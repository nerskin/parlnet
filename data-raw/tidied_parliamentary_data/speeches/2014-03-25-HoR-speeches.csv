Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (12:01):  I move:


That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: AIR 9000 Phase 5C Replacement Chinook Facilities Project, Townsville, Queensland.


The Department of Defence is proposing to provide new and refurbished facilities at the Royal Australian Air Force Base Townsville, Queensland, to support the introduction of new CH47F Chinook helicopters for the Army. The facilities will be used by Army's 5th Aviation Regiment located at Royal Australian Air Force Base Townsville and will provide new and upgraded working accommodation, new maintenance hangars, storage and workshop facilities and a simulator building. The project is valued at $54.8 million plus GST and includes the provision of facilities and supporting infrastructure necessary to support the new F model Chinook medium-lift helicopter by enhancing capability to provide efficiencies in the delivery of the capability through the provision of either new or expanded and modified facilities.


This investment will bring economic benefits for local industry in the Townsville region over the next three years. The works are anticipated to generate around 50 full-time jobs over the life of the project. Subject to parliamentary approval of the project, construction is expected to begin in late 2014, with completion by mid-2017. I commend the motion to the House.


Question agreed to.

 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (12:03):  I move:


That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Defence Terrestrial Communications Network Facilities and Infrastructure Project.


The Department of Defence is proposing to remediate and upgrade its terrestrial communications network facilities and communications infrastructure at 282 Defence sites in all states and territories. Successive independent reviews have identified the need for Defence to substantially improve the management of its information and communications technology. Defence's response has been a series of ICT reforms which will deliver significant business advantages to Defence by upgrading, replacing, standardising and rationalising its ICT network. Defence will use this opportunity to reduce operating costs and complexity, and provide new collaborative business processes for ICT users, such as wi-fi, mobile videoconferencing and remote access—very important. The project will include the provision of computer cabinets and storage, power, lighting, air conditioning, fire protection and security alarms. The project will also replace broken infrastructure and install fibre-optic cabling and connections to buildings. Defence will partner with Telstra to implement the transform network solution.


The upgrade is valued at $131.1 million plus GST. Funding has been approved by the government. The cost includes management and design fees, construction costs, furniture, fittings and equipment, contingencies and an allowance for escalation. The works will bring economic benefits to local industry at the 282 locations. Defence's investment will generate job opportunities for local subcontractors over the next two years. Subject to parliamentary approval of the project, construction is expected to commence in mid-2014, and should be completed on all sites by mid-2016. I commend the motion to the House.

"Henderson, Sarah, MP",LP,2014-03-25,"



Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (12:06):  It is a pleasure to continue my contribution from yesterday. I was speaking about the terrific Green Army project that we have announced for Lorne which is a very important town along the Great Ocean Road and a mecca for tourism. We will be cleaning up the Lorne St George River tramway track to the west of Point Grey. Walking tracks and adventure are so important in the Great Ocean Road region, and this project will add to the tourism assets of our great region. I commend the Great Ocean Road Coast Committee as well as volunteer organisations, such as Lornecare and Friends of Queens Park, for their preliminary work on this project.


Another wonderful project is a Green Army project in Apollo Bay, further down the Great Ocean Road and another wonderful tourist town in my seat of Corangamite. The Barham River Green Army restoration project will enhance the health of the river between Apollo Bay and the Marengo Flora Reserve. This project will include extensive weed removal and the revegetation of the banks of the Barham River. It is another very important project for the region. 


In Colac the fourth Green Army project, which will be rolled out in the foreseeable future, is the preservation and enhanced works at the Barongarook Creek. Barongarook Creek forms an important part of the local river system and the project will involve doing quite a lot of work in weed removal, revegetation and the inclusion of some interpretive signage. Again, we see a great commitment by the government to the environment. We see the funding of wonderful local projects which would otherwise not be funded. Very disappointingly, of course, these were not funded by the previous Labor government. We are also building on the terrific work of the Howard government. Its successful Green Corps program, established in 1996, propagated and planted over 14 million trees, erected more than 8,000 kilometres of fencing, cleared more than 50,000 hectares of weeds and constructed or maintained more than 5,000 kilometres of walking tracks or boardwalks. 


Although the Green Army program supports important local projects, to me, as the member of Corangamite, they are not the only important environmental projects we are undertaking. We have also announced a $300,000 program for a solar Surf Coast. This is a project to help fund the installation of solar panels for community groups, surf-lifesaving clubs, schools and senior citizens groups. It is a wonderful opportunity for so many communities along the Surf Coast, in my electorate, to apply for funding and to get the support they need to install solar panels. I am a big supporter of renewable energy and particularly solar energy. In a country such as ours where each home has the capacity to generate its own power—to be its own mighty power station—this project provides an important incentive for the use of renewable energy in Corangamite. 


This is in stark contrast to what the previous government did to help the environment. It introduced a carbon tax, which is a tax on jobs, a tax on manufacturing and a tax on every family in my electorate of Corangamite and across the country. It is a $7.6 billion hit to the economy, costing each and every family $550 a year. Consider the damage that it has done to small business, which has not been compensated, and also to manufacturing—a $1.1 billion hit on manufacturing. I represent a very important farming district in my electorate and farmers are also adversely affected. For example, dairy farmers will be hit with a $7,000 a year impost as result of this dreadful and economically destructive tax. I say to the people of WA, Labor is leading you in a merry dance. They have no intention of looking after your interests. We are doing everything we can to abolish the dreadful carbon tax. Labor is saying one thing in WA and another thing here in Canberra. If Labor were to have its way, it would impose a carbon tax on diesel fuel, which would cripple many more small businesses, farmers and other enterprises. That could only mean one thing—job losses. 


At a time when we are working so hard to give young people an opportunity to develop new skills and new experiences in the workplace, you would think there would be bipartisan support for what is a very positive initiative. But what we see in the amendment before the House today is members opposite obstructing another great idea that primarily supports young people in our community. I reflect on the youth unemployment rates in my city of Geelong. The figure for young people aged 15 to 24 is an alarming 14.3 per cent. We are delivering a program which will help young people to build pride and develop the skills that will lead them to many other opportunities. It is very disappointing to see some of the comments made by members opposite, by the Greens and even by the ACTU president, Ged Kearney, who has said: 


This whole concept of the Green Army is the latest attempt by the Abbott Government to cut wages [and] cut conditions of working people in this country.


It is a pity that Ms Kearney, the Labor Party and the Greens simply do not appreciate this program. This program is creating new opportunities and a whole new pathway to employment. Her statement is frankly a load of absolute rubbish. What I would say to those opposite, to the ACTU and to the Greens is come to my region and see how destructive youth unemployment is in places like Geelong and Colac. I can tell them that this is a wonderful opportunity for so many young people and it is a particularly important part of our efforts to combat youth unemployment. We are doing something. We are giving young people a go. We are helping them to build pride in their work. We are making them feel valued and like they are part of a team, and we are helping them to move towards their next opportunity. We are also tackling important local environmental projects, which unfortunately were ignored by the Labor Party. This is a wonderfully positive scheme, a proud initiative of environment minister Greg Hunt and the coalition government, and I proudly commend this bill to the House.

"Watts, Tim, MP",ALP,2014-03-25,"



Mr WATTS

 (
Gellibrand
) (
12:14
):  The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014 claims to address the current crisis facing our unemployed youth. However, the bill unfortunately raises more questions than it answers. Today's labour market is tightening. In February 2014 our unemployment rate hit six per cent for the first time in recent memory. The Abbott government has promised one million new jobs, but that is little more than a mirage on the horizon.


In these circumstances, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find employment, particularly for Australia's youth. Figures released by the Brotherhood of St Laurence in February show that 12.4 per cent of young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were out of work in January of this year. The figures are even higher in Melbourne's west, where over 13 per cent of young people are not able to find work in the current job market—more than double the official unemployment rate. This is to say nothing of the ambitious young people who are underemployed or stuck in temporary work, unable to find the security of a permanent job. The first steps in starting a career are hard enough without a marketplace that will not give you a chance. It places these young people in an extremely vulnerable position, forcing them to trade away their work entitlements for any chance at employment. Youth unemployment rates are reaching crisis levels, and they look unlikely to ease any time soon in Melbourne's west.


There are tough times facing the manufacturing industry in my electorate. With 2½ thousand jobs gone at the Toyota plant in Altona and with more than 1,000 jobs at risk of disappearing at the BAE Systems shipyards in Williamstown, the traditional career path taken by many young people in Melbourne's west, into to a world of manufacturing, will no longer be available. Jobs at the businesses who supply these two companies will also disappear, making opportunities scarce for those trying to enter the working world. The jobs marketplace for the youth of Melbourne's west is not a promising one. 


We need to do all that we can to get these young people into work. Through the right training, work experience, incentives and, most importantly, the right level of government support, Labor believe that we can help these young people to find jobs that are right for them. Labor support work and training programs as a pathway to get these young people into the workforce. 


Work and training programs that are aimed at improving our environment will have an additional benefit, for we all know that the natural beauty that we find in our parks, reserves and beaches adds something immeasurable to the enjoyment of our life. They are places to gather with friends and family, to get active, to celebrate the most important events in our lives and to share our lives with others. Looking after these public places, which add so much to our lives, is essential for the soul of our nation. It is also a moral imperative. The words of Antoine de Saint Exupery are often quoted, yet they still ring as true today as they ever did: 'We do not inherit the earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children.' So it is our obligation to care for our natural environment so that our descendants may enjoy it as much as we do. 


The previous Labor government took these words to heart. It introduced a raft of both immediate and long-term measures to protect our nation's environment. It added new national parks to the World Heritage List, including the Ningaloo Reef, and it added the Koongarra area to Kakadu National Park, so that these parks would have domestic and international protections. Most significantly, the previous Labor government created the most comprehensive system of national marine parks in the world, covering thousands of miles of Australian coastline and sea, with the same protections given to our national parks.


Protecting the environment is a core Labor value. Unfortunately, however, this trait is not shared by our colleagues across the floor in the coalition. The Abbott government's environmental record after only six months in office is abysmal. It has disallowed the classification of the Murray River from the Darling to the sea as an 'endangered community'. It has abandoned efforts to have Queensland's Cape York added to the World Heritage List. It has approved every request for a development in one of Australia's brightest jewels, the Great Barrier Reef, despite UNESCO threatening to list the reef as being 'in danger'. It has secretly rolled back the marine system created under Labor by undoing the management plans that gave the system effect. This is a government that has approached the World Heritage Committee and asked it to delist 74,000 hectares of protected forests. This is a Prime Minister who has claimed: 'We have quite enough national parks. We have quite enough locked up forests already.' This is a government that cannot be trusted to look after our natural environment.


However, the Green Army Program in the bill under consideration is one of the few programs introduced by the Abbott government that could actually go some way to protecting the environment, even in Melbourne's west. Many of our parks, beaches and reserves would benefit from a team of young people to care for and maintain these valuable community areas. Indeed, many of the parks in Melbourne's west are already lucky enough to benefit from the support of the community. I applaud the work of voluntary organisations such as Friends of Lower Kororoit Creek and their president, Geoff Mitchelmore, as well as our Landcare volunteers who work throughout Melbourne's west. They work tirelessly to ensure that our parks and gardens are kept beautiful.


An employment program that provides even more resources for these public places to be cared for and provides our youth with training and work opportunities would clearly provide great benefit to my community. After all, programs like this are a part of Labor's heritage. The Landcare and Environment Action Program, LEAP, was introduced by the Keating government in 1992. It provided work opportunities for young people and fostered good environmental outcomes. This bill proposes to create a similar employment program, although this is hard to see from the grandiose statements of the environment minister. He is at pains to convince us that this is an environmental program, mainly because the government does not have any other coherent environmental policy. In his second reading speech, he touts the Green Army as, 'a central component of the government's cleaner environment plan,' and claims that it will, 'deliver tangible benefits for the environment'. In the explanatory memorandum too, the Green Army's credentials are vaunted. It is described as making, 'a real difference to the environment and local communities through projects such as restoring and protecting habitat, weeding, planting, cleaning up creeks and rivers and restoring cultural heritage places'. 


But let me be clear: the bill under consideration before us is for an employment program. It is primarily designed not to look after the environment but to get young people back into work. This is clear from the program's explicit focus on young people between the ages of 17 to 24, even though there are people of all ages who have the time and passion to get involved in conservation work. It is clear from the environment minister's frequent references to the Green Army as a workforce, which is even contained in the explanatory memorandum to the bill before us today. There is nothing wrong with this. A program designed with skill can achieve the aims of both creating employment opportunities and caring for the environment. Labor has been proud to support this form of employment program throughout its various iterations, from the Landcare and Environment Action Program I mentioned before to bills like the one before us today. 


As an employment program, the Green Army should give to its workers the rights and protections bestowed on all employees under Australian employment law. It is this aspect of the bill under consideration that is most concerning to me, for the bill before us explicitly excludes the Green Army workers from many of the protections awarded to Commonwealth employees. It excludes Green Army members from the definition of 'worker' under the Work Health and Safety Act. It excludes Green Army members from the definition of 'employee' under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. Most importantly, it excludes Green Army members from the definition of 'employee' under the Fair Work Act.


Cutting out Green Army workers from these three crucial areas of employment protection has a significant impact on the legal rights of these workers. If excluded by the Work, Health and Safety Act, the registered training organisations running the Green Army program will not be required to follow the occupational health and safety requirements in relation to Green Army workers. Similarly, being excluded from the ambit of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act means that, in the event of injury during the Green Army program, Green Army workers will not be covered by Commonwealth compensation. This could potentially lead to the unjust situation where the supervisors of Green Army programs would be covered in the event of workplace injury, but the Green Army members they organise would not.


Of most concern is the exclusion of Green Army workers from the ambit of the Fair Work Act. The Fair Work Act provides crucial protections to workers. It protects them from unfair dismissal, allows them to request time off and ensures that they will be paid a minimum wage. If this bill is passed, however, none of these statutory protections will be available to Green Army workers. This would have significant implications for the rights of workers undertaking the program—the workers who, let us not forget, are young, inexperienced, eager for work and desperate to get a foot into the door of the employment market, and many of whom will be passionate about the environment and keen to do something that has an impact on the world but will not understand what the loss of these important workplace rights will entail. 


This is a significant limitation on the rights of a particularly vulnerable group of people in our society, yet there is no detail contained in the bill on the implications of changes to workers' rights, benefits and protections. There is no detail given about the alternative wages that will be offered to Green Army workers. This is a significant issue that requires clarification. Unfortunately, the Green Army seems to be headed by Sergeant Schultz, in the form of the environment minister, who knows nothing about the details of these plans.


More discussion and analysis is required before we can be sure that the level of protection given to the Green Army workers is justifiable. For example, who sets the wage that workers will be receiving? Is it the government or the private service provider who is 'responsible for the disbursement of Green Army allowances', according to the explanatory memorandum? According to what criteria will these wages be justified? Will a 17-year-old Green Army worker be paid the same wages as a graduate with an environment degree? After all, the Abbott government is aiming to attract a large pool of graduates to the Green Army program. 


This is not the only area where a startling lack of detail accompanies the government's claims. We only need to look to the Abbott government's promises about the training opportunities afforded by the Green Army program to see more sweeping statements and no precise detail. The Abbott government seems keen to highlight the training opportunities offered by the Green Army program. The explanatory memorandum frequently mentions the 'hands-on, practical skills, training and experience' that these young people will encounter. In the second reading speech too, the environment minister mentions that 'Green Army participants will have the opportunity to develop job-ready skills and to undertake training'. But what are these job-ready skills that these programs will teach? Will academic training programs be offered to workers, or will manual skills development be the focus? Which industries will the government be preparing these workers to enter? How much training will workers receive for their work? 


It is even unclear whether training will be offered to every worker in the Green Army program. The draft statement of requirements outlines that 'the training component of the programme will be negotiated with each participant as part of the participant agreement'. It gives no guarantees that training will be offered to all participants in the program. It places the onus of negotiating this training on the people in the most vulnerable bargaining position—young people who are desperate for work. It is hard to believe such an unequal bargaining position will result in the best training outcomes for Green Army workers.


Another concern raised by the bill is its potential to displace existing workers. There are many hard-working environmental workers across our communities who fulfil important roles honed with years of experience. Many of these workers may not make much more than the minimum wage. Yet, with an army of workers on training allowances, the potential for these workers to be displaced is significant. How will the government ensure that the jobs of these workers will not be lost, or that in a time of shrinking budgets the skills of these workers will not have been cast off for Green Army trainees who are being paid below the minimum wage? How will the government design the program to prevent this from happening? 


This bill poses far more questions than it answers. Unfortunately, it will be our young people who suffer the most from this lack of detail. The youth of Australia—and particularly the youth of Melbourne's west—are facing tough employment conditions. They will need help in navigating the continuing slide of the employment market to find secure, stable work. An employment program like the one this bill describes can help transition young people into this secure, stable work. It can do so while caring for the parks, rivers and beaches that are so important to us all, but it should not exclude our young people from basic employment protections with a vague sweep of its arm.


The government needs to justify why it is taking these employment protections away. It needs to outline what the consequences of this lack of protection will be, how it will mitigate these consequences and what the offsetting benefits are to the participants in these programs. It needs to specify what sort of wages and training benefits the Green Army program will offer to participants. It needs to detail the procedures in place to ensure that this program will not take away jobs from those already undertaking environmental works in our communities.


The Abbott government has failed to provide the level of detail in this bill. It needs to stop acting like an opposition who cannot think past three-second sound bites and provide some detail about how the Green Army program will support and protect workers in practice.

"Wood, Jason, MP",LP,2014-03-25,"



Mr WOOD
 (La Trobe) (12:28):  I rise to talk about the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014. It is a fantastic program and initiative being launched by the government in July this year. The policy covers two things that I am very passionate about: one is the environment, and the other is youth welfare. In my electorate of La Trobe, we are now committed to four Green Army projects: a nature reserve mountain biking network, National Rhododendron Gardens in Olinda, the south-eastern Dandenong Ranges protection program and Shangri-La Wildlife Shelter. I will now look at each of those programs separately.


First of all is the nature reserve mountain biking network. Mountain bike trails attract a large group of enthusiastic participants, and the Green Army proposal will look at developing crown land in La Trobe to make environmentally sensitive changes for this to happen.


The Beaconsfield Nature Conservation Reserve is one location being considered, along with other crown land in Cockatoo and Gembrook. The project will see the construction of sustainable trails as well as weed control and the preservation of heritage. We will work with the Cardinia Environmental Coalition and the wider community to build an internationally approved, staggered-loop design mountain bike track system. The community will benefit in many ways from this—improved fitness and health of local residents, improved level of wellbeing as the people connect to nature, and benefits to local traders from the influx of trail users.


The environment will also benefit in many ways, as building sustainable trails will guarantee long-term protection of the land. Mountain bike riders have shown themselves to be highly motivated and willing to put many volunteer hours back into the areas they ride. Weed control will also be improved and regulated with maintenance on the trail. I would like to thank Malcolm Doswell for submitting this proposal and hope that other organisations—like the local Friends group, the Fat Tyre Flyers Mountain Bike Club, Full Gas Pedallers, Yarra Ranges Mountain Bikers, the Dirtriders Mountain Bike Club and the Cardinia Environmental Coalition will also greatly benefit from this Green Army project.


Another planned Green Army project is for the National Rhododendron Gardens in Olinda. The lovely town of Olinda is in the Dandenong Ranges, and nearby are the iconic National Rhododendron Gardens—and I love these gardens. There are more than 15,000 rhododendrons in the gardens, and they share the stage with 12,000 azaleas, 3,000 camellias and, amazingly, 250,000 daffodils. Located only a short distance from Olinda, the 100-acre gardens offer a fantastic opportunity to see one of the region's premier garden sites. Thousands of people visit these gardens each year, especially since the Liberal state government was elected and removed the entry fee for admission. The Green Army project will assist the rhododendron society to maintain and further develop the 100 acres of botanical gardens, the main focus being on weeding of invasive species, care and protection of native fauna through the construction of bird breeding boxes and the construction of walking paths or boardwalks. The community will benefit by making this unique asset in La Trobe even better. In October each year we have the internationally recognised Blossom Festival. A number of Japanese and Chinese tourists attend the gardens for this, and it is quite spectacular. I would like to thank Mike Hammer, who initially put this application in back in 2010 and has been a great ambassador for the gardens. I would also like to thank all of the other committee members and all of the volunteers who help in the rhododendron gardens.


The next project is the south-eastern Dandenong Ranges protection program, which will greatly benefit from the Green Army project. This project will focus around the Dandenong Ranges, in the southern and eastern areas surrounding the iconic Puffing Billy corridor. This corridor provides an opportunity to establish a significant biolink stretching from the Dandenong Ranges to the west to the Bunyip State Park in the east. These works will complement works already being undertaken by environmental volunteer groups, including the community weed alliance in the Dandenongs, the Southern Ranges Environment Alliance and Puffing Billy. It will build on the works of the Urban Fringe Weed Management Initiative, which combines the efforts of council, Melbourne Water, and Parks Victoria. Tasks will include revegetation, woody weed control, wandering trad control—and I will talk a bit more about that later—nest box insulation, and monitoring and treatment of climbing ivy. It will encapsulate a range of awareness and training opportunities for private landowners.


The project will improve the tourism and the amenity values of the iconic Dandenong Ranges and will support the work of many environmental groups, providing valuable ground assistance. It will also improve connectivity of multiple-use trails in the parks, bushland reserves and trackside properties of the Puffing Billy railway. The project will begin to deliver a consistent and effective weed management program for private landowners adjacent to public land managers. I would like to thank the following people for their continued efforts in weed control in the area and support of the Green Army proposal: Bill Incoll, Jane Hollands, Darcy Duggan, Xander Groverland and Glenn Brooks-MacMillan. Glenn is the facilitator of the Southern Ranges Environmental Alliance. I recently had a great meeting with the team up in Ferny Creek, off Jacka Street, where a great initiative took place. They would approach landowners saying that they had, for example, holly or sycamores or wandering trad or ivy on their properties, and the group then worked with the private residents to remove those weeds. Why did this take place? If it had not, the weeds would have flourished into the Sherbrooke Forest next door.


I had a good chat to Phil Hastings, a local resident in Ferny Creek, who knows a lot about weeds. Phil is also a member of the Ferny Creek Horticultural Society, and he had a fence of ivy in his backyard. Each year he would do the right thing and cut back all of the ivy before it flowered, but the problem is that you cannot get every bud—and then it goes into the forest. So Phil allowed the group to remove this ivy from his fence, and it is looking fantastic. The next project is the Shangri-La Wildlife Shelter, run by Rodney and Tina Hudson-Davies, with whom I have shared a great number of years of friendship and work. When I hear the opposition say that the Abbott government does not care about the environment, can I say that in my past experience in La Trobe, the Labor Party has done nothing for the environment. A classic example is the Shangri-La Wildlife Shelter, which had never received any state, council or federal funding until Malcolm Turnbull became the environmental minister and we announced $25,000, I think it was, to help build shelters and fences up there. The shelters provide rehabilitation services for injured animals, and this project will focus on stopping dog attacks, which have sadly killed kangaroos and other animals. A brush fence is to be built, and some more pens for the injured animals are to be constructed.


The Green Army will not only make significant contributions to the betterment of our environment but will assist our young to gain hands-on practical experience that will improve their employment prospects. The coalition Green Army policies plan to bring 15,000 people—the largest-standing environmental workforce in Australia's history—to provide real and practical solutions to cleaning up river banks and creeks and revegetating sand dunes and mangrove habitats, among the other environmental conservation work being carried out.


The Green Army is also about training for young people. Aside from improving the environment—and that is obviously the message in La Trobe—participants will receive a training wage, invaluable work skills and formal training. In Year 12 I completed my outdoor education course at Boronia Secondary College. I learned a lot of environmental skills—in fact, I remember working on the ground at Ferntree Gully in Dandenong Ranges National Park pulling out weeds and caring for the environment. The group I worked with ended up doing very well. I think training in the environment, and getting hands-on experience, is a great initiative, and the minister must be congratulated for that.


The program will commence from July 2014 with the rollout of 250 Green Army projects and approximately 2,500 people undertaking on the ground environmental activities in 2014-15. I cannot see why the Labor Party are so strongly opposed to this. Up to nine eligible participants and at least one team supervisor will constitute a Green Army. Participants will be eligible to receive a Green Army allowance while participating in the program, and will have the opportunity to undertake training.


Again, when the Labor Party implemented their pink batts scheme it was an absolute disaster. I find it quite ironic that the Labor Party, in opposition, has the audacity to lecture us on workplace training, when under their pink batts scheme four young people sadly had their lives taken and there were over 250 house fires. Why? It was through sheer incompetence. We now have a royal commission looking at this. The pink batts scheme was such a bad program. I know they may be trying to cover their tracks by blaming the Abbott government for this Green Army project, but remember this: they cannot look themselves in the mirror without judging themselves for completely failing on the pink batts program.


The Green Army Program will initially target participants between the ages of 17 and 24 years. Why would the Labor Party be strongly opposed to seeing young people get jobs? To me that is so important.


I will now briefly talk about Labor's environmental record in La Trobe. I mentioned wandering trad earlier. For those who do not know, it is a weed that grows in the creeks. In fact, it is in up to 50 kilometres of creeks in the Dandenong Ranges. It stops any wildlife from moving and it sucks up an amazing amount of water. Back in 2007, when Malcolm Turnbull was the environment minister, prior to the election being called we made an election commitment for $450,000 to find a biological control for wandering trad. The local environmentalists were exceptionally excited and really appreciated it.


During the same election campaign, Peter Garrett, I believe it was, bizarrely came down to La Trobe to make an announcement about the Great Barrier Reef. Unfortunately we do not have the Great Barrier Reef in La Trobe, but we would love to have it. Our big issues are fire management and weed control in the Dandenong Ranges. So what happened when the Rudd government was elected in 2007? One of the first things they did was to cut the wandering trad funding, and sadly this weed has caused a great deal of damage ever since. In 2010 I again committed to funding of $450,000, this time under Minister for the Environment Greg Hunt, who has been an absolute ambassador and supporter of the Dandenong Ranges. Again, Labor did not match this. They are all talk when it comes to the environment. The same was true of the Greens, who just kept their mouth shut during the election campaign.


In the 2013 election campaign what did we do? We announced further funding for wandering trad amounting to $450,000. The Minister for the Environment, Greg Hunt, knows how bad this problem is in the Dandenong Ranges. Remember that this is one of Victoria's top 10 tourist attractions. It is a disgrace that our creeks do not flow because of this weed. Greg Hunt, and I think Ian Macfarlane also, committed that the CSIRO will continue to look at finding a biological control. In New Zealand this weed is devastating their national forest and they have committed to a biological control.


The other announcement we made was $2.4 million dollars to be spent on bushfire and fuel reduction in the Dandenong Ranges. I made similar announcements back in 2010 and 2007. Again, the Labor Party talks about doing great work for the environment and how passionate they are, but would they match this commitment? No. The only true supporters of the environment in the Dandenong Ranges, in the electorate of La Trobe, have been the Liberal Party and the Nationals.


We see that Minister for the Environment Greg Hunt has been a great supporter of La Trobe, the Dandenong Ranges and of the environment. This program, put together with the Prime Minister Tony Abbott, is all good. It is all about the environment, it is all about finding jobs for young people. I do not understand why we have this criticism and lack of support from the Labor Party. They should bow their heads in shame, especially if they venture into La Trobe.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2014-03-25,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (12:42):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation, because Labor believes in helping job seekers enter the workforce. We believe in providing young people with the appropriate training, skills and work experience they need to help them enter employment—especially as they make that difficult transition from school to work. We believe that environmentally based work and training programs can be an effective pathway for job seekers, and also provide some real environmental benefits.


We support the Green Army, just as we supported its previous incarnations; the National Green Jobs Corps; the Green Corps program; and the original incarnation, Paul Keating's 1992 Landcare and Environment Action Program. However, although we support the principles of the program, we remain significantly concerned at the lack of detail that is being provided by the Abbott government about how this program will actually work, and about the exemptions from the workplace health and safety laws, compensation laws, and industrial relations laws that the government is seeking to put in place.


As they always do, the wonderful staff of the Parliamentary Library have prepared a comprehensive Bills Digest on this legislation. It is very much worth a read, and I recommend it. It was published last week on 18 March. The reason I mention it now is that in the very first section of this digest, on the first page out of nine pages of text, the library has provided a caveat. It says:


It is worth noting that, beyond the basics, there is not a great deal of publicly available information about the programme.


This program is meant to begin on 1 July this year. That is just over three months away, and we are still without any significant detail about how it will run. I note that the Green Army has been a policy of the Liberal Party since the 2010 election, so it is quite surprising that they have not worked out the detail yet. But this is just further evidence that the Prime Minister is a Prime Minister of slogans and not of substance.


Some of the details that we are missing include what, if any, training will be provided to participants. It is by no means clear that training for participants is to be guaranteed or that any training that is provided is to be accredited training. The explanatory memorandum merely states that Green Army participants will have the opportunity to undertake training. Who will provide this training? Will it be accredited training? What level of training will be provided? What qualifications will participants have at the end of this training? Will they have a certificate I? Will they have a certificate II? Will they have a certificate III? Will they have a certificate IV? 


Similarly, we do not know what, if any, processes are going to be put in place to support participants to transition into the workforce after they have completed the program. We also do not have any great detail about the environmental objectives of the program. Any environmental outcomes the program might provide would be greatly enhanced if the program were more clearly focused on strategically targeted long-term projects that met a clear set of environmental objectives. Unfortunately, this is not the case.


We also do not know what, if any, safeguards are being put in place to ensure the program does not lead to the displacement or reduction of employment opportunities for existing workers. The Abbott government must assure those hardworking Australians in local government and other organisations and authorities that employers will not be able to displace them and rely upon Green Army participants to do their work. There is simply no justification for a program like the Green Army that can provide employment pathways if the participants then go on to displace existing workers. This potential displacement needs to be addressed by the Abbott government in its design of the program. We currently have no detail to give us any confidence that this will not occur.


Of greater concern to Labor than what we do not know about this policy is what we do know—that there will be exemptions from work health and safety, compensation and industrial relations laws for participants. Labor is gravely concerned that this bill does not provide adequate protections for participants in the Green Army scheme, namely in the areas of occupational health and safety, workers compensation and rehabilitation. Proposed section 38J of this legislation provides that a participant in the Green Army Program is not a worker for the Commonwealth and is not an employee of the Commonwealth for the purposes of the Work Health and Safety Act 2011, nor an employee within the meaning of section 5 of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 and is not an employee for the purposes of the Fair Work Act 2009. Because they are not an employee, they are not entitled to the benefits that an employee would be entitled to, including workers compensation.


In defence of this, the Minister for the Environment says that the arrangements would be similar to the Howard government's Green Corps program. That is all very well, but the workplace relations environment has changed since the days of the Green Corps. Under previous schemes, participants could have been covered by state and territory employment laws, but this will no longer be the case, since most states and territories referred their industrial relations powers to the Commonwealth in 2010.


Nothing in the bill addresses the issue of the extent to which Green Army service providers will be required to provide suitable insurance. However, even when suitable insurance is in place, it differs from workers compensation cover in that an injured participant is likely to have to demonstrate negligence. There have been successful claims of this sort, but they can take many years to settle, and young volunteers may not have the resources to pursue such claims.


What we have here is a program where young and inexperienced workers will be undertaking physical work in outdoor, unpredictable environments but will be offered a lower standard of workplace protection. Labor finds this entirely unacceptable. If the Abbott government were at all committed to workplace safety and entitlements or at all concerned about the wellbeing of the Green Army participants, it would ensure that participants are deemed employees so that they are covered by a range of Commonwealth laws, including the Fair Work Act, the Work Health and Safety Act and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act.


So far I have outlined a range of concerns with the detail of this program, but perhaps the biggest problem with the policy, the thing that causes me the most concern, is that those opposite think that the Green Army is a solution to climate change. The Green Army section of the Liberal's policy document says the Green Army will 'make a real difference to improving the environment in our own backyard and addressing climate change'. Of course, those opposite intend for the Green Army to complement the Abbott government's biggest policy disaster, which is Direct Action. But, no matter how many young Australians join the Green Army, no matter how much the Abbott government is prepared to pay to big polluters, these policies will not be as effective as a market based solution to cap carbon pollution. That is why Labor is united in support for an emissions trading scheme.


We have known for some time that our sea levels are rising as a result of human induced global warming. The advice from climate scientists is clear on this. Most recently, the fifth report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, released last year, told us that warming of the climate system is unequivocal and that the sea level has risen. We know, too, that extreme weather events are increasing in intensity and frequency as a result of climate change. In Australia, we do not need to be reminded about the devastation that extreme weather events can cause. It is something we all know. It is something we all fear. It is something, therefore, that we should be united in tackling. I heard on the radio just this morning that Oxfam was warning about the fact that potentially 100 million people in the next 50 years could be facing starvation if there is not appropriate action taken on climate change in the near future.


Those opposite agree on the need to reduce carbon pollution. What we disagree on is how we should go about that. Labor will support the repeal of the fixed carbon price in order to replace it with an emissions trading scheme. What we will not support is the removal of the fixed price on carbon if it is not going to be replaced by a carbon pricing scheme that puts a cap on carbon pollution, that guarantees a reduction in carbon pollution. 


The fact is that economies all over the world are putting a price on carbon right now or they have already done so. There are over one billion people currently living in carbon constrained economies. They live in a country, a state, a province or a union that has initiated some form of carbon pricing, such as a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme.


The European Union, of course, has had an ETS since 2005. The EU ETS is now the largest carbon market in the world, operating in 30 countries, including the 27 EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The EU is Australia's second largest trading bloc, which is why linking Australia's ETS with the EU's ETS was a long-term goal of the Labor government. When in August last year the then Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency announced that when the Australian carbon price moved to a floating price ETS it would be linked with the European Union ETS, it was applauded as the best possible outcome for Australia.


However, the EU is not alone—far from it. California, which is the ninth largest economy in the world in its own right, has introduced an emissions trading scheme around the $20 mark. In China alone, 200 million people are living in provinces where there is an ETS either in place or in development. Most significantly, there are plans for a nationwide emissions trading scheme in China later this decade. Closer to home, our friend and neighbour New Zealand has had an ETS in place since 2009 with bipartisan support.


I mention the bipartisan support because, in the debate on carbon pricing over the last few years since I had the honour of being elected the member for Canberra, in the discussions that I have had with the community and also the diplomatic community here in Canberra one thing that has particularly staggered the European members of the diplomatic corps is the fact that this has become such a partisan issue. In the UK and throughout Europe, action on climate change has been seen as a bipartisan issue, requiring, therefore, bipartisan support. I have to say that the European diplomatic corps, particularly, have been absolutely astonished about the level of partisanship that has embraced this issue in Australia, given the fact that it has enjoyed such strong bipartisan support in the EU and in each of those countries throughout the EU for such a long time. It is quite breathtaking when our neighbour and friend New Zealand have had this ETS in place since 2009 with bipartisan support.


By 2016, over three billion people will be living in countries where there are emissions trading schemes or carbon taxes. That is three billion people. But, if the Abbott government has its way, Australians will not be among those three billion. The fact is that the Abbott government's so-called Direct Action Plan will take very little action at all. Direct Action does not put a cap on carbon pollution and it does not provide the price signal—the market based imperative that is required to move away from carbon intensive actions. Direct Action is a system of taxpayer funded subsidies to polluters. It asks ordinary, working, taxpaying Australians to subsidise big polluters. It is a policy that is rejected by climate scientists and economists alike. Direct Action does not guarantee a reduction in carbon pollution. The simple truth is that without a cap on carbon there cannot be any such guarantee. It is an expensive system that pays taxpayer funded subsidies to polluters with no guarantee of success.


I know that there are members opposite who agree that an ETS is the most efficient and effective way to reduce carbon pollution. The fact is that in 2007 there was bipartisan support for an ETS. It was the policy that both parties took to the 2007 election and was supported beyond the 2007 election.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Craig Kelly
):  Order! Member for Canberra, I am happy to have a wide-ranging debate, but this bill is the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill. I request that you be as relevant as you can to the bill.




Ms BRODTMANN:
  The Green Army is designed to tackle climate change, and I am talking about tackling climate change. On tackling climate change, then Prime Minister John Howard said:


Australia will more than play its part to address climate change but will do it in a practical and balanced way in full knowledge of the economic consequences for our nation.


He was not talking about Direct Action; he was not talking about using taxpayers' money to subsidise polluters; he was talking about the introduction of an ETS. Following the election, then Leader of the Opposition Brendan Nelson also put the coalition support behind an ETS. He said:


We believe in an emissions trading scheme. We believe in a cap and trade system.


Of course, famously, Dr Nelson's successor as Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth, is the No. 1 fan of the ETS. He put it very succinctly when he said:


You won't find an economist anywhere that will tell you anything other than that the most efficient and effective way to cut emissions is by putting a price on carbon


Sadly, the most recent change in leadership heralded a policy backflip and, for reasons unknown, an ETS has fallen out of favour with the coalition. Today, I ask those opposite to consider whether they really believe that the policy combination of the Green Army and Direct Action is a sufficient response to climate change. I ask them to listen to the experts, the scientists and the economists, to remember their own comments made not so long ago and to commit to a market based solution to climate change—a cap-and-trade ETS.


I also urge those opposite to wake up to the fact that, no matter how much merit this program might have as a vocational training program, it is no solution to climate change. An emissions trading system is the only way forward. (Time expired)

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2014-03-25,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (12:57):  I rise today to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014, which resurrects and expands on the Howard years' Green Corps, which was an outstanding program proving time and time again to be a great opportunity for young people, especially those about to enter the workforce. It gave them a sense of belonging in the community, as well as having positive environmental outcomes. Unfortunately, under the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments, the successful Green Corps program was replaced with the National Green Jobs Corps, which effectively reclassified unemployed people, who continued to receive an income support payment, and was then abolished altogether.


Over the life of the Green Corps program, participants propagated and planted more than 14 million trees, erected more than 8,000 kilometres of fencing, cleared more than 50,000 hectares of weeds, collected more than 9,500 kilograms of seeds and constructed and maintained more than 5,000 kilometres of walking tracks and boardwalks. I am proud that the coalition government will not follow the way of the previous government, which repealed a program that helped to develop the skills of young people, helped communities to take responsibility for their local patch and helped to directly fix or mitigate local environment issues. Indeed, it was a program that actually worked. No wonder Labor did away with it! It was a program that actually worked—in stark contrast to the Labor government's extensive list of failures.


On this side of the chamber, we are creating a standing Green Army, which will gradually build to a 15,000-strong environmental workforce. This will provide real and practical solutions to cleaning up riverbanks and creek beds, revegetating sand dunes, revegetating mangrove habitat, and a host of other environmental conservation projects. The Green Army will work with, and complement the work undertaken by, local and care groups, bush care groups, foreshore communities, natural resource management groups, local catchment authorities and councils in their work restoring and protecting the local environment. This will be particularly beneficial in my electorate as Ryan is home to part of Brisbane River, which is facing issues of sedimentation and bank degradation, and we also have Mount Coot-tha and its surrounding national parks and forests, Mount Crosby, parts of Mount Nebo, Walkabout Creek and the Enoggera Dam.


When the Minister for the Environment visited my electorate before the last election, to launch the Ryan Green Army Program, I was pleased to see such a strong turnout from local environmental groups and interested members of the community—all coming together united by their interest in and dedication to caring for our environment. Mount Coot-tha is a popular bushland destination for many people from all over Brisbane. It includes the Brisbane Botanic Gardens and Sir Thomas Brisbane Planetarium, as well as a mountain drive, bike tracks, walking trails and parks. There are several popular walking tracks around Mount Coot-tha, with most involving some uphill sections or steps. These tracks are often used by hikers training to walk the Kokoda Track in Papua New Guinea as the terrain and climate are considered similar.


Recently I attended a neighbourhood planning forum, hosted by Premier Newman, for The Gap community works, including upgrades to Walkabout Creek in my electorate. The upgrades would give residents better access to the Enoggera Dam, allowing for kayaking and other water sports; an expansion of the Walkabout Creek centre, making it a community hub, with animal enclosures, educational sessions and a treetop boardwalk; and the creation of new walking tracks, high ropes courses and infrastructure for local scouts and guides groups. The scouting movement have expressed their desire to see this work carried out as it would mean a new area to train groups in outdoor exploration. Community leaders have found that there is a missing stepping stone between teaching scout groups the theory of outdoor exploration, camping and bushwalking, and then going and having an adventure in national bushland. These new upgrades will fill that gap, enabling young adventure groups to ease into the more difficult outdoor exploration.


Walkabout Park, part of the larger nature reserve lying on the western boundary of Brisbane, in the Enoggera Reservoir, is home to many rare native plants and animals. It was evident at the neighbourhood family meeting, with more than 100 people turning up on a Sunday morning to discuss upgrades in their local environment, that the national park is of huge significance to the local community. There were representatives from some of the many community green groups in the area, who work on local waterways, rehabilitation, weed eradication and the protection of local endangered species.


I am delighted to stand in this place legislating for a stronger, more lasting version of the former Green Corps by way of the coalition government's Green Army. My office has already received a number of Green Army grant applications, and I look forward to seeing the army grow and develop within my electorate. The electorate of Ryan is home to the University of Queensland, one of the leading research universities in the Southern Hemisphere. The researchers at University of Queensland are investigating a range of projects to protect and rehabilitate the environment, and to create a more sustainable way of living. I have previously spoken in this place about the work of Professor Ben Hankamer at the Institute for Molecular Bioscience on using genetically modified algae to rehabilitate creeks and waterways that have been affected by the nutrient run-off from farms or from the waste created by mine sites.


The University of Queensland is preparing the future of the hydrogen economy by looking at ways to sustainably produce hydrogen from genetically modified hydrogen, and on more efficient hydrogen fuel cells, to eventually replace our dependence on fossil fuels. There is also research into increasing the efficiency of traditional solar panels, as well as manufacturing lighter and more flexible and transportable solar panels. These new solar strips could be used along skirting boards and around windows in office buildings to capture light to reduce the energy demands of the building. There is a great deal of research in these fields not just at the University of Queensland but also internationally. However, in most cases the research is exactly that, research, and is not quite viable for mass production or mass implementation yet. Until such a time as the research becomes a viable alternative to our current practice, direct action from community groups to better their local environment is one of our best options.


When local community members work together to solve a problem, the sky is the limit. I would like to give special mention to some of the many green groups in my electorate and highlight all the good work they do: Save Our Waterways Now, Kenmore Transition Town, Yarrabee Road Bushcare Group, Barnett Road Bushcare Group, Men of the Trees, Freer's Farm Bushcare Group, Ferny Grove Transition Town, Glen Harding Park Bushcare Group, Toowong Creek Roving Rehabilitators, Birds Queensland, Protect Long Pocket Action Group, St Lucia Esplanade Bushcare Group, Indooroopilly Woods Residents Group, Moore Park Bushcare Group, Taringa Parade Bushcare Group, Rainbow Forest Experimental Rehabilitation Group, Brookfield Showground Bushcare Group, Brushbox Bushcare Group, Merri Merri Park Bushcare Park, Cubberla Creek Revegetation Group, Kimba Street Bushcare Group, Greenhill Regenerators, Wandering Weeders, Mandalay Progress Association, Manaton Park Bushcare Group, Manaton Habitat Group, McKay Brook Bushcare Group, Pullen Pullen Catchments Group, Guardians of Little Gubberley, Gap Creek Bushcare Group, Cubberla-Witton Catchment Network, Huntington Bushcare Group, Rural Environmental Planning Association, Upper Gold Creek Bushcare Group, Upper Brookfield Bush Regeneration, Anstead Park Bushcare Group, Moggill Creek Catchment Group, Lions Nature Trail Bushcare Group and my local group, The Hut Environmental and Community Association. All these groups will benefit from the Green Army Program and I look forward to working with them in the future.

"Ryan, Joanne, MP",ALP,2014-03-25,"



Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (13:06):  I rise today to support the amendment moved by the member for Port Adelaide to the second reading debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014. Labor has always believed in the need for people in our society to work and in the dignity it brings to the individual and to the community. We also know that the vast majority of people in our society want to work. They want to earn money. They want to make a contribution. Having meaningful work is integral to one's sense of self.


This is why Labor are focused on creating the conditions for low unemployment and for fair work conditions and why we fight to keep workers in their jobs. This is why we have moved this amendment. This discussion needs to address how participants in this program will be protected if they are injured, sick or mistreated. We need to address what training will be given to the participants. What will be provided to help them transition to full-time work? What are the risks for the displacement of existing workers? These are all questions that need to be asked and answered. 


Labor agrees that we need to do everything we can to get people into work, but we need more than a thought bubble here. The implications of this legislation need to be carefully and rigorously thought through. Given that this is a Green Army, the government's environmental record seems to be a good place to start—and I mean on the big environmental issues. This government already has an unenviable reputation as a retrograde administration when it comes to the environment. It is the only government in the world that has asked the World Heritage Committee to delist a currently listed wilderness area. It has a radical anti-environment agenda—from disallowing the endangered community listing of the Murray from the Darling to the sea, to the marine park stretching from Cape York to Fraser Island, to the reserve in the great Alpine National Park. In six months this government has conducted a relentless, destructive campaign when it comes to the environment. I have not yet mentioned its flat-earth-society approach to climate change or the oxymoron that is this government having a Minister for Environment.


The Australian government, regardless of which party is in power, has a sacred duty to protect and maintain our Great Southern Land's unique and magnificent natural assets. Those opposite must realise that they are stewards. They have been entrusted by the people of Australia, and by our children and children's children, to take care of this fragile place. At the moment, those opposite are failing in this duty. In fact, they actively and shamefully neglect it. 


It is worth looking, too, at their record in protecting and supporting the vulnerable, given this bill will impact on our vulnerable young people. In the six months since they took office, they have abolished the Council on Homelessness, followed soon after by axing the National Housing Supply Council. More recently, they have refused to commit to the National Affordable Housing Agreement and to the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness. 


Their record on workers is also instructive. They have abandoned manufacturing workers at Toyota, Alcoa and Holden, giving no guarantees of assistance despite the time elapsed since these heartless decisions were made.


There is a theme that has developed in the short time this government has been in power. The Prime Minister has told us that there are goodies and baddies. In this case, market is good, regulation is bad. It is here again in this bill—a failure to do the hard work that will ensure positive outcomes for the young people involved with an eye only on the prize of less regulation, as though less regulation is an end in itself—a value. This government know the cost of everything but the value of nothing.


However, the government are good at a few things. They are good at spin. They are great sloganeers. They excel at reducing debate to nonsensical repetitive sentences. Their three word slogans are becoming legendary— 'cutting red tape'. We all know this is a euphemism for removing protections. Just this week I heard an argument form the member for Farrer that childcare workers should not monitor and record children's progress as part of their duties—that somehow this was an example of evil red tape and a waste of time. Again, the cost is highlighted rather than the value—the value of early detection of learning, health or social issues that would lead to better outcomes for the child, the family and the community. 


We see it here again with the Green Army legislation. The purpose of the bill is unclear. Is it about getting young people into work? Is it about developing work-ready skills? Is it about long-term outcomes through training and experience? Or is it about the market and this government wrapping itself in green and pretending it cares about the environment and the vulnerable? This bill provides exemptions from the Fair Work Act 2009, Work Health and Safety Act 2011, and the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. This is alarming. These acts cover occupational health and safety, workers compensation and rehabilitation. 


Labor is concerned that this bill does not provide adequate protections for participants in the Green Army scheme. Participants will not be treated as employees, and so they will be denied the rights and protections normally afforded to employees. These pretty basic rights are quite important for the smooth running of our society. They are there to ensure that unwarranted risks are not taken on the job site, to ensure workers are trained appropriately to minimise injury and to ensure that, where this fails, workers are rehabilitated and compensated for their injuries. They are hallmarks of a civilised society. They are what a First World country expects. They are about risk and harm minimisation. It seems they are the one cost that this government does not understand—the cost of a young person who works too hard to impress the boss and damages his or her back, who is then judged to have a permanent injury that will prevent them from ever joining our armed forces. Where there is smoke, there is fire.


As I said earlier, cutting red tape is a euphemism for removing worker protections. It is not credible that any government would introduce a scheme that did not provide these basic protections. This legislation raises more questions than answers. Why do participants not have employee status even though they are being removed from social security and paid an equivalent training wage? The government is attempting to take an employment program, rebadge it as an environmental program and abdicate from their responsibility as an employer—all at the same time.


It kind of sums up the Abbott Government—mad policy alchemists trying to conjure solutions to difficult problems out of thin air, while doing none of the hard work required. It is irresponsible, it is dangerous and it is not on. This government does not have an environmental policy. This is why it is forced to take from employment policy and dress it up as environment policy. But let us be clear: it is an employment program and, as such, participants should be treated as employees. It is a good thing that the Green Army participants will be paid the equivalent of the training wage. It is not a lot of money, but it is more than Newstart pays. These payments will also be similar to the training wages received by thousands of other young Australians who are in vocational training or education. What is troubling though is that, while they are being paid by the Commonwealth, they will not be treated as Commonwealth employees. This leaves them in an undefined place—a place without standard worker protections and entitlements, yet with the same risks as workers in the workplace.


A further concern for Labor is the concept of additionality or the potential to displace existing workers. There is no point training people for roles that are already filled. Robbing Peter to pay Paul is no way to govern. This is another example of the government trying to conjure solutions out of thin air without doing the hard work required. The thing about governing is that it is hard work. I am not certain those opposite have fully comprehended this fact. It is not all swanning around parliament and cutting ribbons. It is certainly not about taking the reins of government and then slinking back to the office or the restaurant and leaving the market to do the work. It is about working with and for the community. It is about working with business, workers and people to build the economy together. 


Sometimes in question time, when I hear the cries 'Get out of the way!', I wonder what would happen if we did just get out of the way and let this government put the markets in charge of our lives. What would happen to the young people who set off to the job site without protection under the law? When I read this bill I know the answers. While this amendment bill omits much of the detail related to workers' rights, benefits and protections, the associated statement of requirements is equally bereft of detail. Unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, causes great hardship to workers, their families and their communities. Entrenched unemployment is a cancer on the economic strength of our nation.


Those on this side of the House believe that some people need help getting work and that there is a role for government in this process. People need the right training, work experience, incentives and, most importantly, the appropriate level of support. A close reading reveals that access to the formally recognised training requirements delivered by RTOs are an optional part of this program. What then will compel those charged with delivering the program to include this training in it? We all know that training costs money. What impetus will drive the delivery of training within the program? And, if the training is to be delivered, of what nature will it be? What vocations and skills will be provided within the program? Have they been identified by the Australian Workplace and Productivity Authority as areas of emerging and future skill needs? There are many questions to answer because there is so little detail. If we look at the decisions and choices this government has made, we get an insight and again we get bad news—this time for our youth. This government has cut trade training centre funding and will cut the Youth Connections program funding—two initiatives that assist our young people in becoming contributors to our society through education and work preparation.


Environment-based training and employment programs are an effective way of getting people to work whilst at the same time training them up in skills that our country needs to remain economically strong. This country cannot afford to look for shortcuts. We need to invest in training now, but that is not in this government's plan. Their plan is to cut and cut and cut again. You cannot cut your way to prosperity. The Green Army scheme, if delivered as intended, not only will help train young people and the unemployed in skills our nation requires but will also go ways to conserving our natural environment at a local level. However, if we leave out the training, those in the Green Army will become little more than gangers with no pathway to a better future and few skills to help our economy.


Youth unemployment must be addressed. It must be addressed for the sake of the youth in question—a citizen, an Australian, someone's son or daughter. It must be addressed for the sake of the workforce. There is a skills shortage. Training our youth is an obvious solution. It must be addressed for the sake of our economy. The unemployed not only cost the economy in terms of benefits but also deny the government revenue in the form of taxes and productivity when they are not taking part in the workforce. This government needs to show a commitment to fair wages, meaningful work, training and the opportunity for people to progress in the workforce. It is now time they look the problem of youth unemployment in the eye, roll up their sleeves and start doing the hard yards required to solve this complex problem.

 (Brisbane) (13:18):  I am very pleased to speak to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014 today. It is an example of the Abbott government delivering on yet another key election commitment through legislation to establish the Green Army. The Green Army Program is a key plank in the government's cleaner environment plan under the clean land pillar. The Green Army is a voluntary program that encourages hands-on, practical, grassroots action to support local environment and heritage conservation projects in Australia. It is an opportunity for young people in my electorate of Brisbane aged between 17 and 24 to gain very valuable training experience in environmental and heritage conservation fields and to explore careers further in the conservation management area.


In my electorate of Brisbane the Abbott government has committed to two Green Army projects on the Brisbane north side. Enoggera Creek, Ithaca Creek and Kedron Brook Creek will benefit from the two Green Army teams improving the local environment and amenity through practical and real action. I want to provide some further detail on one of the areas of my electorate that will benefit from this work being done by the Green Army. I am specifically referring to Kedron Brook, which stretches a total of 29 kilometres, starting at the D'Aguilar National Park and ending in the Schulz Canal in Moreton Bay. The creek is a very valuable part of the north side of Brisbane. Many families walk alongside the many pathways and bikeways on a regular basis. I want to commend the work that has been done by the Brisbane City Council as well. The environment along the creek has some of the last remaining remnants of riparian rainforest and includes the remnants of the locally uncommon flood gum Eucalyptus grandis along the Kedron Brook floodway. Mangroves and exotic grasses are the dominant vegetation. It is these wonderful natural gems, not just in my electorate but all over Australia, that this bill will protect.


Once in place the Green Army teams will focus on revegetation, installing ecological signage, upgrading walkways and cycling paths, mapping wildlife, planting trees, and installing measures to minimise flooding and reduce its impact on the local environment. This is a very real and practical way to make a difference to our environment and to complement our direct action approach to climate change. I am currently working with the Minister for the Environment in having this project rolled out as soon as possible.


The Green Army Program will provide benefits to both the environment and the community through projects such as restoring and protecting habitat, weeding, planting, cleaning up creeks and rivers, and restoring cultural heritage places. In addition to all of the great environmental work that will be done, the Green Army participants will be paid an allowance and gain valuable experience in conservation management, teamwork, discipline and waking up every morning and being committed to doing the job that needs to be done. The Australian government will shortly be undertaking a tender process for service providers who will engage the Green Army teams and supervisors and manage the activities to ensure that projects are completed safely, are reported regularly on and are on time. Projects may be carried out across urban, and regional and remote Australia, or on public land, Indigenous-held land or private land where there is a clear community, environmental and heritage benefit.


The Green Army will become Australia's largest ever environmental workforce, building to 15,000 participants by 2018 and capable of delivering real results. Those real results will be 1,500 on-the-ground environmental projects. It should be noted that this bill builds on the very strong history the coalition has in delivering for the environment. In particular it will build on the Howard government's successful Green Corps program, which was established in 1996. I saw the evidence of that and what a huge impact it made not just to the environment but to the lives of many people who participated and who then went further and continued their studies in this area or went on to technical and training education or to university education.


Over the life of the Green Corps program, participants delivered the following outcomes: they propagated and planted more than 14 million trees, they erected more than 8,000 kilometres of fencing, they cleared more than 50,000 hectares of weeds and they constructed or maintained more than 5,000 kilometres of walking track or boardwalks.


The Abbott government's approach can be contrasted quite starkly with those on the other side. Under Labor's watch, and solely on the basis of small-minded political reasons, the Howard government's Green Corps program was torn apart, was rebadged and it failed to improve the environment. Then it was terminated in 2012. Young people no longer had the opportunity to gain practical skills and to improve their local environment. But then again, no-one really should have been surprised. After all, Labor's approach to the environment is to hit families, businesses and the economy with a carbon tax. The carbon tax is an attack on the entire Australian economy. What is worse is that it does not even work. Despite a $7.6 billion tax, emissions for the first 12 months barely changed by 0.1 per cent.


The Abbott government will provide $300 million over four years, and a further $222 million in 2017-18 and $289.2 million in 2018-19 to establish the Green Army. The measure was announced in the 2013-14 MYEFO. The request for tender will be released shortly. The request for tender will be open for tender applications for at least four weeks. The Australian government will be running sessions for potential tenderers, and details of these sessions will be provided as part of the RFT.


The key components to the program will be that service providers will be contracted by the Australian government to engage the Green Army teams, deliver training and wage payments, manage activities to ensure projects are completed and report regularly on progress. There will be project sponsors, and they will be organisations such as local councils, community groups or natural resource management organisations that will develop project proposals. The sponsors will submit proposals to the Australian government through an application round. They will be assessed, and recommendations will be made to the Minister for the Environment for successful projects in each round.


Then, of course, there are the wonderful participants themselves. The Green Army Program will target participants aged between 17 and 24. Participants may be Indigenous people, school leavers, gap-year students, graduates and the unemployed. The program in future years will expand to people of all ages.


Unlike previous programs that were rushed through with unholy haste by the previous Labor government, the work, health and safety of Green Army participants is of particular importance to the Abbott government. The Department of the Environment will work with the service providers on an agreed risk-management framework for the delivery of this project. They will be informed by the experience of the Department of Employment and external expertise relating to work, health and safety issues.


Service providers will be required to work with the project sponsors on risk plans for each individual project. They will regularly report to the Australian government on the management of participants and project delivery, and audit and compliance schemes will manage any contractual breaches.


In addition to the on-the-job training, a key element of the program is the provision of opportunities for vocationally-oriented accredited training delivered by registered training organisations under the Australian Qualifications Framework. Training may be undertaken in areas such as work readiness, conservation, land management, heritage conservation, leadership, project and human resource management and trades. As such, on-the-job training activities need not be exclusively outdoors. The service providers will be responsible for ensuring that the training satisfies the requirements under the Australian Qualifications Framework in a format that best meets the need of each of the participants.


An individual training plan will be negotiated with each participant. Participants will be given an opportunity to undertake training for a certificate I or certificate II qualification or nationally endorsed skill sets.


Training in first aid and work, health and safety must all be completed by the participants prior to the commencement of Green Army activities. The participants without these basic training requirements must not commence project activities until they complete the relevant training.


In terms of funding that will be provided to the project sponsors proposing Green Army projects, the Green Army Program provides costs to support the Green Army teams that will be undertaking the project activities. The particular sponsors will be expected to provide specific equipment, materials and expertise to deliver the Green Army projects. No cash funding will be provided to the project sponsors. It is really important to note that the Green Army Program is an environmental programme and not considered an employment program. The engagement of a participant in a Green Army team for 20-26 weeks is not considered full-time employment. It is a voluntary opt-in program where participants will receive work-like experience and will be paid an allowance that is higher than income support, such as youth allowance or Newstart allowance.


The approach of not paying superannuation is consistent with the previous approach used for the Green Corps programs. It is consistent with the approach applied for income-support recipients undertaking existing approved programs of work activities, such as the Work for the Dole and the Remote Jobs and Communities Program.


The Green Army Program will be considered an approved program of work of participants who elect to stay on income support. Minister Hunt is to be congratulated on this bill. He has a big job unravelling the mess left behind by six years of Labor in office, but he has hit the ground running and this bill is ample proof of his application to the task.


I look forward to seeing the wonderful benefits of the Green Army projects he has approved for my electorate. 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER

Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (12:06):  It is a pleasure to continue my contribution from yesterday. I was speaking about the terrific Green Army project that we have announced for Lorne which is a very important town along the Great Ocean Road and a mecca for tourism. We will be cleaning up the Lorne St George River tramway track to the west of Point Grey. Walking tracks and adventure are so important in the Great Ocean Road region, and this project will add to the tourism assets of our great region. I commend the Great Ocean Road Coast Committee as well as volunteer organisations, such as Lornecare and Friends of Queens Park, for their preliminary work on this project.


Another wonderful project is a Green Army project in Apollo Bay, further down the Great Ocean Road and another wonderful tourist town in my seat of Corangamite. The Barham River Green Army restoration project will enhance the health of the river between Apollo Bay and the Marengo Flora Reserve. This project will include extensive weed removal and the revegetation of the banks of the Barham River. It is another very important project for the region. 


In Colac the fourth Green Army project, which will be rolled out in the foreseeable future, is the preservation and enhanced works at the Barongarook Creek. Barongarook Creek forms an important part of the local river system and the project will involve doing quite a lot of work in weed removal, revegetation and the inclusion of some interpretive signage. Again, we see a great commitment by the government to the environment. We see the funding of wonderful local projects which would otherwise not be funded. Very disappointingly, of course, these were not funded by the previous Labor government. We are also building on the terrific work of the Howard government. Its successful Green Corps program, established in 1996, propagated and planted over 14 million trees, erected more than 8,000 kilometres of fencing, cleared more than 50,000 hectares of weeds and constructed or maintained more than 5,000 kilometres of walking tracks or boardwalks. 


Although the Green Army program supports important local projects, to me, as the member of Corangamite, they are not the only important environmental projects we are undertaking. We have also announced a $300,000 program for a solar Surf Coast. This is a project to help fund the installation of solar panels for community groups, surf-lifesaving clubs, schools and senior citizens groups. It is a wonderful opportunity for so many communities along the Surf Coast, in my electorate, to apply for funding and to get the support they need to install solar panels. I am a big supporter of renewable energy and particularly solar energy. In a country such as ours where each home has the capacity to generate its own power—to be its own mighty power station—this project provides an important incentive for the use of renewable energy in Corangamite. 


This is in stark contrast to what the previous government did to help the environment. It introduced a carbon tax, which is a tax on jobs, a tax on manufacturing and a tax on every family in my electorate of Corangamite and across the country. It is a $7.6 billion hit to the economy, costing each and every family $550 a year. Consider the damage that it has done to small business, which has not been compensated, and also to manufacturing—a $1.1 billion hit on manufacturing. I represent a very important farming district in my electorate and farmers are also adversely affected. For example, dairy farmers will be hit with a $7,000 a year impost as result of this dreadful and economically destructive tax. I say to the people of WA, Labor is leading you in a merry dance. They have no intention of looking after your interests. We are doing everything we can to abolish the dreadful carbon tax. Labor is saying one thing in WA and another thing here in Canberra. If Labor were to have its way, it would impose a carbon tax on diesel fuel, which would cripple many more small businesses, farmers and other enterprises. That could only mean one thing—job losses. 


At a time when we are working so hard to give young people an opportunity to develop new skills and new experiences in the workplace, you would think there would be bipartisan support for what is a very positive initiative. But what we see in the amendment before the House today is members opposite obstructing another great idea that primarily supports young people in our community. I reflect on the youth unemployment rates in my city of Geelong. The figure for young people aged 15 to 24 is an alarming 14.3 per cent. We are delivering a program which will help young people to build pride and develop the skills that will lead them to many other opportunities. It is very disappointing to see some of the comments made by members opposite, by the Greens and even by the ACTU president, Ged Kearney, who has said: 


This whole concept of the Green Army is the latest attempt by the Abbott Government to cut wages [and] cut conditions of working people in this country.


It is a pity that Ms Kearney, the Labor Party and the Greens simply do not appreciate this program. This program is creating new opportunities and a whole new pathway to employment. Her statement is frankly a load of absolute rubbish. What I would say to those opposite, to the ACTU and to the Greens is come to my region and see how destructive youth unemployment is in places like Geelong and Colac. I can tell them that this is a wonderful opportunity for so many young people and it is a particularly important part of our efforts to combat youth unemployment. We are doing something. We are giving young people a go. We are helping them to build pride in their work. We are making them feel valued and like they are part of a team, and we are helping them to move towards their next opportunity. We are also tackling important local environmental projects, which unfortunately were ignored by the Labor Party. This is a wonderfully positive scheme, a proud initiative of environment minister Greg Hunt and the coalition government, and I proudly commend this bill to the House.

Mr WATTS

 (
Gellibrand
) (
12:14
):  The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014 claims to address the current crisis facing our unemployed youth. However, the bill unfortunately raises more questions than it answers. Today's labour market is tightening. In February 2014 our unemployment rate hit six per cent for the first time in recent memory. The Abbott government has promised one million new jobs, but that is little more than a mirage on the horizon.


In these circumstances, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find employment, particularly for Australia's youth. Figures released by the Brotherhood of St Laurence in February show that 12.4 per cent of young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were out of work in January of this year. The figures are even higher in Melbourne's west, where over 13 per cent of young people are not able to find work in the current job market—more than double the official unemployment rate. This is to say nothing of the ambitious young people who are underemployed or stuck in temporary work, unable to find the security of a permanent job. The first steps in starting a career are hard enough without a marketplace that will not give you a chance. It places these young people in an extremely vulnerable position, forcing them to trade away their work entitlements for any chance at employment. Youth unemployment rates are reaching crisis levels, and they look unlikely to ease any time soon in Melbourne's west.


There are tough times facing the manufacturing industry in my electorate. With 2½ thousand jobs gone at the Toyota plant in Altona and with more than 1,000 jobs at risk of disappearing at the BAE Systems shipyards in Williamstown, the traditional career path taken by many young people in Melbourne's west, into to a world of manufacturing, will no longer be available. Jobs at the businesses who supply these two companies will also disappear, making opportunities scarce for those trying to enter the working world. The jobs marketplace for the youth of Melbourne's west is not a promising one. 


We need to do all that we can to get these young people into work. Through the right training, work experience, incentives and, most importantly, the right level of government support, Labor believe that we can help these young people to find jobs that are right for them. Labor support work and training programs as a pathway to get these young people into the workforce. 


Work and training programs that are aimed at improving our environment will have an additional benefit, for we all know that the natural beauty that we find in our parks, reserves and beaches adds something immeasurable to the enjoyment of our life. They are places to gather with friends and family, to get active, to celebrate the most important events in our lives and to share our lives with others. Looking after these public places, which add so much to our lives, is essential for the soul of our nation. It is also a moral imperative. The words of Antoine de Saint Exupery are often quoted, yet they still ring as true today as they ever did: 'We do not inherit the earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children.' So it is our obligation to care for our natural environment so that our descendants may enjoy it as much as we do. 


The previous Labor government took these words to heart. It introduced a raft of both immediate and long-term measures to protect our nation's environment. It added new national parks to the World Heritage List, including the Ningaloo Reef, and it added the Koongarra area to Kakadu National Park, so that these parks would have domestic and international protections. Most significantly, the previous Labor government created the most comprehensive system of national marine parks in the world, covering thousands of miles of Australian coastline and sea, with the same protections given to our national parks.


Protecting the environment is a core Labor value. Unfortunately, however, this trait is not shared by our colleagues across the floor in the coalition. The Abbott government's environmental record after only six months in office is abysmal. It has disallowed the classification of the Murray River from the Darling to the sea as an 'endangered community'. It has abandoned efforts to have Queensland's Cape York added to the World Heritage List. It has approved every request for a development in one of Australia's brightest jewels, the Great Barrier Reef, despite UNESCO threatening to list the reef as being 'in danger'. It has secretly rolled back the marine system created under Labor by undoing the management plans that gave the system effect. This is a government that has approached the World Heritage Committee and asked it to delist 74,000 hectares of protected forests. This is a Prime Minister who has claimed: 'We have quite enough national parks. We have quite enough locked up forests already.' This is a government that cannot be trusted to look after our natural environment.


However, the Green Army Program in the bill under consideration is one of the few programs introduced by the Abbott government that could actually go some way to protecting the environment, even in Melbourne's west. Many of our parks, beaches and reserves would benefit from a team of young people to care for and maintain these valuable community areas. Indeed, many of the parks in Melbourne's west are already lucky enough to benefit from the support of the community. I applaud the work of voluntary organisations such as Friends of Lower Kororoit Creek and their president, Geoff Mitchelmore, as well as our Landcare volunteers who work throughout Melbourne's west. They work tirelessly to ensure that our parks and gardens are kept beautiful.


An employment program that provides even more resources for these public places to be cared for and provides our youth with training and work opportunities would clearly provide great benefit to my community. After all, programs like this are a part of Labor's heritage. The Landcare and Environment Action Program, LEAP, was introduced by the Keating government in 1992. It provided work opportunities for young people and fostered good environmental outcomes. This bill proposes to create a similar employment program, although this is hard to see from the grandiose statements of the environment minister. He is at pains to convince us that this is an environmental program, mainly because the government does not have any other coherent environmental policy. In his second reading speech, he touts the Green Army as, 'a central component of the government's cleaner environment plan,' and claims that it will, 'deliver tangible benefits for the environment'. In the explanatory memorandum too, the Green Army's credentials are vaunted. It is described as making, 'a real difference to the environment and local communities through projects such as restoring and protecting habitat, weeding, planting, cleaning up creeks and rivers and restoring cultural heritage places'. 


But let me be clear: the bill under consideration before us is for an employment program. It is primarily designed not to look after the environment but to get young people back into work. This is clear from the program's explicit focus on young people between the ages of 17 to 24, even though there are people of all ages who have the time and passion to get involved in conservation work. It is clear from the environment minister's frequent references to the Green Army as a workforce, which is even contained in the explanatory memorandum to the bill before us today. There is nothing wrong with this. A program designed with skill can achieve the aims of both creating employment opportunities and caring for the environment. Labor has been proud to support this form of employment program throughout its various iterations, from the Landcare and Environment Action Program I mentioned before to bills like the one before us today. 


As an employment program, the Green Army should give to its workers the rights and protections bestowed on all employees under Australian employment law. It is this aspect of the bill under consideration that is most concerning to me, for the bill before us explicitly excludes the Green Army workers from many of the protections awarded to Commonwealth employees. It excludes Green Army members from the definition of 'worker' under the Work Health and Safety Act. It excludes Green Army members from the definition of 'employee' under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. Most importantly, it excludes Green Army members from the definition of 'employee' under the Fair Work Act.


Cutting out Green Army workers from these three crucial areas of employment protection has a significant impact on the legal rights of these workers. If excluded by the Work, Health and Safety Act, the registered training organisations running the Green Army program will not be required to follow the occupational health and safety requirements in relation to Green Army workers. Similarly, being excluded from the ambit of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act means that, in the event of injury during the Green Army program, Green Army workers will not be covered by Commonwealth compensation. This could potentially lead to the unjust situation where the supervisors of Green Army programs would be covered in the event of workplace injury, but the Green Army members they organise would not.


Of most concern is the exclusion of Green Army workers from the ambit of the Fair Work Act. The Fair Work Act provides crucial protections to workers. It protects them from unfair dismissal, allows them to request time off and ensures that they will be paid a minimum wage. If this bill is passed, however, none of these statutory protections will be available to Green Army workers. This would have significant implications for the rights of workers undertaking the program—the workers who, let us not forget, are young, inexperienced, eager for work and desperate to get a foot into the door of the employment market, and many of whom will be passionate about the environment and keen to do something that has an impact on the world but will not understand what the loss of these important workplace rights will entail. 


This is a significant limitation on the rights of a particularly vulnerable group of people in our society, yet there is no detail contained in the bill on the implications of changes to workers' rights, benefits and protections. There is no detail given about the alternative wages that will be offered to Green Army workers. This is a significant issue that requires clarification. Unfortunately, the Green Army seems to be headed by Sergeant Schultz, in the form of the environment minister, who knows nothing about the details of these plans.


More discussion and analysis is required before we can be sure that the level of protection given to the Green Army workers is justifiable. For example, who sets the wage that workers will be receiving? Is it the government or the private service provider who is 'responsible for the disbursement of Green Army allowances', according to the explanatory memorandum? According to what criteria will these wages be justified? Will a 17-year-old Green Army worker be paid the same wages as a graduate with an environment degree? After all, the Abbott government is aiming to attract a large pool of graduates to the Green Army program. 


This is not the only area where a startling lack of detail accompanies the government's claims. We only need to look to the Abbott government's promises about the training opportunities afforded by the Green Army program to see more sweeping statements and no precise detail. The Abbott government seems keen to highlight the training opportunities offered by the Green Army program. The explanatory memorandum frequently mentions the 'hands-on, practical skills, training and experience' that these young people will encounter. In the second reading speech too, the environment minister mentions that 'Green Army participants will have the opportunity to develop job-ready skills and to undertake training'. But what are these job-ready skills that these programs will teach? Will academic training programs be offered to workers, or will manual skills development be the focus? Which industries will the government be preparing these workers to enter? How much training will workers receive for their work? 


It is even unclear whether training will be offered to every worker in the Green Army program. The draft statement of requirements outlines that 'the training component of the programme will be negotiated with each participant as part of the participant agreement'. It gives no guarantees that training will be offered to all participants in the program. It places the onus of negotiating this training on the people in the most vulnerable bargaining position—young people who are desperate for work. It is hard to believe such an unequal bargaining position will result in the best training outcomes for Green Army workers.


Another concern raised by the bill is its potential to displace existing workers. There are many hard-working environmental workers across our communities who fulfil important roles honed with years of experience. Many of these workers may not make much more than the minimum wage. Yet, with an army of workers on training allowances, the potential for these workers to be displaced is significant. How will the government ensure that the jobs of these workers will not be lost, or that in a time of shrinking budgets the skills of these workers will not have been cast off for Green Army trainees who are being paid below the minimum wage? How will the government design the program to prevent this from happening? 


This bill poses far more questions than it answers. Unfortunately, it will be our young people who suffer the most from this lack of detail. The youth of Australia—and particularly the youth of Melbourne's west—are facing tough employment conditions. They will need help in navigating the continuing slide of the employment market to find secure, stable work. An employment program like the one this bill describes can help transition young people into this secure, stable work. It can do so while caring for the parks, rivers and beaches that are so important to us all, but it should not exclude our young people from basic employment protections with a vague sweep of its arm.


The government needs to justify why it is taking these employment protections away. It needs to outline what the consequences of this lack of protection will be, how it will mitigate these consequences and what the offsetting benefits are to the participants in these programs. It needs to specify what sort of wages and training benefits the Green Army program will offer to participants. It needs to detail the procedures in place to ensure that this program will not take away jobs from those already undertaking environmental works in our communities.


The Abbott government has failed to provide the level of detail in this bill. It needs to stop acting like an opposition who cannot think past three-second sound bites and provide some detail about how the Green Army program will support and protect workers in practice.

"Wood, Jason, MP",LP,2014-03-25,"



Mr WOOD
 (La Trobe) (12:28):  I rise to talk about the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014. It is a fantastic program and initiative being launched by the government in July this year. The policy covers two things that I am very passionate about: one is the environment, and the other is youth welfare. In my electorate of La Trobe, we are now committed to four Green Army projects: a nature reserve mountain biking network, National Rhododendron Gardens in Olinda, the south-eastern Dandenong Ranges protection program and Shangri-La Wildlife Shelter. I will now look at each of those programs separately.


First of all is the nature reserve mountain biking network. Mountain bike trails attract a large group of enthusiastic participants, and the Green Army proposal will look at developing crown land in La Trobe to make environmentally sensitive changes for this to happen.


The Beaconsfield Nature Conservation Reserve is one location being considered, along with other crown land in Cockatoo and Gembrook. The project will see the construction of sustainable trails as well as weed control and the preservation of heritage. We will work with the Cardinia Environmental Coalition and the wider community to build an internationally approved, staggered-loop design mountain bike track system. The community will benefit in many ways from this—improved fitness and health of local residents, improved level of wellbeing as the people connect to nature, and benefits to local traders from the influx of trail users.


The environment will also benefit in many ways, as building sustainable trails will guarantee long-term protection of the land. Mountain bike riders have shown themselves to be highly motivated and willing to put many volunteer hours back into the areas they ride. Weed control will also be improved and regulated with maintenance on the trail. I would like to thank Malcolm Doswell for submitting this proposal and hope that other organisations—like the local Friends group, the Fat Tyre Flyers Mountain Bike Club, Full Gas Pedallers, Yarra Ranges Mountain Bikers, the Dirtriders Mountain Bike Club and the Cardinia Environmental Coalition will also greatly benefit from this Green Army project.


Another planned Green Army project is for the National Rhododendron Gardens in Olinda. The lovely town of Olinda is in the Dandenong Ranges, and nearby are the iconic National Rhododendron Gardens—and I love these gardens. There are more than 15,000 rhododendrons in the gardens, and they share the stage with 12,000 azaleas, 3,000 camellias and, amazingly, 250,000 daffodils. Located only a short distance from Olinda, the 100-acre gardens offer a fantastic opportunity to see one of the region's premier garden sites. Thousands of people visit these gardens each year, especially since the Liberal state government was elected and removed the entry fee for admission. The Green Army project will assist the rhododendron society to maintain and further develop the 100 acres of botanical gardens, the main focus being on weeding of invasive species, care and protection of native fauna through the construction of bird breeding boxes and the construction of walking paths or boardwalks. The community will benefit by making this unique asset in La Trobe even better. In October each year we have the internationally recognised Blossom Festival. A number of Japanese and Chinese tourists attend the gardens for this, and it is quite spectacular. I would like to thank Mike Hammer, who initially put this application in back in 2010 and has been a great ambassador for the gardens. I would also like to thank all of the other committee members and all of the volunteers who help in the rhododendron gardens.


The next project is the south-eastern Dandenong Ranges protection program, which will greatly benefit from the Green Army project. This project will focus around the Dandenong Ranges, in the southern and eastern areas surrounding the iconic Puffing Billy corridor. This corridor provides an opportunity to establish a significant biolink stretching from the Dandenong Ranges to the west to the Bunyip State Park in the east. These works will complement works already being undertaken by environmental volunteer groups, including the community weed alliance in the Dandenongs, the Southern Ranges Environment Alliance and Puffing Billy. It will build on the works of the Urban Fringe Weed Management Initiative, which combines the efforts of council, Melbourne Water, and Parks Victoria. Tasks will include revegetation, woody weed control, wandering trad control—and I will talk a bit more about that later—nest box insulation, and monitoring and treatment of climbing ivy. It will encapsulate a range of awareness and training opportunities for private landowners.


The project will improve the tourism and the amenity values of the iconic Dandenong Ranges and will support the work of many environmental groups, providing valuable ground assistance. It will also improve connectivity of multiple-use trails in the parks, bushland reserves and trackside properties of the Puffing Billy railway. The project will begin to deliver a consistent and effective weed management program for private landowners adjacent to public land managers. I would like to thank the following people for their continued efforts in weed control in the area and support of the Green Army proposal: Bill Incoll, Jane Hollands, Darcy Duggan, Xander Groverland and Glenn Brooks-MacMillan. Glenn is the facilitator of the Southern Ranges Environmental Alliance. I recently had a great meeting with the team up in Ferny Creek, off Jacka Street, where a great initiative took place. They would approach landowners saying that they had, for example, holly or sycamores or wandering trad or ivy on their properties, and the group then worked with the private residents to remove those weeds. Why did this take place? If it had not, the weeds would have flourished into the Sherbrooke Forest next door.


I had a good chat to Phil Hastings, a local resident in Ferny Creek, who knows a lot about weeds. Phil is also a member of the Ferny Creek Horticultural Society, and he had a fence of ivy in his backyard. Each year he would do the right thing and cut back all of the ivy before it flowered, but the problem is that you cannot get every bud—and then it goes into the forest. So Phil allowed the group to remove this ivy from his fence, and it is looking fantastic. The next project is the Shangri-La Wildlife Shelter, run by Rodney and Tina Hudson-Davies, with whom I have shared a great number of years of friendship and work. When I hear the opposition say that the Abbott government does not care about the environment, can I say that in my past experience in La Trobe, the Labor Party has done nothing for the environment. A classic example is the Shangri-La Wildlife Shelter, which had never received any state, council or federal funding until Malcolm Turnbull became the environmental minister and we announced $25,000, I think it was, to help build shelters and fences up there. The shelters provide rehabilitation services for injured animals, and this project will focus on stopping dog attacks, which have sadly killed kangaroos and other animals. A brush fence is to be built, and some more pens for the injured animals are to be constructed.


The Green Army will not only make significant contributions to the betterment of our environment but will assist our young to gain hands-on practical experience that will improve their employment prospects. The coalition Green Army policies plan to bring 15,000 people—the largest-standing environmental workforce in Australia's history—to provide real and practical solutions to cleaning up river banks and creeks and revegetating sand dunes and mangrove habitats, among the other environmental conservation work being carried out.


The Green Army is also about training for young people. Aside from improving the environment—and that is obviously the message in La Trobe—participants will receive a training wage, invaluable work skills and formal training. In Year 12 I completed my outdoor education course at Boronia Secondary College. I learned a lot of environmental skills—in fact, I remember working on the ground at Ferntree Gully in Dandenong Ranges National Park pulling out weeds and caring for the environment. The group I worked with ended up doing very well. I think training in the environment, and getting hands-on experience, is a great initiative, and the minister must be congratulated for that.


The program will commence from July 2014 with the rollout of 250 Green Army projects and approximately 2,500 people undertaking on the ground environmental activities in 2014-15. I cannot see why the Labor Party are so strongly opposed to this. Up to nine eligible participants and at least one team supervisor will constitute a Green Army. Participants will be eligible to receive a Green Army allowance while participating in the program, and will have the opportunity to undertake training.


Again, when the Labor Party implemented their pink batts scheme it was an absolute disaster. I find it quite ironic that the Labor Party, in opposition, has the audacity to lecture us on workplace training, when under their pink batts scheme four young people sadly had their lives taken and there were over 250 house fires. Why? It was through sheer incompetence. We now have a royal commission looking at this. The pink batts scheme was such a bad program. I know they may be trying to cover their tracks by blaming the Abbott government for this Green Army project, but remember this: they cannot look themselves in the mirror without judging themselves for completely failing on the pink batts program.


The Green Army Program will initially target participants between the ages of 17 and 24 years. Why would the Labor Party be strongly opposed to seeing young people get jobs? To me that is so important.


I will now briefly talk about Labor's environmental record in La Trobe. I mentioned wandering trad earlier. For those who do not know, it is a weed that grows in the creeks. In fact, it is in up to 50 kilometres of creeks in the Dandenong Ranges. It stops any wildlife from moving and it sucks up an amazing amount of water. Back in 2007, when Malcolm Turnbull was the environment minister, prior to the election being called we made an election commitment for $450,000 to find a biological control for wandering trad. The local environmentalists were exceptionally excited and really appreciated it.


During the same election campaign, Peter Garrett, I believe it was, bizarrely came down to La Trobe to make an announcement about the Great Barrier Reef. Unfortunately we do not have the Great Barrier Reef in La Trobe, but we would love to have it. Our big issues are fire management and weed control in the Dandenong Ranges. So what happened when the Rudd government was elected in 2007? One of the first things they did was to cut the wandering trad funding, and sadly this weed has caused a great deal of damage ever since. In 2010 I again committed to funding of $450,000, this time under Minister for the Environment Greg Hunt, who has been an absolute ambassador and supporter of the Dandenong Ranges. Again, Labor did not match this. They are all talk when it comes to the environment. The same was true of the Greens, who just kept their mouth shut during the election campaign.


In the 2013 election campaign what did we do? We announced further funding for wandering trad amounting to $450,000. The Minister for the Environment, Greg Hunt, knows how bad this problem is in the Dandenong Ranges. Remember that this is one of Victoria's top 10 tourist attractions. It is a disgrace that our creeks do not flow because of this weed. Greg Hunt, and I think Ian Macfarlane also, committed that the CSIRO will continue to look at finding a biological control. In New Zealand this weed is devastating their national forest and they have committed to a biological control.


The other announcement we made was $2.4 million dollars to be spent on bushfire and fuel reduction in the Dandenong Ranges. I made similar announcements back in 2010 and 2007. Again, the Labor Party talks about doing great work for the environment and how passionate they are, but would they match this commitment? No. The only true supporters of the environment in the Dandenong Ranges, in the electorate of La Trobe, have been the Liberal Party and the Nationals.


We see that Minister for the Environment Greg Hunt has been a great supporter of La Trobe, the Dandenong Ranges and of the environment. This program, put together with the Prime Minister Tony Abbott, is all good. It is all about the environment, it is all about finding jobs for young people. I do not understand why we have this criticism and lack of support from the Labor Party. They should bow their heads in shame, especially if they venture into La Trobe.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2014-03-25,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (12:42):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation, because Labor believes in helping job seekers enter the workforce. We believe in providing young people with the appropriate training, skills and work experience they need to help them enter employment—especially as they make that difficult transition from school to work. We believe that environmentally based work and training programs can be an effective pathway for job seekers, and also provide some real environmental benefits.


We support the Green Army, just as we supported its previous incarnations; the National Green Jobs Corps; the Green Corps program; and the original incarnation, Paul Keating's 1992 Landcare and Environment Action Program. However, although we support the principles of the program, we remain significantly concerned at the lack of detail that is being provided by the Abbott government about how this program will actually work, and about the exemptions from the workplace health and safety laws, compensation laws, and industrial relations laws that the government is seeking to put in place.


As they always do, the wonderful staff of the Parliamentary Library have prepared a comprehensive Bills Digest on this legislation. It is very much worth a read, and I recommend it. It was published last week on 18 March. The reason I mention it now is that in the very first section of this digest, on the first page out of nine pages of text, the library has provided a caveat. It says:


It is worth noting that, beyond the basics, there is not a great deal of publicly available information about the programme.


This program is meant to begin on 1 July this year. That is just over three months away, and we are still without any significant detail about how it will run. I note that the Green Army has been a policy of the Liberal Party since the 2010 election, so it is quite surprising that they have not worked out the detail yet. But this is just further evidence that the Prime Minister is a Prime Minister of slogans and not of substance.


Some of the details that we are missing include what, if any, training will be provided to participants. It is by no means clear that training for participants is to be guaranteed or that any training that is provided is to be accredited training. The explanatory memorandum merely states that Green Army participants will have the opportunity to undertake training. Who will provide this training? Will it be accredited training? What level of training will be provided? What qualifications will participants have at the end of this training? Will they have a certificate I? Will they have a certificate II? Will they have a certificate III? Will they have a certificate IV? 


Similarly, we do not know what, if any, processes are going to be put in place to support participants to transition into the workforce after they have completed the program. We also do not have any great detail about the environmental objectives of the program. Any environmental outcomes the program might provide would be greatly enhanced if the program were more clearly focused on strategically targeted long-term projects that met a clear set of environmental objectives. Unfortunately, this is not the case.


We also do not know what, if any, safeguards are being put in place to ensure the program does not lead to the displacement or reduction of employment opportunities for existing workers. The Abbott government must assure those hardworking Australians in local government and other organisations and authorities that employers will not be able to displace them and rely upon Green Army participants to do their work. There is simply no justification for a program like the Green Army that can provide employment pathways if the participants then go on to displace existing workers. This potential displacement needs to be addressed by the Abbott government in its design of the program. We currently have no detail to give us any confidence that this will not occur.


Of greater concern to Labor than what we do not know about this policy is what we do know—that there will be exemptions from work health and safety, compensation and industrial relations laws for participants. Labor is gravely concerned that this bill does not provide adequate protections for participants in the Green Army scheme, namely in the areas of occupational health and safety, workers compensation and rehabilitation. Proposed section 38J of this legislation provides that a participant in the Green Army Program is not a worker for the Commonwealth and is not an employee of the Commonwealth for the purposes of the Work Health and Safety Act 2011, nor an employee within the meaning of section 5 of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 and is not an employee for the purposes of the Fair Work Act 2009. Because they are not an employee, they are not entitled to the benefits that an employee would be entitled to, including workers compensation.


In defence of this, the Minister for the Environment says that the arrangements would be similar to the Howard government's Green Corps program. That is all very well, but the workplace relations environment has changed since the days of the Green Corps. Under previous schemes, participants could have been covered by state and territory employment laws, but this will no longer be the case, since most states and territories referred their industrial relations powers to the Commonwealth in 2010.


Nothing in the bill addresses the issue of the extent to which Green Army service providers will be required to provide suitable insurance. However, even when suitable insurance is in place, it differs from workers compensation cover in that an injured participant is likely to have to demonstrate negligence. There have been successful claims of this sort, but they can take many years to settle, and young volunteers may not have the resources to pursue such claims.


What we have here is a program where young and inexperienced workers will be undertaking physical work in outdoor, unpredictable environments but will be offered a lower standard of workplace protection. Labor finds this entirely unacceptable. If the Abbott government were at all committed to workplace safety and entitlements or at all concerned about the wellbeing of the Green Army participants, it would ensure that participants are deemed employees so that they are covered by a range of Commonwealth laws, including the Fair Work Act, the Work Health and Safety Act and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act.


So far I have outlined a range of concerns with the detail of this program, but perhaps the biggest problem with the policy, the thing that causes me the most concern, is that those opposite think that the Green Army is a solution to climate change. The Green Army section of the Liberal's policy document says the Green Army will 'make a real difference to improving the environment in our own backyard and addressing climate change'. Of course, those opposite intend for the Green Army to complement the Abbott government's biggest policy disaster, which is Direct Action. But, no matter how many young Australians join the Green Army, no matter how much the Abbott government is prepared to pay to big polluters, these policies will not be as effective as a market based solution to cap carbon pollution. That is why Labor is united in support for an emissions trading scheme.


We have known for some time that our sea levels are rising as a result of human induced global warming. The advice from climate scientists is clear on this. Most recently, the fifth report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, released last year, told us that warming of the climate system is unequivocal and that the sea level has risen. We know, too, that extreme weather events are increasing in intensity and frequency as a result of climate change. In Australia, we do not need to be reminded about the devastation that extreme weather events can cause. It is something we all know. It is something we all fear. It is something, therefore, that we should be united in tackling. I heard on the radio just this morning that Oxfam was warning about the fact that potentially 100 million people in the next 50 years could be facing starvation if there is not appropriate action taken on climate change in the near future.


Those opposite agree on the need to reduce carbon pollution. What we disagree on is how we should go about that. Labor will support the repeal of the fixed carbon price in order to replace it with an emissions trading scheme. What we will not support is the removal of the fixed price on carbon if it is not going to be replaced by a carbon pricing scheme that puts a cap on carbon pollution, that guarantees a reduction in carbon pollution. 


The fact is that economies all over the world are putting a price on carbon right now or they have already done so. There are over one billion people currently living in carbon constrained economies. They live in a country, a state, a province or a union that has initiated some form of carbon pricing, such as a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme.


The European Union, of course, has had an ETS since 2005. The EU ETS is now the largest carbon market in the world, operating in 30 countries, including the 27 EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The EU is Australia's second largest trading bloc, which is why linking Australia's ETS with the EU's ETS was a long-term goal of the Labor government. When in August last year the then Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency announced that when the Australian carbon price moved to a floating price ETS it would be linked with the European Union ETS, it was applauded as the best possible outcome for Australia.


However, the EU is not alone—far from it. California, which is the ninth largest economy in the world in its own right, has introduced an emissions trading scheme around the $20 mark. In China alone, 200 million people are living in provinces where there is an ETS either in place or in development. Most significantly, there are plans for a nationwide emissions trading scheme in China later this decade. Closer to home, our friend and neighbour New Zealand has had an ETS in place since 2009 with bipartisan support.


I mention the bipartisan support because, in the debate on carbon pricing over the last few years since I had the honour of being elected the member for Canberra, in the discussions that I have had with the community and also the diplomatic community here in Canberra one thing that has particularly staggered the European members of the diplomatic corps is the fact that this has become such a partisan issue. In the UK and throughout Europe, action on climate change has been seen as a bipartisan issue, requiring, therefore, bipartisan support. I have to say that the European diplomatic corps, particularly, have been absolutely astonished about the level of partisanship that has embraced this issue in Australia, given the fact that it has enjoyed such strong bipartisan support in the EU and in each of those countries throughout the EU for such a long time. It is quite breathtaking when our neighbour and friend New Zealand have had this ETS in place since 2009 with bipartisan support.


By 2016, over three billion people will be living in countries where there are emissions trading schemes or carbon taxes. That is three billion people. But, if the Abbott government has its way, Australians will not be among those three billion. The fact is that the Abbott government's so-called Direct Action Plan will take very little action at all. Direct Action does not put a cap on carbon pollution and it does not provide the price signal—the market based imperative that is required to move away from carbon intensive actions. Direct Action is a system of taxpayer funded subsidies to polluters. It asks ordinary, working, taxpaying Australians to subsidise big polluters. It is a policy that is rejected by climate scientists and economists alike. Direct Action does not guarantee a reduction in carbon pollution. The simple truth is that without a cap on carbon there cannot be any such guarantee. It is an expensive system that pays taxpayer funded subsidies to polluters with no guarantee of success.


I know that there are members opposite who agree that an ETS is the most efficient and effective way to reduce carbon pollution. The fact is that in 2007 there was bipartisan support for an ETS. It was the policy that both parties took to the 2007 election and was supported beyond the 2007 election.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Craig Kelly
):  Order! Member for Canberra, I am happy to have a wide-ranging debate, but this bill is the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill. I request that you be as relevant as you can to the bill.




Ms BRODTMANN:
  The Green Army is designed to tackle climate change, and I am talking about tackling climate change. On tackling climate change, then Prime Minister John Howard said:


Australia will more than play its part to address climate change but will do it in a practical and balanced way in full knowledge of the economic consequences for our nation.


He was not talking about Direct Action; he was not talking about using taxpayers' money to subsidise polluters; he was talking about the introduction of an ETS. Following the election, then Leader of the Opposition Brendan Nelson also put the coalition support behind an ETS. He said:


We believe in an emissions trading scheme. We believe in a cap and trade system.


Of course, famously, Dr Nelson's successor as Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth, is the No. 1 fan of the ETS. He put it very succinctly when he said:


You won't find an economist anywhere that will tell you anything other than that the most efficient and effective way to cut emissions is by putting a price on carbon


Sadly, the most recent change in leadership heralded a policy backflip and, for reasons unknown, an ETS has fallen out of favour with the coalition. Today, I ask those opposite to consider whether they really believe that the policy combination of the Green Army and Direct Action is a sufficient response to climate change. I ask them to listen to the experts, the scientists and the economists, to remember their own comments made not so long ago and to commit to a market based solution to climate change—a cap-and-trade ETS.


I also urge those opposite to wake up to the fact that, no matter how much merit this program might have as a vocational training program, it is no solution to climate change. An emissions trading system is the only way forward. (Time expired)

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (12:57):  I rise today to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014, which resurrects and expands on the Howard years' Green Corps, which was an outstanding program proving time and time again to be a great opportunity for young people, especially those about to enter the workforce. It gave them a sense of belonging in the community, as well as having positive environmental outcomes. Unfortunately, under the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments, the successful Green Corps program was replaced with the National Green Jobs Corps, which effectively reclassified unemployed people, who continued to receive an income support payment, and was then abolished altogether.


Over the life of the Green Corps program, participants propagated and planted more than 14 million trees, erected more than 8,000 kilometres of fencing, cleared more than 50,000 hectares of weeds, collected more than 9,500 kilograms of seeds and constructed and maintained more than 5,000 kilometres of walking tracks and boardwalks. I am proud that the coalition government will not follow the way of the previous government, which repealed a program that helped to develop the skills of young people, helped communities to take responsibility for their local patch and helped to directly fix or mitigate local environment issues. Indeed, it was a program that actually worked. No wonder Labor did away with it! It was a program that actually worked—in stark contrast to the Labor government's extensive list of failures.


On this side of the chamber, we are creating a standing Green Army, which will gradually build to a 15,000-strong environmental workforce. This will provide real and practical solutions to cleaning up riverbanks and creek beds, revegetating sand dunes, revegetating mangrove habitat, and a host of other environmental conservation projects. The Green Army will work with, and complement the work undertaken by, local and care groups, bush care groups, foreshore communities, natural resource management groups, local catchment authorities and councils in their work restoring and protecting the local environment. This will be particularly beneficial in my electorate as Ryan is home to part of Brisbane River, which is facing issues of sedimentation and bank degradation, and we also have Mount Coot-tha and its surrounding national parks and forests, Mount Crosby, parts of Mount Nebo, Walkabout Creek and the Enoggera Dam.


When the Minister for the Environment visited my electorate before the last election, to launch the Ryan Green Army Program, I was pleased to see such a strong turnout from local environmental groups and interested members of the community—all coming together united by their interest in and dedication to caring for our environment. Mount Coot-tha is a popular bushland destination for many people from all over Brisbane. It includes the Brisbane Botanic Gardens and Sir Thomas Brisbane Planetarium, as well as a mountain drive, bike tracks, walking trails and parks. There are several popular walking tracks around Mount Coot-tha, with most involving some uphill sections or steps. These tracks are often used by hikers training to walk the Kokoda Track in Papua New Guinea as the terrain and climate are considered similar.


Recently I attended a neighbourhood planning forum, hosted by Premier Newman, for The Gap community works, including upgrades to Walkabout Creek in my electorate. The upgrades would give residents better access to the Enoggera Dam, allowing for kayaking and other water sports; an expansion of the Walkabout Creek centre, making it a community hub, with animal enclosures, educational sessions and a treetop boardwalk; and the creation of new walking tracks, high ropes courses and infrastructure for local scouts and guides groups. The scouting movement have expressed their desire to see this work carried out as it would mean a new area to train groups in outdoor exploration. Community leaders have found that there is a missing stepping stone between teaching scout groups the theory of outdoor exploration, camping and bushwalking, and then going and having an adventure in national bushland. These new upgrades will fill that gap, enabling young adventure groups to ease into the more difficult outdoor exploration.


Walkabout Park, part of the larger nature reserve lying on the western boundary of Brisbane, in the Enoggera Reservoir, is home to many rare native plants and animals. It was evident at the neighbourhood family meeting, with more than 100 people turning up on a Sunday morning to discuss upgrades in their local environment, that the national park is of huge significance to the local community. There were representatives from some of the many community green groups in the area, who work on local waterways, rehabilitation, weed eradication and the protection of local endangered species.


I am delighted to stand in this place legislating for a stronger, more lasting version of the former Green Corps by way of the coalition government's Green Army. My office has already received a number of Green Army grant applications, and I look forward to seeing the army grow and develop within my electorate. The electorate of Ryan is home to the University of Queensland, one of the leading research universities in the Southern Hemisphere. The researchers at University of Queensland are investigating a range of projects to protect and rehabilitate the environment, and to create a more sustainable way of living. I have previously spoken in this place about the work of Professor Ben Hankamer at the Institute for Molecular Bioscience on using genetically modified algae to rehabilitate creeks and waterways that have been affected by the nutrient run-off from farms or from the waste created by mine sites.


The University of Queensland is preparing the future of the hydrogen economy by looking at ways to sustainably produce hydrogen from genetically modified hydrogen, and on more efficient hydrogen fuel cells, to eventually replace our dependence on fossil fuels. There is also research into increasing the efficiency of traditional solar panels, as well as manufacturing lighter and more flexible and transportable solar panels. These new solar strips could be used along skirting boards and around windows in office buildings to capture light to reduce the energy demands of the building. There is a great deal of research in these fields not just at the University of Queensland but also internationally. However, in most cases the research is exactly that, research, and is not quite viable for mass production or mass implementation yet. Until such a time as the research becomes a viable alternative to our current practice, direct action from community groups to better their local environment is one of our best options.


When local community members work together to solve a problem, the sky is the limit. I would like to give special mention to some of the many green groups in my electorate and highlight all the good work they do: Save Our Waterways Now, Kenmore Transition Town, Yarrabee Road Bushcare Group, Barnett Road Bushcare Group, Men of the Trees, Freer's Farm Bushcare Group, Ferny Grove Transition Town, Glen Harding Park Bushcare Group, Toowong Creek Roving Rehabilitators, Birds Queensland, Protect Long Pocket Action Group, St Lucia Esplanade Bushcare Group, Indooroopilly Woods Residents Group, Moore Park Bushcare Group, Taringa Parade Bushcare Group, Rainbow Forest Experimental Rehabilitation Group, Brookfield Showground Bushcare Group, Brushbox Bushcare Group, Merri Merri Park Bushcare Park, Cubberla Creek Revegetation Group, Kimba Street Bushcare Group, Greenhill Regenerators, Wandering Weeders, Mandalay Progress Association, Manaton Park Bushcare Group, Manaton Habitat Group, McKay Brook Bushcare Group, Pullen Pullen Catchments Group, Guardians of Little Gubberley, Gap Creek Bushcare Group, Cubberla-Witton Catchment Network, Huntington Bushcare Group, Rural Environmental Planning Association, Upper Gold Creek Bushcare Group, Upper Brookfield Bush Regeneration, Anstead Park Bushcare Group, Moggill Creek Catchment Group, Lions Nature Trail Bushcare Group and my local group, The Hut Environmental and Community Association. All these groups will benefit from the Green Army Program and I look forward to working with them in the future.

"Ryan, Joanne, MP",ALP,2014-03-25,"



Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (13:06):  I rise today to support the amendment moved by the member for Port Adelaide to the second reading debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014. Labor has always believed in the need for people in our society to work and in the dignity it brings to the individual and to the community. We also know that the vast majority of people in our society want to work. They want to earn money. They want to make a contribution. Having meaningful work is integral to one's sense of self.


This is why Labor are focused on creating the conditions for low unemployment and for fair work conditions and why we fight to keep workers in their jobs. This is why we have moved this amendment. This discussion needs to address how participants in this program will be protected if they are injured, sick or mistreated. We need to address what training will be given to the participants. What will be provided to help them transition to full-time work? What are the risks for the displacement of existing workers? These are all questions that need to be asked and answered. 


Labor agrees that we need to do everything we can to get people into work, but we need more than a thought bubble here. The implications of this legislation need to be carefully and rigorously thought through. Given that this is a Green Army, the government's environmental record seems to be a good place to start—and I mean on the big environmental issues. This government already has an unenviable reputation as a retrograde administration when it comes to the environment. It is the only government in the world that has asked the World Heritage Committee to delist a currently listed wilderness area. It has a radical anti-environment agenda—from disallowing the endangered community listing of the Murray from the Darling to the sea, to the marine park stretching from Cape York to Fraser Island, to the reserve in the great Alpine National Park. In six months this government has conducted a relentless, destructive campaign when it comes to the environment. I have not yet mentioned its flat-earth-society approach to climate change or the oxymoron that is this government having a Minister for Environment.


The Australian government, regardless of which party is in power, has a sacred duty to protect and maintain our Great Southern Land's unique and magnificent natural assets. Those opposite must realise that they are stewards. They have been entrusted by the people of Australia, and by our children and children's children, to take care of this fragile place. At the moment, those opposite are failing in this duty. In fact, they actively and shamefully neglect it. 


It is worth looking, too, at their record in protecting and supporting the vulnerable, given this bill will impact on our vulnerable young people. In the six months since they took office, they have abolished the Council on Homelessness, followed soon after by axing the National Housing Supply Council. More recently, they have refused to commit to the National Affordable Housing Agreement and to the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness. 


Their record on workers is also instructive. They have abandoned manufacturing workers at Toyota, Alcoa and Holden, giving no guarantees of assistance despite the time elapsed since these heartless decisions were made.


There is a theme that has developed in the short time this government has been in power. The Prime Minister has told us that there are goodies and baddies. In this case, market is good, regulation is bad. It is here again in this bill—a failure to do the hard work that will ensure positive outcomes for the young people involved with an eye only on the prize of less regulation, as though less regulation is an end in itself—a value. This government know the cost of everything but the value of nothing.


However, the government are good at a few things. They are good at spin. They are great sloganeers. They excel at reducing debate to nonsensical repetitive sentences. Their three word slogans are becoming legendary— 'cutting red tape'. We all know this is a euphemism for removing protections. Just this week I heard an argument form the member for Farrer that childcare workers should not monitor and record children's progress as part of their duties—that somehow this was an example of evil red tape and a waste of time. Again, the cost is highlighted rather than the value—the value of early detection of learning, health or social issues that would lead to better outcomes for the child, the family and the community. 


We see it here again with the Green Army legislation. The purpose of the bill is unclear. Is it about getting young people into work? Is it about developing work-ready skills? Is it about long-term outcomes through training and experience? Or is it about the market and this government wrapping itself in green and pretending it cares about the environment and the vulnerable? This bill provides exemptions from the Fair Work Act 2009, Work Health and Safety Act 2011, and the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. This is alarming. These acts cover occupational health and safety, workers compensation and rehabilitation. 


Labor is concerned that this bill does not provide adequate protections for participants in the Green Army scheme. Participants will not be treated as employees, and so they will be denied the rights and protections normally afforded to employees. These pretty basic rights are quite important for the smooth running of our society. They are there to ensure that unwarranted risks are not taken on the job site, to ensure workers are trained appropriately to minimise injury and to ensure that, where this fails, workers are rehabilitated and compensated for their injuries. They are hallmarks of a civilised society. They are what a First World country expects. They are about risk and harm minimisation. It seems they are the one cost that this government does not understand—the cost of a young person who works too hard to impress the boss and damages his or her back, who is then judged to have a permanent injury that will prevent them from ever joining our armed forces. Where there is smoke, there is fire.


As I said earlier, cutting red tape is a euphemism for removing worker protections. It is not credible that any government would introduce a scheme that did not provide these basic protections. This legislation raises more questions than answers. Why do participants not have employee status even though they are being removed from social security and paid an equivalent training wage? The government is attempting to take an employment program, rebadge it as an environmental program and abdicate from their responsibility as an employer—all at the same time.


It kind of sums up the Abbott Government—mad policy alchemists trying to conjure solutions to difficult problems out of thin air, while doing none of the hard work required. It is irresponsible, it is dangerous and it is not on. This government does not have an environmental policy. This is why it is forced to take from employment policy and dress it up as environment policy. But let us be clear: it is an employment program and, as such, participants should be treated as employees. It is a good thing that the Green Army participants will be paid the equivalent of the training wage. It is not a lot of money, but it is more than Newstart pays. These payments will also be similar to the training wages received by thousands of other young Australians who are in vocational training or education. What is troubling though is that, while they are being paid by the Commonwealth, they will not be treated as Commonwealth employees. This leaves them in an undefined place—a place without standard worker protections and entitlements, yet with the same risks as workers in the workplace.


A further concern for Labor is the concept of additionality or the potential to displace existing workers. There is no point training people for roles that are already filled. Robbing Peter to pay Paul is no way to govern. This is another example of the government trying to conjure solutions out of thin air without doing the hard work required. The thing about governing is that it is hard work. I am not certain those opposite have fully comprehended this fact. It is not all swanning around parliament and cutting ribbons. It is certainly not about taking the reins of government and then slinking back to the office or the restaurant and leaving the market to do the work. It is about working with and for the community. It is about working with business, workers and people to build the economy together. 


Sometimes in question time, when I hear the cries 'Get out of the way!', I wonder what would happen if we did just get out of the way and let this government put the markets in charge of our lives. What would happen to the young people who set off to the job site without protection under the law? When I read this bill I know the answers. While this amendment bill omits much of the detail related to workers' rights, benefits and protections, the associated statement of requirements is equally bereft of detail. Unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, causes great hardship to workers, their families and their communities. Entrenched unemployment is a cancer on the economic strength of our nation.


Those on this side of the House believe that some people need help getting work and that there is a role for government in this process. People need the right training, work experience, incentives and, most importantly, the appropriate level of support. A close reading reveals that access to the formally recognised training requirements delivered by RTOs are an optional part of this program. What then will compel those charged with delivering the program to include this training in it? We all know that training costs money. What impetus will drive the delivery of training within the program? And, if the training is to be delivered, of what nature will it be? What vocations and skills will be provided within the program? Have they been identified by the Australian Workplace and Productivity Authority as areas of emerging and future skill needs? There are many questions to answer because there is so little detail. If we look at the decisions and choices this government has made, we get an insight and again we get bad news—this time for our youth. This government has cut trade training centre funding and will cut the Youth Connections program funding—two initiatives that assist our young people in becoming contributors to our society through education and work preparation.


Environment-based training and employment programs are an effective way of getting people to work whilst at the same time training them up in skills that our country needs to remain economically strong. This country cannot afford to look for shortcuts. We need to invest in training now, but that is not in this government's plan. Their plan is to cut and cut and cut again. You cannot cut your way to prosperity. The Green Army scheme, if delivered as intended, not only will help train young people and the unemployed in skills our nation requires but will also go ways to conserving our natural environment at a local level. However, if we leave out the training, those in the Green Army will become little more than gangers with no pathway to a better future and few skills to help our economy.


Youth unemployment must be addressed. It must be addressed for the sake of the youth in question—a citizen, an Australian, someone's son or daughter. It must be addressed for the sake of the workforce. There is a skills shortage. Training our youth is an obvious solution. It must be addressed for the sake of our economy. The unemployed not only cost the economy in terms of benefits but also deny the government revenue in the form of taxes and productivity when they are not taking part in the workforce. This government needs to show a commitment to fair wages, meaningful work, training and the opportunity for people to progress in the workforce. It is now time they look the problem of youth unemployment in the eye, roll up their sleeves and start doing the hard yards required to solve this complex problem.

"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2014-03-25,"



Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (13:18):  I am very pleased to speak to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014 today. It is an example of the Abbott government delivering on yet another key election commitment through legislation to establish the Green Army. The Green Army Program is a key plank in the government's cleaner environment plan under the clean land pillar. The Green Army is a voluntary program that encourages hands-on, practical, grassroots action to support local environment and heritage conservation projects in Australia. It is an opportunity for young people in my electorate of Brisbane aged between 17 and 24 to gain very valuable training experience in environmental and heritage conservation fields and to explore careers further in the conservation management area.


In my electorate of Brisbane the Abbott government has committed to two Green Army projects on the Brisbane north side. Enoggera Creek, Ithaca Creek and Kedron Brook Creek will benefit from the two Green Army teams improving the local environment and amenity through practical and real action. I want to provide some further detail on one of the areas of my electorate that will benefit from this work being done by the Green Army. I am specifically referring to Kedron Brook, which stretches a total of 29 kilometres, starting at the D'Aguilar National Park and ending in the Schulz Canal in Moreton Bay. The creek is a very valuable part of the north side of Brisbane. Many families walk alongside the many pathways and bikeways on a regular basis. I want to commend the work that has been done by the Brisbane City Council as well. The environment along the creek has some of the last remaining remnants of riparian rainforest and includes the remnants of the locally uncommon flood gum Eucalyptus grandis along the Kedron Brook floodway. Mangroves and exotic grasses are the dominant vegetation. It is these wonderful natural gems, not just in my electorate but all over Australia, that this bill will protect.


Once in place the Green Army teams will focus on revegetation, installing ecological signage, upgrading walkways and cycling paths, mapping wildlife, planting trees, and installing measures to minimise flooding and reduce its impact on the local environment. This is a very real and practical way to make a difference to our environment and to complement our direct action approach to climate change. I am currently working with the Minister for the Environment in having this project rolled out as soon as possible.


The Green Army Program will provide benefits to both the environment and the community through projects such as restoring and protecting habitat, weeding, planting, cleaning up creeks and rivers, and restoring cultural heritage places. In addition to all of the great environmental work that will be done, the Green Army participants will be paid an allowance and gain valuable experience in conservation management, teamwork, discipline and waking up every morning and being committed to doing the job that needs to be done. The Australian government will shortly be undertaking a tender process for service providers who will engage the Green Army teams and supervisors and manage the activities to ensure that projects are completed safely, are reported regularly on and are on time. Projects may be carried out across urban, and regional and remote Australia, or on public land, Indigenous-held land or private land where there is a clear community, environmental and heritage benefit.


The Green Army will become Australia's largest ever environmental workforce, building to 15,000 participants by 2018 and capable of delivering real results. Those real results will be 1,500 on-the-ground environmental projects. It should be noted that this bill builds on the very strong history the coalition has in delivering for the environment. In particular it will build on the Howard government's successful Green Corps program, which was established in 1996. I saw the evidence of that and what a huge impact it made not just to the environment but to the lives of many people who participated and who then went further and continued their studies in this area or went on to technical and training education or to university education.


Over the life of the Green Corps program, participants delivered the following outcomes: they propagated and planted more than 14 million trees, they erected more than 8,000 kilometres of fencing, they cleared more than 50,000 hectares of weeds and they constructed or maintained more than 5,000 kilometres of walking track or boardwalks.


The Abbott government's approach can be contrasted quite starkly with those on the other side. Under Labor's watch, and solely on the basis of small-minded political reasons, the Howard government's Green Corps program was torn apart, was rebadged and it failed to improve the environment. Then it was terminated in 2012. Young people no longer had the opportunity to gain practical skills and to improve their local environment. But then again, no-one really should have been surprised. After all, Labor's approach to the environment is to hit families, businesses and the economy with a carbon tax. The carbon tax is an attack on the entire Australian economy. What is worse is that it does not even work. Despite a $7.6 billion tax, emissions for the first 12 months barely changed by 0.1 per cent.


The Abbott government will provide $300 million over four years, and a further $222 million in 2017-18 and $289.2 million in 2018-19 to establish the Green Army. The measure was announced in the 2013-14 MYEFO. The request for tender will be released shortly. The request for tender will be open for tender applications for at least four weeks. The Australian government will be running sessions for potential tenderers, and details of these sessions will be provided as part of the RFT.


The key components to the program will be that service providers will be contracted by the Australian government to engage the Green Army teams, deliver training and wage payments, manage activities to ensure projects are completed and report regularly on progress. There will be project sponsors, and they will be organisations such as local councils, community groups or natural resource management organisations that will develop project proposals. The sponsors will submit proposals to the Australian government through an application round. They will be assessed, and recommendations will be made to the Minister for the Environment for successful projects in each round.


Then, of course, there are the wonderful participants themselves. The Green Army Program will target participants aged between 17 and 24. Participants may be Indigenous people, school leavers, gap-year students, graduates and the unemployed. The program in future years will expand to people of all ages.


Unlike previous programs that were rushed through with unholy haste by the previous Labor government, the work, health and safety of Green Army participants is of particular importance to the Abbott government. The Department of the Environment will work with the service providers on an agreed risk-management framework for the delivery of this project. They will be informed by the experience of the Department of Employment and external expertise relating to work, health and safety issues.


Service providers will be required to work with the project sponsors on risk plans for each individual project. They will regularly report to the Australian government on the management of participants and project delivery, and audit and compliance schemes will manage any contractual breaches.


In addition to the on-the-job training, a key element of the program is the provision of opportunities for vocationally-oriented accredited training delivered by registered training organisations under the Australian Qualifications Framework. Training may be undertaken in areas such as work readiness, conservation, land management, heritage conservation, leadership, project and human resource management and trades. As such, on-the-job training activities need not be exclusively outdoors. The service providers will be responsible for ensuring that the training satisfies the requirements under the Australian Qualifications Framework in a format that best meets the need of each of the participants.


An individual training plan will be negotiated with each participant. Participants will be given an opportunity to undertake training for a certificate I or certificate II qualification or nationally endorsed skill sets.


Training in first aid and work, health and safety must all be completed by the participants prior to the commencement of Green Army activities. The participants without these basic training requirements must not commence project activities until they complete the relevant training.


In terms of funding that will be provided to the project sponsors proposing Green Army projects, the Green Army Program provides costs to support the Green Army teams that will be undertaking the project activities. The particular sponsors will be expected to provide specific equipment, materials and expertise to deliver the Green Army projects. No cash funding will be provided to the project sponsors. It is really important to note that the Green Army Program is an environmental programme and not considered an employment program. The engagement of a participant in a Green Army team for 20-26 weeks is not considered full-time employment. It is a voluntary opt-in program where participants will receive work-like experience and will be paid an allowance that is higher than income support, such as youth allowance or Newstart allowance.


The approach of not paying superannuation is consistent with the previous approach used for the Green Corps programs. It is consistent with the approach applied for income-support recipients undertaking existing approved programs of work activities, such as the Work for the Dole and the Remote Jobs and Communities Program.


The Green Army Program will be considered an approved program of work of participants who elect to stay on income support. Minister Hunt is to be congratulated on this bill. He has a big job unravelling the mess left behind by six years of Labor in office, but he has hit the ground running and this bill is ample proof of his application to the task.


I look forward to seeing the wonderful benefits of the Green Army projects he has approved for my electorate.

Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga) (13:30):  I am pleased to rise to speak about a remarkable boy, Connor McLeod, from Oakhurst in Sydney. Connor, his mum, Ally, and the member for Chifley came to see me this week with their idea to introduce tactile bank notes to Australia. 


Connor is visually impaired. He told me about the significant difference tactile banknotes would make in his life. He is frequently forced to pay for things using only coins because these are easier to distinguish. Connor told me how he received money from his relatives for Christmas last year but was unable to determine for himself how generous his relatives had been. Tactile banknotes would make a major difference to the lives of more than 300,000 Australians with a visual impairment. Connor showed me an example of a tactile banknote from Canada. Many other countries have adopted tactile banknotes. It is possible.


I urge the government to instruct the Reserve Bank of Australia to introduce tactile banknotes to Australia as soon as possible. Most Australians take for granted the ability to tell the difference between banknotes. Visually impaired Australians deserve to be as independent as they possibly can be. I will continue to work with Connor and his mother, Ally, to make sure this important advance for visually impaired Australians becomes a reality.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Prime Minister) (14:00):  If I may, I will give the House a brief update on ill-fated flight MH370. As members may have noticed, based on the accumulation of evidence, late last night Prime Minister Najib Razak of Malaysia declared that the plane must be presumed lost in the southern Indian Ocean. That means that what up until now has been a search moves into a recovery and investigation phase. I have this morning spoken to Prime Minister Najib Razak. I have offered Malaysia—as the country legally responsible for this—every assistance and cooperation from Australia.


This plane is lost in one of the most inaccessible parts of our globe. It is a long way from anywhere. But the closest land is Australia, and we are the best placed country to assist. It is highly likely that in coming days and weeks many of the relatives of passengers on ill-fated flight 370 will wish to come to Australia. I want them all to know that should they come here they will be in the arms of a decent country. I should also let the House know that the government has decided to waive visa fees for any relatives wishing to come to Australia. I should at this point express my condolences and the House's condolences regarding the Australian passengers on that flight, and I propose that we might have a formal condolence motion for them tomorrow.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (14:02):  I rise to associate the opposition with the remarks of the Prime Minister. Our thoughts today are with all the families and friends of the passengers and crew of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. The pain of not knowing what has happened to one's family has now given way to the agony of loss. We too offer our sympathies to all of those whose worst fears have been realised. These matters are never easy to deal with, but to have to wear a very public loss when perhaps you would seek to mourn in peace and privacy must have been very difficult. The disappearance of MH370 is a mystery that has captured global attention. Unlike perhaps some disasters that occur around the world, because all of the citizens of the world fly, this disaster is one that touches all of us.


Australia can be rightly proud of the leading effort it has played in the international search effort. Our service men and women have taken on an extremely difficult task with determination and dedication. This search has brought nations together. Australia is proud of the Australian contribution, and I believe the world is grateful to them. We may never know the full story of MH370, but we do know that there will be families consumed by grief today and in the years to come. Our hearts go out to them.

"Bowen, Chris, MP",ALP,2014-03-25,"



Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (15:45):  Of all the policy mistakes of this new government it is hard to find a worse example of policy dysfunction, of policy on the run and of policy that will put ordinary Australians in danger of grave financial loss than the debacle that is this government's changes to financial advice. These changes are the brainchild of the now departed Assistant Treasurer—the Assistant Treasurer who has been stood aside. He is responsible for their design and for their implementation.


There was a glimmer of hope last week, when the Assistant Treasurer stood aside, that maybe sanity would prevail. We thought that maybe a new minister might step in and undo the Assistant Treasurer's changes. But yesterday we saw an article, in the Financial Review, which said that the government was going to 'aggressively defend' its financial advice changes. The article was entitled:


Cormann grabs his FoFA laws from fallen Sinodinos.


It gets better. There is a very large opinion piece on the inside-back page defending the changes to financial advice. You can see it in the copy I am holding. I thought—



An opposition member interjecting— 




Mr BOWEN:
  They are still on there! This was yesterday. That policy position did not last the day, because around five o'clock the Minister for Finance announced that he was freezing the changes. What a difference a day makes!




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order! The member for McMahon will not use props. He knows it is disorderly. I will have to deal with him if he does not desist from using props.




Mr BOWEN:
  I was just ensuring that the House was aware of Senator Cormann's statements, Mr Deputy Speaker. We need to establish what actually went on yesterday. I think we know what went on. It was that during the day the Minister for Finance actually started to understand his own policy. I think he actually started to get what was going on. He certainly did not understand it in the morning, because he took to Twitter, the old finance minister, and said:


Our FOFA reforms do not re-introduce commissions.


He also said:


You should read my piece in AFR. Decision to pause regs taken last Friday.


I will deal with the last part first. It is a very strange media management strategy to take a decision on Friday to pause a government policy, be out defending it on the front page of the Financial Review and writing op-eds in its defence on Monday. It is a very strange media strategy, indeed.


I will turn to the substance. He said:


Our FoFA reforms do not reintroduce commissions.


That is pretty clear. I would have thought it pretty clear that commissions were being reintroduced, but maybe I misunderstood. We will go to what other people think. What does Alan Kohler think? He says:


… Minister, you are reintroducing sales commissions for general advice. The proposed amendment, and Coalition policy, is perfectly clear on that score.


Mr Kohler is correct. But it is not just Mr Kohler who thinks that. The people who actually know something about financial planning—that would be the financial planners—think commissions are being under government policy. And they do not like it. They do not support the reintroduction of commissions. On 19 March, the chair of the Financial Planning Association put out a bulletin to his members. He said, 'There is one glaring change which has been heavily lobbied for that we cannot support—the so-called general advice exemption. The Financial Planning Association strongly opposes the payment of commissions under general exemption. This is a retrograde policy that would allow remuneration by commission on the sale of investment and superannuation products to Australian consumers and to open the door to a bygone era of mis-selling and inappropriate advice.




Mr Van Manen:
  Rubbish!




Mr BOWEN:
  Rubbish, says the member for Forde. The financial planners do not know about financial planning, says the member for Forde! They do not understand what this policy does. The member for Forde should get his facts straight, as should the Minister for Finance. Very clearly this policy reintroduces commissions, and very clearly this is a retrograde step.


It is not just about general advice; it is about personal advice. Their changes reintroduce commissions on personal advice. The Minister for Finance says, 'Well, no, they could introduce bonuses if you happen to sell a lot of products. That is not a commission.' Apparently that is not a commission. If it walks like a commission and talks like a commission, guess what? It is a commission. The Minister for Finance slowly worked this out during the course of yesterday. It slowly dawned on him what his policy actually was. By five o'clock he had decided that he could not proceed with this policy at this point.


This would be amusing if it wasn't so serious. But there is a lot at stake here. These reforms were introduced in response to a catastrophe for Australia's investors, a catastrophe for normal investors who were following the advice of financial planners. Tomorrow is the fifth anniversary of the collapse of Storm Financial. What an arrogant sense of irony it takes for this government to rip up changes to financial laws that provide protection to ordinary investors right across the country on the fifth anniversary of the collapse of Storm Financial. It was not just Storm Financial that led the previous government to make these changes. There was Trio. The member for Cunningham and the member for Throsby, in particular, remember the damage caused to their communities by the collapse of Trio. The Minister for Finance indicated before the election that he would consider compensation for those people.



Ms Bird interjecting—




Mr BOWEN:
  In fact, they are going the other way, as the member for Cunningham correctly points out. We had the collapse of Westpoint, based in Western Australia, in which 4,300 investors, primarily Western Australians lost $310 million. Why were they investing, by and large, in Westpoint? Because their financial advisers told them it was a good investment—they advised them to invest in Westpoint.


Why would anybody advise that an investment in what was in effect a Ponzi scheme was a good idea? The commissions being paid for the advice to invest in Westpoint amounted, on average, to 10 per cent of the amount invested. This government thinks that is just fine. This government wants to bring back laws which will enable that to happen, and that is nothing short of a disgrace. In the Westpoint case, ASIC concluded that advisers had 'negligently advised Group Members to invest in certain Westpoint products and engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct.' The vast majority of Australia's financial planners are very professional people who give very good advice. But, Australian consumers deserve protection from those who are not. The Prime Minister, in response, said on 17 March:


It is a given of ethical practice if you are a professional that you are taking the best interests of your client, your patient, your customer into account and regulatory burdens around what are ethical givens are, I think, a classic case of regulatory overkill.


Well, the Prime Minister should face the victims of Trio, the victims of Westpoint and the victims of Storm and tell them that this is regulatory overreach; tell them that these reforms go too far. They know, more than anybody else, why these reforms were introduced and they know why this government is wrong. When you have a government which has got it so wrong that the Financial Planning Association, Choice and National Seniors have all said they have gone too far, then they know that they have a problem. Choice CEO Alan Kirkland said: 


It’s important to remember that the need for widespread reform followed the catastrophic effects of major financial advice scandals … These are the problems that FoFA was designed to fix, and we urge the Government to reconsider its changes.


Michael O'Neill, National Seniors Australia CEO, said:


If cutting red tape means creating a murky environment in which the hard-earned savings of working Australians end up in the hands of financial advisers, you can leave it


People are onto this government. What is particularly galling about this government's approach is the dodgy and sneaky way they have gone about doing it. There is a way you can change the law in Australia and it is called the parliament—you introduce legislation, you go through a parliamentary process and you put the legislation before a committee. What did the former Assistant Treasurer seek to do? He tried to introduce these changes by regulation and, what is worse, he was proposing to introduce the regulation on a Thursday afternoon, after the House had risen, and the parliament could not disallow it for six weeks. What a dodgy and sneaky way to go about the administration of this nation. 


It is just as well that the Minister for Finance has stepped back and paused these reforms. If the Minister for Finance thinks that he can get away with putting off these reforms off until 5 April and continue their dodgy and sneaky approach and mislead the people of Western Australia, he is wrong.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2014-03-25,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (15:55):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance about investor protections for consumers seeking financial advice. Our Future of Financial Advice reforms will make financial advice more accessible and more affordable. Let us be clear about exactly what the coalition is doing and why things have been put on hold for now. But, first, we can take on board some of things the experts have to say about this delay. The Financial Services Council, which represents wealth managers, says that the break will help the government better communicate the changes. Its chief executive, John Brogden—a good man—supports the delay and says he will use it to lobby for a better outcome. Industry Super Australia chief executive, David Whiteley, also welcomes the delay, and the seniors' consumer group, the Council on the Ageing, also welcome the decision. Ian Yates, chief executive of COTA Australia, says 'retirees cannot afford poor financial advice.' Frankly, there was a lot of hysteria about what people thought was in the legislation but here we have industry experts saying that the delay is a good thing. We heard the member for McMahon raving on about the government being dodgy and sneaky. We are not dodgy and sneaky. We consult and we take on board what stakeholders tell us. That is one of the reasons why these reforms have been put on hold for now. 


We are not proposing to water down important protections. Reducing the compliance and regulatory burden for the financial advice sector, as for all sectors, has always been a top priority for the coalition. All these reforms to FoFA were clearly outlined prior to the last election. We released our detail and our comprehensive plan to boost productivity and reduce red tape in July last year, more than three months before the election. The coalition's concerns with the current laws go back to 2012 when these laws were first introduced. The coalition participated in the Senate inquiry and wrote a dissenting report. There was nothing dodgy and sneaky there. We committed to implementing all 16 recommendations of the dissenting report, if we won government. It might be news to those opposite that we did win government on 7 September. They seem to deny it, but it was us who won. The FoFA bill before the parliament, which is currently being considered by a Senate committee, was put out for consultation in the form of an exposure draft, and the bill reflects this. Particularly in relation to this policy we have been as accountable, transparent, open and consultative as any government could be. 


We have been clear that a better balance needs to be struck. Some of the specific measures outlined in our FoFA changes included clarifying and not removing the catch-all best interests duty. The catch-all best interests duty as proposed by Labor led to uncertainty and confusion amongst advisers. Advisers would not know, under Labor's rules, whether or not their advice satisfied the best interests duty. The coalition is simply looking to remove the catch-all requirement in order to give the adviser confidence that their advice is compliant and will be in the best interests of their clients. We are removing the opt-in requirement, which forces clients to complete unnecessary paperwork—Labor loves paperwork—every two years simply to continue their arrangements with their financial advisers. The government will also streamline the current requirement so that fee disclosure statements need to be provided only to new clients. Under Labor's proposals, advisers were required to provide such statements for all of their clients, going back indefinitely—more paperwork which would undoubtedly put a significant financial burden on financial advisers. 


We are cutting through the regulation; cutting through the red tape. A good regulatory regime is one in which those being regulated know what compliance looks like. You should not need a law degree or a tome on regulation to know your requirements and you should not need to look over your shoulder every time you sit down to conduct legitimate business. But those opposite do not understand business—they do not get it. The changes we are proposing—which were well-known and flagged well before the last election—are very pragmatic and well considered. Labor did not want to do a cost-benefit analysis because it knew it would not add up—I do not think that Labor knows what a cost-benefit analysis actually is.


Former Prime Minister Gillard gave the Leader of the Opposition, then Assistant Treasurer, an exemption from having to rigorously assess the costs and benefits of Labor's FoFA reforms. No scrutiny, no accountability, just full steam ahead—wham, bam, in you go. It is just like with the National Broadband Network, and we are now cleaning up the mess of that monumental disaster and trying to deliver the NBN sensibly and sustainably. It is just like the recent capability review of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which revealed that Labor stubbornly pressed ahead, ignoring the recommendations of the Productivity Commission.


We have a number of very valid concerns with FoFA which we are seeking to address. The changes that we have flagged will certainly do just that. Under Labor's FoFA reforms, the up-front implementation costs to industry are conservatively estimated to be well in excess of $1 billion, with ongoing annual costs of at least $350 million. This is simply ludicrous. The current FoFA laws simply go too far, imposing excessive regulatory burdens on advisers, at huge cost to clients but for limited benefit to everyone. 


It is worth noting that these laws would have never prevented a Storm Financial collapse. So, not only do these changes fail to achieve one of their main objectives; they also impose significant red tape and costs, which will hurt the industry and ultimately prohibit ordinary mum and dad investors or retirees from accessing affordable financial advice. 


The government acknowledges that there is inherent risk involved in investing in financial markets and in financial products. Of course, we are committed to maintaining confidence in the sector and ensuring that consumers are adequately protected. However, Labor's FoFA laws just went too far. They do not strike a balance; they tip the scales. Consumers and the industry are equally the losers, and they know it. They are wise to this Labor opposition. 


The government is quite sensible in drawing breath on the planned FoFA regulations. The minister has taken the right approach in postponing these reforms. Minister Cormann is precisely right to do just what he did yesterday. Given the complexity and the level of detail contained in the regulations, and the ongoing confusion and uncertainty by many in our community in relation to these reforms, this pause will give Minister Cormann the opportunity to undertake consultations with relevant stakeholders in good faith. Labor could never locate the pause button; they could only ever locate fast forward in relation to any legislation that they introduced over the last six years. That is why it is so important that we as a government are doing things pragmatically, methodically and sensibly. 


During the last six years, those opposite just rushed everything through without any thought about its possible implications. Labor lurched from one policy disaster to another: between pink batts and overpriced school halls, between boat arrivals and the broken carbon tax promise. The coalition is actually committed to methodically and calmly implementing the agenda that we took to the people last September and is delivering on our commitments to the Australian people. 


The coalition is absolutely committed to delivering these FoFA reforms, but we want to bring the people with us. We do not want to have policy by social media or to have policy by knee-jerk reactions—like those opposite did whilst they were in government under Rudd, then Gillard and then Rudd again. We do not change government policies in response to a television show, as with the live cattle fiasco, or to a Facebook post—we can only think of the supertrawler fiasco. We do not switch leaders. We do not haphazardly switch leaders in response to opinion polls. There is one opinion poll that matters and it was taken on 7 September last year. The voters voted overwhelmingly to put the coalition—the sensible people in politics—back into power. As I say, there is one opinion poll which Labor should listen to and that was the result of last year's election. The people spoke and the people now want the mandate that they gave to the coalition to be enacted. They want the Senate to get out of the way and remove the mining tax and the carbon tax, which are destroying Western Australia. The people in Western Australia can certainly get on board on 5 April and vote in the Nationals through Shane Van Styn and certainly the Liberals.


We will not be lectured by those opposite about financial management or financial priorities. Those opposite left us with $123 billion in deficits and, if left unchecked, $667 billion in debt, so they cannot lecture us about financial reforms. The International Monetary Fund survey found that Australia topped the list of 17 countries, with the largest increase in expenditure. How dare those opposite lecture us on financial performance. The IMF also reported that Australia has the third-highest growth in debt of any nation in the top 17 countries. What a disgrace Labor has left us. What an absolute mess we have inherited, but we will fix it up. You can laugh all you like, member for Fraser, but we will fix it up because we are the mature, sensible and methodical people in this parliament.


These reforms came on the back of Labor imposing a job-destroying carbon tax and a farcical mining tax which raised hardly a dollar, yet which Labor precommitted $16 billion worth of spending against. What a disgrace! When these FoFA reforms are ready, after we have taken due consultation with the people, they will certainly be brought in, but not until they are properly planned and properly thought out. Those opposite should take a lesson from how we do things.

Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley) (16:05):  Tomorrow is the fifth anniversary of the collapse of Storm Financial. It is the fifth anniversary of thousands of ordinary investors losing their life savings, many of them left with no opportunity to start again. It is important to keep this in mind as we consider the government's extraordinary and shambolic attempts at dismantling Labor's Future of Financial Advice laws. When it comes to financial advice, it is the classic story of David and Goliath: the consumers and retirees versus the big banks and institutions in the race to access the growing pile of $1.8 trillion in retirement savings and the many billions of dollars in fees and charges that brings in. It is a lot of money straight out of the accounts of ordinary retail clients who can least afford it, but it is never enough for the big end of town, who want more. To make matters worse, it is not just the fees and charges up for the taking; it is the culture it breeds of selling products instead of the more honourable task of actually providing quality advice and the impact that may have over a lifetime of saving for retirement.


No matter how hard they press the pause button, the government and the new minister replacing the former Assistant Treasurer Arthur Sinodinos will not alter the fear and uncertainty created by the proposals to roll back the FoFA laws—laws that only came into full effect nine months ago and have barely had time to be fully appreciated by the sector or the consumer. This comes after business models have changed and systems have been updated and modernised. Given either the complete misunderstanding by the minister of his own legislation and new regulations, or the minister's hope that no-one will read what the proposed legislation actually states in black and white, let us clear up a few details. Commissions are squarely back on the table, best interest survives in name only and a sales focus on financial products is the new push, with costs foisted onto retirees while the sector gets to pocket a few extra dollars in cost reductions as well as reaping hundreds of millions in extra charges. 


Claims by the minister that this is all about efficiency, transparency and competition are laughable. Paragraph 2.27 of their proposed changes to fee disclosure statements explicitly details that a change to the existing fees charged, the terms of the agreement, or if the provider changes ownership, will not constitute a new arrangement and therefore no disclosure is required. That is a lot of change right there that blows a hole in the minister's transparency argument and in the pockets of retirees and consumers, and here the central problem remains that none of us get a choice.


When we consider commissions, page 28 of the explanatory memorandum of the bill sets out that commissions can be paid for general advice and provides the clarity the minister refers to on how it is done. Unfortunately for investors, the goal posts are set so wide you could drive a truck through them literally sideways. The minister claims that conflicted remuneration for personal advice is still banned. But this is not correct at all, because the proposed changes alter the definition of what is not considered conflicted remuneration on personal advice to include volume-based sales bonuses when they are part of a balanced scorecard approach. The minister can try all the tricks or call it what you will but it just does not pass the pub test. Providing quality personal advice and getting paid a sales volume bonus or a commission are incompatible. 


One of the most important parts of FoFA are the best interest obligations through the safe harbour provisions in section 961B that provide a range of tests to ensure a balanced approach, with best interest part G being the catch-all provision that ties it all together and makes sense of going beyond the flick-through, simple, tick-a-box compliance cop out. This provision, perhaps more than any other, is driving a cultural change in the industry and lifting the standard of quality advice—something the sector wants and something the sector has been asking for for perhaps more than a decade. It is hard to explain why the minister thinks it is acceptable to remove a provision that a provider should take 'any other step that would reasonably be regarded as being in the best interest of the client'—and yet it is specifically removed by the minister. It might be fair to say that every once in a while the little guy gets a small win, even if only a temporary pause, while the question remains as to what caused the minister to stumble and rethink.


The government's FoFA roll-back process has been in shambles from the beginning and is now in disarray, with no-one sure of what happens next, not even the minister. The answer is clear, though. When you realise that you are travelling down a one-way street the wrong way, the best policy is to pause, think, and then turn around. This government has absolutely got it wrong on dismantling FoFA and the consumer protections that it provides, and there is no-one left that supports the government on these changes. Whether it is that over the weekend that changed the minister's mind or the Western Australian elections, I do not care.

"Taylor, Angus, MP",LP,2014-03-25,"



Mr TAYLOR
 (Hume) (16:10):  Only the Labor Party could believe that they know how to define professionalism, and only Labor could think it wise to legislate every aspect of a professional's behaviour. Perhaps this is because of their own failures of professionalism which are so widespread. Indeed the failures of professionalism amongst union officials have been truly extraordinary. But I have bad news for those on the other side of the House: the character and conduct of a professional cannot be defined by legislation that regulates every aspect of their behaviour. 


The overriding requirement for all professionals is that they act in the best interest of their clients. I have spent 20 years working in management consulting and I know this. Every professional knows that conflicts of interest emerge almost every day, and no set of rules will ever resolve those conflicts. Whether it is the temptation to sell unnecessary time to clients or to try to sell them the wrong product or service, there are myriad reasons to do wrong. Professionalism takes common sense and a mindset which puts the clients' interests above all else. 


Those of us—particularly on this side of the House—who have worked as professionals over long periods of time have learnt those skills and that mindset, but the truth is that you cannot legislate for every circumstance. It is no secret that financial planners have a less-than-ideal reputation in the public eye at times—they could take a little advice themselves and work on their PR. That said, the government is not about legislating to try and abolish all poor advice—you simply a cannot do it. The very whiff of an adviser taking a commission for a sale that goes against sound financial advice is wrong on anyone's ledger, but similar issues exist in all professions and you cannot—I repeat, cannot—legislate against all bad behaviour because there are too many ways to behave badly if you have built trust with a client.


Time and time again we see that Labor thinks it can legislate its way to nirvana, whether it is 18C, FoFA reforms or the 50,000 pages of legislation we have been left to repeal, but their attempt to control, you, me and every other Australian will never cease. From this starting point, the government is making amendments to existing FoFA laws. 


In recent weeks, there has been either deliberate or misguided smearing of the government's objectives in reference to the reforms. It is worth restating what we are not doing. We are not repealing the FoFA laws; we are improving them. We are not getting rid of the best-interest duty, the most important part of this legislation; we are ensuring there is certainty about the obligations facing financial advisers to act in the best interests of their clients. That is sacrosanct. We are not reintroducing product specific sales commissions for financial advisers; that is totally misleading. The government is not reintroducing sales commissions, as I said; incentives for volume sales that do not conflict with sound advice from a financial adviser should be permissible. That is all we are saying.


The government is wholly committed to protecting consumers, but we do not need Labor's legislation to do this. In principle, we support the underlying goals of the FoFA reforms, but Labor's FoFA laws were bad for consumers. They went too far and they will cost too much. Do not just take our word for it. Listen to the Chief Executive of the AMP, Craig Meller. He says:


Some of the issues with the legislation as it went through first time added an awful lot of bureaucracy to the system and made it difficult for providers to work out exactly whether something was in someone's best interests or not.


He goes on to say:


We think the policy adjustments proposed by the new government significantly reduce red tape and make it much clearer to Australians and their advisers that the advice being given is absolutely in their best interests. We're very much supportive and in agreement with the changes that the government is proposing. 


Thank you, Mr Meller. We agree.


What this country needs now, what our consumers need now, is more freedom to move, not more regulation. The government has undertaken extensive consultation on the FoFA bill, and the bill reflects the feedback we have received. In the interests of consumers, the government is committed to amending the FoFA legislation to reduce costs and to make financial advice more affordable for all Australians. These are fine goals, and I support them wholeheartedly.

"MacTiernan, Alannah, MP",ALP,2014-03-25,"



Ms MacTIERNAN
 (Perth) (16:15):  I do not think anyone should be surprised that we see the Liberal government trying to unwind these important consumer protections in the finance area, because the Liberal Party has extraordinary form in betraying small investors while protecting their mates. And West Australians, of all people, are acutely aware of that, having been on the receiving end of unscrupulous conduct from finance scammers and having witnessed the blatant refusal of Liberal governments—both state and federal—to take action. And now we see that the Liberal government is trying to undo the good work that was done by a Labor government.


I want to take you back to something that is still very present in the minds of Western Australians—the finance brokers' scandal of the late 1990s. I first alerted the WA parliament to this systematic abuse of the pooled mortgage schemes in Western Australia in, I think, around 1999. Week after week for two years we were explaining and exposing in parliament and through the media the profound consequences that were occurring from the failure of the then-Court government to regulate what was going on with a range of finance professionals engaged in what can only be described as a great fraud. It was a fraud that saw many, many thousands of Western Australians—self-funded retirees, families—lose almost their entire life savings. And day after day we would get the same response that we have got here—that people need the freedom, that it is 'buyer beware', that we do not need to do anything about that. The finance broking industry in Western Australia had very powerful friends in the Court government, and they simply refused to act.


What we finally saw with the state election in 2001 was the minister who was leading the charge lose his seat and indeed the Court government lose the election. So scandalous was that behaviour, so scandalous was their refusal and failure to act that this ended up in a royal commission. The taxpayers of Western Australia ended up paying tens of millions of dollars in compensation. Quite clearly there was a major regulatory failure.


In Western Australia we had a heightened sensitivity to this, so when we saw a new scheme developing in 2002 we were very concerned. This was a mezzanine finance scheme—one that has been described here today as something of a Ponzi scheme. The first company to be involved in this was Westminster Finance. Basically investors thought they had an investment secured by property. They did not. In August 2002, the consumer protection department wrote to ASIC, and it also raised it at ministerial meetings.  It was trying to get action. But nothing happened. They could not get the federal government or federal agencies to act. So in May 2003, the then minister for consumer protection, John Kobelke, wrote to his counterpart, Senator Ian Campbell, who was Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, alerting him to this particular problem. I will just quote John here, because it really goes to the heart of it:




I expressed concern at the level of risk posed to inexperienced investors, many of whom are self-funded retirees who were 
approached by the company. The fact that the company was soliciting people to invest in it was a new element





that I will expand upon in a moment.



Accordingly, he went and raised with Senator Campbell the need for urgent action. Nothing happened. So in June he wrote again and said, 'We have received your letter, but this requires urgent attention.' And over the following years the department of consumer protection continued to take this matter up, and nothing happened. Then in 2006, lo and behold, the whole scheme collapsed. You must take responsibility for it—you have form on this matter. (Time expired)

"Van Manen, Bert, MP",LP,2014-03-25,"



Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (16:20):  It is interesting when we have been talking about the financial planning industry today that there have been all sorts of references to finance brokers and others who are not even covered by this legislation, so it is wonderful to see that, again, Labor is on the job and actually knows what it is talking about—not!


Let us have a look at the proposed changes and some of the history of FoFA, because I think it is important to reflect on that. In its original form, FoFA was designed to improve the trust and confidence of Australian retail investors in the financial advice industry, which I think is a very noble goal, and we support that fully on this side of the House. That goal was to be achieved by specifically tackling conflicts of interest that were seen to pervade the financial planning industry at that point in time. The government supports the principles of FoFA but has concerns about the regulatory burden imposed on the financial planning industry. And we have seen from feedback from the industry that they were looking at costs of some $90 million per year in implementation costs and another $190 million in further savings. When speaking to local financial planners, they have assured me that these cost savings will be passed on to their customers. I was speaking to one of our local planners this afternoon, and he made the point to me that one of the by-products of the current FoFA regime is that some 10 per cent of potential clients are declining advice because of cost. In an area like Beenleigh this is a significant concern as many of these people actually need assistance and advice.


The sad thing about this is that it is the very thing the FoFA regulations promoted by the previous government were supposed to deal with. They were supposed to make it more cost effective for people. As usual with what the previous government has put in place, the reality ends up being far from what was originally envisaged.


I also took the opportunity to speak to others in the financial planning industry to seek feedback on their views on these proposed changed. One of the key points they make with respect to these proposals is that they will provide clarity in regard to the provisions relating to the best interests of clients. We as a government see no reason whatsoever to water those down, but we do see great value in ensuring clarity so that both planners and clients understand what they are being protected for. In their view, the objective of these changes will place the financial planning profession on an equal footing with other professions, such as solicitors, doctors and accountants.


There are also claims by some that the proposed changes will result in another Storm Financial type of collapse. There is nothing in FoFA, or these proposed changes, that would result in the protection of another Storm Financial collapse. That is ASIC's responsibility, and ASIC needs to shoulder some of the responsibility for what has happened in this industry due to their not enforcing regulations that are already in place.


I have also had feedback from industry that the present FoFA laws have also created confusion. For example, advisors report that when they send out the fee disclosure statements some clients see that as a bill and have actually sent in a cheque, without realising it was just a statement for fees and services that have already been paid. Further, some of the over-the-top negativity from certain stakeholders with vested interests in this sector has certainly not helped with this confusion and uncertainty.


As we sit down to look at the shambles left by those opposite, we see that it is only this government that can start to sort out this mess. Only we can provide clarity for the long-term future of not only the financial planning industry but more importantly for the millions of Australians who will require that advice as their superannuation and other investment balances continue to grow, thanks to our wonderful superannuation system. I fully support the changes that we are bringing to provide that clarity and certainty to everyone in our community.

"Watts, Tim, MP",ALP,2014-03-25,"



Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (16:25):  A core role of government is to protect the vulnerable members of our community. It is to ensure that people placed in a vulnerable situation are not exploited by those they seek advice from. A key example of one of these vulnerable situations is the provision of financial services. Most Australians seeking to invest their money are not used to the ups and downs of the financial market. They need independent, impartial advice on where their money is best placed so they can enjoy a secure future.


When advisers are incentivised through targets and commissions to recommend a certain financial product, despite the product's quality, it is hard for this independent advice to occur. In these circumstances there is a considerable risk of exploitation of these vulnerable investors. We saw this occur recently with the collapse of Storm Financial and other investment companies, where the savings of thousands of Australians around the country was lost as the questionable financial instruments they had invested in collapsed.


After the global financial crisis it was recognised that protections needed to be put in place for these vulnerable investors, so the previous Labor government initiated a parliamentary inquiry into financial advice, products and services. This inquiry produced the Future of Financial Advice Act to strengthen the protections for inexperienced investors. FoFA required that advisers providing personal financial advice must act in the best interest of their client. It required advisers to ask their clients to 'opt in' if they wished to receive ongoing service every two years. Most importantly it put a ban on conflicted remuneration. This meant that advisers selling a certain financial product were not able to receive a commission for the sale of that product to the investor. This ensured that financial investors would provide the impartial advice that retail investors so badly needed.


The Abbott government has wasted no time in attempting to role back these crucial protections for consumers who are seeking financial advice. Their attempts so far have been a classic example of how not to execute legislative change. This demonstrates to the Australian people once again the inability of the Abbott government to switch from opposition to government.


Firstly, they announced in the last few days before Christmas that they would make changes to the legislation. Like many Abbott government policy moves, this was done without any consultation with interested stakeholders. They did it without talking about the changes with consumer groups, or industry groups, or seniors groups. Clearly, former Assistant Treasurer Arthur Sinodinos pled that consulting his previous colleagues in the banking world was sufficient. Nothing else was needed to strip protections away from a vulnerable group of investors.


The Abbott government pulled out the usual tactic in relation to this legislation, which was to not talk about it in the hope nobody would notice it until it was passed. They did not count on the community backlash from industry experts, consumer advocates, seniors groups, and previous victims of dodgy financial practises, who all condemned the governments actions. Even those within their own party disowned the reforms.


Peter Collins, the former leader of the New South Wales Liberal Party, and now the head of Industry Super Australia, was unequivocal in condemning these proposed changes. As pressure from the community mounted we saw the response of the Abbott government shift back and forth, from supporting the changes to abandoning them, with the schizophrenic attitude of a government that just does not know how to govern.


The former Assistant Treasurer Arthur Sinodinos was asked to resign, as his failure to answer questions in the Senate became a thorn in the Abbott government's side.



Government members interjecting—


A government member:  He asked to resign.




Mr WATTS:
  Feel free to clarify: has he resigned or not? The Abbott government took this as an opportunity to use Minister Mathias Cormann to push the changes once more. It was reported to the Australian Financial Review only yesterday that the Abbott government would:


… aggressively defend its ambitious unwinding of Labor's future of financial advice (FoFA) laws …


Minister Cormann even wrote an editorial in the Financial Review expanding the merits of its recent reforms. The next day the attitude of the Abbott government had changed completely. The Financial Review reported this morning that the Abbott government:


… has frozen plans to immediately implement changes to laws banning commissions for financial advisers …


This was in direct contrast to Minister Cormann's statement on Twitter yesterday, when he claimed that this freeze had been in the work since Friday of last week. I find it unlikely that nobody in his office could get to the article before Monday to prevent his valiant defence of the FoFA reforms being printed. This is if we are charitable, and assume the op-ed was not written after he had allegedly 'changed his mind'.


The Abbott government's eleventh-hour decision to freeze the changes in the FoFA act shows that they are a government that do not know how to govern. They think a three-word slogan, not stakeholder consultation, is what is needed to form government policy. When these policies do not hold up in the harsh light of day, the cohesion of the Abbott government crumbles under pressure. The Prime Minister needs to take responsibility for the botched way this policy has been handled. He needs to acknowledge to the Australian people that these reforms are both unwelcome and have been badly run. The Abbott government should not just freeze these reforms; they should throw them on the same bonfire that they claim to be throwing red tape onto in Australia and put an end to them once and for all.

Mr SUKKAR
 (Deakin) (16:30):  It is disappointing to see members opposite engaging in this overblown rhetoric and hyperbole. We saw it from the member for McMahon at the beginning of the MPI. I can understand that the member for McMahon would have been very embarrassed by his two very ordinary questions in question time and probably sought to atone for that, but I think we just need to settle the debate and talk about the facts.


We are not proposing to repeal protections here. We are improving these rules in line with our election commitments, and 2014 is the year when the coalition government will deliver on each of those commitments that we made prior to the election. We are not proposing to get rid of the requirement that financial advisers act in the best interest of their clients—quite the contrary. As members on this side have said earlier today, we are focusing on the fiduciary duty that financial advisers owe their clients. It is very heroic for any government to assume that they can look into a crystal ball and see what each possible problem may be between a financial adviser and their client. But if we focus on the fiduciary duty that applies, and that is that the financial adviser always acts in the best interests of their client, then that is a good place to start.


We are not proposing to reintroduce commissions or other conflicted remuneration structures. That is just wrong, so the overblown rhetoric of those opposite is going to blow up in their faces, because when the facts come to light, as the review will ensure happens, all of the inaccuracies propagated by those opposite will come to light. Instead, we are restoring a level playing field across the whole financial services market, ensuring that everyday consumers of financial advice can continue to access robust financial advice, personal to their own circumstances and in their best interests. We agree there is a significant public interest in ensuring that financial advice laws are transparent and competitive in a financial services system, but we are also concerned that consumers actually have access to that advice. If we create a regulatory system around the access to financial advice that disenfranchises one consumer from getting personal advice for themselves, then we have done a disservice to them.


In ensuring that we provide that access to all consumers, we want to ensure that people who are saving for their retirement have certainty in the advice that they are receiving. We are not seeking to throw the baby out with the bathwater in that sense, but a balance has to be reached, and that is what the coalition's version of these rules will ensure. Do not take our word for it. Listen to some eminent people in the markets. Those opposite, who mostly have never worked in the private sector, should listen to this. Ian Narev, the CEO of the Commonwealth Bank, said that Australia's financial planning industry is too heavily regulated and customers will be better served with fewer regulations. Steve Munchenberg, the chief executive of the Australian Bankers' Association, described the changes as sensible and claimed that their opponents—that is, the members opposite—had been circulating disinformation about their impact. These are eminent people in the financial services industry.


In my electorate of Deakin, I have spoken to many consumers and providers of financial advice, and, in these discussions, two prevailing themes have come through. For everyday investors, there was justifiable anxiety that the additional cost that they would face in accessing financial advice would mean that they were unable to afford it. The view of financial advice providers has been that FoFA is unworkable. One provider sent me an email this morning that said, 'I don't think any AFSL holder is ready for it'—being FoFA—'and we are meant to be compliant already.' This observation is confirmed by the fact that the costs and disincentives of Labor's FoFA mean it just is not workable, and our changes are extremely important.

"Parke, Melissa, MP",ALP,2014-03-25,"



Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (16:35):  Timing is everything, and it has been no surprise to see the coalition government throw the car into reverse when it comes to their plans to weaken investor protection on the eve of the Western Australian Senate re-run. The Labor government introduced the Future of Financial Advice reforms to ensure transparency and fairness, to ensure best practice and to ban conflicted remuneration. It was a step taken in response to clear evidence of established practices in the financial advice sector which were risky, harmful, improper and misleading. It included requirements that ordinary investors be provided with basic information about the fees attached to the advice they were receiving and a requirement that clients' consent be obtained rather than presumed in relation to ongoing fees. That is what sensible regulation in this space exists to do; it is what good government exists to do; and it is precisely what the wider community expects.


The government was clearly hoping that the weakening and watering-down of these long-needed protections could be done quietly, under the cover of the government's bizarre 'war on red tape'. The Senate re-run election in WA has spoiled those plans, and so now, out of the blue, we hear that the weakening and watering-down of financial protections is being delayed because suddenly it is all very complicated and technical. Let me tell you, there is nothing very complicated about it. Financial advisers are not, in essence, salespeople. Their expertise—for which each and every client is paying—goes to the quality of their financial advice, which in turn depends entirely on it being in the best interest of the client, with no interfering consideration such as a separate financial reward that an adviser might receive from the owner of a financial or investment product. Such a scenario presents the very definition of a conflict of interest. The financial self-interest of the adviser is in conflict with the financial interest of the person they are obliged to serve, and that cannot be tolerated as part of what should be a safe, fair and transparent financial services environment.



You can walk the streets in any community in this country and ask people whether they think financial advisers should be required to act in their client's best interest, and the only way you will find anyone who disagrees is if you happen to run into a dodgy financial adviser or else a member of this government's economic team. I assure you that in Western Australia there is a good understanding of what happens when the so-called red tape, the regulations that exist to protect all of us in areas of life like investment where we are vulnerable, is ineffective.




Mr Pasin:
  I think they are more interested in the carbon tax.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Mitchell
):  Order! The member for Barker will be silent.




Ms PARKE:
  We have seen in the Westpoint collapse precisely what happens to ordinary investors when corporate fraud and inadequate financial regulation mix. Indeed, the Westpoint fiasco is a perfect and terrible example of the need for the reforms that Labor introduced. Individuals were encouraged to invest in the Westpoint Group, a Western Australian property development outfit, on the basis of advice that was negligently given and as a result of large commissions paid to financial advisers by Westpoint. There were more than 4,000 people who invested in the company, including many Western Australians. Together their losses have been estimated in excess of $300 million. It is no good to simply say that the relevant advisers have been banned as a result of the Westpoint collapse. It is no good to say, as the Prime Minister has said, that you should not regulate for 'ethical givens', when there has been a steady flow of savage and large-scale losses as a result of shonky corporate and financial industry operators who are completely impervious to basic ethical considerations.


The whole rationale for effective regulation, for Labor's carefully designed and consulted financial advice reforms, is the need to prevent disasters from happening in the first place. It is so much easier and better to have a system that works to keep the frauds out and to resist the creep of self-interested advisory negligence than to come along afterwards when millions and millions of dollars have disappeared and thousands of people have suffered severe financial loss.


Today, the Prime Minister talked about the need for decency. It is not decent for this government to remove sensible protections for consumers and investors—many of whom are elderly, vulnerable people. It is not decent for this government to abolish the charities commission, which protects donors and acts as a watchdog against scammers and dodgy charities. The treatment by this government of consumers, patients, orphans of war veterans, asylum seekers, low-paid workers, unemployed people and people with disabilities is simply not decent. So please do not talk to us about decency, Prime Minister. If saving senior Australians from losing their life savings to financial spivs is what the government calls red tape, then we say, 'Bring it on.' It is only those barriers and disincentives to improper conduct in an industry with serious inherent risks that keep ordinary Australians and their investments safe. This government wants to throw away those protections and wants to leave investors in the dark. What is worse, it wants to do so without scrutiny by Western Australians as they approach the ballot box.

Ms SUDMALIS
 (Gilmore) (16:40):  This government has always supported the need to protect the financial stability and investment for Australians. The underlying principles were established so that workers and families who have worked hard all their lives know that what they have saved—what is commonly referred to as their 'nest egg', or the funding for their well-deserved retirement years—is secure. It is at this point that I wish to digress in order to publicly compliment those amazing people who have done exactly this. So many of our wise Australians have become self-sufficient and are grouped together under the heading of self-funded retirees. They are fully deserving of our respect and compliments for being such important role models for the next generation. These people come to me on my village visits and ask, with tears in their eyes, what they did wrong. They have worked hard and saved hard, and they are not taking benefits from the government. They ask that we help them to protect their investments. The crux of their issue at this point is that financial advice is becoming too expensive and that you need to be a solicitor to understand all the fine print in the booklets that they get sent in the post, not to mention needing a magnifying glass to read the font.


They know that we are not repealing the Future of Financial Advice laws, but, in line with the commitments that we made to so many groups, we are going to improve these laws, simplify them and ensure that investors are protected and that the legislation is less complicated. Most important is the introduction of best-interest duty to complement the common-law protections.


Let me take another moment to cite an occasion that has left an indelible impression. In the past, a licensed financial adviser during a time of world financial crisis—in fact, it was just prior to the recession in 1987—advised his clients that they should move their investments to safer portfolios, saving them from significant financial losses. You might wonder, apart from having a clear conscience, what other consequences occurred. That individual had his position declared vacant. But he was acting in their best interests. This introduction of best-practice duty is an honourable and well-overdue change. There is no intention of introducing landmine aspects, of financial advisers gaining commissions, or convoluted and difficult methods for seeing how they work and what the real costs to the investor are.


The most important proposals in the changes are to make sure investment advice is competitive, fair, efficient and transparent. The previous suite of legislative changes, which were aimed at protection, were complicated at best and anti-competitive at worst. Increased investment options means that different avenues can give a different range of benefits to the investors to suit their different needs. There are estimates surrounding the existing implementation regime that include a cost burden of around $350 million. Ultimately, this will be borne by the investor. The proposals being put forward have been assessed by the independent Office of Best Practice Regulation.


The previous parliament had bipartisan support to change this industry after the debacle of Storm Financial. Sustainable reform was the overall theme at that time, as recommended by the Ripoll inquiry. There were three key recommendations: the best-interest duty; that clients were fully aware of the conditions of their investments; and that difficult financial advice was made a whole lot clearer. However, there were unintended consequences for investors. They had to re-sign with their advisers, and this cost was part of their fee structure. Out of 400 submissions to the Storm Financial inquiry, only one—the industry super fund—recommended this step. Perhaps I am a cynic, but one wonders why only one from this source is supposed to be representing the best interest of the industry members, or, more simply, the workers they say they represent, when in effect they are gaining repetitive repayments at the disadvantage of the workers.


The best-practice duty requirement is an essential step for sound financial investment. It will provide security for those people who come to me and proudly—deservedly so—say, 'I am a self-funded retiree.' The proposed legislation does not reintroduce commissions. At the moment, investors are not ever able to opt out of a fund where they actually have no investments. This is such a complicated industry, with most of us finding it difficult to navigate. Also, determining a trusted adviser is very concerning, as there are many perceptions around the commissions of the past, which, I emphasise again, are not being introduced with these amendments.


There is to be a $90 million saving on the current implementation costs, and who would have been sustaining these costs? Why, the investors of course. The Financial Services Council has estimated that the burden on this industry is in the order of $700 million. Those opposite have once again demonstrated a complete lack of economic depth or ability to analyse financial impacts on the very people they have endeavoured to assist—yet another Labor mess to be cleaned up. Our aim is to make financial advice more affordable and more effective. The window of opportunity here allows time for more consultation— (Time expired)



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The discussion is now concluded.

Mr KELVIN THOMSON
 (Wills) (21:00):  This afternoon, members of the Transport Workers' Union came to Parliament House to talk about the current state of the Australian aviation industry. In 2013 Australia's aviation industry generated over $35 billion in revenue, yet wages cost the industry only one-seventh of that. The House will be aware that, following the release of their recent financial results, Qantas asked for government assistance in the form of financial support and alterations to Australian airline ownership regulations, while at the same time announcing the axing of 5,000 jobs. However, many of Qantas's arguments for these measures do not address the central issues that have led the airline to its current position.


In December last year, Qantas management met with officials of the Transport Workers' Union. In that meeting, Qantas's major complaint to unions was that Virgin was running a loss-leading strategy to increase its market share and that the Qantas response was to protect its 65 per cent domestic market share by lowering fares and expanding capacity by double that of Virgin. Qantas management conceded at the time that air fares were unsustainably low. The capacity battle between these two competitors places downward pressure on fares and, hence, revenue and profit margins. Qantas's 65 per cent strategy compounds this, because it triples capacity growth and intensifies the downward pressure on fares and at the same time increases capital costs. In short, there are too many empty seats and too many cheap seats. Qantas maintain that they will continue to increase domestic capacity this year by three to four per cent on 2013 levels. This is simply a continuation of a failed, high-risk, high-cost strategy which looks as if it is seeking to induce industry-wide losses in the hope of destroying its only domestic competitor and achieving a monopoly on domestic air services.


Furthermore, the Transport Workers' Union advised us that the Qantas group have been using loopholes in Australia's special purpose visa program to employ Thai based flight attendants on domestic routes for as little as $257 per month. The House will be aware that, recently, the federal government changed the requirements for the 457 visa program, including the removal on the number of 457 workers a company can bring in without market testing or adequate protection. This is only likely to exacerbate the vulnerability of this group of workers.


The Qantas Sale Act was enacted in 1992 to ensure that Qantas remained an Australian airline serving the national interest. Yet, the wholesale outsourcing and offshoring of jobs, the reduction of full-time positions in favour of part-time and casual workforce structures, the flouting of migration laws and the reduction of employment standards do not serve the national interest. A repeal of part 3 of the Qantas Sale Act will not address core strategic and planning decisions that have contributed to the situation that Qantas now finds itself in. In fact, it is more likely to see a replication by Qantas of their domestic capacity war in the international arena.


The Transport Workers' Union point out that Australian aviation is vital to our economy and the Australian way of life and that aviation workers have a right to a decent, safe and secure job. To achieve this, aviation employers must stop outsourcing and offshoring aviation jobs with lower wages and conditions, stop exploiting foreign workers using legal loopholes to undermine Australian wages and conditions and stop bringing down standards in the aviation industry through cutthroat and unsustainable levels of competition. The Transport Workers' Union also make the point that a debt guarantee will not serve to improve decision making by Qantas management. The Australian public could find itself funding outcomes that are costly and inefficient without having had the opportunity to contribute to better planning strategy and decision making. All risk will be transferred to the public sector, while rewards—if any—will be the exclusive domain of the private sector. The TWU think that consideration of a government equity stake should be conditional on the provision of quality Australian jobs, on a commitment to skills development and innovation, on the ability to scrutinise and contribute to the strategic direction and growth plans for the airline, on the prioritisation of national aviation security and on the service of the national interest. Qantas management needs to accept responsibility for what has been a failed strategy.
