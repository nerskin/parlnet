Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland) (12:32):  The health and safety of Australians is the top priority when Labor considers changes to nuclear and radiation safety. Labor takes radiation and nuclear safety very seriously. The bill that we are dealing with today, the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Amendment Bill 2015, is an amendment bill which strengthens the powers of ARPANSA, the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, which is responsible for managing radiation and nuclear safety in our country. Largely, this bill follows a review by the Australian National Audit Office that was conducted in 2013-14 and, in part, also captures some of the recommendations made by the IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency, when they conducted their periodic reviews of our regulator. There are a number of changes to the licensing arrangements administered by ARPANSA, which have the effect of improving safety and efficiency and closing a number of loopholes that have been identified by the ANAO and also pick up some of the recommendations from the IAEA.


I note the recent submissions received by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee on the bill. There were five submitters to the bill and Labor thanks those organisations and individuals who contributed to the Senate community affairs inquiry process. I particularly want to thank the expert contributors to that process. In particular, Labor wants to acknowledge the contributions of ANSTO, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, the CSIRO and the supervising scientists in the Department of the Environment. Similarly, the contributions from the Department of Health were very welcome. They have always been professional and constructive when it comes to this issue. Labor also wants to put on record our thanks to Minister Nash and her office for the briefings that were provided to our shadow minister and his team.


I will discuss some, but not all, of the elements of the bill. It is a very technical bill which improves the safety of regulation in our country. I want to discuss the observation that there was general support from all of the witnesses for all of the amendments. Some concerns were raised outside the scope of the bill and outside the recommendations that have been picked up by the bill but, overall, there was general support for the bill. Engineers Australia pointed to a new safety standard that has been issued by the IAEA, and pointed out that reviews conducted by the IAEA's integrated regulatory review team of ARPANSA's activities have identified the need for strengthening the ARPANS Act. Engineers Australia said that the bill would provide:


greater clarity regarding application of the legislation to contractors


adoption of a risk-based approach 


requirement for a licence holder to provide information


power to issue improvement licences


power to issue time limited licences


power to regulate activities on legacy sites


The amendments go to clarifying the definition of a nuclear installation from nuclear waste to radioactive waste. This change is regarded as more appropriate and technically correct. The IAEA does not provide a definition of nuclear waste as all waste is captured under the definition of radioactive waste. The committee also heard evidence that there were different definitions in state and territory legislation, but it is not within the scope of this bill to deal with that. Frankly, that is a matter for states and territories to deal with.


The committee also made some commentary about ARPANSA's powers during an emergency. ANSTO discussed proposed section 41, which outlines the powers of the CEO of ARPANSA to give written directions to controlled persons. The bill reaffirms the internationally accepted principle of operator responsibility for safety, and clearly sets out that the powers of the ARPANSA CEO would only be used in the most exceptional of circumstances. ANSTO also noted that the principle of operator responsibility for safety reflects international best practice, as developed under the auspices of the IAEA, as well as being reflected in international nuclear safety treaties to which Australia is a party.


Mr Jack Dillich from ARPANSA highlighted in the inquiry that 'the proposed powers were intended to equip the regulator to address rare unforeseen circumstances'. To paraphrase, he said that this is something that would happen infrequently, if at all, but he thought it was important that those powers should be available.


I now go to a question that was raised in the Bills Digest, which I commend to the chamber. There are two issues I want to go to. The first is the change to information-gathering powers. The Bills Digest states:


… Item 29 would create a new section 44A in the ARPANS Act, providing for new information-gathering powers for the purpose of monitoring compliance with Commonwealth radiation licences. … The provision allows the CEO of ARPANSA to require that a controlled person provide information or documents, answer questions or appear before the CEO of ARPANSA to provide information, answers or documents.


It also recognises that:


… a controlled person is excused from giving the required information if giving such information would:


- be self-incriminating or expose the individual to a penalty or


- contravene an obligation under an international agreement …


It is our view that these requirements for information to be provided do seem reasonable. The bill provides that self-incriminating information may not be gathered compulsorily. The common law would provide a protection against self-incrimination. But I think having it explicitly in the bill is of use.


Finally, I want to go to the issue of changes to duration and scope of Commonwealth radiation licences. The bill brings in an opportunity to time-limit radiation licences, which is new for this act. Previously, all licences were issued for an indefinite period of time, which is something I was unaware of, but do now understand. I want to point to an interesting comment made in the Bills Digest:


… the use of time-limited licences more generally could be desirable. … An extension of this is that radiation exposure should be kept to what is strictly necessary …


Always, the intention is to limit any exposure to radiation. So we should be aiming to keep radiation exposure to what is absolutely strictly necessary. It further states:


… a requirement for licences to be renewed could be a useful trigger for a periodic assessment of whether the continued existence of the radiation source is necessary.


That is a welcome amendment to the act.


In conclusion, Labor recognises that the bill makes a number of improvements to the current legislation. We support the bill as it does improve the regulatory framework for nuclear and radiation safety and protection in our country. We are pleased to continue to work with the government in a cooperative way when reasonable legislative changes, such as this, are put forward.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-08-18,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:42):  The Greens will also be supporting the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Amendment Bill 2015, for very similar reasons to those identified by Senator McLucas. It is probably a bit of a rare thing for the Australian Greens to get up and announce that we are supporting a government bill involving regulation of nuclear technology. I just wanted to point that out.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  Are you serious? Take my temperature!




Senator LUDLAM:
  So much heckling. Don't make me change my mind!




Senator Nash:
  We appreciate it.




Senator LUDLAM:
  We are all appreciating each other today! I will put on the record a couple of comments and concerns about the narrowness of the drafting of the bill, but the fact is, as Senator McLucas has expressed, this does improve regulation of a sector that does have potential to cause enormous environmental and social harm and enormous harm to public health.


I guess it is worth acknowledging at the outset that the separation between the regulator and the regulated in this country has often been dangerously close. In instances I was following with whistleblowers at ANSTO's radioisotope facility in Sydney, we saw what extraordinarily, to my mind, amounted to regulatory capture, where whistleblowers who were trying to put on the public record the real dangers to workers' health were being attacked and eventually sacked or set aside. Under the previous government we saw some quite welcome reforms that moved the regulator more to an arm's length basis from those they were regulating. In my view this bill—not in a bit melodramatic way, but in small but important ways—continues the process of giving the regulator a freer hand at regulating this extraordinarily dangerous technology: through increasing transparency and accountability; through powers to require licence-holders to produce information; through powers to issue the improvement notices within a set time frame; and by being able to issue directions—again this goes to Senator McLucas's comments—about what happens in an emergency where the act or regulations are basically silent, where it may not be the case that ARPANSA has time to go through formal processes of issuing an instruction or direction but effectively needs to bring its expertise as a regulator to bear on an unforeseen potentially very risky or threatening event. I think those amendments are sensible. Noting ANSTO's reservations, nonetheless we are pleased to support those amendments here.


There is a very narrow definition in the bill, however, of prescribed legacy sites to which the act applies. I may take up a bit of time before we debate Senator Day's committee stage amendment to put a couple of questions to the minister and her advisers about the definition of 'prescribed legacy site' and what is in and what is out. I suspect that it is no surprise to the minister that I will be doing so. They were questions that I raised during the brief inquiry into which I teleconferenced a couple of weeks ago. I felt that I came out of the hearing without much more information than I went in with, so I am hoping that a bit of preparation and a bit of work has been done in the meantime—it would be great.


There are no specified outcomes for reducing contamination at legacy sites. So although we have a broader range of places and powers brought into ARPANSA's ambit there do not appear to be any benchmarks for, for example, dose thresholds at sites. Senator McLucas put quite correctly our ambition when it comes to ionising radiation exposure to human beings or to the wider environment. Our ambition is to minimise that exposure to the point where it is imperceptible, because the literature for so many years internationally has said that there is no safe dose. You cop a risky dose—airline pilots and air crew get a dose of ionising radiation—when you are 10 kilometres above the surface of the earth. You get a dose of ionising radiation if you stay out exposed to the sun too often. Those kinds of doses are just from being a human being alive on the planet being exposed to stray cosmic rays from time to time. But there is no safe dose. So we need to do anything at all that we can to reduce the additional doses that are being effectively forced on people, without their consent, from industrial exposure not only in the workplace—where you presume the workforce are properly trained and are given an understanding of the risks of exposure to ionising radiation—but also downstream of uranium mines.


We need to minimise these non-consensual doses of harmful ionising materials. We need to minimise it down towards zero, because any additional exposure—the way it was put to me in the literature years ago when I first came across this technology and was trying to understand what is going on at a biochemical level is that it is like machine gun fire inside the nucleus of the cell. Maybe something important gets hit; maybe it does not. But once that cancer has started or once that other damage has been done to the DNA, particularly in children or to foetuses in utero, you cannot claw it back. There is no way you can heal somebody once that damage has been done, and it takes just one decay track through one cell to cause cancer. I guess that is the literal understanding of why there is no safe dose. Yes, we are exposed to ionising radiation just in the course of our normal lives, living on a planet that is mildly radioactive. But everything we can do to force those additional exposures back towards zero is important.


People living in the vicinity of uranium mines, either operating ones or closed mines in the Alligator Rivers region in the Northern Territory, for example, are extremely distressed to read credible research from a couple of years back that showed the incidence of cancer among Aboriginal people in host communities around the closed Alligator Rivers mines in the NT that were operated in the fifties and sixties was double that of background populations or other populations in the area. That is how serious it is. I will get to the wider consequences, as I guess is probably appropriate, when we come to debating Senator Day's amendments about how this is precisely the wrong time to be ripping the lid off and opening the door to wider expansion into nuclear technology. The evidence is out there—not because the Greens say so; the industry itself is starting to front up to the consequences of just how much trouble it is in overseas. But I will hold those comments off until we get to the committee stage.


I foreshadow, to give the minister's advisers a bit of time in case the material is not immediately at hand, that I will ask to get an inventory of which existing sites are included under the amending legislation we are discussing today and which are not. My understanding, which was not changed during the inquiry of a couple of weeks ago, was that the act would not cover, for example, contaminated sites around Maralinga or other areas of nuclear weapons testing, where Australian service personnel and Aboriginal people from central and north-western Australia were bombed, were exposed to ionising radiation and to fission products in fallout by an ally. I note—as I think is appropriate in this year when we are commemorating the sacrifice of veterans in conflicts into which we have sent them—that in Australia the atomic veterans are not eligible for a gold card, because they were bombed by an ally. If they had been exposed to radiation from imperial Japanese forces or from any of the other forces that we faced during the Second World War they would be automatically eligible for a gold card. Because their exposure occurred from being bombed by nuclear weapons deployed by an ally—Australian uranium basically fired upon them in central Australia by the British government—they are not eligible. They are dying one by one; that cohort diminishes year by year. These are the sorts of risks that we are talking about. As far as I am aware—I would be delighted to be proven wrong—Maralinga and the other nuclear weapons test sites are not covered; they are not brought into the ambit of the regulator.


Port Pirie, Wild Dog, Radium Hill, Rum Jungle—radioactive contamination in this country goes back way further than most people think, certainly further than I thought. Early radium workings go back way before the development of a nuclear weapons or nuclear power industry. That, for me, is one of the reasons why it is important to remark when we see this kind of regulation coming through the Senate that nuclear accidents and nuclear contamination have a start time. Often you can pinpoint it, as they were able to pinpoint to within a few seconds the reactors at the Fukushima site on Japan's Pacific coast going into meltdown on 3 November 2011. These accidents and these contamination and exposure sites have a start date but they have no end date. There are still contamination legacy issues at Radium Hill, which was contaminated more than 100 years ago. There are still contamination issues at the—by today's standards relatively small—uranium workings in the Alligator Rivers region that were mined out, closed down and rehabilitated as far as the authorities of the day were concerned decades ago but are still leaching materials into the wider environment. Ionising radiation is invisible. It does not tell you that it is there. You cannot see it. Unless you are carrying a Geiger counter around with you, you do not know that it is there. That is why these sites are so dangerous. I am very keen to know whether any of those sites that I listed, the so-called orphan sites where state regulation is either completely absent or patently inadequate, are caught by this bill and whether they will be brought within this bill and what it would mean if they were. What are the obligations that arise?


One of the questions I put during the brief committee hearing was: why are there no cost implications in this bill? If we are going to see a higher level of accountability and a higher level of rehabilitation for these orphan contaminated sites, surely that is going to cost money. Protecting people who are cleaning up the radioactive aftertaste of these sorts of operations does cost money. It is an unavoidable consequence which is often not factored in—it is almost never factored in—at any point in the nuclear fuel chain. I was a bit curious and maybe even a bit perplexed to see that there were no cost implications with this bill, because that to me would imply that nothing is in fact going to change on the ground. Again, Minister—through you, Mr President—if I am wrong about that I would be very happy to stand corrected.


We are also interested to know about the definition of a 'prescribed legacy site', and I will go into this again a little bit in the committee stage, unless the minister wants to address these comments in her closing remarks. It is not entirely clear to me what such a site is. Is it mining, a processing facility, a research facility? In some parts of the amending legislation it is clear which sites are included. Based on their management by Commonwealth entity, the institutional jurisdiction defines whether a site is caught or not. That is reasonably clear. But what about some of these other orphan sites where ownership is not entirely clear. In the end we chose not to bring forward amendment at the committee stage to try to bring all the sites within ARPANSA's ambit as a regulator. It may in fact be a wiser course to lift the standard of state and territory regulation and to create that consistency around the country where it is lacking at the moment.


I will confine my comments to the clauses as they are outlined in the bill. I think Senator Day has actually done us a bit of a favour in bringing his amendment forward. The Greens certainly will not be supporting it, but it is a good opportunity to look at the consequences of what would happen if the chamber did support that amendment. In the meantime, I gather that this amending legislation have been in the works for a long time and that a lot of work has gone on behind the scenes to bring it forward. I acknowledge the government and those public servants who brought this amending legislation forward and commend it to the chamber.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2015-08-18,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (12:55):  In case anyone needs reminding, the 1980s are over. This is significant in many ways. It means you can throw away your Walkman, your Duran Duran cassettes and your VCR. Women can give their shoulder pads and leg warmers to the Salvos, and video game enthusiasts can try something other than Space Invaders.


It also means that we can discard our outdated antinuclear views. These views have always had little to do with the facts about peaceful nuclear technologies and a lot to do with the preoccupations of people who chose the wrong side of history in the Cold War. Some of these people still inhabit this chamber from time to time. They are still fighting the Cold War, rather like those Japanese soldiers found in the Philippines in 1974 who were unaware that World War II had ended.


The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Amendment Bill 2015 provides a rare opportunity to turn the tide against decades of antinuclear hysteria. It is a long time since anything pro nuclear passed through the parliament. If we want to we can also take the first step towards cutting Australia's carbon dioxide emissions in half. This is the kind of result we would achieve if nuclear power flourished in this country. Those who claim climate change is an emergency but nuclear power is not the answer are the real deniers of science. It is like saying there is a fire but refusing to call the fire brigade. Nuclear is the only realistic option for replacing fossil fuels for baseload power on a large scale. Hydro might be an option in other countries, but that requires big rivers and big dams. Nuclear power has also been proven to be safe. The Fukushima disaster taught us that even when outdated reactors in earthquake zones are hit by tsunamis nobody dies.


Those who say nuclear energy would take too long, is too expensive and is a technology that is on the way out are easily disproved on all counts. France built a nuclear capacity equal to Australia's needs in 20 years. It is competitive and has no accidents. France's per capita emissions are 60 per cent lower than Australia's. If it is true that nuclear power is not and never will be economically viable, the Greens have nothing to worry about. I am not arguing that taxpayers' money should be thrown at nuclear power. The best path to cheaper electricity, the return of Australia's competitive advantage in energy production and a retention of manufacturing is to stop throwing taxpayers' money at any power generation. Our 1980s thinking means we risk being left behind. We are now the only G20 country not using nuclear energy. It is true that many reactors around the world are closing, but many more are opening. Over 60 reactors are under construction right now, and China plans another 200 by 2050. There are 400 nuclear reactors in the world, and within 10 years there will be over 500.


If any country in the world should embrace nuclear power it is Australia. We have nearly half the world's reserves of uranium, a government capable of responsibly regulating the industry over the long term, a land mass with few earthquakes or other risks plus vast, remote locations in which we could safely store nuclear waste, not that modern nuclear reactors produce a lot of waste to store anyway. Small modular reactors could be built to power regional towns and mining sites with little or no risk or waste legacy. South Australia, in particular, is in a position to take a leading role in nuclear technology that could turn around the fortunes of the entire state. Instead, we have banned both the processing of uranium into nuclear fuel and nuclear power plants. It is akin to Saudi Arabia banning oil refineries and cars.


This bill is a small step in the right direction. I would like to see it take a bigger step. If you can agree that the 1980s have ended, you will support Senator Day's amendment to the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Amendment Bill 2015. This bill, even if it is amended, will not mean that people can build nuclear reactors any time soon, as there are other legal hurdles, but it will be the first step towards taking the blinkers off and demonstrating that superstition can no longer be a major plank of our energy policy.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2015-08-18,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (13:00):  I am very pleased today to have the opportunity to sum up the second reading debate on the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Amendment Bill 2015. As we have discussed, this bill amends the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act 1998 to ensure that Australia's regulation of radiation activities remains international best practice. I thank senators for their contribution to this bill, and I note the support from the Australian Labor Party, and thank Senator McLucas for her comments, and also those of the Australian Greens through Senator Ludlam.


Radiation protection and nuclear safety are constantly evolving. International approaches and industry practice have evolved since 1998 when the act was first introduced, and Australia needs to remain at the forefront of these changes. Australia is fortunate to have a strong regulator in the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, or ARPNSA as it is more commonly known. The regulatory scheme continues to provide Australians with appropriate protections; however, as science and technology changes, the legislation and regulation needs to remain contemporary. To this end, this bill increases capacity for improved risk management and provides ARPANSA with greater powers to monitor compliance. 


The amendments also support the CEO of ARPANSA to better respond in the unlikely event of an emergency. The bill enables the CEO to issue directions to licence holders to minimise any risk to people and the environment in unforeseen circumstances. All action taken by ARPANSA in response to noncompliance or to emergencies will continue to be reported quarterly and annually to the parliament. This will also be published on the ARPANSA website. This ensures that there is absolute accountability and transparency about the radiation activities being undertaken by Commonwealth agencies and about the actions taken by the regulator. Consistent with this government's commitments, the changes do not have any financial impact, nor do they increase any compliance burden for individuals, business or community organisations. The amendments simply update and improve the legislation.


I thank Senators for their contributions to debate on this bill and note the questions foreshadowed by Senator Ludlam to be dealt with in the committee stage, and I thank the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee for their consideration of this legislation. I would also like to thank ARPANSA and the Department of Health for their work on preparing this legislation.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (13:04):  In response to your questions earlier regarding those particular sites, obviously it is only the Commonwealth sites that come under the ARPANS Act. Clearly, the controlled person, as defined in the act as the Commonwealth entity or the Commonwealth contractor, must be in place for it to come under the Commonwealth.


My understanding is that the Alligator Rivers site and the Little Forest Legacy Site come under the Commonwealth's purview. Maralinga, that you also referred to, does indeed come under the Commonwealth power—or it did, because my advice is that that site has been remediated. Those that come under state and territory responsibility do not fall under the ARPANS Act. They are the ones that you referred to—Rum Jungle, Radium Hill and Port Pirie.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (13:05):  I guess there were two surprises in the minister's comments there, one being that she believes Maralinga has been rehabilitated. I am sorry to break your heart, Minister Nash—Maralinga is still a mess. There are parts of that site that are heavily laced with plutonium from a botched effort to rehabilitate that site some time ago. Maralinga is not a safe place for people to go. Admittedly, it is a huge land area and much of it is, but there are areas in there that are still heavily contaminated and, I believe, that goes for some of the other test sites as well.


The Alligator Rivers Region that I referred to refers to a number of smallish—by today's standards—uranium mine sites that were worked out in the fifties and sixties. It will be a pleasant surprise if you can confirm that those sites are to be considered as part of the ambit of this bill, because that was not my understanding. Maybe the minister would like to clarify. If you miss spoke that would be a shame, but if those are a couple of sites that are brought a little bit closer to better regulation then that would be a welcome development.

Senator DAY
 (South Australia) (13:08):  On behalf of the Family First Party I move amendment (1), circulated in my name:


(1) Schedule 1, page 3 (before line 4), before item 1, insert:




1A


Section


10



   Repeal the section.


My home state of South Australia—I like starting a speech with 'My home state of South Australia'; it just gets me off on the right foot—amongst other things, is blessed with significant uranium deposits. On a per capita basis we have, perhaps, the most in the world. 


Let me mention a former state Labor MP, the late Mr Norm Foster. He was one of the first members in the other place for the electorate of Sturt. He then became a member of the South Australian Legislative Council. In 1982 Norm Foster crossed the floor in the state parliament to get uranium mining underway at Olympic Dam, in South Australia. In expressing his conscience in support of that state, Norm Foster resigned from the Labor Party, to perhaps avoid being expelled for going against party policy. Thankfully, history and the Labor Party were kinder to him in later years and he is now hailed as a hero in South Australia. It just goes to show, though, that sometimes groupthink has to be taken head-on, no matter what the cost. When this legislation was created in 1998, a provision was inserted by the Greens, to automatically ban certain types of nuclear activity and installations.



Senator Ludlam interjecting—




Senator DAY:
  I thank Senator Ludlam for his interjection; he still holds to that view 20 years later. I want to highlight that this is not the end of the debate, if the amendment is defeated. It is not even the beginning of the end. I accept that the government was perhaps housekeeping in this particular legislative area and then along I came, opportunistically, with an amendment about nuclear installations. And when you come from South Australia you take every opportunity that you can. I get that. I also want colleagues to get that, when it comes to a nuclear future for South Australia—and my South Australian colleague Senator Edwards and indeed a number of other coalition senators have offered encouraging words to me in support of this amendment—I and others from South Australia and no doubt other senators from other states support that, and breaking down the barriers to get on with the nuclear fuel cycle and industry for South Australia.


A royal commission into the nuclear fuel cycle has been instituted in South Australia and, to its great credit, state Labor got this underway. My party, the Family First Party, has welcomed and supported that. I note that it has been reported that the South Australian government's Attorney-General's Department is already preparing tenders for consultants to bid for the work in preparing business cases for the very things that are described and banned outright in section 10 of the act. This move is designed to clear and improve the business case for South Australia participating more broadly in the nuclear fuel cycle.


I want to also make it clear that a nuclear spent fuel facility is already permissible at law, although the Greens also tried to stop that in 1998. We need and already have low-level facilities, but these are presently licensed by the authority. 


I also want to talk about nuclear submarines. I want to emphasise, again, that I support nuclear-powered submarines, not nuclear-armed submarines. Some of our major allies have nuclear-powered submarines, not least of which are the UK and the United States. The generation of submarines currently under the competitive evaluation process will of course be conventional submarines. But I hope that the next generation after that will be nuclear, because there is no doubt that these provide the tactical superiority and particular range that a large and relatively remote nation such as Australia needs. Informed opinion tells us that Australia's defence needs are for 12 submarines, six conventional and six nuclear powered.


Having a nuclear fuel cycle and nuclear industry will greatly improve the prospects of us establishing a nuclear submarine industry and, indeed, developing local talent. We could work, for example, in partnership with, say, the United Kingdom or the United States and progress towards having our own nuclear industry, supporting nuclear-powered submarines.


With respect to international comparisons, let me just outline for the benefit of senators where Australia presently sits in comparison with its major trading partners when it comes to the types of facilities described in section 10 of the act. Thirty-three nations have nuclear power and 19 of those nations have nuclear fuel fabrication. Eleven nations have nuclear enrichment plants. There are seven nations with reprocessing facilities. Australia is one of just four out the 20 G20 nations that does not have nuclear power. Eighteen of the 34 OECD nations have nuclear power, and Australia of course is not one of them. So nuclear energy and its fuel cycle is not an international pariah as some might suggest; in fact, far from it.


I want to move on to consider small, modular reactors, which Senator Leyonhjelm mentioned a short time ago. I have learnt a little bit about this aspect of nuclear energy. Let me tell you about small modular reactors, SMRs for short. In brief, they are small, economically efficient, reliable nuclear energy sources—




Senator Ludlam:
  They don't exist.




Senator DAY:
  They do exist—




Senator Ludlam:
  Nobody has built one.




Senator DAY:
  They are assembled in-house and then shipped to the desired locations. They are often destined for remote locations as they require few staff and have fewer containment issues. They employ inherent—




Senator Ludlam:
  Where are they operating?




Senator DAY:
  I will get to that, Senator Ludlam—




Senator Ludlam:
  I'll stop.




Senator DAY:
  If you don't mind. We have talked about courteous—




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  Senator Day, address your questions through the chair. And those on my left, order.




Senator DAY:
  Senator Ludlam is very close to me here. It is irritating me in my ear as I go along through this, Mr Chair.


There is no need for long transmission powerlines with these small modular reactors in remote locations, and South Australia of course has abundant remote locations. There is a smaller power output relative to the larger power plants, and the initial construction costs are much lower by comparison. SMRs produce between 10 and 300 megawatts, compared to 1,000 megawatts for a typically large reactor. SMRs have load-following designs so that when electricity demands are low they produce a lower amount of electricity. They are fast reactors and are designed to have higher fuel burn-up rates, reducing the amount of spent fuel produced. And, importantly, they use low enriched uranium, which is non-weapons-grade uranium. This makes the fuel less desirable for weapons production, supporting nonproliferation.


Let me talk about the knowledge economy in South Australia. We are hearing much these days about improving our international competitiveness and giving our own young people reason to stay in Australia, in South Australia in particular. It is a worthwhile debate to have, and that mentality was a driving force behind the Medical Research Future Fund debate, with scientists writing to us, urging us, that our best and brightest were going overseas to pursue research opportunities.


I ask my colleagues today in this debate: where will the next Albert Einstein come from? Will they be Australian? Where will the next Ernest Rutherford come from? He was a New Zealander. South Australia has produced a Howard Florey. Will we one day develop the equivalent of a hadron collider in South Australia?


I have somewhat of a background in science and I have to say it is very discouraging when you have a law saying that some science is completely off-limits, even though you have other nations in the world delivering significant benefits to their citizens.


Will we one day celebrate a huge leap forward in scientific technology? Lockheed Martin are saying they are close to doing that with nuclear fusion. Will that involve a former Australian citizen who went to Britain, somewhere friendlier, to do nuclear science? What a shame that would be. We embrace nuclear medicine and its benefits to our health, and we ought to be embracing the nuclear fuel cycle also.


I moved this amendment because it is simply illogical to have a law saying that you simply will not entertain certain technologies. By all means, if you want to impose strict licence conditions so be it; do so. We know that regulation rules out a host of other things already because it makes it uneconomic to proceed, yet it is regulatory extremism to statutorily ban certain things from ever being considered. The 1998 provision was not opposed by the major parties because they were not looking this far into the future. My amendment is designed to get the parliament to reconsider the future, and to vote in favour of the future, by supporting this amendment.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2015-08-18,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (13:19):  In responding to the amendment, I firstly would like to commend Senator Day for seizing the opportunity to encourage debate around this issue.


While the government welcomes a discussion around the broader opportunities that exist for a nuclear industry in Australia, it has been clear that any move to expand the nuclear industry in Australia would require bipartisan and broad community support. I can inform the senator that the government believes all energy options, including nuclear, should be part of any community discussion about Australia's future energy mix. The energy white paper 2015 states:


The Australian Government will consider the outcomes of the South Australian Royal Commission into its future involvement in the nuclear fuel cycle including the mining, enrichment, energy and storage phases for the peaceful use of nuclear energy.


And I note the royal commission is due to report its findings in May 2016 and also note that South Australia is indeed Senator Day's home state.


The Australian government is also committed to monitoring international developments on nuclear energy and will continue to work with the states and territories on improving the regulation of nuclear industries. Improvements include responding to technical developments and the streamlining and removal of any unnecessary regulation. The Department of Industry and Science is reviewing options in this regard, and repealing section 10 would be premature in light of these existing processes and policy settings.


While consideration of lifting prohibitions may be relevant when setting the policy direction for Australia's energy future, such considerations should be made at the right time. In the case of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Amendment Bill 2015 before us, it is intended to update the legal framework governing the safety of existing facilities and the protection of workers, the public and the environment.


Consideration of section 10 of the act was outside the scope of the review of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act 1998. The review of the ARPANS Act was undertaken to improve the operation of the legislation and to update the regulatory scheme to better reflect international best practice.


The bill provides ARPANSA with a range of tools in order to best manage radiation risks and to monitor and enforce compliance with the legislation by existing Commonwealth entities. Repealing section 10 of the ARPANS Act in isolation would not result in a situation whereby the prohibited nuclear installations could then be constructed or operated in Australia. The ARPANS Act only applies to Commonwealth entities. Other legislation at both state and federal levels would need to be repealed and amended to enable the prohibited nuclear installations identified in section 10 to be constructed and operated in Australia. I note again that such an action would be premature in light of processes underway to consider options and opportunities in relation to the future of the Australian nuclear industry. As such, the government does not support the amendment but we look forward to further discussion of this issue.

Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland) (13:22):  Labor does not support any amendment that would repeal section 10 of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act. Section 10 of the ARPANS Act provides that nothing in the legislation is taken to authorise the construction or operation of a list of nuclear installations—a nuclear fuel fabrication plant, a nuclear power plant, an enrichment plant and a reprocessing facility. These issues were canvassed at the Senate inquiry and the committee's view was that:


A change of this significance is broader than the committee's inquiry into the provisions of the bill and deserves separate consideration.


Senator Day, I join with the minister in congratulating you for using this opportunity to have a debate but I say to you that this is not the place, in the Senate, on a regulatory bill to be having a debate which could result in completely change Australia's energy policy. This bill goes to the regulatory framework for the regulation of radiation sources in our country. I do not think this is the place to have that debate. We note that the inquiry is being undertaken by the South Australian government and the issues you are trying to canvass will, I am sure, be considered there. We do not support your amendment, which, as I said, would fundamentally change Australia's energy policy.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-08-18,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (13:24):  I also join with my colleagues in thanking Senator Day for bringing this bill forward, despite the admonishment just then from Senator McLucas about this not being the time or the place. The Greens also have, from time to time, introduced amendments which would radically change the course of a particular piece of legislation. Today is as good a day as any. I am not going to support the amendment and I will explain as clearly as I can why not. 


Let us start with South Australia. I think where Senator Day and I would be in firm agreement is that the South Australian economy is in deep trouble. Between the closure of advanced manufacturing for cars, the extraordinary uncertainty faced by naval shipbuilders in South Australia at the moment and, ironically enough, the uncertainty provoked by BHP's intentions on the Roxby Downs expansion you have three of the larger employers or potential employers in the state of South Australia potentially hitting the wall at the same time. I recognise, as do my South Australian colleagues, that that puts the state in a very serious predicament, one I would hope in here would be above politics. 


It is without much pleasure that I would remind Senator Day and others that it was only a week or so ago that 380 employees of BHP lost their jobs. I think part of that is as a consequence of the company's decision a couple of years ago to not proceed with the expansion of the Roxby Downs open cut. Senator Day is quite right when he points out that Australia hosts a very large fraction of the world's uranium reserves but the Olympic Dam operation or the Roxby Downs site has a surprisingly large proportion of that uranium infantry at that one single site. The problem we have, which BHP discovered, is that yes, that deposit is huge, but it is very low grade and is a long way underground. 


BHP's initial modelling showed that they were going to need to run the largest haul packs in the world 24/7, around the clock, for four years just to remove the overburdened before they could reach the top of the ore body, an excavation which would ultimately become the largest on the planet. For four years those diesel powered monsters would go down and down into the pit just to remove the overburdened and to put it into a temporary mountain to one side of the pitch before starting to mine marketable ore. Once we had the numbers on the size of the open cut, what it would look like, how much it would cost to access that ore body and how much radioactive waste would have been piled on the surface in 50, 60 or 70 years of the mine's life, we would be leaving, in effect, more than a cubic kilometre of very finely powdered, pulverised, carcinogenic radioactive waste on the surface. Neither the South Australian government nor the Commonwealth environmental regulators were proposing that that radioactive material should be put back in the hole at the end of mining. 


I think one of the reasons that BHP ultimately decided not to proceed with the expansion—you could also argue that Roxby is a copper-gold venture which has uranium as a by-product—one of the things that killed that expansion was the very low world uranium price which had fallen from the extraordinary spike in 2007 to the point where they simply could not make the numbers add up. Now even a couple of years after that decision has been made we are still seeing companies having to let people go. 


So yes, there is a lot of uranium but it may be too low grade and too deep to bring to the surface at this time. That is before you bring in the issues that have plagued that site for many years—the destruction of Aboriginal country and sacred sites, in particular the draining of the mound springs, the extraordinary consumption of water in processing operations not just for uranium but for copper, gold and other material coming out of that underground site and the fact that this is the feedstock for the global nuclear fuel chain. 


Senator Day used the term 'nuclear fuel cycle'. While this probably sounds pedantic, I do not use that phrase. There is no cycle. There is no closed loop. It has never existed. It has been a dream since the 1950s that you could feed the waste products of the nuclear fuel cycle, as they were calling it then, in the form of plutonium, back into the front end at so-called breeder reactors and nobody, not even the best engineers and technologists in the world, in Russia, in Japan and in North America have ever figured out how to make it work.


You were listing before, Senator Day, the countries that operate reprocessing plants, and I am presuming you would include Japan in that list. They are not reprocessing there at the moment. It is so formidably difficult to close the loop on the 'nuclear fuel cycle' that we should not dignify it with that term. It is a one-way process for creating very low-grade uranium ores into various categories of intractable radioactive carcinogenic waste, including here in this country.


So no expansion at Roxby—and, if you are looking to one of the world's largest uranium mines to provide those jobs and that economic stability at a time of great instability in other sectors, it is the last place that you would want to look. What about if we head north to a much higher grade deposit and look to Kakadu? The Ranger uranium mine is presently on its knees. The company has just abandoned proposals to go underground and are looking at a kind of the reverse process to what they are looking at at Roxby. According to Rio Tinto, they will not be going underground at Ranger. So, effectively, you have a mine that is on its knees. They now have to have a very serious look at cleaning up 30 years of radioactive messes inside a World Heritage area, and it is not at all clear from company statements whether they have the financial resources to do that. Coming back to central South Australia, the Beverley uranium mine is looking radically uneconomic. They have been shedding people as well. The Honeymoon mine, which was opened with such fanfare a couple of years ago, is uneconomic as well. 


It is not simply due to the low uranium price, but that is of course a key factor. Why is the world uranium price so low? Partly it is because of the indestructible optimism of advocates. We heard before from Senator Leyonhjelm—who put it about as well as I think I have heard it put in recent times—about that glowing, radiating enthusiasm for an industry that simply derides any opposition as emotional or irrational and says, 'We can finally kick the 1980s to one side.' I think it was very interesting, Senator Leyonhjelm, that that was your baseline, because the 1980s was this curious collision of the hangover of Three Mile Island, where the asset of a nuclear utility that had been running perfectly was converted from an asset into a multibillion dollar liability over a period of about 20 minutes, and the point where regulators were trying to decide whether or not to evacuate a million people from the site around the stricken reactor at Three Mile Island. Eventually they got that site back under control again and no human being will ever set foot inside that reactor building again.


The markets, Wall Street in particular, had already decided that the industry was simply going to be uneconomic. The writing was on the wall before 1979, except that you had this huge construction build in the pipeline from the sixties and the seventies. So the 1980s is a very interesting period to start looking at this industry, because you still had the tail end of that extraordinary construction boom of the 1970s and reactors coming on line. It was a time of enormous optimism in the industry until 1986, when engineers at the Chernobyl plant in the Ukraine lost control of the reactor during a very, very poorly calibrated test and blew the side out of the building. Again, hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated from that site. At this time the writing was very seriously on the wall.


When I go to look for the facts, not for the stuff that I guess I was indirectly accused of by both of the previous speakers—around irrationality or, 'It's just emotional' or 'You're not looking at the facts—I get my facts, which are available to everybody to evaluate, from The world nuclear industry:status report 2015. I think it has been in publication for six or seven years now, and it is an extraordinarily valuable resource. They do not bring an agenda—they would not describe themselves, I would hope, as either pro- or antinuclear—but they do put a lot of very important global data into the public domain and they update it once a year. That is why I could not help myself and I was a bit undisciplined during Senator Day's comments when he was putting onto the public record stuff that the evidence simply does not support. So let us go through this in a bit of detail.


One of the reasons that the world uranium price is so low is that inventories are piling up around the world. You had between 40 and 50 reactors in Japan offline—the entire country's nuclear fleet offline—after 3/11 and nuclear inventories simply building up around the world. The reason that they have not started up again is that, firstly, the Japanese public are aware that 160,000 radiation refugees had to be pulled out of that area and most of them will never be able to go home. I do not know how many people have visited that site, but I have. I got within 10 kilometres of the reactor into an area that had recently been opened up again. It was though the tsunami had only just happened yesterday. It was a haunting experience. There are 150,000 radiation refugees still unable to go home—nor is it likely that they will ever be able to. The Japanese public trusted the industry and were told that such a thing could never happen. So there has been a staggering betrayal of trust.


Another thing is that, yes, it had an impact on Japanese coal and gas imports, but the Japanese public realised for the first time in the postwar era that they did not need what they call the atomic mafia. The lights stayed on and the Japanese economy stayed intact. Yes, their energy imports went up, and instead of importing uranium from places like Australia, they are importing gas from places like Australia, but the lights stayed on. So there were two fundamental betrayals of trust: the industry was not needed and the industry was not safe. That has permanently changed the character of Japanese politics. Apart from, I think, one unit that went online within the last fortnight or so, the other reason that those reactors have not started up in Japan is that local authorities—prefectural and district level authorities—have a very important say in whether or not those plants get back up. So, if we are looking to Japan as a customer country for Australian uranium, we would need to look somewhere else.


France was mentioned as the country with the highest density of installation of nuclear power stations in the world. It might have been Senator Leyonhjelm—though I do not want to misquote him—who said that there had been no accidents. The record of accidents in the French nuclear industry—which I will not go into in detail now—stands for itself. But here is the thing: the French authorities are backing out of the industry. Japan was once held up as the exemplar of the nuclear economy. Pro-nuclear advocates do not talk about Japan so much anymore, but they do talk about France. But AREVA are now technically bankrupt. They were downgraded to junk standard by Standard and Poor's, and the share value plunged to a new historic low on 9 July, with a value loss of 90 per cent since 2007.


AREVA is the state-owned entity that basically does everything in relation to atomic energy, all the way through the fuel chain from mining to waste—parking and waiting and seeing. AREVA is effectively bankrupt, and the French policy now is basically around getting from 70 per cent back to less than 50 per cent nuclear. They realise that that extraordinary reliance on ageing and extremely inflexible and risky reactors in France is a dead end for their energy policy and they are looking to diversify. Where are they looking? They are not looking to fossil; they are looking to clean energy, to renewable energy. And that is what is happening elsewhere.  


I refer again to the Theworld nuclear industry: status report. The industry is stuffed, colleagues. The global nuclear industry is on its knees; it is on its way out. It would be something of a tragedy, I would think, for well-meaning senators in here looking for economic diversification, looking for energy security, to look to this dead end that has never, ever lived up to its promises. Nuclear plant construction starts plunged from 15 in 2010 to three in 2014. I will quote one paragraph from that same report:


The 391 operating reactors … are 47 fewer than the 2002 peak of 438 ...


So peak nuclear was 2002—that is getting to be a while ago now. It has all been in decline since then. There are 47 fewer reactors operating now than there were then. That is a reasonably large number. The report goes on:


… the total installed capacity peaked in 2010 at 368 gigawatts before declining by 8 percent to 337 gigawatts …


So now we have basically rewound the industry by about 20 years in terms of installed capacity. Further:


Annual nuclear electricity generation reached 2,410 terawatt hours in 2014—a 2.2 percent increase over the previous year, but 9.4 percent below … peak …


My question to Senator Day is whether he would like a copy of this document. I do welcome this debate because the nuclear debate has been happening in Australia for decades and there are important reasons why the pro-nuclear side keeps losing and one of them, I would suspect, is simply overlooking the underlying fundamentals of a market that is broken and has delivered only risk, despite promising such extraordinary benefits.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (13:39):  The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act is the legislation that makes it illegal to authorise a nuclear power station, fuel enrichment or a fabrication facility or a reprocessing facility. Senator Day's amendment would repeal section 10 of the ARPNS Act and thus make it possible, not necessarily probable, for the regulator to authorise a nuclear power station, fuel enrichment or a fabrication facility or a reprocessing facility. In submissions to the Senate inquiry, both the Australian Nuclear Association and Engineers Australia suggested such an amendment. Senators Nash and McLucas have both said now is not the time for such an amendment. Senator Ludlam suggested there is never a good time for an amendment like this. I would argue that now is as good a time as any to start peeling back the Australia's absurd attitude to a nuclear industry. Senator Day's amendment would make a useful start and I signal my support for it.

Senator DAY
 (South Australia) (13:40):  In summing up, I thank my colleagues for their contributions on my amendment. I would particularly like to thank my colleague Senator Leyonhjelm for his support. In response to Senator McLucas suggesting that my amendment would fundamentally change energy policy, I was not suggesting that but rather just removing a ban on even considering these things at the first hurdle. Whether my amendment represented a fundamental change in energy policy, I thank Senator McLucas for her compliment.


In response to Senator Ludlam's comments, he makes my point exactly. He says that there is no nuclear fuel cycle. What have the last hundred years of brilliant discoveries and inventions been all about? We used to burn off gas from oil refineries and now it is recycled. Methane used to leak out of rubbish dumps and now it is harnessed and used for fuel. And there are all the medical breakthroughs. I think Senator Ludlam's short-sighted approach, saying, 'We can't allow it because we haven't done anything yet,' is my whole point. The whole point is where might the next big medical or scientific come from? If we keep on blindly with a 'Ludlam-ite' approach—excuse the pun, Senator Ludlam—it will get us nowhere. 


It would appear that I do not have the numbers for this to succeed today. I accept that. This amendment has come at relatively late notice. I do thank senators for their contribution. It has triggered an interesting discussion. I will read Senator Ludlam's discussion paper on this because it really is very, very important for my home state of South Australia. Nonetheless, I have moved my amendment on sheet 7764.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2015-08-18,"



Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland) (12:32):  The health and safety of Australians is the top priority when Labor considers changes to nuclear and radiation safety. Labor takes radiation and nuclear safety very seriously. The bill that we are dealing with today, the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Amendment Bill 2015, is an amendment bill which strengthens the powers of ARPANSA, the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, which is responsible for managing radiation and nuclear safety in our country. Largely, this bill follows a review by the Australian National Audit Office that was conducted in 2013-14 and, in part, also captures some of the recommendations made by the IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency, when they conducted their periodic reviews of our regulator. There are a number of changes to the licensing arrangements administered by ARPANSA, which have the effect of improving safety and efficiency and closing a number of loopholes that have been identified by the ANAO and also pick up some of the recommendations from the IAEA.


I note the recent submissions received by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee on the bill. There were five submitters to the bill and Labor thanks those organisations and individuals who contributed to the Senate community affairs inquiry process. I particularly want to thank the expert contributors to that process. In particular, Labor wants to acknowledge the contributions of ANSTO, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, the CSIRO and the supervising scientists in the Department of the Environment. Similarly, the contributions from the Department of Health were very welcome. They have always been professional and constructive when it comes to this issue. Labor also wants to put on record our thanks to Minister Nash and her office for the briefings that were provided to our shadow minister and his team.


I will discuss some, but not all, of the elements of the bill. It is a very technical bill which improves the safety of regulation in our country. I want to discuss the observation that there was general support from all of the witnesses for all of the amendments. Some concerns were raised outside the scope of the bill and outside the recommendations that have been picked up by the bill but, overall, there was general support for the bill. Engineers Australia pointed to a new safety standard that has been issued by the IAEA, and pointed out that reviews conducted by the IAEA's integrated regulatory review team of ARPANSA's activities have identified the need for strengthening the ARPANS Act. Engineers Australia said that the bill would provide:


greater clarity regarding application of the legislation to contractors


adoption of a risk-based approach 


requirement for a licence holder to provide information


power to issue improvement licences


power to issue time limited licences


power to regulate activities on legacy sites


The amendments go to clarifying the definition of a nuclear installation from nuclear waste to radioactive waste. This change is regarded as more appropriate and technically correct. The IAEA does not provide a definition of nuclear waste as all waste is captured under the definition of radioactive waste. The committee also heard evidence that there were different definitions in state and territory legislation, but it is not within the scope of this bill to deal with that. Frankly, that is a matter for states and territories to deal with.


The committee also made some commentary about ARPANSA's powers during an emergency. ANSTO discussed proposed section 41, which outlines the powers of the CEO of ARPANSA to give written directions to controlled persons. The bill reaffirms the internationally accepted principle of operator responsibility for safety, and clearly sets out that the powers of the ARPANSA CEO would only be used in the most exceptional of circumstances. ANSTO also noted that the principle of operator responsibility for safety reflects international best practice, as developed under the auspices of the IAEA, as well as being reflected in international nuclear safety treaties to which Australia is a party.


Mr Jack Dillich from ARPANSA highlighted in the inquiry that 'the proposed powers were intended to equip the regulator to address rare unforeseen circumstances'. To paraphrase, he said that this is something that would happen infrequently, if at all, but he thought it was important that those powers should be available.


I now go to a question that was raised in the Bills Digest, which I commend to the chamber. There are two issues I want to go to. The first is the change to information-gathering powers. The Bills Digest states:


… Item 29 would create a new section 44A in the ARPANS Act, providing for new information-gathering powers for the purpose of monitoring compliance with Commonwealth radiation licences. … The provision allows the CEO of ARPANSA to require that a controlled person provide information or documents, answer questions or appear before the CEO of ARPANSA to provide information, answers or documents.


It also recognises that:


… a controlled person is excused from giving the required information if giving such information would:


- be self-incriminating or expose the individual to a penalty or


- contravene an obligation under an international agreement …


It is our view that these requirements for information to be provided do seem reasonable. The bill provides that self-incriminating information may not be gathered compulsorily. The common law would provide a protection against self-incrimination. But I think having it explicitly in the bill is of use.


Finally, I want to go to the issue of changes to duration and scope of Commonwealth radiation licences. The bill brings in an opportunity to time-limit radiation licences, which is new for this act. Previously, all licences were issued for an indefinite period of time, which is something I was unaware of, but do now understand. I want to point to an interesting comment made in the Bills Digest:


… the use of time-limited licences more generally could be desirable. … An extension of this is that radiation exposure should be kept to what is strictly necessary …


Always, the intention is to limit any exposure to radiation. So we should be aiming to keep radiation exposure to what is absolutely strictly necessary. It further states:


… a requirement for licences to be renewed could be a useful trigger for a periodic assessment of whether the continued existence of the radiation source is necessary.


That is a welcome amendment to the act.


In conclusion, Labor recognises that the bill makes a number of improvements to the current legislation. We support the bill as it does improve the regulatory framework for nuclear and radiation safety and protection in our country. We are pleased to continue to work with the government in a cooperative way when reasonable legislative changes, such as this, are put forward.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:42):  The Greens will also be supporting the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Amendment Bill 2015, for very similar reasons to those identified by Senator McLucas. It is probably a bit of a rare thing for the Australian Greens to get up and announce that we are supporting a government bill involving regulation of nuclear technology. I just wanted to point that out.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  Are you serious? Take my temperature!




Senator LUDLAM:
  So much heckling. Don't make me change my mind!




Senator Nash:
  We appreciate it.




Senator LUDLAM:
  We are all appreciating each other today! I will put on the record a couple of comments and concerns about the narrowness of the drafting of the bill, but the fact is, as Senator McLucas has expressed, this does improve regulation of a sector that does have potential to cause enormous environmental and social harm and enormous harm to public health.


I guess it is worth acknowledging at the outset that the separation between the regulator and the regulated in this country has often been dangerously close. In instances I was following with whistleblowers at ANSTO's radioisotope facility in Sydney, we saw what extraordinarily, to my mind, amounted to regulatory capture, where whistleblowers who were trying to put on the public record the real dangers to workers' health were being attacked and eventually sacked or set aside. Under the previous government we saw some quite welcome reforms that moved the regulator more to an arm's length basis from those they were regulating. In my view this bill—not in a bit melodramatic way, but in small but important ways—continues the process of giving the regulator a freer hand at regulating this extraordinarily dangerous technology: through increasing transparency and accountability; through powers to require licence-holders to produce information; through powers to issue the improvement notices within a set time frame; and by being able to issue directions—again this goes to Senator McLucas's comments—about what happens in an emergency where the act or regulations are basically silent, where it may not be the case that ARPANSA has time to go through formal processes of issuing an instruction or direction but effectively needs to bring its expertise as a regulator to bear on an unforeseen potentially very risky or threatening event. I think those amendments are sensible. Noting ANSTO's reservations, nonetheless we are pleased to support those amendments here.


There is a very narrow definition in the bill, however, of prescribed legacy sites to which the act applies. I may take up a bit of time before we debate Senator Day's committee stage amendment to put a couple of questions to the minister and her advisers about the definition of 'prescribed legacy site' and what is in and what is out. I suspect that it is no surprise to the minister that I will be doing so. They were questions that I raised during the brief inquiry into which I teleconferenced a couple of weeks ago. I felt that I came out of the hearing without much more information than I went in with, so I am hoping that a bit of preparation and a bit of work has been done in the meantime—it would be great.


There are no specified outcomes for reducing contamination at legacy sites. So although we have a broader range of places and powers brought into ARPANSA's ambit there do not appear to be any benchmarks for, for example, dose thresholds at sites. Senator McLucas put quite correctly our ambition when it comes to ionising radiation exposure to human beings or to the wider environment. Our ambition is to minimise that exposure to the point where it is imperceptible, because the literature for so many years internationally has said that there is no safe dose. You cop a risky dose—airline pilots and air crew get a dose of ionising radiation—when you are 10 kilometres above the surface of the earth. You get a dose of ionising radiation if you stay out exposed to the sun too often. Those kinds of doses are just from being a human being alive on the planet being exposed to stray cosmic rays from time to time. But there is no safe dose. So we need to do anything at all that we can to reduce the additional doses that are being effectively forced on people, without their consent, from industrial exposure not only in the workplace—where you presume the workforce are properly trained and are given an understanding of the risks of exposure to ionising radiation—but also downstream of uranium mines.


We need to minimise these non-consensual doses of harmful ionising materials. We need to minimise it down towards zero, because any additional exposure—the way it was put to me in the literature years ago when I first came across this technology and was trying to understand what is going on at a biochemical level is that it is like machine gun fire inside the nucleus of the cell. Maybe something important gets hit; maybe it does not. But once that cancer has started or once that other damage has been done to the DNA, particularly in children or to foetuses in utero, you cannot claw it back. There is no way you can heal somebody once that damage has been done, and it takes just one decay track through one cell to cause cancer. I guess that is the literal understanding of why there is no safe dose. Yes, we are exposed to ionising radiation just in the course of our normal lives, living on a planet that is mildly radioactive. But everything we can do to force those additional exposures back towards zero is important.


People living in the vicinity of uranium mines, either operating ones or closed mines in the Alligator Rivers region in the Northern Territory, for example, are extremely distressed to read credible research from a couple of years back that showed the incidence of cancer among Aboriginal people in host communities around the closed Alligator Rivers mines in the NT that were operated in the fifties and sixties was double that of background populations or other populations in the area. That is how serious it is. I will get to the wider consequences, as I guess is probably appropriate, when we come to debating Senator Day's amendments about how this is precisely the wrong time to be ripping the lid off and opening the door to wider expansion into nuclear technology. The evidence is out there—not because the Greens say so; the industry itself is starting to front up to the consequences of just how much trouble it is in overseas. But I will hold those comments off until we get to the committee stage.


I foreshadow, to give the minister's advisers a bit of time in case the material is not immediately at hand, that I will ask to get an inventory of which existing sites are included under the amending legislation we are discussing today and which are not. My understanding, which was not changed during the inquiry of a couple of weeks ago, was that the act would not cover, for example, contaminated sites around Maralinga or other areas of nuclear weapons testing, where Australian service personnel and Aboriginal people from central and north-western Australia were bombed, were exposed to ionising radiation and to fission products in fallout by an ally. I note—as I think is appropriate in this year when we are commemorating the sacrifice of veterans in conflicts into which we have sent them—that in Australia the atomic veterans are not eligible for a gold card, because they were bombed by an ally. If they had been exposed to radiation from imperial Japanese forces or from any of the other forces that we faced during the Second World War they would be automatically eligible for a gold card. Because their exposure occurred from being bombed by nuclear weapons deployed by an ally—Australian uranium basically fired upon them in central Australia by the British government—they are not eligible. They are dying one by one; that cohort diminishes year by year. These are the sorts of risks that we are talking about. As far as I am aware—I would be delighted to be proven wrong—Maralinga and the other nuclear weapons test sites are not covered; they are not brought into the ambit of the regulator.


Port Pirie, Wild Dog, Radium Hill, Rum Jungle—radioactive contamination in this country goes back way further than most people think, certainly further than I thought. Early radium workings go back way before the development of a nuclear weapons or nuclear power industry. That, for me, is one of the reasons why it is important to remark when we see this kind of regulation coming through the Senate that nuclear accidents and nuclear contamination have a start time. Often you can pinpoint it, as they were able to pinpoint to within a few seconds the reactors at the Fukushima site on Japan's Pacific coast going into meltdown on 3 November 2011. These accidents and these contamination and exposure sites have a start date but they have no end date. There are still contamination legacy issues at Radium Hill, which was contaminated more than 100 years ago. There are still contamination issues at the—by today's standards relatively small—uranium workings in the Alligator Rivers region that were mined out, closed down and rehabilitated as far as the authorities of the day were concerned decades ago but are still leaching materials into the wider environment. Ionising radiation is invisible. It does not tell you that it is there. You cannot see it. Unless you are carrying a Geiger counter around with you, you do not know that it is there. That is why these sites are so dangerous. I am very keen to know whether any of those sites that I listed, the so-called orphan sites where state regulation is either completely absent or patently inadequate, are caught by this bill and whether they will be brought within this bill and what it would mean if they were. What are the obligations that arise?


One of the questions I put during the brief committee hearing was: why are there no cost implications in this bill? If we are going to see a higher level of accountability and a higher level of rehabilitation for these orphan contaminated sites, surely that is going to cost money. Protecting people who are cleaning up the radioactive aftertaste of these sorts of operations does cost money. It is an unavoidable consequence which is often not factored in—it is almost never factored in—at any point in the nuclear fuel chain. I was a bit curious and maybe even a bit perplexed to see that there were no cost implications with this bill, because that to me would imply that nothing is in fact going to change on the ground. Again, Minister—through you, Mr President—if I am wrong about that I would be very happy to stand corrected.


We are also interested to know about the definition of a 'prescribed legacy site', and I will go into this again a little bit in the committee stage, unless the minister wants to address these comments in her closing remarks. It is not entirely clear to me what such a site is. Is it mining, a processing facility, a research facility? In some parts of the amending legislation it is clear which sites are included. Based on their management by Commonwealth entity, the institutional jurisdiction defines whether a site is caught or not. That is reasonably clear. But what about some of these other orphan sites where ownership is not entirely clear. In the end we chose not to bring forward amendment at the committee stage to try to bring all the sites within ARPANSA's ambit as a regulator. It may in fact be a wiser course to lift the standard of state and territory regulation and to create that consistency around the country where it is lacking at the moment.


I will confine my comments to the clauses as they are outlined in the bill. I think Senator Day has actually done us a bit of a favour in bringing his amendment forward. The Greens certainly will not be supporting it, but it is a good opportunity to look at the consequences of what would happen if the chamber did support that amendment. In the meantime, I gather that this amending legislation have been in the works for a long time and that a lot of work has gone on behind the scenes to bring it forward. I acknowledge the government and those public servants who brought this amending legislation forward and commend it to the chamber.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2015-08-18,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (12:55):  In case anyone needs reminding, the 1980s are over. This is significant in many ways. It means you can throw away your Walkman, your Duran Duran cassettes and your VCR. Women can give their shoulder pads and leg warmers to the Salvos, and video game enthusiasts can try something other than Space Invaders.


It also means that we can discard our outdated antinuclear views. These views have always had little to do with the facts about peaceful nuclear technologies and a lot to do with the preoccupations of people who chose the wrong side of history in the Cold War. Some of these people still inhabit this chamber from time to time. They are still fighting the Cold War, rather like those Japanese soldiers found in the Philippines in 1974 who were unaware that World War II had ended.


The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Amendment Bill 2015 provides a rare opportunity to turn the tide against decades of antinuclear hysteria. It is a long time since anything pro nuclear passed through the parliament. If we want to we can also take the first step towards cutting Australia's carbon dioxide emissions in half. This is the kind of result we would achieve if nuclear power flourished in this country. Those who claim climate change is an emergency but nuclear power is not the answer are the real deniers of science. It is like saying there is a fire but refusing to call the fire brigade. Nuclear is the only realistic option for replacing fossil fuels for baseload power on a large scale. Hydro might be an option in other countries, but that requires big rivers and big dams. Nuclear power has also been proven to be safe. The Fukushima disaster taught us that even when outdated reactors in earthquake zones are hit by tsunamis nobody dies.


Those who say nuclear energy would take too long, is too expensive and is a technology that is on the way out are easily disproved on all counts. France built a nuclear capacity equal to Australia's needs in 20 years. It is competitive and has no accidents. France's per capita emissions are 60 per cent lower than Australia's. If it is true that nuclear power is not and never will be economically viable, the Greens have nothing to worry about. I am not arguing that taxpayers' money should be thrown at nuclear power. The best path to cheaper electricity, the return of Australia's competitive advantage in energy production and a retention of manufacturing is to stop throwing taxpayers' money at any power generation. Our 1980s thinking means we risk being left behind. We are now the only G20 country not using nuclear energy. It is true that many reactors around the world are closing, but many more are opening. Over 60 reactors are under construction right now, and China plans another 200 by 2050. There are 400 nuclear reactors in the world, and within 10 years there will be over 500.


If any country in the world should embrace nuclear power it is Australia. We have nearly half the world's reserves of uranium, a government capable of responsibly regulating the industry over the long term, a land mass with few earthquakes or other risks plus vast, remote locations in which we could safely store nuclear waste, not that modern nuclear reactors produce a lot of waste to store anyway. Small modular reactors could be built to power regional towns and mining sites with little or no risk or waste legacy. South Australia, in particular, is in a position to take a leading role in nuclear technology that could turn around the fortunes of the entire state. Instead, we have banned both the processing of uranium into nuclear fuel and nuclear power plants. It is akin to Saudi Arabia banning oil refineries and cars.


This bill is a small step in the right direction. I would like to see it take a bigger step. If you can agree that the 1980s have ended, you will support Senator Day's amendment to the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Amendment Bill 2015. This bill, even if it is amended, will not mean that people can build nuclear reactors any time soon, as there are other legal hurdles, but it will be the first step towards taking the blinkers off and demonstrating that superstition can no longer be a major plank of our energy policy.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2015-08-18,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (13:00):  I am very pleased today to have the opportunity to sum up the second reading debate on the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Amendment Bill 2015. As we have discussed, this bill amends the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act 1998 to ensure that Australia's regulation of radiation activities remains international best practice. I thank senators for their contribution to this bill, and I note the support from the Australian Labor Party, and thank Senator McLucas for her comments, and also those of the Australian Greens through Senator Ludlam.


Radiation protection and nuclear safety are constantly evolving. International approaches and industry practice have evolved since 1998 when the act was first introduced, and Australia needs to remain at the forefront of these changes. Australia is fortunate to have a strong regulator in the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, or ARPNSA as it is more commonly known. The regulatory scheme continues to provide Australians with appropriate protections; however, as science and technology changes, the legislation and regulation needs to remain contemporary. To this end, this bill increases capacity for improved risk management and provides ARPANSA with greater powers to monitor compliance. 


The amendments also support the CEO of ARPANSA to better respond in the unlikely event of an emergency. The bill enables the CEO to issue directions to licence holders to minimise any risk to people and the environment in unforeseen circumstances. All action taken by ARPANSA in response to noncompliance or to emergencies will continue to be reported quarterly and annually to the parliament. This will also be published on the ARPANSA website. This ensures that there is absolute accountability and transparency about the radiation activities being undertaken by Commonwealth agencies and about the actions taken by the regulator. Consistent with this government's commitments, the changes do not have any financial impact, nor do they increase any compliance burden for individuals, business or community organisations. The amendments simply update and improve the legislation.


I thank Senators for their contributions to debate on this bill and note the questions foreshadowed by Senator Ludlam to be dealt with in the committee stage, and I thank the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee for their consideration of this legislation. I would also like to thank ARPANSA and the Department of Health for their work on preparing this legislation. 


Question agreed to.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (13:45):  I rise to speak on the cognate bills—the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman Bill 2015 and the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2015. Labor supports the passage of these bills, but not without emphasising our concerns and the concerns of stakeholders who recently submitted to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry—the report of which, fortunately, was just tabled.


These concerns are specifically in reference to the use of the title 'ombudsman' for this role, its defined powers and its degree of independence. Questions were raised in the inquiry as to the appropriateness of the use of the term ombudsman in this context. If these concerns remain unaddressed they have the capacity to undermine the widely-accepted and well-established functions and powers of the role of the ombudsman in Australia. Consequently, this may well lead to a loss of confidence in or under-utilisation of the role of the small business ombudsman by small-business people requiring assistance. While the Senate legislation committee report recommends that these bills be passed without substantive change, it also notes the need for regular review of the legislation to examine and monitor issues raised by stakeholders. Labor outlined four major concerns to the committee in our additional comments. I will address these separately, but I will now make a few comments regarding the history and the role of the ombudsman. 


Labor believes the independence and impartiality of the role of an ombudsman is important to guaranteeing the trust of Australians in this role. The office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman exists to safeguard the community in its dealings with government agencies and to ensure that administrative action by Australian government agencies is fair and accountable. The establishment of the office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman was first moved under the Whitlam Labor government and enabled by legislation in 1976, commencing operation on 1 July 1977. The Commonwealth Ombudsman can investigate complaints about the actions and decisions of Australian government agencies to see if they are wrong, unjust, unlawful, discriminatory or just plain unfair. 


The office of the Australian Small Business Commissioner, or the ASBC, was established by the Gillard Labor government in 2013. The principal functions of the ASBC are: to provide information and assistance to small businesses, including referral to dispute resolution processes; to represent small business interests and concerns to the Australian government; and to work with industry and the government to promote a consistent and coordinated approach to small business matters. These cognate bills would establish the office of the ASBC and replace the role of the new Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman—the ASBFE Ombudsman, which I will simply refer to as the small business ombudsman.


This bill, with the establishment of the office of the small business ombudsman, cannot fulfil the functions of an independent and impartial umpire and will, therefore, compromise the safeguard role that a traditional ombudsman plays on behalf of all Australians. The advocacy and dispute resolution functions of the small business ombudsman that are at the heart of this bill are inconsistent with an accepted set of criteria considered necessary to be described as an ombudsman. 


Labor senators note the strong opposition expressed by numerous expert groups and peak organisations in the six submissions that expressed a view about the use of the term ombudsman in the title. The Commonwealth Ombudsman identified concerns with the suitability of the title of ombudsman for this role, and the Australian and New Zealand Ombudsman Association noted that the office proposed is not an ombudsman, and should not be called one. The Commonwealth Ombudsman expressed strong concerns that use of the term ombudsman in this context is misleading and has the potential to damage the ombudsman brand that has been developed by ombudsman offices throughout Australia over the last 40 years. 


As noted in the main report, both Restaurant and Catering Australia and the Small Business Commissioner of Western Australia expressed concern that the title may actually prevent small businesses and family enterprises from approaching the new office. The Energy and Water Ombudsman New South Wales urged the committee to consider the name and replace it with a more accurate one.


Labor senators are concerned that the new small business ombudsman is described in the explanatory memorandum as a 'departmental official' who will receive corporate and staffing support from the department. One of the generally accepted core functions of an ombudsman is for the ombudsman to be able to independently and impartially investigate the actions of government agencies. This may prove difficult with the administrative arrangements and organisation of the small business ombudsman described in the bill as being structured within a departmental agency of government. Under clause 20 of the bill the minister may give written directions to the ombudsman, and the ombudsman must comply with these directions. 


The activities of the Commonwealth Ombudsman's office are governed by a number of Commonwealth laws, principally the Ombudsman Act 1976. The Commonwealth Ombudsman's office delivers an annual report which provides details of the numbers and types of complaints dealt with and the ways in which they are resolved. The Commonwealth Ombudsman must provide the minister with an annual report under section 46 of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013.


Labor senators are concerned that this bill requires the small business ombudsman to provide quarterly reports to the minister on the research and inquiries undertaken. Our principal concern goes to the lack of an effective arms-length separation of the powers between the small business ombudsman and the minister's office. The bill describes arrangements that could reasonably be described as a close working relationship with the minister's office and one that is not far removed from ongoing oversight by or influence of the minister. This is rightly reflected in the views expressed by some of the stakeholders in the inquiry. The office of the New South Wales Small Business Commissioner, for example, queries whether the level of direction able to be given to the ombudsman from the minister aligns with the references in the explanatory memorandum to the objective of impartiality. If the ombudsman is truly going to be able to make credible inquiries into the concerns of small businesses and family enterprises arising out of the legislation, policies and practices, the ombudsman needs to have the certainty that the minister will not alter any findings or recommendations made by the ombudsman.


In its current form, the provisions of the bill diminish the ombudsman's independence from the government of the day and risk limiting the ombudsman's ability to be non-partisan. Business Enterprise Centres Australia expressed the view that it would be preferable for the ombudsman to report directly to the parliament rather than to the minister. Labor senators consider the operation of the existing Commonwealth Ombudsman, particularly in relation to the government of the day, to be a more appropriate association and one that should be considered as the model to be applied to the role of the small business ombudsman. Failure to address this fundamental issue will result in a lowering of expectations by the community and the potential for the diminution over time of the respect and high regard Australians have for the role of ombudsmen.


Labor senators note the views of those expressing concerns regarding the advocacy function to be performed by the small business ombudsman. These concerns go to the combined role of advocacy on behalf of a group or individual and the role of an independent and impartial investigator as an ombudsman. Labor does not consider the advocacy functions set out for the small business ombudsman as being the primary role or function of an ombudsman. Rather it is Labor's view that these functions could be provided by the existing Australian Small Business Commissioner. This would allow for a clear separation of the two roles and maintain the independence and impartiality of the new small business ombudsman. 


In the Treasury's consultations on the exposure draft legislation for the small business ombudsman, the Australian and New Zealand Ombudsman Association, the Financial Ombudsman Service of Australia and the Association of Dispute Resolvers—LEADR and IAMA—all noted the advocacy function as being of considerable concern and inconsistent with the role of an independent ombudsman.


The Shopping Centre Council of Australia submitted that the use of the term 'ombudsman' in the title was misleading and should be changed to 'commissioner'. A similar view was expressed by the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. The Australian and New Zealand Ombudsman Association submitted to the Treasury and to the committee that it is clear that the role of the Small Business and Family Enterprise Agency is as an advocate, in both reality and perception. As such, it does not meet the independence criterion. They support the aims of the proposal to assist small business and family enterprise but strongly submit that it should be called something other than an ombudsman.


The minister has even acknowledged that the ombudsman who advocates a position regarding a particular issue would not be perceived as impartial in dealing with disputes relating to that issue. However, the minister maintains that the small business ombudsman or the ombudsman's staff will not conduct any dispute resolution processes but rather refer matters to outsourced alternative dispute resolution providers and that is this separation between dispute resolution and advocacy ensures the independence of the role.


Labor senators note the view expressed by the minister but consider nevertheless that the arrangements prescribed in the bill are inappropriate for an office being establish with the title of 'ombudsman' and fear that this will lead to confusion among small business owners, resulting in the underutilisation of the service. 


Labor senators consider that the ombudsman must be truly independent if he or she is to have the confidence of the community. The small business ombudsman bill includes a dispute resolution function but the bill designates this role to a secondary function with an emphasis on the ombudsman primarily being a concierge for complaints. Dispute resolution services are allocated to a panel of dispute resolution providers, and any role the ombudsman plays in the resolution of disputes is only minor. 


Regarding those able to provide dispute resolution services, the Mediator Standards Board noted in its submission to the consultations on the exposure draft of the legislation the need for those mediators that can perform dispute resolution services to be accredited under the National Mediator Accreditation System. Clause 72(1) of the bill provides that the ombudsman may publish a list of persons who have the qualifications or experience to conduct alternative dispute resolution processes to resolve disputes in relation to relevant actions. Clause 72(2) of the bill provides that the minister may, by legislative instrument, prescribe the qualifications or experience required for persons to be included on the list. Labor senators support the concerns of the Mediator Standards Board and urge the government to prescribe that those able to conduct alternative dispute resolution services are required to be accredited under the National Mediator Accreditation System. 


The Abbott government has unfairly raised the expectations of the small business sector in election commitments and statements since the Minister for Small Business announced the new small business ombudsman that would be able to effectively deal with and resolve small business issues. Labor senators are not convinced that the new role of the small business ombudsman has the statutory independence of an ombudsman and consider that the role prescribed in this bill is not comparable to an ombudsman. The new role of the small business ombudsman is not consistent with the accepted definition of an ombudsman and would lead to confusion and unmet expectation from those seeking an independent and impartial umpire to investigate matters they seek to pursue in a fair and impartial way. 


Labor senators support the views expressed by stakeholders in the report that the title 'ombudsman' should be reconsidered by the government. The dual roles of advocate and ombudsman are not consistent with the accepted definition of an ombudsman; nor is the regularity of the reporting requirements of the small business ombudsman and the powers of the minister to direct the ombudsman. While Labor supports the Senate passing these bills, Labor senators are mindful that Australian small business operators may underutilise the new office of the small business ombudsman as a result of these issues as prescribed in the bill.

If the ombudsman is truly going to be able to make credible inquiries into the concerns of small businesses and family enterprises arising out of the legislation, policies and practices, the ombudsman needs to have the certainty that the minister will not alter any findings or recommendations made by the ombudsman.


In its current form, the provisions of the bill diminish the ombudsman's independence from the government of the day and risk limiting the ombudsman's ability to be non-partisan. Business Enterprise Centres Australia expressed the view that it would be preferable for the ombudsman to report directly to the parliament rather than to the minister. Labor senators consider the operation of the existing Commonwealth Ombudsman, particularly in relation to the government of the day, to be a more appropriate association and one that should be considered as the model to be applied to the role of the small business ombudsman. Failure to address this fundamental issue will result in a lowering of expectations by the community and the potential for the diminution over time of the respect and high regard Australians have for the role of ombudsmen.


Labor senators note the views of those expressing concerns regarding the advocacy function to be performed by the small business ombudsman. These concerns go to the combined role of advocacy on behalf of a group or individual and the role of an independent and impartial investigator as an ombudsman. Labor does not consider the advocacy functions set out for the small business ombudsman as being the primary role or function of an ombudsman. Rather it is Labor's view that these functions could be provided by the existing Australian Small Business Commissioner. This would allow for a clear separation of the two roles and maintain the independence and impartiality of the new small business ombudsman. 


In the Treasury's consultations on the exposure draft legislation for the small business ombudsman, the Australian and New Zealand Ombudsman Association, the Financial Ombudsman Service of Australia and the Association of Dispute Resolvers—LEADR and IAMA—all noted the advocacy function as being of considerable concern and inconsistent with the role of an independent ombudsman.


The Shopping Centre Council of Australia submitted that the use of the term 'ombudsman' in the title was misleading and should be changed to 'commissioner'. A similar view was expressed by the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. The Australian and New Zealand Ombudsman Association submitted to the Treasury and to the committee that it is clear that the role of the Small Business and Family Enterprise Agency is as an advocate, in both reality and perception. As such, it does not meet the independence criterion. They support the aims of the proposal to assist small business and family enterprise but strongly submit that it should be called something other than an ombudsman.


The minister has even acknowledged that the ombudsman who advocates a position regarding a particular issue would not be perceived as impartial in dealing with disputes relating to that issue. However, the minister maintains that the small business ombudsman or the ombudsman's staff will not conduct any dispute resolution processes but rather refer matters to outsourced alternative dispute resolution providers and that is this separation between dispute resolution and advocacy ensures the independence of the role.


Labor senators note the view expressed by the minister but consider nevertheless that the arrangements prescribed in the bill are inappropriate for an office being establish with the title of 'ombudsman' and fear that this will lead to confusion among small business owners, resulting in the underutilisation of the service. 


Labor senators consider that the ombudsman must be truly independent if he or she is to have the confidence of the community. The small business ombudsman bill includes a dispute resolution function but the bill designates this role to a secondary function with an emphasis on the ombudsman primarily being a concierge for complaints. Dispute resolution services are allocated to a panel of dispute resolution providers, and any role the ombudsman plays in the resolution of disputes is only minor. 


Regarding those able to provide dispute resolution services, the Mediator Standards Board noted in its submission to the consultations on the exposure draft of the legislation the need for those mediators that can perform dispute resolution services to be accredited under the National Mediator Accreditation System. Clause 72(1) of the bill provides that the ombudsman may publish a list of persons who have the qualifications or experience to conduct alternative dispute resolution processes to resolve disputes in relation to relevant actions. Clause 72(2) of the bill provides that the minister may, by legislative instrument, prescribe the qualifications or experience required for persons to be included on the list. Labor senators support the concerns of the Mediator Standards Board and urge the government to prescribe that those able to conduct alternative dispute resolution services are required to be accredited under the National Mediator Accreditation System. 


The Abbott government has unfairly raised the expectations of the small business sector in election commitments and statements since the Minister for Small Business announced the new small business ombudsman that would be able to effectively deal with and resolve small business issues. Labor senators are not convinced that the new role of the small business ombudsman has the statutory independence of an ombudsman and consider that the role prescribed in this bill is not comparable to an ombudsman. The new role of the small business ombudsman is not consistent with the accepted definition of an ombudsman and would lead to confusion and unmet expectation from those seeking an independent and impartial umpire to investigate matters they seek to pursue in a fair and impartial way. 


Labor senators support the views expressed by stakeholders in the report that the title 'ombudsman' should be reconsidered by the government. The dual roles of advocate and ombudsman are not consistent with the accepted definition of an ombudsman; nor is the regularity of the reporting requirements of the small business ombudsman and the powers of the minister to direct the ombudsman. While Labor supports the Senate passing these bills, Labor senators are mindful that Australian small business operators may underutilise the new office of the small business ombudsman as a result of these issues as prescribed in the bill.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (15:07):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) and the Minister for Employment (Senator Abetz) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to the Commissioner of the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption and to meetings of the Cabinet.


I think it is important to reflect, yet again, on the discussion we have had in relation to the trade union royal commission because ministers attempt to say such questions are repetitive, that we are just rehashing old territory and then they start getting even more defensive. Once again, I got a lecture from Senator Brandis about my tone—though I think this was a first. They are issues that, fortunately, the President has indicated he will take away and look at as well. But it reminds me of the suggestion recently from Laura Tingle that some things for this government are almost like new religions. National security was one recently, but even the appropriate behaviour of royal commissioners seems to be another—how dare one ask questions. The point here is that the questions that are being asked are not repetitive. This story seems to be evolving.


The answers provided by both Senator Abetz and Senator Brandis today, with respect, are somewhat desperate if not pathetic. The comparison that Senator Brandis made to today about the future behaviour of former politicians was extraordinarily weak. We saw that Senator Abetz needed to correct his reference to a past appointment of Commissioner Heydon by, he thought at first, Neville Wran, but, as it turns out, it was Bob Carr. But, with respect, it is much like the debate about whether it is a fundraiser, an unsuccessful fundraiser, a Liberal Party event or whatever. The real point is that Commissioner Heydon, when he was a commissioner into trade union behaviour, chose to accept an invitation to a Liberal Party event and it was clear, by virtue of it calling for donations, that it was also a fundraiser. Now, he tells us that he overlooked certain connections. It seems as if he overlooked them a couple of times.


The point I made in question time was that that is all well and good—all of us overlook things on occasions—but Commissioner Heydon needs to apply the same standards that he applies to those whom he is investigating. As a recent article by Helen Davidson and Lenore Taylor points out, this has not been the case during the course of the royal commission. He has on several occasions admonished people. Indeed, Senator Abetz, it was not Mr Shorten who was highlighted as one of the three people on this occasion; it was Ralph Blewitt, it was Julia Gillard and it was Leah Charlson who were all admonished for overlooking something once—not twice, three times or four times over several months.


The core issue is whether Commissioner Heydon's position in this case has become partisan. That is the core issue. What is evolving are, of course, other associations that are important. This gives me a chance to reflect on a comment that I made yesterday about a link between the invitation—and I was not quite sure who but it might have been the Law Council or the Law Society of New South Wales that had a link to this invitation that I questioned, but, as it turns out, it was actually the New South Wales Bar Association. Professional associations of lawyers, in my view, do need to be careful about their party political links and connections because, at the end of the day, despite quite eminent appointments in the past, their partisanship in the future may become an issue as it has in relation to this royal commission. 


The other associations, as it turns out over the last day or so, have highlighted the close relationship that Commissioner Heydon has to the now Prime Minister through the constitutional monarchy legal committee, through his position on the selection panel for Mr Abbott's Rhodes scholarship, and one wonders what else. The key issue here, though, is that the Prime Minister has failed to appoint someone to this trade union royal commission who can maintain a sense of balance and impartiality. This is the Prime Minister's fail and he has failed because we all know it has always been a witch-hunt. (Time expired)

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2015-08-18,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (15:12):  The venom and hatred that the Australian Labor Party have been spewing forth against Dyson Heydon is motivated by one reason and one reason alone—that is, the revelations that have emerged from this royal commission. There is the revelation that Mr Shorten hid from the Australian people for eight years the fact that he had been given a $40,000 donation in the form of a paid staff member to be his personal campaign manager. That person was, it appears, misdescribed—some would use harsher words—as a research officer for the particular company, in circumstances where he was clearly not so engaged.


How do we know all this? Before he had to give his evidence, Mr Shorten changed the documentation to delete 'nil' from his declaration to tell the Australian people that somehow, somewhere, a $40,000 contribution was made. How you could overlook such a matter is, quite frankly, beyond me. Why it would be misdescribed is also beyond me. But not all the evidence has been given. What we do know is that the Labor Party have changed their own declarations in relation to Mr Shorten's campaign for his seat those eight years ago.


We also know that, because of the royal commission—without any findings or recommendations being made—Mr Shorten's very, very good mate and successor in title in the Australian Workers Union had to resign as Government Whip in the upper house in Victoria. We know that. This is all about payback. It is about revenge. It is about shooting the messenger. It is about hoping to besmirch Mr Heydon in such a way that the actions that have now been exposed will not be seen in the light they deserve to be seen in.


But for the royal commission, we would never have known that the Australian Workers Union, led by Mr Shorten, had traded away workers' entitlements in exchange for what appears to be donations to the union. So cleaners can be paid less, mushroom pickers can be paid less, circus workers can be paid less—indeed, use was made of the Work Choices regime to ensure that these conditions were driven down by the Australian Workers Union. And—surprise, surprise—the businesses that benefited from these sleazy deals just happened to make donations to the Australian Workers Union. But for the royal commission, these sleazy dealings would never have been exposed. But for the royal commission, the Australian people would still be in the dark, like the mushroom pickers at Chiquita Mushrooms. But for the royal commission, we would not know—and this would have to be one of the lowest acts of all—that moneys donated by companies to assist people with drug and alcohol issues were misapplied; 80 per cent went to the CFMEU and only 20 per cent to the proper fund. Can you get any lower than taking money from the needs of those who have alcohol and drug issues?


What do we know about the money that goes into the Australian Workers Union? What do we know about the money that goes into the CFMEU? Thousands—indeed, over the years, millions—of dollars have gone directly to the Australian Labor Party. Their source of funding has been exposed by this royal commission: money from shonky deals with employers and money skimmed off charitable organisations goes to the unions, which in turn donate to the Labor Party. This is what motivates this attack on Mr Heydon, and I suggest to the Labor Party that they take into account the Law Council of Australia's admonition today to stop it. (Time expired)

"Gallagher, Sen Katy",ALP,2015-08-18,"



Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory) (15:18):  I rise to take note of answers from Senator Brandis and Senator Abetz in question time today. Defending the indefensible appears to be the new philosophy of the coalition government, and today we heard more attempts from an embattled government to defend what has been outed to the community as what everyone now clearly understands are the political motivations behind the royal commission into trade unions.


In question time today Senator Abetz and the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, were desperately trying to defend a royal commission that has focused a lot of its attention on previous Labor leaders. In the last week I think we have all seen it exposed as a political witch-hunt, which we have always said it was. The royal commissioner, Mr Dyson Heydon, summed it up perfectly himself when he said that the judiciary had to possess 'a measure of independence from the wrath of disgruntled governments or other groups'. We all know that a strong, democratic nation is built upon the pillar of an impartial and independent justice system, and one that is seen at all times to be above the political fray.


This government appears to be happy to trash that framework, and to use the royal commission as a vehicle to pursue its political opponents and as a smokescreen to cover up its own lack of courage to tackle some of its ideas in relation to industrial relations itself. Perhaps the government is still burnt from Work Choices and hides behind the protection of a royal commission. 


The episode we have seen playing out over the royal commission and the way that the government has responded exemplifies everything that is wrong with this government, and puts it out there for all to see very clearly just how low this government has reduced itself to. 


In responses in question time—and this is symptomatic of this government's approach—we have seen ministers ignore obvious problems, like the acceptance by the royal commissioner of the opportunity to give the Sir Garfield Barwick address. They deny that there was a problem and they dig deeper in defence—really dogged, blind defence—of a mate and colleague. This is despite very clear evidence and opinion from people with experience in how to handle matters of bias and potential conflicts of interest—providing very extensive responses to some of the problems presented from the position the royal commissioner finds himself in.


There is no doubt from where we sit that this royal commission was always politically motivated—spending $61 million on a royal commission to pursue your political opponents. It was done before with the previous Liberal government inquiry into trade unions, and it is being done again. There is some irony in this pursuit of political opponents and the expenditure of this amount of money in this place this week, when the cleaners who clean this building are undertaking protected action because they are after a $1.80 pay rise. It really shows how wrong this government's priorities are. 


When you look at the question of bias and of apprehended bias, the test is whether a 'fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge'—in this case the royal commissioner—'might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question before them'.


We have watched this situation roll out over the past week, and people on the streets are talking about this subject. I do not think that I have heard even one person say that they think there is not at least a perception of apprehended bias presented by this unfortunate situation. More than that, we have heard the unfortunate response from the government to this situation and have seen their doggedness in trying to defend a colleague and friend, and they are refusing to address this problem. Whilst it remains unaddressed there will not be any faith in the royal commission, in its processes or, indeed, in the report that it will hand down if it proceeds to an end. It again shows the lack of leadership at a political level across the country.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2015-08-18,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:23):  I too rise to take note of the answers but more particularly to take note of the questions. Here we are at a time when South Australia has the highest rate of unemployment in the nation and people are leaving jobs, and yet every question in question time from those opposite has gone to the issue of this royal commission. 


No matter what Senator Gallagher says about apprehended bias, it does not change the fact that the royal commission is exposing is deep-seated corruption within the union movement. A number of things have been revealed during this royal commission about the bribes, the blackmail, the bullying and the criminal offences that, as a direct result of this royal commission, have seen union organisers arrested and charged with criminal offences. We have heard about the tight linkages between the union movement and members opposite. As a result of the royal commission we have seen Mr Shorten, as Leader of the Opposition, scramble to correct the record after eight years of hiding a $40,000 donation to his campaign. He has scrambled to correct the record before the light of transparency provided by this royal commission could be shone onto his circumstances. Those opposite are defending the indefensible not just because of that conduct but, more importantly, because of the things that are important to Australians—things like the economy and jobs for our citizens and our children. The union movement is now running a scare campaign against initiatives of this government around things like free trade agreements. This government has signed three free trade agreements that former governments, particularly the former Labor government, were never able to achieve, yet we have seen the Electrical Trade Union blatantly lying on TV about the impact on jobs of the free trade agreement. Anyone who watches TV at the moment will see the consistent ads coming up—always designed to tug at the heartstrings—of a dad talking to his son and saying how jobs will not be available because Tony Abbott did not choose him. 


In hearings of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, officers from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade were questioned at length about this issue by Labor Party members of the committee. What became clear, in answer after answer after answer, was that that campaign by the unions is just wrong. It is inaccurate and they are peddling lies as a scare campaign because they see this as an opportunity to bolster the political stakes for the Labor Party heading into the next election. The department provided quite detailed explanations and it is very clear that China has been brought into line with most other countries in terms of how Australia deals with them. All workers who come in have to have the relevant qualifications, there has to be market testing, jobs have to be advertised and Australians have to get first choice. There are time limits for anyone who is brought in, and they have to be paid Australian wages and work under Australian conditions. All of the claims of the union movement are wrong. That is why it is so disappointing that the opposition would spend the whole of question time today debating the motivations of the commissioner rather than addressing the substance of the evidence which has emerged during the commission about the fact that the union movement—which now represents a very small percentage of the Australian workforce—is, for political reasons, actually undermining measures taken by this government to create jobs, grow our economy and provide our young people with a future. 


If there is a failure of leadership, if there is a failure of judgement, surely it is in the focus of the opposition on short-term political expediency as opposed to calling their supporters—and I am the first to acknowledge that unions do have a place—to account for the corrupt activity, for the lies which are economic vandalism and for sabotaging the future of this  nation.

Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:28):  The previous speaker is concerned that we spent the whole of question time asking questions about whether Commissioner Heydon is credible and whether he should continue, because of his links to the Liberal Party. Do you know what, Senator Fawcett? It is our job on this side to ask questions. You talked about South Australia—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Bilyk, could you address your remarks through the chair.




Senator BILYK:
  Sorry, Mr Deputy President. Of course, Senator Fawcett has now left the chamber, but I did not see him standing up and defending the people of South Australia on the issue about whether or not submarines should be built in South Australia. Nor have I seen him stand up and defend the people of South Australia with regard to what is happening with job development in their state—or any of the other issues in that state. So I do not know that he is quite the right person to be questioning us about the questions we are asking. We have every right to ask questions about Commissioner Heydon. It is not disrespectful; it is asking questions and seeking answers. To be honest, I was a bit surprised that my questions got such a reaction from those on the other side, who interjected so loudly and behaved so badly. They were questions like: 'When was the Prime Minister's office first aware that Commissioner Heydon was giving the address at a Liberal Party function? Was the Prime Minister invited? Did any of the politician lawyers raise any concerns with the Prime Minister's office regarding Commissioner Heydon's lack of impartiality in addressing the New South Wales Liberal Party while the royal commission was still afoot?' The last question I asked was about the Prime Minister saying last year that he trusted Dyson Heydon's judgement and he was very happy to put us—the government—in the hands of Dyson Heydon and see where this commission went. The question after that was, 'Does the PM still have this continued trust in Commissioner Heydon based on the fact that a partisan inquiry is exactly what he wanted?'


I was amazed at the response that got—the interjections and the yelling at me. I thought it was absolutely surprising, and it makes me think they doth protest too much. We had what I would call a rather disappointing question time today and we are pretty used to it from those on that side. The Royal Commissioner—




Senator Bushby:
  If you asked better questions you would get better answers.




Senator BILYK:
  It was the catcalling, more or less. It was the interjections and the completely over-the-top reaction of those on your side, Senator Bushby—through you, Mr Deputy President, to the senator. But the royal commissioner, Mr Dyson Heydon, is another of the Prime Minister's captain's picks. According to the Guide to Judicial Conduct, published for the Council of Chief Justices Australia and New Zealand:


Although active participation in or membership of a political party before appointment would not of itself justify allegations of judicial bias or an appearance of bias, it is expected that a judge on appointment will sever all ties with political parties. An appearance of continuing ties such as might occur by attendance at political gatherings, political fundraising events or through contribution to a political party, should be avoided.


While those opposite seek to defend the trade union royal commissioner and his continued role I would like to cite some other advice given by a very senior legal figure as to why Justice Heydon should disqualify himself. In 2002 this figure said:


The law compels judges who have such a bias or may reasonably be thought to have such a bias to disqualify themselves (from sitting on cases).


In 2011 the same person wrote, 'the appearance of departure from neutrality is a ground of disqualification'. And you know who wrote that? Dyson Heydon himself wrote that.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Fawcett on a point of order.




Senator Fawcett:
  I rise on a point of order regarding standing order 193—reflections on members. I want to point out the inaccuracy of the reflection of the senator opposite saying that I have never raised my voice in this place regarding submarine construction in South Australia. In more than a dozen speeches here as well as opinion pieces, members opposite well know, I am a strong advocate, and I seek her to withdraw and correct the record—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order. If you claim to have been misrepresented there are abilities to correct that and it is not up to the chair to determine the truth or otherwise or accuracy of what other senators may say in this place.




Senator BILYK:
  Obviously today I am upsetting a few people over there—



Senator Abetz interjecting—




Senator BILYK:
  Just hitting a few nails on the head I think, Senator Abetz. That advice came from Dyson Heydon himself— (Time expired)

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (15:49):  I rise to speak under standing order 75 on 'the need for a royal commissioner to appear to be unprejudiced and impartial'. Just last week, Commissioner Heydon accepted an invitation to a Liberal Party fundraiser, the Sir Garfield Barwick lecture, as we have heard. I think, first, it is interesting that the exchange of emails was between Commissioner Heydon's office and Mr Gregory Burton, who, I might add, is widely tipped to be the next Liberal candidate for Mackellar. On the email to Commissioner Heydon from Gregory Burton, he reaffirmed the commissioner's knowledge that this was a Liberal Party function of the Liberal Party lawyers professional branch. This was made clear to Commissioner Heydon by the organisers of the fundraiser. Second, when the commissioner publicly withdrew from the invitation after The Sydney Morning Herald acquired the Liberal Party branded advertisement for the Sir Garfield Barwick lecture, the commissioner claimed that he had 'overlooked' the fact that this was a Liberal event.


The facts are that Commissioner Dyson Heydon is undisputedly one of Australia's leading legal minds, and he has enjoyed an esteemed legal career, having had the honour of serving as Justice of the High Court of Australia. When you look at the correspondence between Gregory Burton and the commissioner's office, it shows that he either had or should have had full knowledge of the event's being of a political affiliation, and at best he ought to have known, when you look at the email. To say that he, as a former High Court justice, 'overlooked' this I think stretches the imagination.


The flyer had a Liberal Party logo on the back, and it had a photo of the commissioner and a photo of Sir Garfield Barwick. On the back of that, it had a form to fill out to pay for tickets, to be directed to the Liberal Party. It even allowed you to make donations to the event, to the Liberal Party, even if you did not want to attend. The flyer and the correspondence were clear.


This royal commission is just now showing itself for what the Prime Minister intended it to be: a taxpayer funded political exercise to go after the Prime Minister's opponents.


I think the most interesting revelation out of this is another candid display of the government's hypocrisy. Let's go back as early as January this year. We had the government and Senator Brandis in a war of words with the Human Rights Commissioner, Professor Gillian Triggs. I quote Senator Brandis on 11 January:


… Professor Triggs' decision to delay holding an inquiry into the issue of children in detention … can only be interpreted, and has been interpreted by many, many people in Australia, as an act that looked partisan.


However, this became much more serious when Senator Brandis called for Professor Triggs's resignation as Human Rights Commissioner. Senator Brandis said:


The position is, I'm sorry to say, that the Government has lost confidence in Professor Triggs.


Senator Brandis was criticised for attacking Professor Triggs. He defended the concept of statutory independence of the Human Rights Commission:


Of course, in most respects the commission is independent—and it is important that it should be so. That independence protects, among other things, the exercise of its powers of inquiry and report …


He went further again. In an opinion piece in The Australian, Senator Brandis goes further:


As I have said many times, an institution such as the Human Rights Commission must be like Caesar's wife. Given that its functions require it, on occasions, to criticise the government of the day, it is absolutely critical to its credibility that it should have an unblemished reputation for freedom from political bias.


…   …   …


In a democracy, it is not character assassination to call a public official to account or to subject their performance to public scrutiny. That applies to the Human Rights Commission as much as to any other executive agency.


So let's not have this debate from those opposite, saying we should not criticise, we should not examine and we should not look. It is entirely appropriate, under Senator Brandis's own hand.


I do not know if Senator Brandis's memory has failed him, but this seems strangely similar to what is playing out now with Commissioner Heydon: (1) we have an independent statutory officer, Commissioner Dyson Heydon; and (2) we have an act that looks partisan, the acceptance of an invitation to speak at a New South Wales Liberal Party fundraiser. There are some serious questions to ask of this government in respect of that: (1) why is the government now jumping to the defence of Commissioner Heydon but asking Professor Triggs to resign; (2) how does Commissioner Heydon still have this government's confidence; and (3) how can the Prime Minister and Senator Brandis now say that the act of Commissioner Heydon accepting an invitation from the New South Wales Liberal Party to attend a fundraiser was not partisan? But let me help Senator Brandis—I am sure he would not particularly want me to—because I think the answer is quite simple. On the one hand, we have a statutory officer who is an open critic of the government, so of course the government must relentlessly accuse Professor Triggs of bias and demand her resignation after she released a report unfavourable to the government. On the other hand, we have the head of the government's politically motivated inquiry into its enemies, so of course the Prime Minister will honourably defend Commissioner Heydon and assure the Australian people that his report will be unbiased and unprejudiced. I think it is called 'hypocrisy'.


When we turn to the PM's judgement in this, this again raises significant doubt over the Prime Minister's judgement. He has pushed unfounded criticism of the Human Rights Commissioner on the matter of bias. He has defended the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, whose bias was arrogant and intentional, as was clear to every Australian watching question time. Now he defends clear bias on the part of the head of this royal commission into his political enemies. This is a person who should not be Prime Minister. This person is struggling to maintain even the confidence of his own colleagues, but I can say to you, Mr President, he is struggling also to maintain the confidence of the Australian people.


The question is not direct bias; the question is really apprehended bias. But the question that must also must be addressed is: how can the Attorney General still say the royal commission is truly independent and free from bias? It is a question that the Attorney-General must and should answer. In an address at the opening of the G20 Anti-Corruption Roundtable on 28 February 2014 in Sydney, Senator Brandis affirmed the concept of judicial independence:


An effective, independent and impartial judiciary is an essential part of any modern system of governance.


I would like the record to reflect that I agree with Senator Brandis. The judiciary must be independent and impartial, and it must appear so and be perceived to be so. Dyson Heydon has to make decisions on admission of evidence before the commission and incorporation of evidence in the final report of the commission. Justice Dyson Heydon accepting an invitation to speak at a New South Wales Liberal fundraiser whilst commissioner of the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption does amount, I think, to either the perception or a reasonable apprehension of bias


There are significant problems with the royal commission. There are significant problems with the way the commissioner has acted towards witnesses. Further to that, in his response to Mr Burton the commissioner made clear that he would be willing to attend such an event as a speaker after he was no longer royal commissioner. It shows, I think, that there is some association between the commissioner and a political party, namely the Liberal Party. He was aware there was a conflict of interest at the time he was invited, he accepted the invitation, and any fair-minded person would say that amounts to a reasonable apprehension of bias. It is even quite possible that it could be viewed as something further.


What makes this event even worse is that the Australian taxpayer is footing the bill for this. The commission was meant to wind up and have a report issued in October; however, conveniently for the government the reporting period was extended even further, to the end of this year, and $80 million of taxpayers' money is now being spent on a witch-hunt.



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Ludwig. Just before I call Senator McGrath, I just remind senators to be cautious in how they reflect on members of the other place.

"McGrath, Sen James",LP,2015-08-18,"



Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland) (15:59):  I also rise to speak on this matter of public importance. I will fully defend the professionalism and the impartiality of Dyson Heydon AC, QC. The senator opposite said that the royal commission had significant problems. I think the significant problems that have been identified are those affecting the union movement and corrupt union bosses across Australia. The issue that the Labor Party has with Justice Heydon is not any allegations about impartiality; it is the corruption and the badness that has been taking place in the union movement over a number of years. The royal commission has done vital work to uncover questionable dealings by union bosses. Criminal charges have been recommended against at least three of the most senior officials of the militant construction union the CFMEU. No less than four people have been arrested in association with the dealings of the CFMEU thanks to the work of the royal commission. A series of unions have been implicated in secret slush fund scandals that have finally come to light. We should not forget that the Leader of the Opposition, a secretary of the Australian Workers Union, traded away the penalty rates of low-paid workers, had his union receive hundreds of thousands of dollars in unexplained payments and failed to disclose over $40,000 donated to his political campaign by a company with which his union was dealing. Of course, he remembered this hours and days before his own appearance before the royal commission.


The Labor Party and their paymasters in the union movement have been engaged in a desperate attack on the royal commissioner. Labor and the unions are desperate to bring down Justice Heydon because of the work he is bringing to light. He is shining sunlight into the nefarious activities of various elements of the trade union movement. The ACTU has claimed by media release that the commission is untenable and that the commissioner's actions are an example of bias. Yet, when given the opportunity to bring a claim of bias to the royal commission, they prevaricated. They clearly do not know whether they have enough evidence to even argue a bias case, let alone win a case. I would like to read from the media statement of the President of the Law Council of Australia, Duncan McConnel: 


The public attacks on the commissioner being played out through the media are unacceptable and damage the basis on which tribunals and courts operate. 


He went on to say:


The person who sits as a royal commissioner is entitled to the same respect, inside and outside of the inquiry, as a judge in court.


In this case, Mr John Dyson Heydon AC QC is a highly regarded former judicial officer. They concurred that the proper place for an application is the commission itself, yet the Australian Council of Trade Unions cannot decide whether it has grounds to make one. 


What I think we should do is have a look at the career of Justice Heydon in terms of what a brilliant legal mind we have here. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Sydney. He was a Rhodes Scholar for New South Wales in 1964. He graduated with a Master of Arts and a Bachelor of Civil Laws from Oxford University. He was admitted to the New South Wales Bar in 1973. He was a professor of law at age 30 and a QC in 1987. He was Dean of the Sydney Law School. He was appointed by a Labor Premier, Mr Bob Carr, to the New South Wales Court of Appeal. He was a former judge with the High Court of Australia and he was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia. Justice Heydon is one of the most respected jurists in Australia. The unfortunate and unacceptable attacks that the Labor Party and their allies are throwing at Justice Heydon in this mud fest are a sad indication of their own lack of belief and their own lack of certainty about the allegations that are coming out of the royal commission. 


What is also interesting is that sometimes the word hypocrisy is thrown about this chamber—I am unsure about the correct term and whether it is unparliamentary—but Labor party members have been involved in organising their own legal lectures at which serving judges have spoken. Now they are claiming, hypocritically, that Commissioner Heydon's decision not to attend a similar function organised by the Liberal Party proves bias. Their events include Justice Kirby delivering the Neville Wran lecture, established by the Labor Party, while a serving High Court judge. In that speech he noted that he has delivered lectures associated with the Liberal Party as well. Luke Foley, the New South Wales Labor politician, delivered the lecture this year. Justices Kirby and Gordon delivered the Lionel Murphy memorial lecture on separate occasions which were initially funded by financial grants from Labor governments. This is very similar the Garfield Barwick lecture, which Commissioner Heydon was asked to deliver and which commemorates the contribution of a former Attorney-General who became a High Court judge. The Australian Society for Labor Lawyers—and that sounds like a fun bunch of people, doesn't it?—is lawyers who are sympathetic to the Labor Party or members of the Labor Party and has had papers presented to it by Justice Michael Kirby while in the New South Wales Court of Appeal in 1984; Mary Gaudron while as a High Court justice in 1987; Michael McHugh while in the New South Wales Court of Appeal in 1987; the ACT Chief Justice and Chief Magistrate in 1988; and Justice Spender of the Federal Court in 1985.


When Labor get up here and attack Justice Heydon, it is clear that they have failed to look in their own closet in terms of their own corporate, political and legal history before they have made the attacks on Justice Heydon. The real reason that Labor are attacking Justice Heydon is the work being undertaken by the royal commission. For those listening at home I have a top 10 list of interesting developments that have come out of the royal commission. In the remaining two minutes and 40 seconds I have, I hope I get to go through the top 10 concerning developments that have come out of the royal commission. This will give an indication of why Labor and their paymasters in the union movement are concerned about the good work—the impartial work—that has been undertaken by Justice Heydon. 


We found out: (1) in Victoria, Comanchero bikies were employed as debt collectors in the building industry; (2) CFMEU officials Brian Parker and Darren Greenfield consorted with underworld crime figure George Alex, whose friends and colleagues included the leader of the Rebels bikie gang—a former Comanchero—and ISIS recruits Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar; (3) construction company Boral suffered a 75 per cent reduction in its market share after refusing to comply with the CFMEU's unlawful demands; (4) the private details over 300 construction workers were leaked by the construction industry super fund Cbus to the CFMEU; (5) John Setka abused and threatened workers; (6) the ACT police arrested a former construction union organiser and previous Labor Party sub-branch president, Fihi Kivalu, after evidence to the commission that he had demanded tens of thousands of dollars in payments from tradesmen in return for getting work. (7) officials of the HSU pressured their staff to cheat online right-of-entry tests in the names of their organisers. (8) the Australian Workers Union added workers to its membership roll without the knowledge or consent of those workers; (9) the Australian Workers Union arranged to have a super fund pay its own assistant secretary $93,000 for 2½ days work; (10) the Australian Workers Union received hundreds of thousands of dollars in unexplained payments from series of companies.


But it is actually the top 11—I did miss out Bill Shorten. Bill Shorten, the leader of the Labor Party forgot that when he was running for election that $40,000 was expended on his behalf in payments to his campaign manager. And they are the real reasons why Labor is going over Justice Heydon—it is revenge. Labor know they have been caught out and they want to have revenge on the commissioner who caught them out in terms of the skulduggery and the dirty deals that have been done for years by the Labor Party and the union movement.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2015-08-18,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (16:09):  I rise to speak on the need for a royal commissioner to appear to be unprejudiced and impartial, which is clearly an important thing. What we are debating today goes to the very heart of the integrity of our legal system—that justice should not only be done, but should be seen to be done. To quote a 2011 judgement in British American Tobacco Australia Services Limited and Laurie:


It is fundamental to the administration of justice that the judge be neutral.


Those words are very applicable today, as they come from Justice Dyson Heydon during his time as a justice of the High Court of Australia. The principle applies to judges, tribunal members, and, yes, royal commissioners. It is crucial to maintaining public confidence in the system.


Let us look at some facts here. The Trade Union Royal Commission was established in 2014 by the Abbott government. The same Liberal government appointed former Justice Heydon as the royal commissioner. Under the watch of Commissioner Heydon, the commission has investigated the operations of the Liberal Party's political opponents. In April 2014, there was an email exchange between Mr Heydon and the organisers of the Sir Garfield Barwick lecture in which the connections between the event and the Liberal Party were spelled out. The invitation promoting Heydon's appearance clearly said:


Cheques should be made payable to the Liberal Party of Australia.


And


… all proceeds from this event will be applied to state election campaigning.


Let us put aside our opinion of whether the royal commissioner is in fact biased; it is the appearance of bias that is important here.


The royal commission certainly appears to be politically motivated. It comes as the party of WorkChoices has waged an attack on people's rights at work. This royal commission was meant to lay the groundwork for further attacks on things like penalty rates. The royal commissioner has got to be considered alongside the government's other attacks on trade unions—the attempts yesterday to reintroduce the ABCC, the attempt yesterday to tie unions up in red tape. This is the context of the appearance of bias.


The event in question, the Sir Garfield Barwick lecture, is clearly a partisan event. It is a New South Wales Liberal Party fundraiser. Then we find out that Mr Heydon—himself a Rhodes scholar—was on the panel that gave the Rhodes scholarship to one Mr Tony Abbott. David Mann has written one jibe at the time was that the scholarship was given to a second-grade footballer, third-rate academic and fourth-class politician. What should happen now?


As Justice Heydon said in 2002:


The law compels judges who have such a bias or may reasonably be thought to have such a bias to disqualify themselves from sitting on cases.


Let us now look at the words of Attorney-General George Brandis:


The political impartiality of the commission [has] been fatally compromised.


That was not about this case; that was about the Australian Human Rights Commission President, Gillian Triggs. Imagine if Ms Triggs had attended a fundraiser for one of the parties opposed to this government? Imagine the calls from the government for the commissioner to step down. Similarly, if a judge was discovered to be raising money for the prosecution, there would be a mistrial and the case would be over. That is what has to happen here. Any pretence of independence of the trade union royal commission is now gone. The royal commission must be immediately terminated.


We have got to stop this tit-for-tat pushing of party political agendas. Australians do not want this government to operate in this he-said she-said manner. We have got to get back to a situation where people have trust in government and trust in the impartiality, particularly of royal commissions. Royal commissions sit there at the pinnacle of our system of inquiries. It is absolutely critical that they are held above reproach, at the highest levels of community regard. They have got to be impeccable otherwise there is such a corrosive influence on the public's assessment of the impartiality of royal commissions and of government itself. The government must put politics aside and focus on governing.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2015-08-18,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (16:14):  I too rise to speak on this matter of public importance, the need for a royal commissioner to appear to be unprejudiced and impartial. Is it any wonder that the Abbott government is so sensitive to this issue of the royal commission and the role of Mr Heydon as the royal commissioner? It is very obvious that he was invited to a Liberal Party fundraiser. Any fair-minded person who looks at that invitation can see for themselves that it was and is a Liberal Party fundraiser, with funds going to two state campaigns. It has the Liberal Party logo all over it, and Mr Heydon accepted an invitation to speak at that Liberal fundraising event. Those are the facts and they cannot be disputed.


The facts are there, and that is why those opposite in the Abbott government are so incredibly sensitive to this matter and will put any kind of spin on it, the sort of spin we have heard over the last couple of days, to try to say it is something else. Anyone with an interest in this matter, or indeed anyone who sees the invitation, can see for themselves it is a Liberal Party fundraiser, and indeed Mr Heydon agreed to speak at it.


I want to look at the principles of impartiality and prejudice, because they are clear in the national guide to court officers. It reads:


An appearance of continuing ties, such as might occur by attendance at political gatherings, political fund raising events or through contributions to a political party should be avoided.


Nothing could be clearer than that, and we have established that Mr Heydon accepted an invitation to speak at a Liberal Party fundraiser. He accepted that invitation and he received emails which clearly stated it was a Liberal Party fundraiser. So that principle in the national court guidelines is certainly breached in that context. Mr Heydon himself, as many of us have said in this place, said in 2011:


It is fundamental to the administration of justice that the judge be neutral. It is for this reason that the appearance of departure from neutrality is a ground of disqualification.


And the quote goes on. So again there is no neutrality in the acceptance of an invitation to speak at a Liberal Party fundraiser. And just yesterday the Prime Minister, so desperate to keep his own job—because the royal commission and Mr Heydon were another captain's pick—misquoted Julian Burnside QC, who said he believed Justice Heydon was an honourable man. Mr Burnside recently said he believed Justice Heydon was an honourable man, but that the government had misquoted him.


What Julian Burnside had said was:


I think he is an honourable person and I think in the circumstances an honourable person would step aside.


The Prime Minister, never one to let the truth get in the way of his spin, only used a selection of what Julian Burnside QC said, stating, 'Dyson Heydon is man of honour'. And of course he did not finish Julian Burnside's complete quote, because Julian Burnside did not put spin on it as the Prime Minister did. The bit that the Prime Minister forgot was that Julian Burnside said, 'In the circumstances, an honourable person would step aside.' And that is what Mr Heydon should do. He should step aside.


Mr Heydon clearly knew it was a Liberal Party fundraiser because the email's heading had that and indeed the body of the email had it. In fact, he has strongly criticised a witness who appeared before him in the royal commission for not reading her documents so thoroughly. It seems that what applies to witnesses does not apply to the commissioner himself. We all know that ignorance is not a defence, and I am sure Mr Heydon knows that. It is time that this witch-hunt of a royal commission be concluded and the now tainted Mr Heydon step down. Never mind the fine record he may have had; he has well and truly overstepped the line, and it is time for him to resign that post at the royal commission.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2015-08-18,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland) (16:19):  Unfortunately this is not question time but statement time, so I cannot ask Senator Lines some questions or get answers. But I would still like to put some rhetorical questions on the record. 


I listened to Senator Lines, and she was saying that it is unacceptable for Justice Heydon to accept an invitation to a Liberal Party organised event. The question I would ask Senator Lines is: if it is such a scandal for that to be accepted, why was it okay for Justice Kirby to deliver the Neville Wran lecture in 2008, organised and established by the Labor Party? Why was that okay while he was a sitting, serving High Court judge? Why was it okay that Michael Kirby addressed the Society of Labor Lawyers while he was on the New South Wales Court of Appeal? Why was it okay that Mary Gaudron, also as a High Court justice, addressed the same body? Why was it okay that Michael McHugh, while he was on the New South Wales Court of Appeal, addressed the Society for Labor Lawyers? Why was it okay for ACT chief justices and chief magistrates to address the same body? Why was it okay for Justice Jeffrey Spender, while he was on the Federal Court, to similarly address the Society for Labor lawyers?


What we have here is blatant hypocrisy from the Labor Party, and we have that hypocrisy because this is not about Justice Heydon and not about this particular event. What this is about is a desperate ploy from a desperate union movement in hock with a desperate political party to distract attention from the disgraceful conduct of union members and officials exposed by this royal commission. It is all a distraction technique.


I am a father of four kids and I know distraction techniques well. When you do not like what your children are doing, when you do not like if they are crying or whingeing or behaving badly, you distract them. You try to distract their attention and put something else in their face or do something like that. That is exactly what the Labor Party are trying to do here because they do not like what is going on down there at the royal commission. They do not like what is happening so they are trying to distract attention from it, at great cost to the Australian people and to good public policy in this area.


I have not seen the Labor Party introduce or state that there is a matter of public importance about the conduct of union officials while I have been here. This time in our chamber is a time for opposition and minor parties to state what they view are the important issues facing the public and we can debate them in this chamber during this time. I have not seen the Labor Party put up one matter of public importance about how it is important that union officials be subject to high levels of propriety and good conduct. I have not seen the Greens either put up motions to discuss and debate the conduct of union officials as they have been exposed in this royal commission and in other fora in the last few years. 


What is the bigger issue here? Is it an issue that we seem to have organised crime involved in our trade union movements? Is that an issue? It has been something the assistant commissioner of the Victorian Police Force has stated to the royal commission? I do not know the assistant commissioner of the Victorian Police Force but I imagine he is of good standing. He has alleged that there are examples of organised crime and criminal conduct in our trade union movement. My question to the Labor Party is: is that an issue? Do you think that is a matter of public importance? Do you think it is a matter of public importance that we may have organised crime in our trade union movement? I certainly do. I think that is an extremely important issue for the public to know about and to debate but it is not something the Labor Party want to expose.


Does the Labor Party think it is a matter of public importance that the royal commission has exposed that some CFMEU officials, in particular Mr Brian Parker and Mr Darren Greenfield, have been exposed as being involved with Australians who have subsequently ended up fighting for ISIS. Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar were both involved with the CFMEU. Is that a matter of public importance? Apparently not, according to the Labor Party because they have never brought that forward in the time available to them in this chamber. Is it a matter of public importance that the CFMEU regularly and consistently disobeys the law on construction sites particularly in Melbourne? Is that a matter of public importance because we know recently in disputes, particularly with Boral and other construction companies in Melbourne, that the CFMEU has disobeyed court orders and has continued to engage in unlawful conduct. Is that a matter of public importance? I think it is a matter of public importance when trade unions do not obey the law but it is not something the Labor Party seems to want to discuss.


Does the Labor Party think it is a matter of public importance when the private details of 300 construction workers are leaked by an industry superannuation fund to the CFMEU? Is that a matter of public importance? Is it a matter of public importance when John Setka makes vile and insistent threats to other people in his role with the CFMEU? Is that a matter of public importance? I reckon it might be. I also think it might be a matter of public importance when people are arrested for unlawful conduct and we know at least four people have been in the royal commission so far and that criminal charges have been recommended against at least three of the most senior officials in the CFMEU. I reckon that might be a bit more important than an event organised for lawyers for lawyers to speak at. I think all of the conduct might be a little bit more important, but that is not something the Labor Party wants to bring into this chamber to debate. It is not something they are willing to have exposed and that is why we have this desperate attempt to distract attention from this disgraceful conduct and that is the only way you can describe this conduct. It is absolutely disgraceful. It should be condemned by every member of this chamber and I think in their heart of hearts it would be but for political reasons it is not something the Labor Party want to talk about.


I did say at the start of my contribution that—surprise, surprise—Labor Party lawyer groups have organised similar functions where sitting judges, including sitting High Court justices, have spoken.




Senator Conroy:
  Not while they are prosecuting cases.




Senator CANAVAN:
  That has happened on multiple occasions, through you Chair to Senator Conroy. I do not think that is such a bad thing. It is not my idea of a fun night out. I am not a lawyer and sometimes being in a political party with many of them I get sick of listening to them, to be honest. But if that is what knocks your socks off, if you want to listen to a justice of the High Court or some other lawyer, go for your life. I have no problem with that and I have no problem with people joining political parties in our country, be it that they join the Labor Party or the Greens or some of the minor parties. I do not have any problem with Australians joining political parties. Indeed, I would recommend and argue more Australians should join political parties because it would be a great thing if more people took an interest in the future of our country.


Whatever your views are, it is a great idea to join a political party and to get involved in the battle of ideas. Some of those ideas do circulate around matters of the law, although that is not my particular kettle of fish—I think that is the wrong metaphor but I cannot think of the right one. It is not what floats my boat, talking about the law. If that is what people want to do, they should go for their life. The Labor Party have done it many times and that is great. One of the most important things about this last week's debate is that clearly judges and other senior legal officials in our community will be less likely to accept invitations to such events after this stunt from the  Labor Party and the multiple stunts they have had in the last week. It will be less likely that events such as this will be organised in the future and I think that is unfortunate. I think it is unfortunate that fewer people will in future be able to go to these events, that fewer senior legal officials will want to discuss and provide their experience and wisdom to the members of political parties and our democracy will be weaker for that effect. 


I did listen also to Senator Rice earlier mention that in her view this was a politically motivate commission. Senator Rice, through you Chair, whatever your thoughts are on why the royal commission was established, there is no doubt that, having been established, it has exposed serious misconduct which needs to be followed up and I am sure will be followed up. The calls to shut it down are completely out of proportion and reveal that the real reason behind why we are having this debate is that they want to cover up this corrupt behaviour.

 (Queensland) (16:29):  The people of Australia have lost faith in the Abbott government. Tony and his team continue to lurch from one catastrophe to another.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  Senator Lazarus, I would ask you to address the Prime Minister by his correct title.




Senator LAZARUS:
  Sorry. I apologise. The Prime Minister and his team continue to lurch from one catastrophe to another. Every morning the people of Australia wake up to yet another colossal Prime Ministerial stuff-up—Choppergate, knighthoods, pension cuts, GP co-payments, and same-sex marriage. The Heydongate saga is just another stuff-up in the growing pile of Prime Ministerial and government stuff-ups. I am of the view that a royal commissioner must be impartial and independent of political associations. Based on this, Dyson Heydon's position is untenable and he must step down in order to restore community confidence in the trade union royal commission. I should add that I am strongly of the view that the trade union royal commission is nothing more than a political attack on the health and future of unionism across Australia.


There are many areas of our community where we desperately do need royal commissions, and the CSG mining sector is one of them. Across our country, farmers and landholders are being decimated by the impact of CSG mining. CSG mining is killing animals, poisoning our water, depleting our water supplies, devastating land values and affecting human health. Why won't the government establish a royal commission into the human impact of CSG mining? It is because CSG mining companies donate to the coalition.


Dyson Heydon must go and the need for the trade union royal commission must be re-assessed. As I keep saying, I cannot keep the government honest but I can keep them accountable. If the Abbott government have any respect for the people of Australia they will act swiftly to remove commissioner Heydon.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2015-08-18,"



Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (16:31):  I rise to support the matter of public importance. I was pleased to hear that Senator Canavan believed that there was some behaviour that was absolutely unacceptable. Let me read to you the following quote:


Probity may be affected by conscious bias for or against a particular litigant or class of litigants. The law compels judges who have such a bias or may reasonably be thought to have such a bias to disqualify themselves ...


That is a quote from none other than Justice Dyson Heydon from a 2002 address to an assembled gaggle of his right-wing friends. Pithy and accurate, Justice Heydon was striking at the heart of the values that underpin our society's approach to justice. But Justice Heydon and the royal commission over which he presides have departed so far from these values that their respective roles are now untenable. Furthermore, Mr Abbott's $80 million dollar royal commission has been exposed as the cynical, political Star Chamber that it is.


In February 2014 Mr Abbott repaid the favour after he himself was sent to Oxford on a Rhodes scholarship by none other than former Justice Heydon. But Mr Abbott did keep an election promise, one of the very rare examples of him doing so. He took the necessary steps to establish a royal commission that would be specifically tasked with pursuing his political opponents. There was no pretence about this at all. Its whole job was to denigrate former Prime Minister Julia Gillard and to attack, undermine and smear the current Leader of the Opposition. The terms of reference were fatalistic. They implicitly accused the trade union movement of engaging in unlawful conduct and explicitly directed the royal commission to pursue particular unions. It was immediately clear to all that this royal commission would act as the Liberal Party's publicly-funded political dirt unit. Not satisfied with just having a little dirt unit in their press secretaries gathered together under their Whip—not content with that—they wanted an $80 million plaything with coercive powers to smear their political opponents. This was a Star Chamber from the first day and it has been exposed again as a Star Chamber in the last few days. 


Tony Abbott needed someone to head up this dirt unit. Enter Dyson Heydon. After a youthful appointment as a law professor, Justice Heydon was elected Dean of the University of Sydney Law School in 1978. His tenure in this role must surely have been successful, because one of his school's students at that time went on to become the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Tony Abbott. In fact, as I said, Justice Heydon was lucky enough to examine the future Prime Minister in detail as he sat on the Rhodes scholarship committee that awarded Tony Abbott his scholarship. Surely the Prime Minister is eternally grateful for the privilege. Following a brief yet controversial stint as Justice of the New South Wales Supreme Court's Court of Appeal, Prime Minister John Howard appointed Justice Heydon to the High Court in 2003. Justice Heydon spent his 10 years on the High Court benches as a judicial activist, regularly dissenting from the moderate rulings of his colleagues and, in doing so, pursuing his right-wing ideologies in the minority.


His family has a longstanding relationship with the Liberal party. His father had even acted as an advisor to the Liberal Menzies government. So Mr Abbott had his man: a respected lawyer, an ideological right-winger, and a man whose family had enjoyed successive generations of Liberal Party patronage.




Senator Ryan:
  What did your dad do?




Senator CONROY:
  Pardon?




Senator Ryan:
  Blaming someone for what their father did?




Senator CONROY:
  Oh dear!


There are roughly 2,500 barristers in the state of New South Wales. Twenty five of these barristers operate from Eight Selborne Chambers in Sydney—just 25 out of 2,500. Eight Selborne had, surprisingly, been home to Justice Heydon and these 25 barristers and represented the most intimate of the legal fraternity. Despite the weight of chance stacked heavily against this small community of legal practitioners, three of these 25 who shared chambers with Justice Heydon have been awarded multimillion dollar contracts from the trade union royal commission, the most prominent of which, of course, is Jeremy Stoljar, who was appointed by Dyson Heydon as counsel assisting the royal commission. Mr Heydon knew that Stoljar would make a reliable deputy. They had long been friends. Heydon was such a keen supporter that he had gladly launched Stoljar's book in 2011. 


As you would expect in such a murky world of patronage and jobs for mates, the government has been exceptionally keen to maintain the secrecy of payments to Heydon and his friends. While they have successfully hidden Heydon's fees behind the thin veil of commercial confidence, investigations by the Senate's committees have revealed that Jeremy Stoljar's pockets have been well lined by the royal commission to the tune of $3.4 million. While taxpayers are wondering what value they are receiving from this star chamber, Justice Heydon and his lavishly paid buddies, Mr Abbott and the Liberal Party are getting everything they have paid for.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Seselja
):  Order! Pause the clock.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order. Standing order 193 makes it very, very clear that it is not possible for a senator to make imputations of improper motives and personal reflections on the houses, or members or officers of those houses. You could not have made a more serious imputation against the character of the Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, than the one just made by Senator Conroy, and he should be asked to withdraw.




Senator CONROY:
  I have no idea what he is talking about.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Sullivan if you could point us to the imputation, without pointing to the exact words used necessarily, so I can rule.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  Senator Conroy made a reference to the relationship between Mr Abbott and the royal commission—



Senator Lines interjecting—




Senator O'Sullivan:
  Do you want to listen or not?



Senator Conroy interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! There is a point of order. I will hear the point of order and then I will rule on it. It is difficult for me to rule if you are interjecting.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  Mr Conroy made a reference to the relationship—




Senator CONROY:
  Senator to you.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  I don't tend to make a contribution with interjections, Mr Acting Deputy President.




Senator Lines:
  Well, call him Senator Conroy.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Lines, I do not need the interjections. Senator O'Sullivan is aware that the use of proper titles such as senator should be used in here and I would remind him. We do not need your assistance while he is making his point of order. You are not being helpful. I will now go to Senator O'Sullivan so that he can make his point of order.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  Senator Conroy made it very clear through his words that there were imputations against our Prime Minister with respect to the appointment of this royal commissioner having occurred as a result of the relationship with the Prime Minister, with the royal commissioner and through their historical association. It is a very serious imputation and it should be withdrawn.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Conroy, it would assist the Senate if any imputations that were made against the Prime Minister were withdrawn.



Senator Dastyari interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Standing order 193 does stand. I did not hear the precise words that Senator O'Sullivan is referring to, but it would certainly assist the debate in the chamber if you would withdraw any motives or imputations and we can move on.




Senator CONROY:
  Like you, I am a little unclear. But if there was an imputation that the good senator from Queensland has taken offence to, I happily withdraw it.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Conroy.




Senator CONROY:
  While the taxpayers are wondering what value they are receiving from Justice Heydon and his lavishly paid buddies, Mr Abbott and the Liberal Party are getting what they paid for. The Heydon royal commission wantonly ignores the standards that have been established and upheld by royal commissions before it—accepting hearsay, refusing objections and cross-examinations, double standards for different witnesses and even providing detailed briefings for the media. Dyson Heydon has overseen a royal commission totally failing principles of natural justice. They stand there and, as they have witnesses walking into the box, they start distributing to the press gallery, before the witnesses have even sat down or are handed it themselves, the documents that they are going to be cross-examined on. So the first time the witnesses get to see documents is as they are handed to the media. This is a star chamber that is about nothing more than helping this pathetic government get re-elected. This royal commission has been put in place, this star chamber, this quasi-judicial theatre, to smear and slander the Liberal Party's political opponents.


But Dyson Heydon's bias and partisan ways were finally exposed by the revelation that he had agreed to address a Liberal Party fundraiser—an absolute slam-dunk case. His claims that he was unaware that the event was a political fundraiser simply do not stand up to scrutiny. By his own admission, he received multiple pieces of correspondence that outlined the event's ties to the Liberal Party. The chair of a Liberal Party lawyer branch invited Mr Heydon to the event on 10 April 2014 and the email explicitly explained the relationship between the Liberal Party and the lawyer branch and the event itself.

Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (16:44):  I have not been here for a long time—



Honourable senators interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Settle down, fellas. As I said to these colleagues last night: kick your shoes off, rest back and have a listen up. I have not been here for a long time, but in the time that I have been here I have seen, on occasions, an abuse of the parliamentary privilege that underpins our ability to get on with the job. But I have never seen such an atrocious abuse as I have just witnessed from Senator Conroy. I have never seen such an attack—in this case on a senior retired jurist of this nation, one of the most respected legal jurists in the country. I do not intend to waste one more second of this chamber's time in relation to the facts that led up to it, because they are well and truly clear. Through question time today and yesterday we have heard from our colleagues across the chamber, including the Greens. Have they got any interest in job creation in this nation? No. About education reform? None whatsoever. Or about disability services? They were chatting and giggling away over there today as they prepared to ask questions on this.


In the short time that I have to make a contribution, we need to ask ourselves: why would they want to attack this royal commission? Why would they want to attack this eminent jurist? I will tell you why: it is because over the last three or four days they have been exposed and their connections, both the Greens and the Labor Party, with their criminal activity—sorry, I withdraw that—with their association with people who are engaged in criminal activity that leads to benefits for those organisations, who then go ahead and nourish the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Greens with phenomenal sums of money. You are paid players, paid to be in this place to represent their interests and to defend them against these very, very serious allegations as exposed by this royal commission. 


A fact I pointed out last night was that, in all the hundreds of hours in recent debates and in debates before, not once—with one exception, which I will come to—has anyone from that side ever mentioned transparency, accountability, holding people to account, or the abuse of power and positions? Only once, and that was a contribution made by Senator Ludwig last night when he referred to this royal commission as a 'stalking horse.' This is a pearl. Pick up your pens and make a note of it so you never, ever make the mistake of using it yourself. He said they were using this royal commission as a stalking horse to pursue transparency and accountability. Have a listen to that! As I said in my contribution last night: some days you people must not be able to think as the galloping hooves of this royal commission come up behind you. 


We have exposed some of the most entrenched modern criminality and criminal behaviour in this country impacting on the productivity of this nation to the tune of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions—I suspect possibly billions. And, I said here, the people who are doing this, who have been exposed by the royal commission, are being protected by the Australian Labor Party—the same crowd that stands up at every opportunity to tell us that they are here for the workers of Australia. I have got to tell you that you do a good job of protecting the unions. You have done a terrific job standing up and battling on their behalf, but nothing you have done will make a positive contribution to the development and maintenance of jobs in this country, to the growth and development in the construction industry, to the issues of transparency and accountability. You need to look them up. I have an Oxford dictionary in my office—I will drop it around if you need it. Accountability—



Honourable senators interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  No, no. You think it is a joke, Senator Sam. In between your filming liabilities as a cameo, all you want to do is laugh when your pathetic performance in protecting these criminal organisations is raised. And it is a massive abuse of parliamentary privilege. I thank you for the opportunity to make the contribution.

"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",Ind.,2015-08-18,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (16:49):  I rise to speak to the matter of public importance. As a royal commissioner leading an inquiry examining union governance and corruption, it is clear that Mr Heydon has displayed a form of bias in accepting an invitation to become a keynote speaker at a Liberal Party function. 


A royal commissioner cannot decide his own impartiality or perception of bias. You do not need a law degree to work that out; you just need to use some common sense. For heaven's sake—we have a situation where the Australian people know how a royal commissioner will vote at the next election. The royal commissioner has personally admitted that he was the main act at an important Liberal Party event. What next? Will Commissioner Heydon suspend royal commission hearings so that he can hand out Liberal how-to-vote cards at the Canning by-election?


No judge, after overwhelming evidence of bias has been produced, including words from this own mouth, can make a ruling on his own impartiality or perception of bias. He can defend his bias, he can argue and put forward a case to the contrary to a higher authority, but he cannot then make a judgement on his impartiality and expect the average Tasmanian to accept the integrity and fidelity of that decision. 


Evidence may have emerged in this royal commission that has implicated the Liberal Party and its associates in corruption. But, because Commissioner Heydon has refused to allow crossbench senators to access his secret volume, we will never actually know the truth. He must resign now, and his secret report must be viewed by all crossbench senators.


You cannot, as Commissioner Heydon himself has written, have a confidential report that shows 'a grave threat to the power and authority of the Australian state' without people associated with all sides of politics being involved in serious corruption, criminal or subversive activities. 


The longer the Prime Minister and Commissioner Heydon cover up that secret report from crossbench senators, the greater the likelihood that the Liberal Party is implicated in serious illegal activities. It is up to the Liberal Party and the Prime Minister to prove that they have not been implicated or linked to illegal activities in Mr Heydon's confidential volumes. 


The Prime Minister made another captain's pick when he chose Justice Heydon to lead this royal commission, knowing full well the strong family and professional links that he had with the Liberal Party. When this sorry farce ends in a successful High Court action against the commissioner, it will ultimately be the Prime Minister who is at fault for the waste of hundreds of millions in taxpayers' money.

 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (17:36):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Treasury Legislation Amendment (Small Business and Unfair Contract Terms) Bill 2015 implements the Government's 2013 election commitment to provide a 'fair go' for small businesses, by extending to the small business sector unfair contract terms protections currently available to consumers.


This Bill will amend the Australian Consumer Law, which is set out in Schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act2001 (ASIC Act), to extend the consumer unfair contract terms protections to cover standard form, small business contracts that are valued below a prescribed threshold.


Consumers have been protected from unfair contract terms since 2010. However, the former government, despite its initial intentions, decided not to proceed with offering similar protections to small business. 


It is time that small businesses, which often face the same vulnerabilities as consumers, also receive protections when offered 'take it or leave it' contracts. Between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2014, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission received 1,375 small business complaints relating to unfair contract terms. This figure does not include complaints directed to state and territory fair trading bodies, state small business commissioners and industry ombudsmen. 


Under the new protections, a court will be able to strike out a term of a small business contract that it considers unfair. For example, a term that allows the business offering the contract to unilaterally change the price or key terms could be considered unfair.


In this way, this Bill provides a remedy for small businesses when an unfair contract term is included in a standard form contract. This will reduce the incentive to include and enforce unfair terms in contracts with small businesses, providing for a more efficient allocation of risk and giving small businesses greater confidence to enter into contracts to invest and grow their business.


This Bill is an important reform for small businesses and reflects a key part of the Abbott Government's small business policy platform from the 2013 election. The Bill is an Australian first, and in designing the legislative amendment the Government consulted extensively with stakeholders.


In 2014, the Commonwealth Treasury, on behalf of Commonwealth, state and territory consumer affairs Ministers, conducted a 10 week public consultation process to gather information about the extent of the problem and the views of stakeholders on policy options. Over 80 submissions and around 300 survey responses were received as part of this process.


Stakeholder feedback indicated that small businesses across a wide range of industries have concerns with unfair terms. Small businesses, like consumers, are vulnerable to the inclusion of unfair terms in standard form contracts as they can lack the time and legal expertise to critically analyse contracts.


The consultations also found significant support for addressing the problem through a legislative extension of the current consumer unfair contract terms law.


I note that state and territory governments were actively engaged in the development of this measure and Consumer Affairs Ministers formally agreed to the proposal to amend the Australian Consumer Law in April 2015, as required under the Intergovernmental Agreement for the Australian Consumer Law. In line with the Corporations Agreement 2002, the Commonwealth notified the states and territories that these legislative protections would be mirrored in the ASIC Act.


Public consultation on the exposure draft legislation was held between 28 April and 12 May 2015, providing stakeholders with the opportunity to comment on the draft Bill. It received almost 50 submissions and my Department, the Treasury, also held discussions with a number of stakeholders.


I would like to thank all of the stakeholders that engaged with the Government through these consultations. Your feedback will help ensure this important reform is implemented effectively.


I would now like to turn to the provisions of the Bill.


In both the ASIC Act and the Australian Consumer Law, this Bill applies the unfair contract terms provisions to small business contracts. A contract will be a small business contract if at least one party to the contract has fewer than 20 employees and its value is below the prescribed threshold.


A headcount approach is used to determine whether a business has fewer than 20 employees by headcount, excluding casual employees not employed on a regular or systematic basis. This characterisation of small business, which is used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, has been chosen as it provides a proxy for the human resources available within a small business.


A headcount approach, rather than full time equivalent, will also simplify the application of the law. It assumes that small businesses will find it easier to recall the number of people they employ at the point of entering into a contract, rather than a full time equivalent calculation.


It is important to note that only casual employees employed on a 'regular and systematic' basis will be counted as part of this definition. This is intended to account for factors such as seasonal variations in employee numbers which are not part of a business' normal workforce.


The second limb of the small business contract test is that the value of the contract must not exceed $100,000, or $250,000 for a multi‑year contract. This 'transaction value' threshold was chosen so that the protections apply when small businesses engage in day-to-day transactions, while encouraging them to conduct due diligence on large contracts fundamental to the success of their business. There is a significant difference between high value contracts and those day-to-day contracts thrust before small business. It is right and reasonable for all enterprises to seek advice on larger contracts. Responsible and savvy small businesses understand this responsibility.


Determining how this threshold applies to a contract did attract significant feedback in the exposure draft consultations and this will inform the development of guidance material to support the implementation of the law.


The final element of the Bill I would like to highlight is the mechanism that will allow the Government to exempt laws that it deems are equivalent to the unfair contract terms law.


This mechanism recognises the importance of avoiding regulatory duplication and unnecessary compliance costs in sectors where there are equivalent and enforceable protections against unfair contract terms. In designing this regulation‑making power the Government has taken care to ensure the power is not broader than is necessary to achieve this objective.


Specifically, this Bill provides that to grant an exemption the responsible Commonwealth Minister must be satisfied that the law or regulation provides enforceable protections for small businesses which are at least equivalent to the unfair contract terms protections. In forming such a view, consideration must be given to a number of prescribed matters, namely the impact on small businesses, businesses generally and the public interest.


I will now turn to the implementation of this important reform. 


This Bill will take effect six months after it receives Royal Assent. Over this six month period, the regulators will engage with industry and produce guidance material and other information to assist them to comply with the new law. As part of the 2014-15 Budget, the Government provided $1.4 million to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for this purpose.


In conclusion, this Bill introduces an important reform that will give businesses access to a level playing field to grow, invest and create jobs. With this legislation, the Government is restoring time and resources back to small businesses to invest in their business' success rather than navigating a costly and time consuming maze of contract terms. 


Stakeholder feedback provided in 2014 and 2015 has helped the Government to settle on an appropriate model for these protections. The selected transaction value thresholds ensure the protections apply when small businesses engage in day-to-day transactions, whilst encouraging small businesses to conduct due diligence on large contracts fundamental to the success of their business. The Bill also provides a mechanism that will allow the Government to exempt laws that it deems are equivalent to the unfair contract terms law and enforceable. 


The Bill is part of our strategy to ensure Australia is the best place to start and grow a business. It meets our 2013 election commitment to extend to the small business sector unfair contract terms protections currently available to consumers. It is an important reform, and the latest in the Government's ongoing commitment to the small businesses of Australia.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (17:38):  I have been looking forward to this speech this afternoon. I hope to be able to entertain you for at least a few minutes because I hold in my hands here today another bill called the Small Business Commissioner Bill 2013, which happens to be a Greens bill. I introduced this to parliament prior to the 2013 federal election when we were in the balance of power with Labor.


I looked at the legislation and the act around the federal Small Business Commissioner. At the time, the Small Business Commissioner was doing the rounds and coming and visiting people like myself who were small business advocates for our parties. Mr Brennan his name was. I had several meetings with him and I certainly enjoyed my discussions. It seemed to me that his office and his role needed a lot of strengthening. It actually needed some power and some teeth and a bit more resourcing.


I did get in touch with Mr Brennan when I put my bill up with the small business commissioners from around the country, not to mention all the various advocates from small business organisations such as Peter Strong from COSBOA and others. Right at the time I was doing this, we had a bit of an issue. I would say it was more than a bit of an issue here in Canberra. We had the construction of the new Australian Security Intelligence Organisation headquarters in Canberra and it was dogged with controversy. There were huge cost overruns.


Unfortunately, the cost blow-outs and questions over approval processes led to some tragedy for a number of small businesses that were sub contracting on that project. Over 100 small businesses at one point in time did not get paid at all and in some cases they went bankrupt. It was a really significant issue for a small area like Canberra. I repeatedly met with a number of those small businesses and I held out hope that a newly appointed small business commissioner could actually help represent them and get them what they were owed by Lend Lease.


The money was provided by the government for the construction of the ASIO building project, that money went to Lend Lease, which was the chief contractor, and of course Lend Lease subbed it out. Urban Contractors was organising a number of the smaller contractors and it went into liquidation or at least went into trading in receivership and, of course, a number of the companies at the bottom of the food chain did not get paid. I thought it would be great example of how the small business commissioner could work, and hit the ground running given that we had literally had hundreds of companies knocking on our door saying 'we are in dire straits'. So we put up this bill.


I would like to tell you a little bit more about this bill. Essentially the functions and powers were covered under division 2. Section 8 sets out the dispute resolution functions of the commissioner. We had sought functions and powers which allowed them to receive and investigate complaints from small businesses about their dealings with departments, statutory agencies and executive agencies of the Commonwealth. It allowed the commissioner to investigate complaints and facilitate resolutions of these complaints including compelling witnesses to attend arbitration and hearings.


There were a whole number of other things that I thought were pretty good. It was a no-brainer. All it needed was some good lawyers, which of course we had in the Senate, a good piece of legislation and then a bit of political will to do it. So anyway, I put the bill up, it went off to committee and, unfortunately, it did not get supported. I was not quite sure why. We were going into an election of course.


I will not say exactly who it was but I did speak to a very influential and well respected small business advocate in this country who said, 'Peter, the only reason your bill is not being supported is the Liberal Party expect to be in government after the election and they want to put up the same bill themselves.' I was not sure if that was the case but now that I look at what is in front of me, it is certainly very similar to what we suggested back in 2013. But unfortunately it does not quite have the teeth we would have wanted to have seen around dispute resolution. Although there are better processes in place than there are at the moment for the Small Business Commissioner, who is essentially an advocate for small business and can take some positive roles in facilitating conflict resolution, we wanted to see something a lot stronger than that.


Models did exist with state small business commissioners. It was great to hear that these small business commissioners cut the burden to the taxpayer in their various states—I had a good meeting with the Victorian Small Business Commissioner—because by getting together with parties, they prevent these things from going to court. Of course that kind of litigation is very expensive, not just for the taxpayer but for the small businesses themselves. The Small Business Commissioner provided an excellent first point of contact for people who needed dispute resolution, especially small companies that were taking on bigger organisations. They, of course, would be prime candidates for using a Small Business Commissioner. 


So now we have a different name—a small business ombudsman. I can understand why there are concerns around that name. I have read the submissions that express those concerns. Personally, I do not think it is a game changer but, at the end of the day, I just wanted to point out that the Greens had a very good idea that was very similar to this, and it is a shame it did not get up before the election because then I could have campaigned on it. Now, I am standing here supporting another piece of legislation that is very similar. But it is good for small business. It is not perfect—it could have gone further—but it does at least provide avenues for dispute resolution and advocacy. We also recommended a direct link with the small-business department and the minister and that that relationship would be a regular, reporting relationship and that they would work closely together. I see this reflected in this bill, and I see that as a positive as well. 


There are examples where things have fallen between the cracks—between state and federal agencies. There are a number of positive roles for a federal small business ombudsman to play—I will switch my use of the frame and the name now to the 'small business ombudsman'. If you want a real-life example of where this kind of legislation that we have in front of us today could have played a really positive role, once again, go back and have a look at that situation with the cost overrun with the ASIO building, because the government does spend a lot of money in Canberra. The federal government allocates a lot of money, and when we go through the tender and the contract processes a number of small businesses are involved in that. These things are buyer beware—there are risks associated with these large contracts, and that was an example where, had we had a good advocate on the ground who was well resourced and had the ability to help these small businesses, we could have achieved some very positive outcomes. 


I look forward to hearing what the other contributors have to say about this, and I hope that it is implemented in the spirit that the Greens brought this original legislation to the Senate with in 2013.

Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland) (17:47):  I welcome the Greens' support for this measure, although I will make one comment on Senator Whish-Wilson's contribution. I know numbers are not the Greens' strong suit, and they might not have noticed, but before the election the coalition—the Liberal and National parties—did not have the numbers. We did not have the numbers either here in the Senate or in the other place. As well-intentioned as I am sure Senator Whish-Wilson's private senator's bill was, at the time, and I was not a member of the Senate then so I cannot recall it, it would not have been able to be implemented by the government at the time. The only way we could have got to the place we are today, to do something like this, was for the Liberal and National parties to be elected at the last election, which fortunately we were. We were elected on a platform to introduce an ombudsman, and it is with great pleasure that I rise today to share my support for this initiative and welcome the fact that the government has brought it forward as an important way to help small businesses receive appropriate access to justice and redress through our competition system.


To start my comments today, I want to go back to when we did have an ombudsman. We actually had an ombudsman for some areas of our economy that will be impacted by this bill. A grocery ombudsman was established back in 2000, I believe. He was around for about five or six years. Last year I was fortunate enough to meet Mr Robert Gaussen, who was the Produce and Grocery Industry Ombudsman at the time. He also subsequently came and provided evidence to the economics committee about his work and what the effect of it was. I thought he gave very compelling evidence. He gave very compelling evidence to show why an ombudsman is an important tool in the competition workshop and an important way of providing a low-cost means for small businesses to access justice and bring matters to a head. At the time, Mr Gaussen told the Senate Standing Committee on Economics:


... any code of conduct that has no adequate enforcement regime will not be a successful code of conduct. The words that appear in this code—


which is the grocery code—


are good words. The content and intention of what is being described in this code are great, and they are needed and are long overdue. But there is no obligation on anyone to do anything, even if they sign up to it, because of the system under which there is no enforcement. 


Mr Gaussen goes on to say:


The average cost for the ACCC to investigate, inquire into and manage disputes is massive, so there is no way in the world that they can provide, through their systems and the laws under which they have to operate, an effective enforcement regime. They are not resourced to do that. An ombudsman service, with referral capacity to the ACCC, provides that filter and at a much reduced price—and quickly. The key to disputes is speed.


I think that is a very important point. To resolve disputes—whether with my wife or with your contracting business—the key is speed. When I have a fight with my wife I try to resolve it as quickly as possible, because if you let matters fester that is when people start—




Senator Bilyk:
  Happy wife, happy life.




Senator CANAVAN:
  Happy wife, happy life! Senator Bilyk, that is absolutely right. That is the anthem I operate under in my life—I try to, at least. Sometimes I go to bed without resolving those disputes, but I try the next morning to make sure I reflect on my behaviour—usually it is me at fault—and resolve that dispute and restore the relationship. I do not think it is any different in business either. If we can have an easy service, which allows people to resolve disputes quickly, they are more likely to continue on with a trusting and productive relationship, going forward, compared to having to rush off to court or make a complaint to the ACCC, in which case, clearly, people will start to bear a grudge on either side of the fence and positions become strengthened and put in concrete through that process. So this is a very important bill in that regard.


There are, of course, alternatives to an ombudsman, other than going to the ACCC or going to court directly. Many other codes of conduct and other dispute resolution frameworks in our country rely on mediators or arbitrators rather than an ombudsman. Indeed, the recently introduced and regulated Food and Grocery Industry Code of Conduct relies on mediation and arbitration. Last year we established a legislative instrument to do with bulk wheat export marketing. Similarly, the provisions of that rely on mediation and arbitration. They are a useful alternative dispute resolution process. But they have their own limitations as well. They are not as costly as the ACCC or a court action, but they still can be slow and expensive at times.


In the case of mediation they can sometimes, of course, not resolve a dispute, because there is no decision maker put in place. While mediation can sometimes be a useful way of resolving disputes it will not necessarily do so in all cases. Then there is arbitration, which is a higher level of dispute resolution. It does provide for a decision maker and a final conclusion to be made, but it can be quite costly these days, in particular. Most arbitration services now rely on third parties or contractors to be involved, which can be quite expensive.


Earlier, I quoted Mr Robert Gaussen, who is the former grocery industry ombudsman. He appeared at a Senate Economics Committee hearing on the recently introduced Food and Grocery Industry Code of Conduct, which relies on mediation and arbitration. We heard evidence in the committee hearing that arbitration can these days be extremely costly. Mr Gaussen said that arbitration is overwhelmingly more expensive in today's years than even litigation, because the courts are now much quicker and more efficient in the time they take to resolve matters. Arbitrators might get one or two matters a year. They have very little practical experience in the area so they are learning from nought. Quite frankly—and Mr Gaussen said some of his close friends were arbitrators—they spin it out unnecessarily so because they are being paid a higher rate. It is a bad system. Most of them are on daily rates but some will get $2,500 to $8,500 a day. It is not bad work! But people have to pay that cost. It is normally shared between the businesses that are involved in the dispute. Often it will be a small business that is involved in the dispute, and they will potentially be up for $2,500 to $8,500 a day. It is quite expensive.


After we had heard that evidence, the committee asked Treasury to provide more information. Unfortunately Treasury had not calculated these costs when it did the regulatory impact statement for the Food and Grocery Industry Code of Conduct, but it did go away and get some information for our committee and it came back and said that professional fees varied, depending on the complexity of the case and the amount in dispute. They also varied between service providers. Treasury understands, based on consultation with a private mediation provider that typical mediation costs are in the order of $275 per hour for each party and that typical disputes resolved following around seven hours of mediation, so that the total cost is around $1,925 for each party, which, again, is quite an expensive way of resolving a dispute.


For some businesses that will not be an overbearing hurdle for them to resolve their dispute. Indeed, for a healthy business it probably should not be, at a couple of thousand dollars. The issue here is that many businesses, particularly small businesses that are involved in disputes are often at the very same time under cash flow pressures or perhaps even long-term operational issues. Because they are involved in a dispute they might not be getting paid by the relevant suppliers. They might be getting paid lower amounts of money than they believe are due to them. Therefore, even just a couple of thousand dollars, on average, could be too much a burden to bear.


That is why, in my view, it is important that we have an alternative cheap and low-cost way of resolving disputes, and an ombudsman allows us to do that. It allows us to do that because an ombudsman is something the Commonwealth government will fund. It will provide the ability for small businesses and others to come forward and have their disputes resolved in an easy and costless fashion.


Indeed, after finishing the Senate Economics Committee inquiry into the Food and Grocery Industry Code of Conduct, I concluded, along with some senators from the National Party, that we should have the grocery code ombudsman in place of the mediation and arbitration process in the grocery code. Relying on arbitration and mediation in the grocery code was not, in my view and that of the National Party senators, an effective way of dealing with the issues in this particular field. We have mediation and arbitration for bulk wheat exporting. That is a different market. You have grain traders who trade substantial amounts of grain and have a substantial amount of turnover who probably can afford to go through processes of this kind. The grocery code is dealing with a completely different class of businesses and operators, often businesses with very thin margins, small amounts of turnover in relative terms, and businesses that may be put under undue pressure from time to time.


I firmly believe that an ombudsman would be the best way to deal with issues in the grocery sector in particular. I commend the government for bringing forward this bill to provide for a low-cost way for small businesses generally to get access and resolve disputes—not specifically from the grocery code, as I would like to see, but generally for the small business sector. That will provide a way for the small businesses in our community to achieve more readily available redress.


This is a policy that the coalition took to the last election. It was part of our small business policy—and one of a number of initiatives at that election—to establish a small business and family enterprise ombudsman. This particular bill implements that commitment. It will do three things. It provides a Commonwealth-wide advocate for small businesses and family enterprises, someone who sits above all of the policy-making areas in this field, to provide a voice within government for small businesses. It will provide a concierge for dispute resolution and provide its own dispute resolution service. So it will allow small businesses an alternative way of coming forward. They can still, of course, go to the ACCC, they can still, of course, engage their own lawyers under private enforcement and law, and they can still seek to resolve disputes under the various codes of conduct that might apply in their sector. But they can also now access an alternative way of doing that, and that is only a good thing and should be supported. It will also, of course, contribute to development of small business policies more widely across the government.


We are a government that is about protecting small business, supporting small business, supporting people who want to take a risk in their lives, back themselves and be their own boss. I said in my maiden speech in this chamber that I want to have a country where people can, if they so choose, start their own business, have their own job, save for their own house and start their own family. Having economic security as part of small business is one aspect of achieving that. This legislation is only a small way of doing that but it fits into a broader context of supporting small business in our country through the recent tax changes we made in the budget, through the grocery code of conduct we have established and through the competition policy review that has recently concluded and the various changes that might come from that.


I note that this legislation has gone through the regulatory impact statement process. This has shown that it will lead to a net reduction in the regulatory burden facing businesses by a small amount: 0.007 million per year. I suppose that is only $7,000—I am getting a nod from some advisers. It is a small amount of money but it is a net reduction in regulatory burden because this will be an easier way to resolve disputes. It will produce broader economic benefits across the economy, not just in terms of red tape, of around $18 million per year. So it is something that should be supported, and I commend the government for it.


In the time remaining I will say a little more about the government's small business agenda. As we saw in the budget, this government is about supporting small businesses, particularly making sure that they face a lower tax burden over time, with both the reduction in the corporate tax rate for small businesses and the granting of a tax rebate for small businesses that are not incorporated, which will help to achieve that. The more than $3 billion worth of savings in depreciation allowances that we have implemented in the budget has been a great stimulus for our economy, again supporting small businesses that want to invest in our economy. We want to support people who take a risk, invest in their business, invest in our country and invest in creating more jobs for all Australians, and we have been able to achieve that.


Late last year the Harper review reported. That was a broad look at competition policy across our policymaking landscape. I will particularly focus on some conclusions of that report that relate to these bills and their objective of supporting small business. We have various competition laws in Australia that seek to restrain the ability of large corporations to act in a dominant and abusive way in marketplaces. We have a good competition law but—just as I said on corporate tax earlier that we have a good tax system—that does not mean that it cannot be made better.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Bring on section 46.




Senator CANAVAN:
  I thank Senator Whish-Wilson. I was just about to come to section 46. The centrepiece of our law which seeks to restrain the activities of dominant firms or firms with a significant degree of market power is section 46. The jurisprudence around section 46 has evolved over time. I would argue—and I agree with the Harper review—that the jurisprudence has evolved to an extent which effectively means that actions under section 46 have very limited ability to succeed. The courts' interpretation of the 'taking advantage' test is a hypothetical one and one that, as an economist, I would say helps economists put their kids through college but does not help small businesses take action in court. Recent cases on Rural Press and Melways that have come to the court on section 46 have involved long, arduous and technical debates about economic structures, particularly of markets and particularly hypothetical structures in those markets, and it has proven very difficult for plaintiffs to prove and take successful action on that. It is also the case that the 'purposes' test as it is currently drafted is out of kilter with the rest of the world. Most other countries, at least in western and English-speaking countries with a common law background similar to ours, have adopted codified laws which make it an offence for a dominant firm to act in a way that has the effect of being anticompetitive in some way, shape or form as defined.


The Harper review has made some detailed recommendations as to how we could finetune our law to introduce an 'effects' test, to remove that 'taking advantage' test which has proven so problematic and, relatedly, to adjust the proscribed purposes under section 46 to make it a more comprehensive test of a substantial lessening of competition. I know that the government is considering its response to the Harper review at this point. I am on record in this chamber as supporting the general thrust of the Harper review recommendations. I think it has clearly identified a problem in our existing law and jurisprudence and a problem that deserves some response.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Bring us some legislation.




Senator CANAVAN:
  I am sure that the government in due course, after due consideration of the Harper review, will bring a response forward, and I look forward to that. Returning to the bills before us, they should be supported by this chamber because they add to the avenues that small businesses can access to get a better deal for themselves. They will provide small businesses with a lower cost way of resolving disputes and they will reduce the burden that is placed on our regulators and the business sector more generally in resolving those disputes. As I said earlier, that is an important attribute because it will help resolve disputes quickly, cheaply and efficiently. That is the same approach I take to my marriage. If it is good enough for me and my wife, I think it is good enough for our small business sector that we try to resolve disputes quickly, cheaply and efficiently. I think this bill will help do that. Senator Cormann was not here to hear my earlier contribution about my marital difficulties from time to time. Suffice to say I have a very strong marriage thanks to the fact that I do try to resolve disputes quickly, and I think this bill will help the small businesses of our country achieve the same result. They do need to have productive relationships with bigger businesses. Small businesses are not islands. They often do rely on contracting with larger businesses. They do face difficulties in that regard. Anything we can do that will build the trust and confidence for them to have those relationships, to invest in their own businesses and to develop stronger and more productive relationships with other businesses will be good for our economy. It will be good for jobs, it will be good for investment, and it should be supported by this chamber.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2015-08-18,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (18:07):  Firstly, I would like to thank all those senators who have contributed to this debate. Our government is very serious about supporting small business as the engine room of our economy, and this proposed legislation, the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman Bill 2015 and the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2015, is another manifestation of that serious commitment. In 2013 the government announced that it would transform the current position of Australian Small Business Commissioner into one with real power to assist small business and family enterprises, and the current bills deliver on that commitment.


The Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman Bill 2015 will create an ombudsman with two key functions: and advocacy function and an assistance function. Through these functions the ombudsman will be a Commonwealth-wide advocate for small business and family enterprises, a concierge for dispute resolution who will also offer an outsourced alternative dispute resolution service, and a contributor to making Commonwealth laws and regulations more small business friendly.


In relation to the advocacy function, part 3 of the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman Bill will allow the ombudsman to conduct inquiries for the purpose of advocating to government on behalf of small businesses and family enterprises. Inquiries may be undertaken on the ombudsman's own initiative or on referral from the minister. Importantly, for the purpose of giving the ombudsman real power, the legislation will allow the ombudsman to require a person or entity to produce information and documents for the purposes of an inquiry. Noncompliance with such requests may attract a penalty.


The ombudsman's advocacy role will contribute to making Commonwealth laws and regulations more small business friendly. This forms part of the Australian government's general deregulation agenda. Regulatory compliance costs as estimated by the Treasury in 2014 could be as high as five per cent of gross domestic product. To assist with getting rid of inefficient regulation and to prevent it from being imposed in the first place, the ombudsman will provide advice on legislation, draft legislation and regulatory practices. The ombudsman will thus be a strong and influential advocate for the interests of small business and family enterprises being at the forefront of policy and program design. The ombudsman will also promote best practice interactions, which could involve the ombudsman recommending changes in practices by Commonwealth government agencies.


Naturally, the ombudsman will be impartial, but the ombudsman must also be seen to be impartial. Therefore, because the ombudsman will advocate particular positions in relation to various issues, the ombudsman may not personally take any part in any alternative dispute resolution processes.


In relation to the assistance function, under part 4 of the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman Bill, the ombudsman may provide assistance in relation to requests. It is anticipated that, in the majority of cases, the ombudsman will transfer requests to other officials under whose jurisdiction the requests fall. The various levels of government—Commonwealth, state, territory and local—and the agencies within those levels often appear as a maze to those in the private sector. Therefore, the ombudsman's concierge function will assist by guiding small businesses and family enterprises to the relevant agencies. In some cases the ombudsman may refer requests for assistance to the ombudsman's own outsourced alternative dispute resolution service.


The scope of the ombudsman has been deliberately designed to be very broad. There is therefore a very broad definition of both a 'family enterprise' and a 'small business' as being a business with fewer than 100 employees or with revenue under $5 million in the previous financial year. Despite this very broad definition, there are naturally restrictions on the ombudsman's operation. The Commonwealth Constitution, for example, contains no power which would allow the ombudsman, in most cases, to deal with disputes between two unincorporated entities in the one state. In addition to such constitutional restrictions, the ombudsman will also not duplicate the functions of any other official, for the simple reason that doing so would be a waste of public money. The ombudsman therefore will work cooperatively with other officials and complement their existing services—thus providing more services to small businesses and family enterprises.


The government acknowledges the feedback provided on the ombudsman through an extensive consultation process, consultation which has included public feedback on a government discussion paper and draft legislation and responses to a committee inquiry. In relation to recent commentary on the ombudsman, proposed section 95 of the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman Bill requires that a review of the ombudsman's assistance function be conducted no later than 30 June 2017, with further reviews at intervals of not more than four years. The first review represents a good opportunity not only to review the assistance function as required by this bill but also to consider other matters raised before the Senate. This includes comments provided in the inquiry report of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee.


The Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2015 ensures that the ombudsman can work collaboratively with the Commonwealth Ombudsman by allowing the Commonwealth Ombudsman to transfer matters to the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman.


These bills fulfil an election commitment and, moreover, they demonstrate the importance of small businesses and family enterprises to Australia. I commend these bills to the Senate.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (17:38):  I have been looking forward to this speech this afternoon. I hope to be able to entertain you for at least a few minutes because I hold in my hands here today another bill called the Small Business Commissioner Bill 2013, which happens to be a Greens bill. I introduced this to parliament prior to the 2013 federal election when we were in the balance of power with Labor.


I looked at the legislation and the act around the federal Small Business Commissioner. At the time, the Small Business Commissioner was doing the rounds and coming and visiting people like myself who were small business advocates for our parties. Mr Brennan his name was. I had several meetings with him and I certainly enjoyed my discussions. It seemed to me that his office and his role needed a lot of strengthening. It actually needed some power and some teeth and a bit more resourcing.


I did get in touch with Mr Brennan when I put my bill up with the small business commissioners from around the country, not to mention all the various advocates from small business organisations such as Peter Strong from COSBOA and others. Right at the time I was doing this, we had a bit of an issue. I would say it was more than a bit of an issue here in Canberra. We had the construction of the new Australian Security Intelligence Organisation headquarters in Canberra and it was dogged with controversy. There were huge cost overruns.


Unfortunately, the cost blow-outs and questions over approval processes led to some tragedy for a number of small businesses that were sub contracting on that project. Over 100 small businesses at one point in time did not get paid at all and in some cases they went bankrupt. It was a really significant issue for a small area like Canberra. I repeatedly met with a number of those small businesses and I held out hope that a newly appointed small business commissioner could actually help represent them and get them what they were owed by Lend Lease.


The money was provided by the government for the construction of the ASIO building project, that money went to Lend Lease, which was the chief contractor, and of course Lend Lease subbed it out. Urban Contractors was organising a number of the smaller contractors and it went into liquidation or at least went into trading in receivership and, of course, a number of the companies at the bottom of the food chain did not get paid. I thought it would be great example of how the small business commissioner could work, and hit the ground running given that we had literally had hundreds of companies knocking on our door saying 'we are in dire straits'. So we put up this bill.


I would like to tell you a little bit more about this bill. Essentially the functions and powers were covered under division 2. Section 8 sets out the dispute resolution functions of the commissioner. We had sought functions and powers which allowed them to receive and investigate complaints from small businesses about their dealings with departments, statutory agencies and executive agencies of the Commonwealth. It allowed the commissioner to investigate complaints and facilitate resolutions of these complaints including compelling witnesses to attend arbitration and hearings.


There were a whole number of other things that I thought were pretty good. It was a no-brainer. All it needed was some good lawyers, which of course we had in the Senate, a good piece of legislation and then a bit of political will to do it. So anyway, I put the bill up, it went off to committee and, unfortunately, it did not get supported. I was not quite sure why. We were going into an election of course.


I will not say exactly who it was but I did speak to a very influential and well respected small business advocate in this country who said, 'Peter, the only reason your bill is not being supported is the Liberal Party expect to be in government after the election and they want to put up the same bill themselves.' I was not sure if that was the case but now that I look at what is in front of me, it is certainly very similar to what we suggested back in 2013. But unfortunately it does not quite have the teeth we would have wanted to have seen around dispute resolution. Although there are better processes in place than there are at the moment for the Small Business Commissioner, who is essentially an advocate for small business and can take some positive roles in facilitating conflict resolution, we wanted to see something a lot stronger than that.


Models did exist with state small business commissioners. It was great to hear that these small business commissioners cut the burden to the taxpayer in their various states—I had a good meeting with the Victorian Small Business Commissioner—because by getting together with parties, they prevent these things from going to court. Of course that kind of litigation is very expensive, not just for the taxpayer but for the small businesses themselves. The Small Business Commissioner provided an excellent first point of contact for people who needed dispute resolution, especially small companies that were taking on bigger organisations. They, of course, would be prime candidates for using a Small Business Commissioner. 


So now we have a different name—a small business ombudsman. I can understand why there are concerns around that name. I have read the submissions that express those concerns. Personally, I do not think it is a game changer but, at the end of the day, I just wanted to point out that the Greens had a very good idea that was very similar to this, and it is a shame it did not get up before the election because then I could have campaigned on it. Now, I am standing here supporting another piece of legislation that is very similar. But it is good for small business. It is not perfect—it could have gone further—but it does at least provide avenues for dispute resolution and advocacy. We also recommended a direct link with the small-business department and the minister and that that relationship would be a regular, reporting relationship and that they would work closely together. I see this reflected in this bill, and I see that as a positive as well. 


There are examples where things have fallen between the cracks—between state and federal agencies. There are a number of positive roles for a federal small business ombudsman to play—I will switch my use of the frame and the name now to the 'small business ombudsman'. If you want a real-life example of where this kind of legislation that we have in front of us today could have played a really positive role, once again, go back and have a look at that situation with the cost overrun with the ASIO building, because the government does spend a lot of money in Canberra. The federal government allocates a lot of money, and when we go through the tender and the contract processes a number of small businesses are involved in that. These things are buyer beware—there are risks associated with these large contracts, and that was an example where, had we had a good advocate on the ground who was well resourced and had the ability to help these small businesses, we could have achieved some very positive outcomes. 


I look forward to hearing what the other contributors have to say about this, and I hope that it is implemented in the spirit that the Greens brought this original legislation to the Senate with in 2013.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,20,2
"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2015-08-18,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland) (17:47):  I welcome the Greens' support for this measure, although I will make one comment on Senator Whish-Wilson's contribution. I know numbers are not the Greens' strong suit, and they might not have noticed, but before the election the coalition—the Liberal and National parties—did not have the numbers. We did not have the numbers either here in the Senate or in the other place. As well-intentioned as I am sure Senator Whish-Wilson's private senator's bill was, at the time, and I was not a member of the Senate then so I cannot recall it, it would not have been able to be implemented by the government at the time. The only way we could have got to the place we are today, to do something like this, was for the Liberal and National parties to be elected at the last election, which fortunately we were. We were elected on a platform to introduce an ombudsman, and it is with great pleasure that I rise today to share my support for this initiative and welcome the fact that the government has brought it forward as an important way to help small businesses receive appropriate access to justice and redress through our competition system.


To start my comments today, I want to go back to when we did have an ombudsman. We actually had an ombudsman for some areas of our economy that will be impacted by this bill. A grocery ombudsman was established back in 2000, I believe. He was around for about five or six years. Last year I was fortunate enough to meet Mr Robert Gaussen, who was the Produce and Grocery Industry Ombudsman at the time. He also subsequently came and provided evidence to the economics committee about his work and what the effect of it was. I thought he gave very compelling evidence. He gave very compelling evidence to show why an ombudsman is an important tool in the competition workshop and an important way of providing a low-cost means for small businesses to access justice and bring matters to a head. At the time, Mr Gaussen told the Senate Standing Committee on Economics:


... any code of conduct that has no adequate enforcement regime will not be a successful code of conduct. The words that appear in this code—


which is the grocery code—


are good words. The content and intention of what is being described in this code are great, and they are needed and are long overdue. But there is no obligation on anyone to do anything, even if they sign up to it, because of the system under which there is no enforcement. 


Mr Gaussen goes on to say:


The average cost for the ACCC to investigate, inquire into and manage disputes is massive, so there is no way in the world that they can provide, through their systems and the laws under which they have to operate, an effective enforcement regime. They are not resourced to do that. An ombudsman service, with referral capacity to the ACCC, provides that filter and at a much reduced price—and quickly. The key to disputes is speed.


I think that is a very important point. To resolve disputes—whether with my wife or with your contracting business—the key is speed. When I have a fight with my wife I try to resolve it as quickly as possible, because if you let matters fester that is when people start—




Senator Bilyk:
  Happy wife, happy life.




Senator CANAVAN:
  Happy wife, happy life! Senator Bilyk, that is absolutely right. That is the anthem I operate under in my life—I try to, at least. Sometimes I go to bed without resolving those disputes, but I try the next morning to make sure I reflect on my behaviour—usually it is me at fault—and resolve that dispute and restore the relationship. I do not think it is any different in business either. If we can have an easy service, which allows people to resolve disputes quickly, they are more likely to continue on with a trusting and productive relationship, going forward, compared to having to rush off to court or make a complaint to the ACCC, in which case, clearly, people will start to bear a grudge on either side of the fence and positions become strengthened and put in concrete through that process. So this is a very important bill in that regard.


There are, of course, alternatives to an ombudsman, other than going to the ACCC or going to court directly. Many other codes of conduct and other dispute resolution frameworks in our country rely on mediators or arbitrators rather than an ombudsman. Indeed, the recently introduced and regulated Food and Grocery Industry Code of Conduct relies on mediation and arbitration. Last year we established a legislative instrument to do with bulk wheat export marketing. Similarly, the provisions of that rely on mediation and arbitration. They are a useful alternative dispute resolution process. But they have their own limitations as well. They are not as costly as the ACCC or a court action, but they still can be slow and expensive at times.


In the case of mediation they can sometimes, of course, not resolve a dispute, because there is no decision maker put in place. While mediation can sometimes be a useful way of resolving disputes it will not necessarily do so in all cases. Then there is arbitration, which is a higher level of dispute resolution. It does provide for a decision maker and a final conclusion to be made, but it can be quite costly these days, in particular. Most arbitration services now rely on third parties or contractors to be involved, which can be quite expensive.


Earlier, I quoted Mr Robert Gaussen, who is the former grocery industry ombudsman. He appeared at a Senate Economics Committee hearing on the recently introduced Food and Grocery Industry Code of Conduct, which relies on mediation and arbitration. We heard evidence in the committee hearing that arbitration can these days be extremely costly. Mr Gaussen said that arbitration is overwhelmingly more expensive in today's years than even litigation, because the courts are now much quicker and more efficient in the time they take to resolve matters. Arbitrators might get one or two matters a year. They have very little practical experience in the area so they are learning from nought. Quite frankly—and Mr Gaussen said some of his close friends were arbitrators—they spin it out unnecessarily so because they are being paid a higher rate. It is a bad system. Most of them are on daily rates but some will get $2,500 to $8,500 a day. It is not bad work! But people have to pay that cost. It is normally shared between the businesses that are involved in the dispute. Often it will be a small business that is involved in the dispute, and they will potentially be up for $2,500 to $8,500 a day. It is quite expensive.


After we had heard that evidence, the committee asked Treasury to provide more information. Unfortunately Treasury had not calculated these costs when it did the regulatory impact statement for the Food and Grocery Industry Code of Conduct, but it did go away and get some information for our committee and it came back and said that professional fees varied, depending on the complexity of the case and the amount in dispute. They also varied between service providers. Treasury understands, based on consultation with a private mediation provider that typical mediation costs are in the order of $275 per hour for each party and that typical disputes resolved following around seven hours of mediation, so that the total cost is around $1,925 for each party, which, again, is quite an expensive way of resolving a dispute.


For some businesses that will not be an overbearing hurdle for them to resolve their dispute. Indeed, for a healthy business it probably should not be, at a couple of thousand dollars. The issue here is that many businesses, particularly small businesses that are involved in disputes are often at the very same time under cash flow pressures or perhaps even long-term operational issues. Because they are involved in a dispute they might not be getting paid by the relevant suppliers. They might be getting paid lower amounts of money than they believe are due to them. Therefore, even just a couple of thousand dollars, on average, could be too much a burden to bear.


That is why, in my view, it is important that we have an alternative cheap and low-cost way of resolving disputes, and an ombudsman allows us to do that. It allows us to do that because an ombudsman is something the Commonwealth government will fund. It will provide the ability for small businesses and others to come forward and have their disputes resolved in an easy and costless fashion.


Indeed, after finishing the Senate Economics Committee inquiry into the Food and Grocery Industry Code of Conduct, I concluded, along with some senators from the National Party, that we should have the grocery code ombudsman in place of the mediation and arbitration process in the grocery code. Relying on arbitration and mediation in the grocery code was not, in my view and that of the National Party senators, an effective way of dealing with the issues in this particular field. We have mediation and arbitration for bulk wheat exporting. That is a different market. You have grain traders who trade substantial amounts of grain and have a substantial amount of turnover who probably can afford to go through processes of this kind. The grocery code is dealing with a completely different class of businesses and operators, often businesses with very thin margins, small amounts of turnover in relative terms, and businesses that may be put under undue pressure from time to time.


I firmly believe that an ombudsman would be the best way to deal with issues in the grocery sector in particular. I commend the government for bringing forward this bill to provide for a low-cost way for small businesses generally to get access and resolve disputes—not specifically from the grocery code, as I would like to see, but generally for the small business sector. That will provide a way for the small businesses in our community to achieve more readily available redress.


This is a policy that the coalition took to the last election. It was part of our small business policy—and one of a number of initiatives at that election—to establish a small business and family enterprise ombudsman. This particular bill implements that commitment. It will do three things. It provides a Commonwealth-wide advocate for small businesses and family enterprises, someone who sits above all of the policy-making areas in this field, to provide a voice within government for small businesses. It will provide a concierge for dispute resolution and provide its own dispute resolution service. So it will allow small businesses an alternative way of coming forward. They can still, of course, go to the ACCC, they can still, of course, engage their own lawyers under private enforcement and law, and they can still seek to resolve disputes under the various codes of conduct that might apply in their sector. But they can also now access an alternative way of doing that, and that is only a good thing and should be supported. It will also, of course, contribute to development of small business policies more widely across the government.


We are a government that is about protecting small business, supporting small business, supporting people who want to take a risk in their lives, back themselves and be their own boss. I said in my maiden speech in this chamber that I want to have a country where people can, if they so choose, start their own business, have their own job, save for their own house and start their own family. Having economic security as part of small business is one aspect of achieving that. This legislation is only a small way of doing that but it fits into a broader context of supporting small business in our country through the recent tax changes we made in the budget, through the grocery code of conduct we have established and through the competition policy review that has recently concluded and the various changes that might come from that.


I note that this legislation has gone through the regulatory impact statement process. This has shown that it will lead to a net reduction in the regulatory burden facing businesses by a small amount: 0.007 million per year. I suppose that is only $7,000—I am getting a nod from some advisers. It is a small amount of money but it is a net reduction in regulatory burden because this will be an easier way to resolve disputes. It will produce broader economic benefits across the economy, not just in terms of red tape, of around $18 million per year. So it is something that should be supported, and I commend the government for it.


In the time remaining I will say a little more about the government's small business agenda. As we saw in the budget, this government is about supporting small businesses, particularly making sure that they face a lower tax burden over time, with both the reduction in the corporate tax rate for small businesses and the granting of a tax rebate for small businesses that are not incorporated, which will help to achieve that. The more than $3 billion worth of savings in depreciation allowances that we have implemented in the budget has been a great stimulus for our economy, again supporting small businesses that want to invest in our economy. We want to support people who take a risk, invest in their business, invest in our country and invest in creating more jobs for all Australians, and we have been able to achieve that.


Late last year the Harper review reported. That was a broad look at competition policy across our policymaking landscape. I will particularly focus on some conclusions of that report that relate to these bills and their objective of supporting small business. We have various competition laws in Australia that seek to restrain the ability of large corporations to act in a dominant and abusive way in marketplaces. We have a good competition law but—just as I said on corporate tax earlier that we have a good tax system—that does not mean that it cannot be made better.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Bring on section 46.




Senator CANAVAN:
  I thank Senator Whish-Wilson. I was just about to come to section 46. The centrepiece of our law which seeks to restrain the activities of dominant firms or firms with a significant degree of market power is section 46. The jurisprudence around section 46 has evolved over time. I would argue—and I agree with the Harper review—that the jurisprudence has evolved to an extent which effectively means that actions under section 46 have very limited ability to succeed. The courts' interpretation of the 'taking advantage' test is a hypothetical one and one that, as an economist, I would say helps economists put their kids through college but does not help small businesses take action in court. Recent cases on Rural Press and Melways that have come to the court on section 46 have involved long, arduous and technical debates about economic structures, particularly of markets and particularly hypothetical structures in those markets, and it has proven very difficult for plaintiffs to prove and take successful action on that. It is also the case that the 'purposes' test as it is currently drafted is out of kilter with the rest of the world. Most other countries, at least in western and English-speaking countries with a common law background similar to ours, have adopted codified laws which make it an offence for a dominant firm to act in a way that has the effect of being anticompetitive in some way, shape or form as defined.


The Harper review has made some detailed recommendations as to how we could finetune our law to introduce an 'effects' test, to remove that 'taking advantage' test which has proven so problematic and, relatedly, to adjust the proscribed purposes under section 46 to make it a more comprehensive test of a substantial lessening of competition. I know that the government is considering its response to the Harper review at this point. I am on record in this chamber as supporting the general thrust of the Harper review recommendations. I think it has clearly identified a problem in our existing law and jurisprudence and a problem that deserves some response.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Bring us some legislation.




Senator CANAVAN:
  I am sure that the government in due course, after due consideration of the Harper review, will bring a response forward, and I look forward to that. Returning to the bills before us, they should be supported by this chamber because they add to the avenues that small businesses can access to get a better deal for themselves. They will provide small businesses with a lower cost way of resolving disputes and they will reduce the burden that is placed on our regulators and the business sector more generally in resolving those disputes. As I said earlier, that is an important attribute because it will help resolve disputes quickly, cheaply and efficiently. That is the same approach I take to my marriage. If it is good enough for me and my wife, I think it is good enough for our small business sector that we try to resolve disputes quickly, cheaply and efficiently. I think this bill will help do that. Senator Cormann was not here to hear my earlier contribution about my marital difficulties from time to time. Suffice to say I have a very strong marriage thanks to the fact that I do try to resolve disputes quickly, and I think this bill will help the small businesses of our country achieve the same result. They do need to have productive relationships with bigger businesses. Small businesses are not islands. They often do rely on contracting with larger businesses. They do face difficulties in that regard. Anything we can do that will build the trust and confidence for them to have those relationships, to invest in their own businesses and to develop stronger and more productive relationships with other businesses will be good for our economy. It will be good for jobs, it will be good for investment, and it should be supported by this chamber.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (18:07):  Firstly, I would like to thank all those senators who have contributed to this debate. Our government is very serious about supporting small business as the engine room of our economy, and this proposed legislation, the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman Bill 2015 and the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2015, is another manifestation of that serious commitment. In 2013 the government announced that it would transform the current position of Australian Small Business Commissioner into one with real power to assist small business and family enterprises, and the current bills deliver on that commitment.


The Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman Bill 2015 will create an ombudsman with two key functions: and advocacy function and an assistance function. Through these functions the ombudsman will be a Commonwealth-wide advocate for small business and family enterprises, a concierge for dispute resolution who will also offer an outsourced alternative dispute resolution service, and a contributor to making Commonwealth laws and regulations more small business friendly.


In relation to the advocacy function, part 3 of the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman Bill will allow the ombudsman to conduct inquiries for the purpose of advocating to government on behalf of small businesses and family enterprises. Inquiries may be undertaken on the ombudsman's own initiative or on referral from the minister. Importantly, for the purpose of giving the ombudsman real power, the legislation will allow the ombudsman to require a person or entity to produce information and documents for the purposes of an inquiry. Noncompliance with such requests may attract a penalty.


The ombudsman's advocacy role will contribute to making Commonwealth laws and regulations more small business friendly. This forms part of the Australian government's general deregulation agenda. Regulatory compliance costs as estimated by the Treasury in 2014 could be as high as five per cent of gross domestic product. To assist with getting rid of inefficient regulation and to prevent it from being imposed in the first place, the ombudsman will provide advice on legislation, draft legislation and regulatory practices. The ombudsman will thus be a strong and influential advocate for the interests of small business and family enterprises being at the forefront of policy and program design. The ombudsman will also promote best practice interactions, which could involve the ombudsman recommending changes in practices by Commonwealth government agencies.


Naturally, the ombudsman will be impartial, but the ombudsman must also be seen to be impartial. Therefore, because the ombudsman will advocate particular positions in relation to various issues, the ombudsman may not personally take any part in any alternative dispute resolution processes.


In relation to the assistance function, under part 4 of the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman Bill, the ombudsman may provide assistance in relation to requests. It is anticipated that, in the majority of cases, the ombudsman will transfer requests to other officials under whose jurisdiction the requests fall. The various levels of government—Commonwealth, state, territory and local—and the agencies within those levels often appear as a maze to those in the private sector. Therefore, the ombudsman's concierge function will assist by guiding small businesses and family enterprises to the relevant agencies. In some cases the ombudsman may refer requests for assistance to the ombudsman's own outsourced alternative dispute resolution service.


The scope of the ombudsman has been deliberately designed to be very broad. There is therefore a very broad definition of both a 'family enterprise' and a 'small business' as being a business with fewer than 100 employees or with revenue under $5 million in the previous financial year. Despite this very broad definition, there are naturally restrictions on the ombudsman's operation. The Commonwealth Constitution, for example, contains no power which would allow the ombudsman, in most cases, to deal with disputes between two unincorporated entities in the one state. In addition to such constitutional restrictions, the ombudsman will also not duplicate the functions of any other official, for the simple reason that doing so would be a waste of public money. The ombudsman therefore will work cooperatively with other officials and complement their existing services—thus providing more services to small businesses and family enterprises.


The government acknowledges the feedback provided on the ombudsman through an extensive consultation process, consultation which has included public feedback on a government discussion paper and draft legislation and responses to a committee inquiry. In relation to recent commentary on the ombudsman, proposed section 95 of the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman Bill requires that a review of the ombudsman's assistance function be conducted no later than 30 June 2017, with further reviews at intervals of not more than four years. The first review represents a good opportunity not only to review the assistance function as required by this bill but also to consider other matters raised before the Senate. This includes comments provided in the inquiry report of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee.


The Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2015 ensures that the ombudsman can work collaboratively with the Commonwealth Ombudsman by allowing the Commonwealth Ombudsman to transfer matters to the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman.


These bills fulfil an election commitment and, moreover, they demonstrate the importance of small businesses and family enterprises to Australia. I commend these bills to the Senate.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Education and Training) (19:20):  This evening I rise to speak regarding a major international event recently concluded where 26 young Australians represented their country—our country—proudly. I refer to WorldSkills Australia's Skillaroos, who are flying home from South America as we speak, having competed in the 43rd WorldSkills international competition in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Just as our elite athletes train daily for the Olympics, so too do these skilled tradespeople, who have spent three days competing in their skill area along with over 1,000 participants from 53 countries all with the same goal in mind: to win a medal and to do their best.


I am absolutely delighted to announce that Australia came home with three silver medals, two bronze medals and 11 medallions of excellence, which are presented to the top competitors in each skill area that score above average. One of the three silver medals was won by Joseph Pauley in the industrial mechanics millwright category. Joseph also walked away with the best of nation award, which is presented to the highest scoring competitor from their respective country. The remaining silver medals were presented to Jyothi Forman in the jewellery category and Harlan Wilton for web design. The two bronze medals were awarded to Dylan Di Martino for plumbing and heating and to Sam Spong for bricklaying. Sam was trained by Troy Everett, one of our Australian Apprenticeships ambassadors, so I am especially pleased with that result.


Let me focus particularly on our best of nation award winner, Joseph Pauley, for one moment. Joseph is from Albany, Western Australia. He has a Certificate III in Engineering Mechanical Trade—Fitter and Machinist—and was trained at the Midland campus of Polytechnic West. Joseph has a genuine passion for his trade and has credited his WorldSkills journey with having made him a better tradesman. Joseph also faced a recent personal tragedy that almost saw him leave the competition before it started, but he persevered and came home with the silver medal. I am sure all senators would agree with me that he was well rewarded and is well deserving of his silver medal, as indeed all our Skillaroos deserve the praise that they receive.


Joseph's fellow silver medallist, Jyothi Forman, completed a certificate III in jewellery manufacture at Melbourne Polytechnic. And Harlan Wilton, the third Skillaroo silver medallist, completed his diploma in web design at the TAFE New South Wales Western Sydney Institute's Wentworth Falls campus. Special mention also goes to John Reminis from Nowra, whom I particularly enjoyed baking bread with during a visit to Nowra in recent months. He is one of the recipients of the medallion of excellence, along with Kallon McVicar in welding, Nicholas Roman in joinery, Hayley Parker in hairdressing, Emma Hillier in fashion technology, Adele Di Bella in patisserie and confectionery, Karl Davies in automobile technology, Samantha Johnson in restaurant service, Blair Watters in car painting, Beau Kupris in refrigeration and air conditioning and Dale Fisher in graphic design technology.


I would like to acknowledge every one of the 26 Skillaroos, whether a medallist or not; all the experts; the families and friends; the teachers; the trainers; the employers; and the amazing team who helped support our WorldSkills Australia contestants, led by Mark Callaghan, for their relentless determination to represent our nation proudly. That is exactly what they did. They represented Australia proudly and demonstrated that all Australians should be proud of our vocational education sector, which is highly respected across the world. The results at WorldSkills show that our skills are not confined to one area; we have shown excellence across industries as diverse as restaurant service, jewellery making and bricklaying.


Continuing to focus on the quality of our training system and the skills of the people within it is critical to Australia's future prosperity. Our government's policies are determined to ensure that we have the highest quality in the content of training and the highest quality amongst our training providers. On behalf of the government, I extend my congratulations to everyone involved in Skillaroos and I look forward to personally acknowledging their efforts next month once they have all returned home.
