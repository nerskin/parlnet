"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2010-11-16,"—The coalition supports the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Connecting People with Jobs) Bill 2010. Apart from some of the self-congratulatory assertions in the minister’s second reading speech in the House of Representatives, the speech outlined very well what the government is seeking to achieve. This is one of those bills that, since it is only four pages long, is fairly easy for us in this chamber to decipher, to understand and come to grips with on a relatively quick basis if we are so inclined.
The idea of this legislation is to assist long-term unemployed job seekers living in areas with high unemployment to relocate and take up a full-time job elsewhere. Funds for relocation on a reimbursement basis will be provided for job seekers with assistance for such things as airfares, removalists, temporary accommodation and post-placement support and mentoring. I understand that this is a trial targeted at the long-term unemployed.
We as a coalition have always believed in the concept of mutual obligation, that if a taxpayer is to make a contribution to a citizen for your assistance then there is an obligation for that citizen to acknowledge that to the community at large. As a result, the government is proposing that, if a person fails to stay in employment without a reasonable excuse for six months and has received assistance from the Connecting People with Jobs relocation pilot program, they incur a wait of up to 12 weeks for more assistance.
The coalition had a virtually identical policy when we were last in government. It was condemned by Labor and now they are reintroducing it—a program that we implemented. It was a policy that was hollowly condemned by Labor, and now it is being adopted virtually in its entirety. So you have a government that does not have an agenda of its own and is unable to make the right calls and so, scratching around, once again goes to the coalition to adopt good, sound policy ideas for the future of our country.
I understand this is being sold as a trial, yet we had this scheme while we were in government and it was criticised by Labor as being non-effective. Indeed, when we announced our policies before the last election, I recall that one of the kingmakers—who I am sure Senator Arbib is well acquainted with—one of the faceless men in the Labor Party, Mr Paul Howes, branded this idea. Providing encouragement for the unemployed to move to find work in another area—relocation and retraining to find a job—especially when unemployment is low, is not a new concept, but it did not stop the boss of the Australian Workers’ Union, Paul Howes, branding the idea as ‘crass politics’ and ‘Tony Abbott’s Sarah Palin moment’, which showed how ‘removed his thinking was from the real world of work’. That was said in April this year.
Having said that, Mr Howes has gone strangely quiet on the government actually adopting this as their policy and committing to our policy, which was designed to get people into work. It does seem somewhat incongruous that we pay unemployment benefits to those in high-unemployment areas and yet there are demands for labour in other areas of our great, large country where there is a shortage of employable people. Being able to match the unemployed with the jobs that are available in other parts of the country, especially where people are capable of moving, makes good sense from a social equity point of view and it makes good sense from an economic point of view. Let us keep in mind that the best social security policy any government can deliver to its people is a job through which they can become self-reliant. That is why we as a coalition have supported this concept for some time.
It is good to see the Labor Party coming on board and adopting our policy; it is good to see the Labor Party acknowledging that this is an area that needs to be addressed. Whilst this is a trial I do note that the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations made mention of relocation in its 2006-07 annual report under the section ‘Report on performance: workforce participation’. It was noted that it occurred largely in the construction industry or in the hospitality sector supporting the mining industry in Western Australia. The fact that we have been able to relocate unemployed people to where the jobs are in the past shows that it does work. It also shows, of course, that Labor’s criticism of our action plan that was delivering results in the run-up to the 2007 election was hollow rhetoric—they have now adopted our policy some three years later, having seen the social and economic benefits of our approach in this area.
As I said in commencement, the coalition supports the legislation. I will not bother to repeat the exact detail of the regime, which, I might say, the minister outlined so succinctly in her second reading speech on 21 October 2010 in the other place. The coalition supports the bill and commends it to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CONNECTING PEOPLE WITH JOBS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2010-11-16,"—The Greens do not support the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Connecting People with Jobs) Bill 2010 and I will articulate why. During the election the government announced the Connecting People with Jobs trial, which will allow long-term unemployed people—those who have been out of work for 12 months or more—to be eligible for reimbursement of up to $3,000 if they relocate to a metropolitan area for work or up to $6,000 if they relocate to a regional area for work, plus an additional $3,000 if they have dependent children. The trial, as we know, will provide a wage subsidy of $2,500 to employers as an incentive to employ these particular job seekers. The trial will be for two years and is aimed to assist 2,000 people.
I note that the funding for this trial is not new money but money already allocated to the Employment Pathway Fund. This bill allows for job seekers in certain circumstances to have their social security stopped for 12 weeks. The current legislation already provides for an eight-week non-payment period where a job seeker becomes unemployed as a result of a voluntary act or due to misconduct. This bill seeks to extend that period to 12 weeks where the job seeker has been paid relocation assistance. The Greens’ concern and opposition to the eight-week non-payment period is well documented and we have articulated in this place on numerous occasions the impact that that eight-week non-payment period has had on people.
The Greens are supportive of measures to provide incentives for long-term unemployed people to find work, including through assistance with relocation costs. That is not what we have an issue with. We do not understand why we have to have the severe additional penalty contained in this bill. It is needless, in our opinion The Greens do not support the current eight-week non-payment period and we do not, therefore, support its extension to 12 weeks. We believe that the impact that the eight-week non-payment period has had on people has been extremely severe. It has in fact led to people dropping out of the social security system altogether, which has meant that there have actually been rolling eight-week non-payment periods. This occurred more often before the government amendments bringing in a much better Employment Pathway Plan, a much better compliance process, a better examination of other options et cetera. Having said that, we are still concerned about the impact that the eight-week non-payment period has had with, as I said, people dropping out of the system and rolling eight-week non-payment periods, and about the impact on certain groups of people and people in certain locations. We are concerned about the impact this much more extensive process could have.
Regardless of circumstances, three months is a long time for people to go without any financial support. We are concerned about the punitive compliance measures proposed to keep people in jobs, particularly when the incentives in this measure are aimed at those who have been out of work for 12 months or more. People who have been out of work for 12 months or more have significant employment barriers, and we are concerned that a significant employment barrier may be a reason why somebody may leave a job once they have started it. Some of those barriers, which may not have been addressed while those people were on income support, may not be acknowledged and may be a contributing factor to their unemployment.
I would also note in passing that we have some concerns that the funding for counselling through the JSA process will stop and that that counselling service will then stop, so that people will not even be able to access that type of service. In fact, we are concerned that the 12-week non-payment period may actually put people off accessing this incentive in the first place.
Voluntarily leaving a job can occur for a variety of reasons—including because of bullying, lack of support or personal circumstances—that we do not believe justify such a severe penalty. This is so particularly when you also take into account that people may be relocating a significant way from their current residence into regional areas and may not get the support they need to stay in a job—particularly, as I said, when we are aiming these incentives at those who have been out of work for a significant period of time. I am concerned that the support services that may be needed to keep people in employment, particularly in regional and more remote areas, may not be available.
We do support attempts by the government to assist people to relocate for work. As I have said, that is because we think that we need to be offering these sorts of incentives to encourage and support people back into the workforce. But just giving financial support is not necessarily addressing what are, for some people, very significant barriers to employment. While we support the attempts by government to assist people to relocate for work, we simply cannot support the provisions of this bill and what we think is the needless increase in the non-payment period.
An eight-week non-payment period, when you have no other source of income, is already a significant deterrent, in our opinion. Indeed, as I have said in this place many times, we believe that eight weeks is too severe—let alone going to 12 weeks. If we have to have a non-payment period, we believe the current, eight-week, period is enough of a deterrent. As I have already said, we have concerns about even the current period.
This bill is, in fact, not about connecting people with jobs; it is about punishing people who are in need of support. We believe we should be focusing our efforts on actually addressing the question: what are the barriers to long-term employment? We believe we should be putting a lot more into ensuring that the people who are in this program are supported to stay in work and into addressing some of the issues that may influence their ability to stay in jobs that they relocate for.
So we do not support this bill. We think it is unnecessarily harsh. We do not support the eight-week non-payment period, as I have said. Just in case people out there have not got that message: we do not like it. We believe is a significant barrier in itself and, therefore, unnecessary. We also believe, as I said, that it is counterproductive and does not consider adequately enough the reasons for which people may leave work. As I said, it may in fact act as a disincentive if people realise that they may then have a 12-week non-payment period. I realise that the two major parties agree on this bill, but we do not support it. We do support the incentives process in this approach, but we do not support the severe penalty that is introduced in this bill.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CONNECTING PEOPLE WITH JOBS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2010-11-16,"—I thank Senators Abetz and Siewert for their comments in the debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Connecting People with Jobs) Bill 2010. However, I reject Senator Abetz’s comments regarding the government’s agenda. The government has had an extremely strong agenda in terms of employment participation. The stimulus for nation building and jobs was targeted at keeping people in employment: 200,000 jobs were supported and protected by the stimulus package while, at the same time, workers, who otherwise may have lost their jobs, were kept in employment and could keep food on their tables and roofs over their families’ heads. That is what the government stands for.
This bill is a key component of the government’s Connecting People with Jobs trial. It aims to improve labour mobility and support for long-term unemployed job seekers. The Connecting People with Jobs trial will commence on 1 January 2011. It will provide support for long-term unemployed job seekers living in areas with high unemployment rates and keep them connected with jobs in other parts of Australia. Job seekers who relocate to take up an ongoing full-time position or apprenticeship will be reimbursed up to $9,000 for relocation expenses and other needed supports. Under the trial, job seekers will be eligible for reimbursement of up to $3,000 for relocating to a metropolitan area or $6,000 for moving to fill a job in a regional area. They may be eligible for an additional $3,000 if they are relocating with their family.
Relocation, as we know, often has high costs, especially when it involves moving interstate or even across the country. These job seekers will have sought employment in their current location for at least 12 months but may have lacked the resources to move to take up employment further afield. As part of Labor’s election commitment, employers will also be eligible for a wage subsidy of $2,500 to create an upfront incentive for taking on these job seekers. This is in recognition of the additional support and assistance individuals will need in the early stages of their employment in the new location. While this trial will encourage the long-term unemployed to relocate to take up a job, this bill seeks to create an incentive for individuals to stay in their new location and to keep them in sustainable employment. Specifically, the bill seeks to strengthen associated compliance measures for job seekers who have been assisted to relocate to a job under the trial by extending to 12 weeks the period of nonpayment of income support, should a relocating job seeker leave the job within the first six months as a result of a voluntary act or of misconduct.
We know that job seekers were previously subject to an eight-week non-payment period. In relation to Senator Siewert’s comments can I just say that under the trial, if a job seeker leaves their relocation employment without good cause within the first six months, the standard non-payment period will be increased from eight weeks to 12 weeks. The important point is that this will happen if they leave ‘without good cause’. Job seekers will of course have an opportunity to explain their situation to Centrelink.
The national unemployment rate currently sits at 5.4 per cent, which is down from 5.7 per cent a year ago. However, the truth is that the employment situation varies across the country. In the modern age there is a need for greater labour mobility—that is something we all accept—and relocating part of the workforce to meet employer demand is an effective measure of achieving this. The Connecting People With Jobs trial will enhance the flexibility of the labour market by encouraging additional relocation activity to help better match labour supply with demand. The funds for relocation will provide job seekers with assistance for things such as airfares, removals, temporary accommodation, post-placement support and mentoring. I think that is very important: it is not just about the relocation expenses; it is also about post-placement support and mentoring. It will also provide employers with the workers they need to grow their businesses and ensure that people have sustainable employment into the future.
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CONNECTING PEOPLE WITH JOBS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2010-11-16,"—I will start by making some general comments in relation to Minister Roxon’s comments about alleged delays and her attempt to attribute those delays to the coalition. The Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill 2010 is based on a 2008 COAG agreement to establish an agency to coordinate preventive health measures between governments, and it has been in this parliament since 2009. There was a debate on this legislation in October 2009; indeed, this is one of the bills that has been sitting on my shelf since I took responsibility for health and ageing in the Senate in late 2009.
Senator Cormann represented the coalition’s position of support for preventive health but not support for another big bureaucracy. In his speech in the second reading debate on 22 October 2009 he called for the government to respond to all the recommendations of the National Preventative Health Taskforce review. On 26 November 2009 Senator Cormann, on behalf of the coalition, again called for a response to that review to be tabled. In February 2010 the bill was again scheduled for debate—amendments were drawn up in preparation for the debate—and again it slipped sidewards. Since then the bill has appeared on the Senate Notice Paper a number of times. For example, it was listed on 22 June as order of the day No. 7. If this is a government priority, the government should have ensured it had higher priority so that it could be reached; indeed, on 23 June it had slipped down to No. 8 and by 24 June it had completely disappeared. Instead, in a last-minute panic, the Senate had to deal with the health identifiers legislation on 24 June—at the death knell of the last parliament. That night the House had to be recalled just to pass Minister Roxon’s legislation because she and the government could not get their act together and get their programming right. Like the preventive health legislation this was shuffled down the list repeatedly.
I raise this because we have had to put up with repeated comments from Minister Roxon. She cannot get her facts right and she persists in putting out these silly press releases that tell us legislation is being blocked in the Senate by the opposition—despite my suggestions to the minister at the last debate that she ought to get a copy of the Senate procedures and understand them or go back to the people who put together the orders and procedures in the Senate and complain to them about the delay. I think it is time that Minister Roxon stopped having these hissy fits and unfairly blaming everyone but herself for her own delays. In this case the minister, not the opposition, is to blame. We put this down to her incompetence. She ought to stop blaming others and get on with the job.
I now turn to the matter before us. Approximately 32 per cent of Australia’s disease burden is attributable to modifiable risk factors. Investing time and energy into preventing chronic or life-threatening disease will obviously assist. At the moment, we are sitting third from the bottom of the OECD list for obesity, we compare poorly with other OECD countries in terms of diabetes and we are mid-ranking on alcohol consumption. Having said that, our tobacco rates are amongst the lowest in the world. The combined efforts of national and state governments over 30 years have seen the incidence of smoking falling from 36 per cent of the adult population in 1977 to 19 per cent in 2007. We have seen a series of long-term successful public health campaigns by various governments. It is now possible to travel on an aeroplane or eat a meal in a restaurant without having somebody breathe smoke in your face. Having said that, that is impossible when you walk past buildings in the CBD, because smokers are standing outside smoking. Smoking rates are too high but the numbers are dropping. The coalition believes preventive health should be on the national agenda because treating people with chronic preventable diseases leads to a substantial reduction in economic and social costs.
Chronic disease is a significant burden on our healthcare system. This leads to substantial economic and social costs for all Australians. If we can manage these costs then it will raise a significant burden from Australia’s healthcare system—a system that is already under a lot of pressure. Increased focus on preventative health—keeping people healthy and out of hospital—is a very important goal for any government. Of course, we agree with provisions to this effect.
Ten years ago, in the context of tax reform, the Howard government responded to the advocacy of many health groups to move the taxation of tobacco to a per stick excise rather than on the basis of weight. I would like to focus, if I could for a few minutes, on the coalition’s record on preventative health. Two years ago the coalition proposed an increase in the level of tobacco excise as part of the budget-in-reply debate, recognising that cigarette smoking still represents the biggest burden of disease and preventable death in Australia.
There have been lifestyle campaigns, anti-alcohol-abuse campaigns and anti-drug campaigns. For example, there was Measure Up, a coalition government measure in 2006, as part of the Australian Better Health Initiative. The aim with that campaign was to reduce the risk factors associated with chronic disease such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cancer and other diseases.
I tell you this because, if it was left to Minister Roxon, she would totally—utterly—forget everything that the coalition ever did on preventative health. It is as if before she came nobody even talked about preventative health—as if nobody ever did anything. This is really the hypocrisy of Minister Roxon. Of course preventative health is a goal for everyone. We continued when we were in government to support and encourage healthy lifestyles to reduce the risks of many chronic diseases. It is a no-brainer. As conceived, the agency will conduct social-marketing campaigns and research into preventative health—something that has occurred under successive governments since at least the Fraser years. How could we forget the Life Be in It campaign featuring Norm? So, Minister Roxon cannot seriously be believed when she suggests that nobody has mounted campaigns in the past.
I will just make some comments in relation to the coalition’s concerns about the bill. The original bill raised a lot more questions than it answered. Indeed, in three years, the government engaged in a lot of talk but did not achieve much. Certainly the functions of this agency as provided by the bill are far reaching, to say the least. In summary, the agency’s objectives—through its CEO—are (1) to analyse and disseminate information on preventative health to the public, business and government; (2) to make recommendations and provide policy advice on preventative health matters; (3) conduct awareness and education campaigns; (4) make financial assistance grants on behalf the Commonwealth; and (5) develop national standards and codes of practice.
Our concern all along has been that this bill would add yet another layer of bureaucracy without any assurances of real results for the health sector. Like a lot of things that this government has done, or has sought to turn its attention to, it sounds good but in the delivery there are problems. We only have to look at the Building Education Revolution, pink batts or the cash for clunkers to see that this government does not have a good history in relation to detail. Our concern was to ensure that this agency will be a transparent body with a purpose. That is what we have sought to do all along.
The changes that have been proposed by the coalition would mean that the CEO must publish on the agency’s website a copy of any advice or recommendations. We will be proposing some amendments, and I note that Senator Xenophon is also proposing an amendment in the same terms. We will come to those in the committee stage. For us, these amendments are about open government—the transparency of this process. Regrettably, since the introduction of the original bill in the previous parliament the government has restricted the extent to which there is public information available on the proposed body.
The explanatory memorandum of the original bill provided a breakdown of fund allocations over the forward estimates. That breakdown has not been provided in this current bill, and we would like to know why it has been left out. The explanatory memorandum, in addition, restricts social-marketing campaigns to those that target only obesity or smoking. Is this deliberate or simply an error in the drafting of the explanatory memorandum? Will the problems, for example, of teenage binge drinking and harmful drinking be getting a social marketing campaign?
Social marketing is an important focus of the agency and we would like to get some clarity as to the intended scope of the social marketing. Research shows that social marketing carried out in isolation is inadequate in influencing behavioural change. It would be more effective to broaden the scope of social marketing in order to integrate other measures such as telephone counselling or online tools. For example, the Quit campaign is a good campaign, where taking a collaborative, holistic approach ensures that the message can be sold a lot more successfully.
The degree to which this agency can be successful will depend on the degree to which they successfully engage with all stakeholders. Most Australians have paid a visit to their GP sometime in the previous 12 months. GPs are geared up to provide assistance to help people give up smoking or make lifestyle changes. The agency cannot operate in isolation and must ensure that there is strong engagement with all the stakeholders to achieve behavioural change across the Australian community. There are existing awareness campaigns. We want to know whether the social marketing campaigns proposed will supplement or be a substitute for previous campaigns. In similar terms, what about the research that is already occurring in the areas of obesity, drug and alcohol abuse and cigarette smoking? Will what is proposed for this agency supplement or simply be a substitute for those activities?
The over-$100 million for the national social marketing campaign is significant. We need to have further clarification as to where this money will be spent. It has become evident after consultations that, whilst the broad functions of the CEO and the agency are far-reaching, the extent to which the CEO or the agency can conduct educational awareness programs relating to mental health is limited and the agency can only conduct programs—alcohol, tobacco use and other substance abuse and obesity—as drafted in the bill. This does not provide the opportunity to achieve broader community benefits than those otherwise focused on in the bill.
We support a greater focus on the health system in its moves towards prevention and practical outcomes that can have a lasting and overall effect on the lives of Australians. As I said, preventative health measures cannot be taken in isolation. Early detection and intervention to avoid disease progression are just as important. And, of course, the innovations of computerisation and practice nurses over the last decade mean that family practices now are much better placed to lead the preventative health effort and to encourage individuals to change their behaviour. The bottom line is that there is general consensus for an increased focus on preventative health. We all know this, except that it is not enough that we simply agree on the importance. We need to have a viable and transparent body with clear objectives. It must be well governed. We need to be assured of positive practical results in the area of preventative health.
We see the establishment of the Australian National Preventive Health Agency, regrettably, as adding another layer of bureaucracy without any assurance of positive health outcomes. Being seen to be taking action is not the same as actually taking action. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Ageing say that the government will allocate $17 million to establish and operate the agency if this legislation is passed. While the object of the bill is to establish the agency to advise on the managed national preventative health outcome, to be truly effective the agency must be viable and transparent.
The coalition during the committee stage will be proposing some amendments. In the House, Dr Southcott proposed five amendments. There were two sets of amendments. The amendment relating to the objects and functions of the agency was accepted and I commend the government for accepting our amendment in the other place. The bill that is before us includes that amendment in clause 2A. Another amendment proposed by the coalition in the House related to the functions of the CEO. We moved to expand those functions. Again, that has been included in the amended bill. As I said earlier, health groups were concerned that the agency would be restricted to addressing only alcohol, tobacco use and other substance abuse and obesity. The coalition’s amendment ensures that other areas of preventative health—but most importantly the promotion of a healthy lifestyle generally—can form and are part of the functions of the CEO.
The amendments proposed by the coalition, first of all, go to the inclusion of a definition of an industry representative. It is important that there be appropriate industry representatives who have commercial expertise in manufacture, distribution or marketing of foods or beverages, including of alcohol beverages. You cannot seriously contemplate preventative health measures without taking into account food and beverages, including of course alcohol beverages. I think it is important in developing a collaborative approach that they be included as part of this process. We will also be, as I foreshadowed earlier, proposing an amendment with Senator Xenophon relating to publication. This amendment will obligate the CEO to provide details of any recommendations made to the government. It also goes part of the way to addressing the concerns about lack of independence and transparency. It also increases public engagement through further dialogue between the public health and industry sectors and, of course, it is about public scrutiny and debate.
We also have another amendment which goes to the membership of the advisory council of the agency and the inclusion of industry representatives and other representatives from consumers or consumer health organisations. It is vitally important that the advisory council has broad representation, not just from government health experts but from industry and consumer groups, so that it can truly have a balanced approach to how it looks at preventative health.
I mentioned the issues relating to the breakdown of fund allocations over forward estimates. Other issues that we would like some explanation of include, as I have indicated, our concerns about the limited scope of social marketing campaigns. Social marketing campaigns have not been defined in the legislation and we really would like to have some clarification as to the scope of social marketing. I will leave further comments for the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2010-11-16,"—The Greens believe that the real challenge for our health system, now and into the future, is managing illness in a way that keeps people out of hospital and well. We believe the evidence is overwhelming that our health policies should focus on keeping people well, preventing illness and better managing illness in the community. We very strongly believe in preventative health measures—and, of course, helping to keep people well is where preventative health comes in.
The Greens believe strong leadership is required if preventative health activities are to get the attention and the funding that they need. Short-term political cycles encourage governments to favour what most of us see as quick fixes, things such as more hospital beds. That is not to say we do not believe hospital beds are important, but often the solution to the crisis in our health system is to provide more hospital beds without actually looking at the overall health of the health system itself. Other quick fixes are used, but quite often these are put in place ahead of long-term preventative health strategies that require more complex approaches and cross-portfolio coordination where the benefits are in fact deferred for many years and so are not accountable in short-term decision making in short-term budget cycles. Investing now in our health system will pay off in the future.
The Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill 2010 has been a long time coming to the Senate. I must say that I share Senator Fierravanti-Wells’s concerns around the fact that there seems to have been a bit of finger-pointing about the Senate. We had dialogue around the need for some amendments, and I should say here that we are very pleased that the government has in fact adopted into this bill most of the amendments that we put up last time. I do acknowledge that, but it was after we had that discussion and indicated our concerns about the bill; we were ready to debate it a long time ago. It is not the Senate’s fault that the government chose not to prioritise this bill and bring it on earlier. I have been receiving emails, and I am sure Senator Fierravanti-Wells has too, from people saying, ‘Please support the Preventive Health Agency; it is way over time that we had such an agency,’ so we have been ready to debate this for some time. People are waiting for action in building—I emphasise the word ‘building’—Australia’s preventative health capacity.
The Greens’ vision for health reform is to transform the costly hospital based sickness system to a wellness system that promotes and supports good health and early intervention approaches. The Greens believe that spiralling health costs can be contained and reduced by this approach, but, most importantly, people will be healthier and feel better and so will be better off. The Preventative Health Taskforce report made a number of recommendations, but the focus was on alcohol, tobacco and obesity. They are rightly seen as key areas of action, although there are other areas that we obviously need to focus on—and I say again that I am pleased the government accepted the amendments broadening the scope of the agency.
We know that most interventions to prevent harm caused by alcohol, tobacco and obesity attempt to change consumer behaviour. A common approach to attempt to change consumer behaviour has been to run social marketing campaigns. These have been effective in some areas but less so in other areas; attempts to change consumer behaviour need a fairly complex and focused long-term approach.
Successive governments have run advertising information campaigns to promote, for example, improved diet and increased physical activity, with the aim of preventing or reducing obesity. Despite these campaigns, obesity rates have continued to rise. Despite campaigns to reduce alcohol consumption, alcohol abuse continues to rise. Evidently these campaigns have not adequately achieved their aims and we still have a long way to go. This suggests that to change behaviour we need a much more strategic approach and not merely provide information and adjust economic incentives. We need a greater understanding of consumer interaction and what drives behaviour change and we need a variety of approaches. There is no silver bullet—if there were, hopefully we would have used it. The antitobacco campaign was a very strategic, long-term campaign using a variety of approaches. The same is true of campaigns addressing alcohol abuse. We have debated this in the chamber and we know very well that price is a very important part of the strategic approach, but we also know that opening and closing hours and social marketing campaigns—all these strategies—need to be part of the approach.
This conclusion is supported by research in behavioural economics, which has shown that in many cases, even when consumers have ready access to understandable information, they may still fail to choose the product or service that best suits their needs. This is because they may ignore or misinterpret relevant information or fail to act on that information because of other barriers to them changing their behaviour.
It is generally considered that the tobacco cessation program has been successful in Australia. The 30 per cent decline in smoking rates between 1975 and 1995 prevented over 400,000 premature deaths and saved over $8.4 billion, which is more than 50 times the amount spent on the antismoking campaign over that time. As I said, this was achieved through a variety of measures. Price signals, higher tobacco taxes and information programs were part of this. However, restrictions on the advertising, sale and consumption of tobacco have also been very important elements. Concerted efforts over more than 20 years have changed community attitudes towards smoking. This change in attitude is also likely to have contributed to a further reduction in smoking rates as smokers have felt increasingly ostracised. Again I point out that this has been a long-term campaign that took a multiple-strand strategic approach involving long-term investment. I think it reflects well on successive governments that they have kept investing in and maintaining the campaign, but we need the same sort of long-term strategic approach to other areas of preventative health such as obesity and alcohol abuse.
To some extent, the lessons from tobacco cessation can be applied to junk food and alcohol; however, of course, we know there are key differences in the products. There is no safe or healthy level of tobacco use, but the same is not true for alcohol or junk foods. And there is no way that I want anybody saying that we want to take the same approach to tobacco, in saying no use, in terms of alcohol or junk foods. Clearly, we should not be using tobacco because it has any level adverse health outcomes. The same cannot be said for junk foods or alcohol. Instead, consumers are advised to limit or moderate their consumption. It would not be possible to make unhealthy eating or excessive consumption of alcohol socially unacceptable behaviours to the same extent that tobacco has been. So we need to look at other ways of behavioural change.
The task force noted in relation to obesity that a major action should be to embed physical exercise and healthy eating in everyday life through social, community and workplace programs. We believe these types of programs will be effective because they would be easy to access and could involve commitments to peers and colleagues. However, as noted previously, information, education and social marketing alone have not been and will not be sufficient to bring about sufficient changes to consumer behaviour or the rates of overweight, obese and diet related diseases associated with alcohol consumption and unhealthy eating.
Figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare tell us that in 2008 only 2.5 per cent of Australia’s health budget was allocated to public health, with the remainder spent on care and treatment services. We believe that, at the very least, this should be raised to four per cent of the health budget. Preventative success should benefit us all through future savings in healthcare expenditure on treatments for preventable diseases, increased taxation transfers from high individual incomes and fewer welfare payments. Businesses should benefit from reduced absenteeism from work and fewer recruitment and training costs associated with placing staff who have to retire early or have substantial time off due to ill health. Individuals should benefit from an increase in income, reduced absenteeism from work or time spent out of the role at home and, of course, increased quality of life from reduced levels of ill health.
According to the figures in a recent report published by VicHealth, The health and economic benefits of reducing disease risk factors in Australia:
In Australia, 13% of adults drink alcohol at a risky or ‘high risk’ level long term.
Annually, Australians drink more litres of alcohol per capita (9.8) than Americans (8.4), Canadians (8.0), Swedes (6.6) and Norwegians (6.4).
Alcohol contributed a net 2.3% to the overall health burden in Australia, with alcohol dependence (39%), suicide and self-inflicted injuries (14%), and road traffic accidents (13%) the major consequences.
Brief alcohol interventions in primary care can reduce alcohol consumption by around 10% (approximately 4 standard drinks of alcohol per week), but other interventions have not demonstrated long-term change.
            …         …         …
Drinking alcohol heavily over a period of time can increase the risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver, cognitive problems, dementia and alcohol dependence ... High risk consumption has also been associated with oral, throat and oesophageal cancer ... and breast cancer in women.
            …         …         …
A review of community-based initiatives restricting alcohol availability in remote Australia identified reductions in consumption ... These reductions ranged from 0.2% ... to 7% in Halls Creek and even up to 60-80% in Curtin Springs, where the restrictions were comprehensive.
Having said that, I would also point out that the way that you introduce restrictions in consumption is very, very important. We have seen a great resistance in communities where restrictions have been imposed externally but, where you work in cooperation with community and drive them from a community decision-making basis, they have been much more effective. Again, it is another important part of how we start addressing and taking preventative health measures.
The Greens have indicated in the past and have highlighted in a number of our policies and initiatives in-principle support for taxation measures that increase the cost of the activities that are incurring a cost for society by causing people harm and doing damage to our environment. We believe these are also very important tools, and I have already highlighted the role that price signals play, for example, in alcohol consumption. We believe such price signals could also play a role in addressing issues around junk food.
These examples all highlight the need for a strong agency that really builds Australia’s capacity in preventative health. The Greens have been strongly supportive of the concept and were supportive of the agency from the start. But we were concerned with the previous bill and believed that a number of changes needed to be made. As I said earlier, I am pleased that the government took those changes on board in the drafting of this bill. I am also very pleased that they have agreed that the $50 million that they are putting aside from the alcopops tax—put aside to address the alcohol voluntary sponsorship fund, the social marketing campaigns and the hotline—will be overseen by the agency or be part of the agency’s activities. We believe that makes much more sense, given that that was about preventative health—and, of course, this agency is about preventative health. We are very pleased, and I thank the minister for indicating that that will happen.
We want to be assured that the agency will have powers that ensure all relevant government agencies across jurisdictions are coordinating, engaging and active in prevention strategies. It is particularly important that this should include a cross-sector commitment of state and territory governments and their agencies, acknowledging that primary prevention goes far beyond health departments and requires support and leadership from multiple agencies. We want an all-government action at Commonwealth, state and territory levels and evidence gathering on current jurisdiction programs so that effective measures can be rolled out nationally. It is very important that we measure the effectiveness of various measures.
We have been calling for a long time for allocation of specific funding to local areas for prevention activities. In particular, we believe that we need to focus on preventative health in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. That is extremely important. Just this morning Transplant Australia had a function here in Parliament House and talked about Indigenous health, the escalating rate of kidney disease in Aboriginal communities and the increasing need for dialysis. But, of course, that means that we have to have strong prevention programs as well. We believe that this agency can and must play an essential role in driving preventative health strategies in this country.
We are pleased that the opposition moved the same amendments in the House of Representatives that I had planned to move in the Senate. We supported those amendments because they were basically the same amendments that the Greens had articulated on several occasions. I tabled them during debate of the last bill. Missing from this bill were clear objectives for the agency. As I said, we are pleased that the opposition jumped in before us and moved those amendments in the House of Representatives. It was essential that the bill had those objectives. We also supported the coalition’s amendments on better defining the role of the CEO. Having said that, the Greens in the House of Representatives did not support coalition amendments for industry representatives. We think that the agency plays a very significant role in the way tobacco, obesity and alcohol are used in this country. We believe we need to have an agency that is independent of industry influence. We have been very clear about that from the start. We will not be supporting industry representation in the agency.
The Greens are attracted to the amendment on the role of making advice available. We did not support the amendment that the coalition put up last time which required disclosure within 14 days. We thought that time period was too short. Senator Xenophon and the coalition have put up an amendment around provision of advice and recommendations by the agency to government. The Greens are attracted to that because, if the agency is very clear about the advice that it is providing and they believe it is strong advice, we do not see why that advice should not be made available. If that advice is controversial, I reckon Australia needs to know about it. It may mean that we need to take a more radical, far-reaching approach. As I said, we are attracted to it. We are not necessarily convinced about the six-month time frame, although it is much better than 16 days. There is merit in providing that sort of information to the community so that we can get an idea around the approach the agency is taking on these very important issues.
The Greens are pleased that the government has finally brought this piece of legislation in for debate. We are very supportive of the agency. We are pleased the government has supported our amendments. We would like to see the agency getting on with the job of promoting and developing preventative health strategies for this country.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2010-11-16,"—I am pleased to stand in the Senate to speak to the Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill 2010 and support it. I am aware of the amendments put forward by a number of senators on behalf of the coalition. The government, through this bill, is addressing concerns in the three areas of obesity, tobacco and alcohol. Many of the objectives and the substance of the bill came out of the National Health Preventative Taskforce report. I want to commend Professor Rob Moodie, Professor Paul Zimmet and members of that task force for the work that they did. This is important work. Many of their recommendations have not been adequately responded to by the Labor government in terms of action. It appears to me that the government is in a policy paralysis position at the moment. I will explain why.
I would like to address my remarks in particular to concerns addressed in this bill about the obesity epidemic in Australia. I acknowledge the work that will have to be undertaken with respect to tobacco and alcohol, but my remarks will relate to obesity and the health complications that flow from that—for example, type 2 diabetes, cancer, heart disease and a whole range of other health complications. Prior to the 2007 election, the government made obesity a national health priority. That was strongly welcomed. They adopted a recommendation that I set out in my book entitled The millennium disease: responses to Australia’s obesity epidemic, edited by me and launched by the Hon. Tony Abbott in December 2006. They adopted my policy and I am very pleased about that. Since then there has been little action in addressing this epidemic. They have made it a national health priority but there has been little action.
In terms of the cost of obesity in Australia today, Access Economics released a report. It was about three years ago at one of my healthy lifestyle forums—I have had 10 since 2002—which are held annually in Canberra or in Tasmania. That report said that the cost is some $58 billion a year—$8.3 billion directly and then there are indirect and lost productivity costs. That is a huge amount. This is not just a health concern; this is a concern for the economy. This is a concern for all levels of government and, in particular, the federal government. Dr Lynne Pezzullo from Access Economics presented that report and it has been used and referred to consistently, month after month, year after year, since it was released some years ago. It was updated as well.
I also refer to the Medibank Health Solutions research report, Obesity in Australia: financial impacts and cost benefits of intervention, of March 2010—a more recent report which stated that it is estimated that 7,200 Australians die each year due to obesity and obesity related illness. That is serious. Those are big numbers. Fellow Aussies are dying every year as a result of this epidemic. Of course, this does not refer to the health complications that flow through; I am simply referring to the number of deaths. The report states that obesity intervention policies aimed at reducing the prevalence of obesity in Australia will yield strong benefits for the economy. I congratulate Medibank on that research and for the work that has been undertaken. There is clearly a whole lot more work to do.
The aggressive effort by the former Howard government was initiated at my healthy lifestyle forum in June 2004, where the Howard government announced four key initiatives: two hours of PE in schools per week, a $15 million incentive to clean up our tuckshops—there is still a lot more work to do on that all around Australia—and the Active After-school Communities program, which is a fantastically successful program that has, sadly, not been fully extended by this federal Labor government. When obesity and diabetes are national health priorities, why won’t they extend that successful and popular program? It is a great shame and a great sadness. Under public pressure, including from Tasmania and all across the country, the Active After-school Communities program has now been extended by one year, but they refuse to extend it further into the future, and that is a great disappointment.
Back in 2004 there was, I think, over $11 million for an education and awareness campaign, and the initiative before us in this bill will increase that substantially. For that I am very grateful. I believe that it is so important to get the message out, particularly among our young people, in terms of improving healthy lifestyles, the way we live our lives, healthy eating and regular exercise.
In Australia today, we are looking at 60 per cent plus of our adult population in terms of people being obese or overweight. Those numbers are tragically high and, sadly, they are increasing, not decreasing. They have been increasing for some decades now, but they seem to be going up and up and up. This has an impact on all parts of our lives. For example, just a month or so ago in Senate estimates the Australian Defence Force updated their figures and confirmed that 14 per cent of the Australian Defence Force were obese. That is just one per cent below the US, which is the fattest nation on the face of this earth. Depending on which review you look at, Australia is in the top four or the top six, behind the US, the UK and Mexico. That is not good enough. This government are on notice. They are aware of these concerns, they are aware of the cost to the community—not just the health costs but the economic costs—and they have done very little. They need to do a lot more.
I want to draw attention to the disgraceful decision made by Nicola Roxon on behalf of the government last Friday. That decision was to totally can the $449 million funding promise, which was to be implemented, for people with diabetes around Australia. This is another broken promise by the Labor government. It happens again and again. Remember that there are 1.5 million Aussies with diabetes—140,000 or thereabouts have type 1—and they would have benefited big time from that. There were concerns from the AMA and others, and I acknowledge that, but the government promised that money. They promised the $449 million. They promised it would happen.
Last month at Senate estimates I asked about the progress of the funding. The government were setting up advisory committees and there were some concerns there. Those concerns were highlighted, but there was not an inkling that that promise would be killed off, that that money would be taken away from care for people with diabetes in Australia. That decision was made last Friday—two days before 14 November, World Diabetes Day. What could be worse? What a cruel hoax on the people of Australia, particularly those 1.5 million Aussies and their families. They were advised that they would be getting support through their GP, through the practice nurse, through the diabetes educators, through the physiotherapists, through the podiatrists and others, and that has been taken away. What has been offered in the place of this funding? A $30 million pilot program. They call it a ‘pilot program’ which will take not one year but three years—maybe four years, according to the minister’s press release of last Friday. That is not good enough. That money has been reduced. I draw this to the attention of all senators and members and also members of the public who may have an interest—and there are many out there who do. They have been swindled.
The government have not made any commitment to say, ‘Yes, that money was directed and will be allocated to people with diabetes.’ In her media release Ms Roxon said that that money will be affecting the forward estimates. That means the money will go into a big black hole in Canberra and will not be reallocated to people with diabetes for their care and attention. The government made a promise on the advance side of the federal election to try to get the votes of the people with diabetes all around this country. Whether it worked or not, I do not know, but maybe it did to some extent. They made that promise and then—bang—two days before World Diabetes Day, 14 November, they say it will be reduced. World Diabetes Day is in honour of the birthday of Frederick Banting, who, along with Charles Best, first conceived the idea which led to the discovery of insulin in 1922. World Diabetes Day is a very important day. Judi Moylan is doing a great job as chairman of the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group, and I am proud to say that we have had an influence on this government and on the former government. We met with Alexander Downer and we encouraged the government at the time to support the UN effort to get a world diabetes day, and we succeeded. We got a UN General Assembly resolution in support of having diabetes considered as one of the key priorities around the world. That is a very key achievement and I am very thankful for that. But this government has not responded in kind and it is a great disappointment.
At this point, I want to acknowledge the great work of Judi Moylan as chairman of that group. It is a bipartisan group, with Labor and Liberal members. As an executive member of that group I am very pleased to acknowledge my colleagues who work on the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group. They do a great job and will continue to support the people of Australia who have diabetes and their families. I have already acknowledged the fantastic work of Professor Paul Zimmet. He advocates for people with diabetes all around the globe—not just in Australia—and is an expert in the field of obesity and diabetes.
It is important that this government acknowledge that we are now living in an obesogenic environment. One-off initiatives, one-off task forces and one-off pilot programs—whether they be $30 million or otherwise—are simply not good enough. We need a total paradigm shift in this country in supporting health prevention measures. I am pleased to say that this bill goes some way to starting that effort and making a difference.
The issues include: advertising to children; getting the healthy eating message out; nutritional labelling on restaurant menus and processed foods; and saturated fats, trans fats, salt and sugar, particularly in processed foods. We also need a healthier food supply—particularly, obviously, for our Indigenous communities. I went to a Transplant Australia breakfast this morning addressing the impact of the food supply on Indigenous communities around Australia, and I commend them on that. The situation is absolutely tragic. We need to make healthier food more affordable and accessible for not just our Indigenous communities but all Australians. We need to build an environment that is not so obesogenic and that is friendly to walking, riding and other regular exercise. We can make a difference. In that regard, Greg Johnson, chair of the Australian Chronic Disease Prevention Alliance and Acting CEO of Diabetes Australia, wrote a very good letter to the editor which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald a few weeks ago. I commend him for that, although I would like to see the diabetes community be more proactive in their advocacy for people with diabetes around this country. There is still a lot more work to do.
There is action happening on the international front on non-communicable diseases. That is encouraging news. As we speak, a meeting is occurring in Beijing with representatives of the International Diabetes Federation. They are doing good work in advocating for UN support and a resolution to encourage all countries to say, ‘Yes, communicable and infectious diseases are important and we need to address them, but non-communicable and chronic diseases are a burden that need to be borne by all of us, a burden that we need to share.’ We need to address the epidemic all around the world. It is not just happening in Australia and the Western world; it is happening in India, China and many parts of the Third World. There will be a special conference in September 2011—and I hope that Australia and the Australian government will play its part—advocating for proactivity and action to promote healthy lifestyles all around the world.
We want this country to lead by example. I was saddened by the decision last Friday which confirmed that this government is in a policy paralysis. It confirmed that we are in limbo in terms of plans for the future for addressing chronic disease, whether it be diabetes, heart disease, cancer or any chronic other disease. Certainly the diabetes community thinks that this government is sitting on its hands and is in limbo. There will be a special policy forum this Thursday and Friday night in Canberra hosted by Diabetes Australia. I congratulate them for that; that is a good initiative. They need to do that more often—to advocate and develop policies that will promote disease prevention and healthy lifestyles all around Australia. I want to commend and thank Peter Dutton, Andrew Southcott and Andrew Laming in the House of Representatives, and Connie Fierravanti-Wells in the Senate, who are doing a great job to promote these important issues. On behalf of many in this great country of ours, I call on the government to rethink its priorities and to put action behind its words. It let the people of Australia down last Friday with that shocking, disgraceful decision to can a promised $450 million diabetes initiative. That will now not be delivered. We are all scratching our heads and wondering what we will get next from this government.
This bill has a lot of merit. It reflects what I called for in part of my 10-point plan released in December 2006. Interestingly, the first point of that plan was the recommendation to classify obesity as a national health priority. The government accepted that prior to the 2007 election, for which I am very thankful, but there is a lot more work to do in this space. I draw those points to the attention of the government and I hope that those matters will be addressed as a matter of urgency. I thank the Senate.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-11-16,"—I support the Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill 2010. I believe it is vital that we promote healthier lifestyles and address issues of obesity, substance abuse, tobacco use and the harmful drinking of alcohol. Australia is in the grip of an obesity epidemic. I should disclose that I could do with losing seven or eight kilos, and I am working on it.
According to the National Health Survey published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics more adult Australians were overweight or obese in 2007-08 compared to 1995, when the previous study was conducted. The survey found that 68 per cent of adult men and 50 per cent of adult women were overweight or obese. This shows a growing incidence over 12 years, as only 64 per cent of men and 49 per cent of women were overweight or obese in 1995. Of most concern, the survey found that there was a significant increase in the proportion of children who were obese, from 5.2 per cent in 1995 to 7.8 per cent in 2007-08.
Alcohol consumption in Australia is also at scarily high levels. The ABS says that one in eight adults, approximately two million people, drink at risky or high levels, and this has increased significantly since the 1990s. Fifteen per cent of adult males and 12 per cent of adult females drink at risky or high-risk levels; meanwhile, 25 per cent of 14- to 19-year-olds report drinking alcohol on a daily or weekly basis. We need to tackle alcohol abuse in Australia—it is as simple as that. Do not get me wrong—alcohol is a safe product if used safely, but we have to stop kidding ourselves that it is being uniformly used safely throughout our community.
There is also the whole issue of the effect of alcohol advertising. As I was driving down North East Road in suburban Adelaide not long ago, I saw a bus shelter with a big poster ad for alcohol. I cannot remember which brand—I think it was for whiskey or bourbon—but the slogan was, ‘Are you ready yet?’ I think many would find that to be an irresponsible form of alcohol advertising.
The rate of non-alcohol substance abuse in Australia is frightening, especially when we compare ourselves to a country such as Sweden, which has had a number of policies in place to reduce substance abuse by focusing on prevention, treatment and control. On the whole, those policies aim not to punish drug users but to offer help and rehabilitation.
It is interesting that, according to the 2009 UN World Drug Report, Australia’s consumption of opiates such as heroin is at 0.4 per cent of the population aged 15 to 64. While the percentage might sound low, this equates to around 90,000 Australians each year using heroin compared to a country such as Sweden in which 0.17 per cent of its population uses opiates each year. Almost 2½ million Australians use cannabis every year. That is 10.6 per cent of our entire population, so it is much higher amongst 15- to 64-year-olds. Again, compare this to Sweden, where just 2.1 per cent of its population uses cannabis. Finally, in Sweden it is estimated that 0.4 per cent of the population consumes amphetamines such as crystal meth each year compared with a staggering 2.7 per cent of Australia’s population—almost seven times more. For those who are aware of the effects of crystal meth, it is an evil drug that causes enormous harm in the community. It is a source of great violence and mental illness.
Sweden’s policies focus on prevention, treatment and control through mandatory rehabilitation. That seems to be an approach that is working and that ought to be looked at in debates here in Australia. We are not doing the right thing by those who are in the grip of an addiction and we need look at better ways to more effectively treat these destructive addictions.
There is also tobacco, perhaps the most insidious product foisted on an unsuspecting public.
—Hear, hear!
—I am looking forward to Senator Boyce’s contribution. There is no question now that tobacco has killed millions of people, and I have never met a smoker who on some level did not want to give it up if they had the right support. It pains me to see people I know and care about killing themselves one cigarette at a time because this unsafe product is so addictive. We have done a lot to help reduce smoking so far, but so much more needs to be done. We need to seriously look at these issues and come up with evidence based, effective recommendations to government about what can be done.
The role of this agency will be to support the Australian Health Ministers’ Conference and, through this conference, COAG to address the challenges associated with preventable health issues and with other chronic illnesses. The ANPHA will be a statutory body; therefore, I believe it is crucial that this body provide independent advice and that any recommendations made by this agency are taken seriously.
Australia does not need another layer of health bureaucracy without more information and better advocacy. That is why I support the intention behind establishing this agency but I do not support a bureaucracy without accountability not just to the government but, more broadly, to the people of Australia. That is why I will be moving an amendment to this bill, calling for the advice and recommendations made by the agency, to be published on its website on a timely basis. Six months was my initial view, but I understand that the Greens will look to amend this to 12 months, and I indicate that I am supportive of that amendment as long as it is on at least an annual basis.
I note that the government is concerned that the agency may feel constrained by such a requirement to publish its advice and recommendations and that the government may be hesitant in what it requests the agency to investigate. I believe that if agencies such as this are to be truly independent and if the recommendations are to be given the authority they deserve, then they need to be made public, and ministers and governments must not have the capacity to ignore or reject out of hand important research-based preventative health recommendations without providing their reasons for doing so. After all, are we not trying to achieve a healthier Australia?
The agency will also provide leadership on preventative health surveillance and data, promote standards and codes for preventative health, collate evidence of preventative health and report biannually. These are important tasks. The agency will also manage schemes rewarding preventative health strategies, provide grounds of financial assistance to health ministers, support cooperation and action leading to better preventative health, and promote behavioural change. Promoting behavioural change is very important in getting a good outcome. I support all of these goals and I look forward to the committee stage of this bill.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2010-11-16,"—Mr President, I seek leave to incorporate an answer to a question asked by Senator Johnston of me in my capacity representing Mr Smith, the Minister for Defence, yesterday. I have a response, which is in the form of a letter to Senator Johnston.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
Senator the Hon D Johnston
Shadow Minister for Defence
Parliament House
CANBERRA ACT 2600
Middle East Area of Operations (MEAO) Air Sustainment Services Contract
I refer to the questions you asked yesterday in the Senate of my colleague, Senator Evans, regarding the Middle East Area of Operations (MEAD) Air Sustainment Services contract.
The Department of Defence (Defence) entered into a contract with Adagold Aviation for MEAD Air Sustainment Services on 22 October 2010. This contract takes effect on 23 November 2010. The value is estimated to be $96m over the two year period of the contract.
Adagold Aviation was selected as the preferred tenderer based on a superior Value for Money assessment and its bid met all of the Commonwealth commercial, technical and airworthiness requirements. This includes meeting the requirements of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Defence for Regular Public Transport (RPT) operations.
As you know, this issue was raised by you in the most recent Senate Estimates hearings. The questions you asked at Estimates were answered at length. You have since placed other similar questions on notice which are in the process of being answered.
In the Senate yesterday, you raised specific issues in relation to the aircraft available to Adagold, namely the employment of Australians, whether or not the Portuguese charter operator, HiFly, has a regular Australian passenger operator licence, and the cost and purpose of the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (Deloitte) review. Each of these is addressed below on the basis of advice I have received today from Defence.
In relation to access to aircraft, the tenderers for the MEAD contract, which were selected from an existing Defence standing offer panel, comprised a mix of aircraft owner-operators, operators and broker companies. Adagold Aviation is a broker utilising the Portuguese based company, HiFly, as its air operator. The tender panel conducted a thorough risk assessment including investigation of the financial viability of Adagold and HiFly as well as assessments to confirm that both companies are ‘fit and proper’ entities. The tender panel confirmed that all the tenderers were able to deliver the services required.
In relation to the employment of Australians, under the terms of the contract, HiFly is required to provide Australian crew within six months of the contract commencement. I am advised it is not expected that there will be a significant loss of Australian based jobs in the transition from Strategic Aviation to Adagold. Tenders for provision of services to the Australian Government or the Department of Defence are determined on the basis of value to the taxpayers’ dollars, not just on the basis of local employment.
In relation to the question about a regular Australian operator passenger licence, it is not necessary for HiFly to have such a licence. It holds an equivalent certification to a Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) issued Air Operator’s Certificate (AOC). This certification is issued by the Portuguese aviation authorities. The certification gives the authority to conduct “scheduled and unscheduled services for both passengers and cargo”.
CASA has provided HiFly a foreign AOC which endorses the certification issued by the Portuguese authorities. Accordingly, HiFly is not required to obtain an Australian RPT certification. Regarding Adagold certifications, Defence has advised that no further certifications or licences beyond those obtained by HiFly, as the aircraft operator, are required.
This tender has been subject to extensive review by Defence. In response to concerns raised by Strategic Aviation (the then operator under the contract), the Defence Chief Audit Executive conducted an independent probity review of the tender process which was completed in August 2010. The Chief Audit Executive’s review concluded that the tender process was fair and complied with Commonwealth and Defence procurement policy. PricewaterhouseCoopers independently reviewed Defence’s probity review process and concluded that the review was carried out in a complete and impartial manner.
As you know, Defence subsequently engaged Deloitte and the Australian Government Solicitor to conduct additional independent assessments to address specific concerns raised by you regarding the financial viability of the preferred tenderer, Adagold Aviation (and its partner Hi Fly Aviation), and the overall selection process. The Terms of Reference were agreed with both the then Minister for Defence and with you during the caretaker period.
The Deloitte review took place over the period 2 to 10 September 2010 inclusive and the report was finalised and provided to Defence on 15 September 2010. You were fully briefed on this by Defence and Deloitte on 15 October 2010.
The final cost of the Deloitte review was $597,000. Deloitte was cognisant of Defence’s desire to complete their review as expeditiously as possible in order to avoid disruption to critical air sustainment services and to minimise the additional costs associated with an interim solution. In response to these concerns, Deloitte deployed a large team, which included a significant number of Partners and Directors, to undertake the review. Their fee represented virtually 1,000 direct man hours of effort and significant on-costs.
Deloitte were aware that their report would have an audience beyond Defence and therefore appreciated the need to very clearly differentiate between what they were requested to do in the Terms of Reference and what was out of their scope. Accordingly, the caveats attached to the review clarify that their work was not to duplicate work already done by the Defence Chief Audit Executive or the Australian Government Solicitor. These caveats in no way affected the completeness or thoroughness of their work as outlined in the Terms of Reference.
Defence’s view is that the expenditure on the reviews conducted by Defence, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte and the Australian Government Solicitor is justified considering the serious nature of the matters raised, the operational criticality of the contract, the cost of the contract and the extent of public comment and criticism (however unfounded) made about this tender.
The external reviews all supported the conclusions of the Chief Audit Executive’s probity review.
I am satisfied that Defence has taken appropriate action to review the concerns that have been raised in regard to the MEAD Air Sustainment Services Contract.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Defence Procurement</title>,Questions Without Notice: Additional Answers,4,1
"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2010-11-16,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations (Senator Evans) to a question without notice asked by Senator Fifield today, relating to the Gillard government.
I think you will recall that the Australian Labor Party fought like no other before the last election, during the last election and after the election to retain office. They did something unprecedented: they tore down—they decapitated—a first term Prime Minister. They fought a tough and tenacious election campaign, post-election, they hopped into bed with the Greens and they wooed and courted the Independents in the other place. You fight so hard, so long and so desperately to retain office for a reason. You do that because you have an agenda, you do that because you have a plan and you do that because there are things in Australia which you think desperately need attention and change.
And so during the campaign the nation assumed that there would be a major agenda on offer—perhaps a plan to reform the tax system? But, no. Perhaps a plan to tackle climate change? No. Perhaps even a plan to help take the pressure off interest rates? No. So we waited during the campaign for the grand plan and the grand agenda; they did not come. Perhaps, we thought, the Labor Party may at least have had a secret agenda which they were not sharing with the Australian people? And so we waited for the parliament to sit; we waited for the legislative agenda and we waited for the grand plan.
What was the reason that the Australian Labor Party sought the glittering prize of commanding the confidence of the House of Representatives? Why was it that the ALP sought a governing pact with the Greens in the Senate? What was the purpose? Again today, for the second time, Senator Evans confirmed the reason for seeking the glittering prize of commanding a majority and the confidence of the House of Representatives. The reason was to introduce legislation to wind back voluntary student unionism. That is what it was all about. That was the only policy, the only plan and the only agenda that Senator Evans, desperately grasping in question time, could lay his hands upon.
That is pathetic. That is an indictment on the Australian Labor Party. This government has no reason for existing. It has no agenda. This government is like that great Peter Sellers movie, the title of which was Being There. That is what it is about for this government: it is just about being there. Senator Evans is a bit like Chauncey Gardiner, the hero of the movie. Chauncey Gardiner liked to watch; he did not do much he just liked to watch. And that is what this government does; that is what Senator Evans does and that is what the Prime Minister does—they just sit back and watch.
We know this government has no agenda. It was confirmed yesterday when the government ran out of legislation and they sought the assistance of minor parties and of the opposition to bring in legislation, which had not been flagged, immediately from the House of Representatives.
We have been incredibly cooperative as an opposition.

Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—

—We have. In the week during the Afghanistan debate we facilitated a range of non-controversial legislation outside of that time. We have been extremely cooperative.
Despite that, this government is still running out of legislation. And despite the fact that the Senate has had its time taken up and the House has had its time taken up with the debate on Afghanistan and the address-in-reply, this government is still running out of legislation. No doubt as we approach the final week of the parliament, according to the government it will be this side of the chamber’s fault when there is a bit of a logjam. But the fact is there is nothing of substance that this government has introduced. They have no plan, they stand condemned and they have no reason for being.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Gillard Government</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,5,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",ALP,2010-11-16,"—What we have now heard is not only misinformation but also an outrageous hypocritical contribution in relation to how this place is managed from those opposite, who seek to upend the program and who seek to try to manage the program from afar without an understanding of how the program actually works—without even an understanding of how the Senate actually operates.
It operates most efficiently and effectively by cooperation between all the parties in here. What I have not heard from the opposition is an undertaking or a guarantee—and they have got the opportunity to give it with the remaining speakers—that we will get through the program that has been outlined. Of course it is misinformation provided by those opposite to say that they did not have a clear picture of what the program for this week was about. It was provided to all parties in the week leading up to this week. That program sets out what we expect to get through in the Senate this week.
I ask the opposition to consider providing that guarantee that we will finalise those pieces of legislation on that list this week. What is disappointing to see is that cheap politics are being played by those opposite with the legislative program, probably because they have nothing else to talk about other than the processor itself—which is disappointing in itself. But the management of the program within the Senate is a serious matter that all parties have agreed to and continue to agree to, except when it does not suit those opposite.
We also have an outrageous position being adopted by the opposition in relation to the program. It is one where it does not want to finalise the address-in-reply—that is an interesting position. We do need to finalise the address-in-reply within this fortnight so that we can provide it to the Governor-General in February when we come back. That is a matter that always happened during this period. If you are blind to that then you have not been following the program particularly well over the last couple of years. Perhaps Senator Evans’s comments about your inability to stay awake in this place are apt.
We do have a range of other matters that we then need to deal with as part of the legislative program. To ignore that we need to have these debates around a whole raft of things, including legislation, committees and the address-in-reply, is to ignore how the program works in the Senate. It is completely baseless to try to fashion an argument that this government is not managing its program well. In addition to that, many of the bills have also been referred—by agreement and not opposed by this government—off to Senate inquiries to be dealt with by Senate committees so that time spent in this parliament in committee stage and also in dealing with second readings will be reduced to assist those making those contributions.
Of course, many of those inquiries are being pushed back because of the number that have been sent. Be that as it may, the reporting dates on that available legislation will fall in the second week that we are here in parliament. I also want the opposition to commit to finalising those bills that the government needs before we go to the end-of-year break. If you are going to complain about the lack of legislation available then I assume you will also agree to additional hours when we require time to finalise the program. I assume that you will also agree to ensuring that we can facilitate debate to ensure we can complete the legislative program as outlined and given you to a week earlier. In addition, I assume that in the second week you will also cooperate in ensuring that we can finalise that legislative program.
It would be stunning to me if you did that, because you have not been doing that in the last three years that we have been in this place and you have been in opposition. This is not only an act of all of those who sit opposite; they are the acts of both the manager and the previous manager, who have not ensured that they provide additional hours of work. They have not ensured additional provision of time to provide for the legislative program to be dealt with in this place. Why? It is because they do not want to be here. That is the only conclusion that I can come to: they do not want to contribute to debate in this place. (Time expired)

"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2010-11-16,"—I almost feel sorry for the Manager of Government Business, Senator Ludwig, when he has to come here and defend this government’s management of the legislative program—that is, until he starts talking about the opposition. I think it was in the last session, in the days when the government was knifing the then Prime Minister, the member for Griffith, that this opposition facilitated the transaction of nearly two dozen pieces of legislation in almost a single Senate sitting day.
The mismanagement of this chamber falls squarely at the feet of this government. You cannot bring in reams of legislation in the last fortnight and expect them to be given due scrutiny. It may be easy to manage members on the other side, but on this side individual senators take their responsibility seriously. What we are truthfully seeing here, despite the rather half-hearted defence of the government by Senator Ludwig, is that this government has simply no agenda.
The only thing that holds this government together is the pursuit of power. Since being returned several weeks ago in what had to be the most humiliating and embarrassing judgment on a first-term government in seven decades, they have drifted from disaster to broken promise to backflip, and a lack of a legislative program indicates this. The contrived empathy that so encapsulated the former Prime Minister has now been replaced by the new Prime Minister with obfuscation and euphemism. The strict promise hours before polling day that there would be no carbon tax has been replaced by the euphemism of a so-called price on carbon, as if when the government collects a revenue from the consumer that it is somehow not a tax. Hours before polling day that promise was made, and hours after taking office the Prime Minister broke that promise and tried to justify it with an Orwellian euphemism.
The broken promises and backflips of the Labor Party cannot hide the fact that the Labor Party is nothing more than a decoy for the pursuit of power. There is no agenda; there is only a commitment to process absent of an outcome. The process itself has become important to this government in order to create the illusion of activity and the illusion of substance. We saw this today, when the Leader of the Government in this place said that the repeal of voluntary student unionism legislation was somehow meant to be taken as a sign of this government’s legislative agenda. Well, if that is your agenda for Australia then I am looking forward to the next election in this place.
The process has become an end in itself for the Labor Party. They simply aim to fill the pages of a newspaper and confect a sense of empathy with the Australian people. They constantly say, ‘We feel your pain,’ but they never actually want to commit to doing anything about it. We saw Fuelwatch, we saw GroceryWatch and we saw the illusion of health reform, but we did not see commitments that could actually be measured. Did any of them impact on fuel prices? No. Did any of them impact on grocery prices? No. They were contrived, confected and simply political stunts. The Prime Minister tries to create the illusion of substance. She makes speeches about reform as if uttering the word alone is enough to justify one’s existence in office. She calls upon the ghosts of Hawke and Keating for strength, but the comparison illustrates that she is really the successor to Rees, Keneally and Bligh—not only in the way in which she took office but also in that her only reason to be in office is to stay there.
The Prime Minister may like to talk about the Hawke and Keating governments and, in comparing this Labor Party to those, so do we. The Hawke and Keating governments, with the support of the opposition, undertook a reform program. They had an agenda. They actually undertook some tax reform, although they baulked at the end of indirect tax and left that for the coalition government and then opposed it. They reformed the Australian economy with the support of the opposition, yet the only things this government can commit to are to somehow increase the size of government and to impose a new tax without any consideration of reducing taxes on consumers in other ways.
You will remember, Mr Deputy President, as you were here, that when the coalition government put up its tax reform agenda there was a tax trade-off. When the previous Labor government, under Prime Minister Hawke, introduced superannuation, there was a wage-tax trade-off. This is the first government in decades in this country that has proposed new taxes to fill its deficit without any consideration of the burden that places on people or business and without any proposal to reduce the taxes people otherwise pay. People do not often speak of legislative programs; they are not always the first thing on people’s minds. But if they want to look at how empty this government’s soul is then they need to look at the fact that there is no serious legislation; there are only broken promises and the only thing the Leader of the Government in this place could say was that he wanted to make students pay compulsory union fees again.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Gillard Government</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,5,1
"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2010-11-16,"—What remarkable contributions from those opposite. I have been in this place serving the Tasmanian community for five years now and it is a great privilege to do that. But to come in here today and to stand up and talk about a legislative program of the nature that the opposition were trying to assert quite frankly does them no favours at all because this is no different to any other time of the year. I want to reiterate, as the minister did in his comments, that on every occasion when we have tried to increase the amount of sitting time or to extend the sitting time those opposite are the first ones out the door.
If we want to talk about the legislation that is on the program for this week it includes the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 4) Bill. The Higher Education Support Amendment Bill, if I recall, was debated last night. There is the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Connecting People with Jobs) Bill. We also have the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Bill and the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill. I think the contributions that senators make in relation to the address-in-reply to the Governor-General’s speech are significant. It was a very important speech that was delivered in this place outlining the program that this government has. Obviously, it really narks those opposite because they cannot come to terms with the fact that the Australian community rejected them. Why did they reject them? It was because they had no plan.
—You got a great majority.
—We had the minister in question time today talking about the National Broadband Network. Senator Abetz, I will take your interjection because you know very well that the leader of the opposition in Tasmania, Mr Will Hodgman, supports the National Broadband Network—I know you do not always get on with him but he did get something right in recent years. Even your good, very close colleague Senator Barnett has come out publicly and said that the National Broadband Network was a contributing factor as to why the Liberals did so very poorly in Tasmania in all five electorates. In your own area in southern Tasmania you should hang your head in shame as to how poorly the Liberals did in Denison.
If we want to talk about our program, let us talk about the economy and let us talk about jobs. Let us talk about the opposition’s record on those in the way you voted and opposed every stimulus package in this place. The Australian community saw through that. They appreciate the fact that this government stood up to ensure that Australian families had jobs and that there was job security. We have things already in place that we have already built on since 2007, one of which is the way we have looked after Australian pensioners. We have given them a pension increase. We have actually delivered tax cuts. We have done more to encourage and support small business than those opposite. When you talk about the government not having any agenda for climate change, I think that is just hilarious. Those sceptics opposite are talking about the government not having a program. Those on this side of the chamber at least are prepared to put the facts on the record in terms of what we are doing.
The most important thing that the Australian people want is a strong economy. They need to know that their representatives are listening to them. We are delivering on the economy. We have done better than any other developed country in the way that we have been able to come out of the global financial crisis. With respect to having no agenda it is us on this side that are ensuring that Australian taxpayers get value for their investment in what the mining tax will deliver. There is also the National Broadband Network and what that will do for health, education, productivity, tourism and small businesses. There are also the jobs that will create. The list goes on and on.
There is what we are doing for education. It was this government that actually invested in infrastructure—the Building the Education Revolution. There are a lot of Liberals turning up at all these school openings. They are the ones who want to have their photos in the school newsletters because they know, as the Tasmanian community knows only too well, particularly in the building industry, what that investment has done.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2010-11-16,"—I am delighted to contribute to this debate. It was only in June of this year that the Labor Party advised us that they had lost their way and on that occasion had to get rid of their Prime Minister. At least on that occasion they had a way. The simple fact of the matter is that this current Labor government does not know the way. It has no way; it has no direction. Anybody who succeeds in business knows very well that to actually establish and run that business, as indeed government, you need a vision. You need to know what the perfect world is for the people in that country or the business. You need to have a mission that will get you there. You need to have objectives and, heaven forbid, you actually need targets upon which the community can measure you.
This Gillard Labor government can best be described as an LFG—a legislation-free zone. For those who come into this place and wonder what legislation is, it is designed to give effect to the vision and mission of the government—if only they had one. Legislation is the foundation or the building block upon which the edifice will be constructed. It is in anatomical terms the skeleton around which the body will be formed. If you have legislation, if you have a vision and a mission, if you have objectives and if you have those foundations and skeletons, then you can develop the regulations, the policies, the procedures, the practices and the directives to the civil servants and others that will complete that dynamic entity which we would normally expect to be a successful country. Regrettably, this particular government has none of those.
This government has not participated, for example, in a process of consultation and dialogue. Have we not seen evidence of that around Australia with the failed border protection policies and the failure to consult with communities? It has no structure. This government is moulding nothing to give to the people of Australia on which historians will be able to look back and say, ‘The Gillard government stood for something.’
It was towards the end of the financial year last year and again this year that I recall our whip and those on this side managing the business of the Senate going to the government managers and saying, ‘There is legislation that you’ve got to get passed by 30 June because it has effect in the new financial year.’ So for the government to stand here and say that we have in some way obstructed the management of this place is a joke. I know in June this year they did have other priorities on their minds: getting rid of someone who at least had a way, even if he had lost it. The simple fact of the matter is that this is a formless government. It is an amoeba. It is without spine or structure. It is ground feeding instead of reaching for the stars as we would expect. It is no wonder that this government in fact was not elected.
If I think of the concepts of vision and mission and business planning, there is no better illustration of the failure of this government than the NBN. In my own speech on the NBN last year, I tried to impress on Senator Conroy that the starting point of any venture, let alone the biggest in Australia’s history at $43,000 million, is a business plan, and within that business plan you would create the vision and mission—and, amongst other things, you would have a cost-benefit analysis. Senator Conroy, in his usual way, stood there and derided us. Here we are, 12 months later, and there still has been no business plan released. And, if in fact there is no cost-benefit analysis within that business plan, it speaks simply to the incompetence and arrogance of the government.
Even in Senator Conroy’s own answer today to Senator Birmingham, taking two minutes with all of the interjections, all the points of order and with his ministerial colleagues around him, he still could not answer the question. When he actually mentioned it, in the final seconds before his time expired, the figure was $437 million of infrastructure at 30 June; in fact, the figure is $453 million. If he had spent more time actually addressing himself to the issue and if this government spent some time addressing itself to legislation, we would not find the amoeba like condition and performance of the Gillard government.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2010-11-16,"—I seek leave to amend general business motion No. 84 standing in my name relating to the production of a Productivity Commission report on the selection of default superannuation funds and the modern awards by omitting 30 April 2011 in paragraph (c) and substituting 31 May 2011.
Leave granted.
—I move the motion as amended:
That the Senate—
notes that:
the current process to select default superannuation funds under modern awards is not transparent, not objective or evidence based, not competitive and not subject to systematic review,
the top ten most commonly listed default funds under modern awards are all union based industry super funds, with these ten funds listed as default super funds in modern awards 330 times,
the Cooper Review into superannuation also confirmed that current default superannuation fund arrangements undermined competition as new employees typically become a member of a default fund, and
a competitive, transparent and efficient superannuation industry is critically important to maximise value for all superannuants;
endorses the Labor Party’s commitment before the 2010 election to instruct the Productivity Commission to design a process for the selection and ongoing review of the superannuation funds to be included in modern awards or enterprise agreements as default funds; and
orders that there be laid on the table, no later than 31 May 2011, a report by the Productivity Commission on the design of a process for the selection and ongoing review of the superannuation funds to be included in modern awards or enterprise agreements as default funds, with the requirements that:
the process is to be based on objective criteria and evidence and be subject to systematic review, so that the selection and ongoing review of eligible default funds is transparent and competitive,
the process is to help maximise employees’ retirement incomes by ensuring that only those superannuation funds that deliver – and continue to deliver – the best results to their members are able to be included as default fund options in modern awards and enterprise agreements, and
in designing the process the Productivity Commission make reference to the existing sophisticated system of superannuation fund ratings which has evolved over the past 20 years and is already used widely by employees, employers and financial planners in making decisions on fund selection.",SENATE,<title>PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION REPORT</title>,<title>Order</title>,Motions,11,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2010-11-16,"—by leave—I see that Senator Cormann has amended the motion to add one month. I am advised that, given that the Productivity Commissioner’s existing workload, it is not possible for them to complete the new report. I have got 30 April 2011, but I am sure that an additional one month would make very little difference to that position, and it would likewise be the case for the end of May 2011.",SENATE,<title>PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION REPORT</title>,<title>Order</title>,Motions,11,1
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2010-11-16,"—by leave—It has been pre-election policy from the Labor Party to ensure that there is a competitive, objective, transparent process to select the default superannuation funds under modern awards. For the last two years, default superannuation funds under modern awards have been identified by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, first, and then Fair Work Australia, without following an objective, transparent, competitive process. The result is that there is a closed shop, anticompetitive arrangement which is not in the best interest of employees and superannuants across Australia. It is not giving them the best possible value in terms of their retirement incomes.
It is absolutely time to act. The opposition advised the government two years ago that this would be a problem, and it has become a problem. There is a closed shop, a captive market, which this government is protecting especially for union superannuation funds. Minister Shorten is very reluctant to act on this pre-election commitment of the Labor Party. He wants to protect for as long as possible the closed shop, anticompetitive arrangement that currently exists. That is why he does not want to act on this Labor Party pre-election commitment until 30 June 2013.
Mr Deputy President Ferguson, it is very important that this process gets underway as quickly as possible. It is very important for the Productivity Commission to do this work. Much of this information is already available through the superannuation ratings agencies like Morningstar, Chant West and Standard & Poor’s. This is a comparatively easy piece of work to do. It is important for the minister to start acting in the public interest on these sorts of issues rather than letting his union bias get in the way.

Leave not granted.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,16,1
"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2010-11-16,"—This is without doubt one of the saddest days I have seen in this place since I came here. We have just witnessed the Labor Party, the Greens and the Independent Nick Xenophon refuse to debate the bill that would have given fairness and equity to regional students, and I think everybody living in a regional area across this country right now would be unbelievably disappointed, shattered and completely at a loss as to what this government is doing when it comes to regional Australia. What on earth did we just see? We had nothing except an hour set aside to debate this bill, utilising time that was already allocated for the coalition. All of the rubbish that Senator Bob Brown went on with about queue jumping so that he would not be able to debate whaling was complete rubbish. We were not queue jumping one little bit. We were using our own time for debate in this place, which would have been entirely appropriate. I also have to say, colleagues, that for Sarah Hanson-Young to sit here and refuse to debate a bill that is going to provide fairness and equity for regional students is nothing short of appalling. As for the Independent Nick Xenophon from South Australia, I would say to all of those people in Mount Gambier and everywhere else across South Australia who are listening and who have contacted me, saying, ‘I want changes made because this is not fair,’—you let him know in no uncertain terms what you think about what he just did. Not only did he not support those people who wanted changes; he would not even let it be debated. And that is on his own head, and on those of Sarah Hanson-Young and the rest of the Greens.
What are we doing in this place if we are not going to provide fairness and equity for young people across the country? The fact that the government did not support it does not surprise me at all, because they simply do not understand regional Australia. They have not got a clue. The bill and the motion that were before this Senate, while it might have been my private senators’ bill, reflected coalition policy and we were absolutely as one on the importance of this to rural and regional students. I acknowledge the member for Sturt, Christopher Pyne; Senator Brett Mason; the member for Forrest, Nola Marino; the member for Gippsland, Darren Chester; and every single one of my other colleagues, including my good colleague here Senator Julian McGauran and every single other one of my other colleagues who have fought for these changes to come about for regional students. My good colleague sitting in front, Senator Barnaby Joyce, put it brilliantly with his words earlier. What we are about is trying to get fairness and equity for regional students, and what this government have done is divided regional Australia into four zones. They have divided it into inner regional, regional, remote and very remote. For those last three groups, students living in those areas can use a gap year. They can take 12 months and earn the under $19½ thousand to qualify for the independent youth allowance which they so desperately need.
What did this government do? It said, ‘All of you thousands of students living in inner regional areas: you can’t do that. You can’t use that gap year. You can’t get that financial assistance you so desperately need to go on to university or to further tertiary education.’ Why not, government? The answer in Senate estimates was that they simply do not want to spend the money. That is not good enough. For all of those thousands of regional students out there who simply have no choice whatsoever but to relocate, to leave home, to attend university, that is just simply appalling. To leave them completely out in the cold, to not support them, when what we should be doing—

Senator Hanson-Young interjecting—

—Senator Hanson-Young said, ‘Make it easier for regional students to get to university, not harder.’ That was interesting. If you actually go back and read Sarah Hanson-Young’s speech, everything she said leads to: ‘Gosh! That would have meant supporting Senator Nash’s bill.’ But, oh no, we have this diatribe about the bigger picture. This is about addressing the current issue of unfairness for regional students. Why should one regional student be treated differently from another? I agree with Senator Hanson-Young; there is much bigger picture here. We need to delve more deeply into the issues facing regional students. But this issue can be dealt with separately and Senator Hanson-Young knows that.
The reason we know it is that she was continually telling people throughout the course of the last year how much she fought for regional students. Let me tell you what Senator Hanson-Young said on 12 August this year during the election campaign. She said:
“We know many students in regional areas have missed out on access to the full rate of Youth Allowance under the new scheme,’’ Senator Hanson-Young said.
                …            …            …
… our policy would use a simple test—if students have to travel more than 90 minutes each way to access their course, and have to move out of home to do so, they will be eligible for the full rate of Youth Allowance.
I would say to Senator Hanson-Young, ‘Why did you not just support my bill, which would have done exactly that?’ Because it would have done exactly that—provide fairness and equity for regional students across the country.
What is extraordinary is watching this government mouth words about how they support regional Australia. Indeed, we had the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, when she had her new government underway saying:
Clearly, the new Parliament will also have a focus on the needs of regional Australia.
And:
I will work tirelessly to do what we said we would do ... to deliver for regional Australia, recognising that in our nation that one size does not fit all; to redeem the hope you have placed in me and Labor; and to be faithful to the trust that has been extended to us.
If this government were at all serious about delivering for regional Australia, they would be making sure that every single regional student who lived in Australia had fair access to independent youth allowance and not cutting out thousands of them simply because they do not want to spend the money. I do have to say that it has been costed at around $90 million a year. Apparently, the government does not want to spend that, as they said in Senate estimates, but they are prepared to spend—get this—$81.9 million on employees to administer the ETS that never happened. They are very happy to spend nearly $90 million on some employees that actually did absolutely nothing, but they are not prepared to find a way to fund regional students. That is not fair, it is not right and it is not on. I have to say that Senator Xenophon has not even allowed debate on this when in the past he has said:
The issue of assistance for regional students is one of the utmost importance to me.
And:
To me the key issue here is ensuring that we have a greater degree of equity and access to territory education for our regional students.
If Senator Xenophon actually believed in what he said—if there were any truth in those words—he would have supported the bill going forward for debate and he would have supported the bill as it came to debate. I cannot believe the unfairness that has been placed on students living out in regional areas. It is simply not fair. They understand what this means to them. They understand that they are being left out and they understand that the words of Senator Hanson-Young and the Greens, the words of the Independent Nick Xenophon and the words of the Labor government under Julia Gillard mean absolutely nothing. I want to read for you an email which was sent to, I believe, all of those other senators in the chamber that I have just mentioned and which sums it up completely. This constituent said:
I have heard that you may not be voting in support of Fiona Nash’s bill on making independent youth allowance available to ‘inner regional zone’ youth under the same criteria as other regional youth.
I am shocked and surprised, as I thought you were a progressive senator on the issue of education for youth.
My son is 19 and working his guts out at Big W doing a gap year and desperate to go to Uni next year in Brisbane. We live in Ballina, New South Wales, in an area designated as ‘inner regional’. It is a 3 hour drive to Brisbane on a good day. He will have to move and live in Brisbane to study. This is beyond our family’s ability to afford to support him—have you seen the costs of staying in cities like Brisbane? We are a ‘middle income’ family with 4 kids and a mortgage on a small house. We pay tax—hell, our son Rob pays tax in his Big W job—why should we be arbitrarily cut off from youth allowance?
This is profoundly and ridiculously unfair. I urge you—I beg you—on behalf on my boy and all the other good young men and women like him, to get and Senator Nash and support these changes.
That is one of hundreds of thousands of emails like it from people who know that their children are being treated unfairly. We had the opportunity today to fix this and the Labor government, the Independents and the Greens should hang their heads in shame because they chose not to and they chose to let the current situation go on. It is simply not fair and I will not stop fighting every single day in this chamber for as long as I am here to get this fixed and to get fairness for regional students.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Youth Allowance</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2010-11-16,"—I actually quite like Senator Nash. I think she is a very dedicated hardworking senator, but on this issue she is actually dead wrong and she has seriously gilded the lily in many aspects of this independent youth allowance issue. It was part of a sweep of reforms that the government made to this whole system occurring out of the Bradley review. It was a contentious issue. It was the subject of a public campaign, which I think the Nationals promoted to their political advantage very well. It has been the subject of a comprehensive Senate inquiry, which looked at it and which resulted in intense negotiations between the Liberal spokesperson for education at the time and the Labor Party. Last March in the build up to an election an agreement was reached to overcome these issues. An agreed bill was put before the parliament and voted for.
Of course, at that time it was during the build up to an election and the Liberal-National coalition had an eye to victory and thought that they may well win this particular election, so they were probably very conscious of the costs of what Senator Nash is now proposing—some $300 million. They already suspected that they were going to have an $11 billion black hole with the promises they were making in the build up to the election and they certainly did not want to add another $300 million to it because they thought they were going to be in government and they were not going to want to spend the money.
But now, back in the luxury of opposition, why not come back and have a second bite of the cherry? ‘Now, when we don’t have to be responsible, when we don’t have to worry about our $11 billion black hole, when we don’t have to worry about where we are going to get the $300 million from, let’s go back and welsh on the deal. Let’s rat on the deal.’ This is the deal they happily agreed to and voted for last March. ‘Let’s rat on that. Let’s come back and ask for more. Doesn’t matter if it costs another $300 million, because we’re in opposition now. It doesn’t matter. The $11 billion shortfall in funding our promises doesn’t matter, an extra $300 million doesn’t matter, because the government will have to find it.’
We have done a lot in the education system, and the reforms that we have put in place will make it fairer and more equitable for all students across the country. Those reforms were well overdue, and I think that, in saner moments, you will even find some in the opposition who are aware of some of the rorts that were going on in the independent youth allowance system and who will actually acknowledge some of those rorts. They were undesirable.
—There were some rorts.
—Thank you, Senator Mason, for acknowledging that. The government instituted the Bradley review and we have instigated significant reforms in this sector to make it fairer. We have also put in an enormous increase in funding.
I remember when I came into this place as a senator in 2002 I was shocked that in the so-called clever country there could be degrees that cost $100,000. It made a mockery of our merit based system and led to our top universities chasing dollars by charging as much as they thought they could get away with, in a system where they were encouraged to do this by the conservative, Howard government of the time. We have put an end to that. Over their 11 years, the Howard government undermined the higher education sector. In their first budget, in 1996, they slashed university operating grants by a cumulative six per cent over the forward estimates from 1997 to 2000, resulting in an $850 million cut to the sector. When we came to office, the participation of rural, regional and low-SES students in higher education had fallen and showed no signs of improvement. Who was in government at the time? The Nationals, in a coalition with the Liberals. Did we hear about this sort of thing from the Nationals then? No—not a squeak while they were in government undermining higher education and making it more expensive for regional students. That is what they were doing.
Youth allowance arrangements were poorly targeted, and assistance was not going to those students most in need, as was found by the Bradley review of education. The student-staff ratio was 20.4, compared with 14.6 in 1995, just as the Howard government came to office. That is the damage they did in their 11 years. The average amount of Commonwealth funding per student in real terms declined by nearly $1,500, and fees and charges had increased by over $3,000. That is the record of the coalition government in the Howard years. HECS had increased dramatically, by tens of thousands of dollars for most students.
The wording of this MPI criticises the Labor government for its treatment of students in regional Australia, so I take it that the Nationals are criticising this government for introducing comprehensive reforms to ensure that more university students have fairer access to student income support, benefiting students from low-socioeconomic backgrounds and students who move away from home to study, particularly those from rural and regional areas. More students—that is what we are doing with our reforms: more students will have access.
—Not enough.
—Senator Scullion says, ‘Not enough.’ I have just gone through your appalling record when you were in government. We are actually improving the system now and you say it is not enough. Well, why didn’t you do something in government? You would not do it in the lead-up to the election because it was going to cost you $300 million. Now, from the safety of opposition, it is, ‘Doesn’t matter what it is; doesn’t matter what it costs. Let’s just do it.’ It is so irresponsible and it is why you will be over on that side for a long, long time.
I also take it that the Nationals are criticising us for fixing the previous student support regime, which saw the participation of young people from low-SES backgrounds, including those from regional and rural communities, languish at around 15 per cent, against the population share of 25 per cent. Is that what you are criticising us for? Are you criticising us for properly targeting assistance to those who need it, for changing the previous youth allowance arrangements so that assistance is going to those students most in need? That is what the reforms do.
We are reforming youth allowance, including the creation of new scholarship payments, lowering the age of independence, an increased threshold for the parental income test and a tighter workforce participation test to target students who are genuinely in need of assistance. They are all good reforms. I do not hear anyone criticising them. Is that what the Nationals are actually criticising us for doing? Are you criticising us for directly benefiting over 100,000 students on student support, including students from inner regional areas, as more young people will be eligible for youth allowance as dependants? Most people who previously had to prove independence will now be able to access support automatically. The proportion of students from regional, rural and remote areas receiving student income support has increased under the new arrangements. Regional and rural students have had their support increased under these reforms—increased—all because we got rid of the rorts.
—You don’t have a clue what you’re talking about. Sit down; you’re embarrassing yourself.
—Senator Nash says I have got to sit down, because the one thing they do not like to hear over there are the facts being presented to them. From a holistic look at the reforms, they know they are actually good for rural and regional students. They do not want to hear that. They focus on a single issue and say, ‘Oh, we don’t like the look of that. Some people are going to miss out or they’re not going to be able to do it the way they did it before, so we’ll ignore the fact that these reforms vastly increase access for rural and regional students.’
I also take it that the Nationals are criticising us for making available a $20 million Rural Tertiary Hardship Fund to young people from rural and regional areas who need financial help to get a university education.
—No, you’re not. You just set up a task force that’s supposed to start in January.
—Senator Nash criticises that. Well, why don’t you, in your bill, take away that $20 million?
—It’s hilarious! Nice try.
—No, you are not criticising us for that—again, something you never did, something you never thought of, but we have actually put in place. I take it you are also criticising us for committing to lifting caps on undergraduate university places for domestic students, at an estimated additional cost of $2.1 billion. Are you criticising us for adopting a new indexation approach which will mean that universities will have an additional $2.6 billion over five years from 2011 to provide top-quality education? Is that what they are criticising us for?
Are you criticising us for making substantial investments in higher education infrastructure? Already, more than $4.1 billion has been committed from the Education Investment Fund for strategic infrastructure in the tertiary education sector. Are you criticising us for making—
—But, Gavin, we paid for that. That was our savings, not yours—
—Now Senator Mason says that was their policy! This motion criticises us. Are you criticising us for making up to $550 million in higher education additional performance funding available to universities, increasing participation, including the enrolment of more students of low-socioeconomic status, as well as increasing the quality of the student experience and learning outcomes?

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2010-11-16,"—I rise to participate in this discussion on this matter of public importance, because it is an important discussion, about how we move forward in offering students the support that they desperately need. Only 12 months ago we were right here in this exact same place discussing and debating this issue. It was 12 months ago that the Senate was deliberating the changes that were being put forward by the government, some of which were really good and some of which needed to happen. Other changes undercut and undermined the ability of students particularly from rural and regional areas to access the support they need to go to university. There was lots of toing and froing. We had country students coming to parliament and speaking with their parliamentarians. We had Julia Gillard acknowledging that you could not pull the rug out from underneath current gap-year students and that it was a mistake. We finally had an agreement that accepted that scholarships not just for those students from rural and regional areas but for a whole range of students that were eligible for youth allowance were needed to start the university year.
The debate dragged on right up until March this year. In March we saw a deal cut between the Labor government and the coalition to put in place the system that we are debating today. There are now lines on a map, which unfortunately means that no longer are there two classes of students who can get access to youth allowance to put themselves through university but there are now three categories: those who are in outer or inner regional areas, those who are not able to apply through either of those areas and those who are in the city.
Really what we need to be doing is acknowledging that youth allowance is there to support our young people to go to university to get the qualifications and skills they need to then go into the workforce and contribute to the productivity of our nation. It is not meant to be a 12-month, three-year or election-cycle vision. This is meant to be about a vision for investing in the future productivity of our country. There is not going to be a quick fix to deal with this. We need to be realistic. If we want to invest in the productivity of our country, then we need to invest in our young people and that means true investment. That means not thinking that a patch-up piece of legislation is simply going to deliver what is needed. It does not mean constant backflipping either from government or from opposition—if those parties have changed sides in the interim. It means an actual vision for investing in the education of our young people, not for the next three years but for the future.
We know that young people who have to move from home in order to go to university overwhelmingly come from country areas. They have to move. They do not have a university in the next suburb, the next couple of suburbs or a few tram stops away. They have to move out of home in order to go to university. Often, in order to get the support that they need, they are forced to try to squeeze into the criteria that are set down by youth allowance. That means we are forcing young people to defer their studies, despite the fact that they have worked really hard in year 12 to get into the course of their dreams. To get that spot at university they have to defer it. They go off and they work, and they have to prove that they are worthy of that support. That is what country students are doing daily. That is what the old system was and that is what the current system is for some of them.
Simply revisiting and reinstating the old rules does not deal with the inequities faced by students from country and regional areas. We know that, out of the students who defer their studies, 30 per cent will never go back. That is quite a big chunk of students who have fought really hard, got into university and then deferred that spot. Thirty per cent of those students will never go back. A young woman who worked so hard to get into teaching, into nursing, into engineering or into a field that was desperately needed in her local country community could not get the support to get to university and so deferred her studies as a way to try and get through the criteria. Thirty per cent of students in her cohort will never go on to study at university. We cannot afford to let that happen. Students who need to be supported should be supported.
We need a new criterion that says that, if you have to move out of home in order to go to university—Senator Nash read out the exact quote that I had used and I stand by it—because there is no university in your country town, you should be recognised as being independent and you should get support. That is what the government should be looking at rather than fiddling at the edges trying to make a system that clearly is not working—it was not working in the past and it is not working now—and rather than trying to come up with some convoluted solution that is just patchwork over patchwork, bandaid solution over bandaid solution. The simplest solution would be to have one criterion: if you have to move out of home in order to go to university and you have to travel that far then you should get the support you need. That would be the simplest solution. The government should cost that. The Greens have asked Treasury to cost that proposal, and I look forward to the government’s response to that.
I think it is good that Senator Nash has brought this on, because we have to have a discussion about the current inequities in the system. The minister has committed to examining whether the current Australian standard geographical classification, the lines on the map that are currently drawn, is appropriate. I say they are not appropriate. No lines on a map, in that sense, are going to be appropriate. We should not be forcing people to defer their studies, making them jump through hoops and over hurdles simply to get the support they need to go to university. City students do not have to do that. City students do not have to defer their studies, put their entire academic career at risk and be part of the higher statistics for students who will never go on to study, will never finish their degree because they do not get support. City students do not have to face that. Why should we settle for less for those country kids, who are ultimately going to be the best people to bring those skills back to their communities? Let us encourage and support our young people from country and rural areas to go to university. If they have got that spot, let us support them in doing it. Let us not put their families through the stress of having to defer studies and then not go to university simply because the government does not acknowledge that this is a problem.
Of course it is going to cost money, and the government is going to need to consider that. That is why the Greens have submitted their proposal to Treasury to look at that. I encourage the government and I look forward to the government’s response on that. But simply putting in place a bandaid solution for the issue that is not going to be dealt with is not a solution. We should not be forcing students to defer their studies just to get the support they need. City kids do not have to deal with that. If the National Party honestly believed that country students are no less important than city students, they would not continue to put a bar above them that their city cousins do not have. If the Nationals honestly support the idea that country students should have equal access to education, they should stop putting barriers in front of them and let us move forward to putting them on an equal footing.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Youth Allowance</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2010-11-16,"—I will just briefly touch on some of the procedural aspects that were touched on earlier this afternoon.
—You were mugged!
—That is right. There was a deal—that is quite right. The deal was to overcome a legislative impasse between the government in the House of Representatives and the coalition and, indeed, the Independent senators here in the Senate. A deal was done to overcome that impasse. The so-called deal was never, ever intended to last forever, certainly not beyond a federal election. Is this deal supposed to hold until the end of time? It is ludicrous and ridiculous, and as much as I respect Senator Evans, I think that he was totally on the wrong track this afternoon.
Let me get to the substantive debate, Madam Acting Deputy President Troeth. This is a really important debate for our country. Universities and higher education providers are in the business of knowledge and there is no more important business in the world than knowledge. That is what this debate is all about.
Professor Bradley, in her landmark review of Australian higher education, nominated a target of 40 per cent of young Australians to have a bachelor’s degree by 2020. In order to achieve that she knew that there had to be a distinct increase in the number of young Australians from three particular disadvantaged groups: Indigenous kids, kids from low-socioeconomic backgrounds and, finally—and this is the one that pertains to Senator Nash’s concern this afternoon—young Australians living in regional and rural areas of our great country. Why? Because they are particularly disadvantaged. There is an argument of equity and there is also, as Senator Nash reminded us all, an argument in the public interest, in the nation’s interest, that we should assist all these kids from disadvantaged communities to attend university. Why? Because we want as many smart young Australians from whatever background to attend university if they are able to. We are a poorer country when young Australians who are able and qualified cannot attend university. We are in fact a worse-off and poorer nation.
We know that while there are more Indigenous kids now going to university—not enough, that is true, but there are more—and there are more students from low-socioeconomic backgrounds going to university—again, not enough, but there are more—what we have discovered, in fact, is that there are fewer young Australians from rural areas attending university. In fact, we are going backwards, and all I need to do is refer to the Bradley review itself. Professor Bradley reported:
People from regional and remote parts of Australia remain seriously under-represented in higher education and the participation rates for both have worsened in the last five years.
That is on page 31 of the review. In other words, it is getting worse for rural kids, not better. For rural students the bar to university study is more likely to be logistical and financial than cultural. The bar is logistical and financial, not cultural. Even with modern technology it is impossible to take universities to every small town in Australia—I think we all concede that. No, we have to somehow get rural students to university, and that cost is not part of HECS. It is not a cost you can claim under HECS. Rural students frequently must leave home to study and they do not receive HECS to cover living away from home expenses.
If this parliament fails to attend to the matters Senator Nash has so eloquently described, as our country moves towards 40 per cent of young Australians graduating with a bachelor’s degree—and that is our country’s aim, and it is a bipartisan aim, I should add—we will simply end up with more students who live in relatively affluent suburbs in the big cities who can catch public transport to university. In other words, there will be no change in social composition. We will simply get more people like me going to university, and we do not want that, do we? What we want are more people like Senator Joyce and Senator Nash going to university. We want kids from all parts of Australia to go, particularly, as I say, because there has been a decline in young Australians from rural and regional areas going to university. It is a big challenge for our country to attend to that.
What really worries me is this. The government is quite right to talk about equity and access. I do not contest that at all. But, unless something is done about rural and regional students, the social composition of young Australians attending university will not change. We have seen this before. We saw it in the Whitlam era with the abolition of tertiary fees. Everyone thought that that would change the social composition of Australian universities. Did it? No. We abolished fees and what happened? Simply more middle-class kids went to university. That is what happened. There will be the same problem here.
I accept what the government has done by in a sense deregulating student demand. I and the opposition accept that. I accept that major reform in the Bradley review. What worries me is that there will be a deregulation of student demand and student demand will force universities to offer courses that students deem appropriate, but the social composition will not change. That worries me, and I suspect it worries the government and Senator Chris Evans too. Unless we do something positive, nothing will change.
—Which we are.
—Not enough perhaps in the context of rural students, Senator Collins. That is what worries me, Senator Nash and Senator Joyce. The bottom line is this: when there are greater opportunities for our rural students—

Senator Polley interjecting—

 (Senator Troeth)—Order! Senator Mason has the floor.
—It is okay, Madam Acting Deputy President; no-one in the Senate has a louder voice than I do, as you know. Who knows whether a 12-year-old boy from Cunnamulla will be the fellow who in 20 years time discovers a cure for cancer or whether a young girl from Broome will be the new Manning Clark or, better still, Geoffrey Blainey. The argument from the coalition is simply this: this parliament should give our rural kids that chance.
—Senator Wortley.
—Why didn’t you do it?
—Order! Only one senator at a time has the floor. It is now Senator Wortley’s turn.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Youth Allowance</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1
"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2010-11-16,"—In this matter of public importance debate the Australian government’s commitment to students in regional Australia is being questioned. The reality is that the Labor government have done more in just over three years for our tertiary students, put more in place for our tertiary students, including those in regional areas, than the coalition did in more than a decade. Not only have we done more but we are also addressing the damage that was left behind by the Howard government.
We know that education is of paramount importance. A strong and appropriately resourced education sector is vital to Australia’s future and one of the cornerstones of our future wellbeing as a nation. We know that, for our young people, education really is the window to the world. We know and understand that this is the reality. That is why in government we have made unprecedented commitments to education, specifically on the issue of the independent youth allowance.
The Bradley review of higher education found that participation in study at university by people from regional areas was falling and that the participation in study by people from low-socioeconomic backgrounds languished at 15 per cent, as against a population share of 25 per cent. That was when those opposite were in government. They were in government for a decade—
—Eleven and a half years.
—More than a decade. Prior to the implementation of the legislation, the system was already broken. It was broken for both of these groups—those from regional areas and those from low-socioeconomic backgrounds. One should look at who held the reins during the years leading up to this—and, yes, it was the coalition, who are sitting opposite. Let us be clear here. Under the coalition, the participation of rural, regional and socioeconomically disadvantaged students in higher education fell and it showed no signs of improving. Senator Joyce, you can sit there—
—Senator Wortley, would you please address your remarks through the chair.
—There are some sitting opposite who have their heads down, looking slightly dismal. I can understand that because, if I had been part of a government that had left behind a higher education system like this, I would feel the same.
The Bradley review also found that youth allowance arrangements were poorly targeted, that assistance was not going to those students most in need. In March this year the government introduced comprehensive reforms to ensure that across Australia more university students had fairer access to student income support. The legislation giving effect to these reforms was supported by the opposition. The changes have benefited students who move away from home to study, particularly rural and regional students and those from low-socioeconomic backgrounds. For many it has meant that they now have the opportunity to attend university. The reforms introduced by the government include lowering the age of independence, an increased threshold for the parental income test—

Senator Nash interjecting—

—I will come back to that, Senator Nash—a tighter workforce participation test to target students genuinely in need of assistance and the creation of new scholarship payments. As a key outcome of these reforms the parental income test has become the main criterion for students to qualify for youth allowance. Under the changes, the parental income test threshold was increased from $33,300 to $44,165 and the 20 per cent family taper was introduced. So that threshold for the parental income test was increased and as a result over 100,000 students, including students from regional areas, will benefit because more students will be eligible for youth allowance as dependants.
So it is now the case that many students who previously had to prove independence will have automatic access to support. Already 25,000 additional students from low- and middle-income families have improved access to youth allowance. The proportion of students from regional, rural and remote areas receiving income support has increased. This is because of the changes to the parental income test. These are students who may well not have otherwise been able to undertake tertiary studies. The parental income test changes have removed an existing barrier for those students. In addition to these reforms, the workforce participation criterion was also tightened. The changes to the youth allowance eligibility criteria only comprise one element of the student income support reforms, the ones that those opposite voted on and supported.
Also introduced were the new student start-up scholarship and the relocation scholarship, which improves access and equity for rural and regional students who need to relocate to attend their place of study. To date nearly 180,000 higher education students who receive student income support have received at least one instalment of the new student start-up scholarship. In addition, since April this year nearly 23,000 students who have relocated from their home to a place closer to where they study have also received an additional relocation scholarship—23,000 students. And the government is also progressively lowering—through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, I urge those on the opposite side to listen—the age of independence, with more than 2,600 students achieving independent status since April this year, when the age of independence was lowered from 25 to 24 years. This will be reduced to the age of 22 on 1 January 2012, further recognising the increasing self-sufficiency of young people.
In stark contrast, the needs of regional students were neglected by the Liberal-National coalition for more than a decade. I have said it. Interestingly, it was the coalition government in 1998—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Senator Nash, you need to listen to this—that increased the age of independence from 22 to 25. They increased it. So the age of independence was increased by the coalition government from the age of 22, where it was, to the age of 25. This was in 1998 and it sat there. For the decade that those opposite were in government it sat at 25.
It has taken a Labor government to reduce it. The government’s $20 million Rural Tertiary Hardship Fund will operate from 1 January 2011 to 30 June 2013. This fund to assist rural and regional students under the age of 25 to undertake higher education studies is very welcome. So from the beginning of next year, young people from rural and regional areas who require financial help to take up an offer from a higher educational institution may be able to receive assistance through this fund. Those in need will have access to this fund. The government has also committed to the establishment of a rural and regional task force to consider and advise on eligibility criteria for assistance with the fund. The role of the task force will be to advise the government, and this is just one of the ways in which the government is helping more rural and regional students aged 25 and under to take on higher education.
The government reforms support the most disadvantaged students in regional areas. Disadvantaged students from remote, very remote and other regional areas are excluded from the changes to the workforce participation criteria provided they need to move away from home to study and their parents’ income is less than $150,000 per annum. This is a good move. The opposition agreed to this in March this year and now they are suggesting that these arrangements need to be extended. The opposition never negotiated to exclude inner regional students from the changes. (Time expired)

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2010-11-16,"—I am pleased to have this opportunity to follow Senator Wortley in this debate because she made some very good points that I would hope to build upon. Before I commence on the detail of the private member’s bill, I want to take a moment to reflect on the process farce that has occurred on us coming here. I will save deeper reflection on what has occurred in managing opposition business on this occasion, but it does need to be highlighted that what has occurred in the Senate today has trashed a deal that was done eight months ago on this issue. And as Senator Xenophon rightly pointed out in the failed motion to suspend standing orders to deal with a private member’s bill, nothing has changed in these issues. Yes, there may well have been, as Senator Mason pointed out, an election, but in terms of the arrangements for student income support and people from remote and regional areas, there has been nothing in that context that is different, nothing at all, other than that Senator Mason has been pounced upon by the Nationals and has highlighted once again the fragility of this coalition—the fragility that exists in terms of sensible policy process from the opposition. That is the issue that leads us to where we are in terms of the private member’s bill or the matter of public interest that is now before us.
Let us have a look at the detail of exactly what this is about. Rather than it being about the government mismanaging student income support, I draw on, as Senator Wortley did earlier, the point made by Senator Mason. Yes, the Bradley review did show that things were going seriously backwards for regional students. It was interesting that Senator Mason made this point because, if you look at the period of time when the government should have ensured appropriate processes to manage student participation from regional and remote Australia, it was indeed the Howard government—it was the Howard government who failed the students. I thank Senator Mason for highlighting what the Bradley review highlighted, because the measures that were introduced under the Howard government led to that decrease in participation. That decrease in participation, mind you, did not only occur in tertiary education for remote students; it also occurred in secondary education. We had dismal figures. The completion rate in secondary schooling went backwards under the Howard government. So how the Nationals can come into the Senate now and try and claim some credibility on this matter is astounding.
Let us look at what is being peddled here. The private member’s bill they sought to have us debate now was about applying the same eligibility criteria for independent youth allowance for students residing in the inner region zone as currently applies to students residing in outer regional, remote and very remote zones. As has been pointed out, the fact remains that the special provisions for disadvantaged students from outer regional and remote locations were agreed with the opposition when the reforms to student income support were passed in March this year. As Senator Xenophon pointed out, there is nothing new. The suspension of standing orders was not supported because there is nothing new other than that Senator Mason was mugged by the Nationals on this occasion and the Manager of Opposition Business foolishly played along. That was the only new thing here.
Under the agreement that was negotiated with the coalition, students from remote, very remote and outer regional areas are excluded from the changes to the workforce participation criteria provided they need to move away from home to study and their parents’ income is less than $150,000 per annum. The opposition is now suggesting that these arrangements be extended to students living in inner regional areas as well. The opposition is aware that this whole package of reform measures was carefully designed with the aim of budget neutrality. The opposition has stated that the funding to support its proposal would come from the capital investment fund— (Time expired)

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2010-11-16,"—What a complete display of utter hypocrisy. We had the capacity to deliver fairness and equality but they voted for hypocrisy and platitudes. We had Senator Hanson-Young talking about a patch-up job. I am afraid, Senator Hanson-Young, I would prefer a patch-up to a flat tyre—that is what you have delivered to the people of regional Australia. Then we had Senator Brown, so help me, railing against queue jumping. This is almost like Brave New World. A couple of weeks ago he was telling us, ‘It is the “don’t ask, don’t question policy” on leadership,’ and today we have the Greens railing against queue jumping. It is a very interesting paradigm that we live in.
What is it about? Senator Brown and the Labor Party are also proffering their advice on how we have to save money by not educating people in regional Australia! How pathetic is that? The money we have wasted on ceiling insulation could have been used to educate kids in regional Australia and given them a tertiary education. We could have used even a portion of the money you wasted on the BER to fix up this problem. We could have used the money you just threw out the door with your $900 cheques in a better way—that is, educating people. The greatest nexus with your aim of social advancement is education. You voted against it today and so did Senator Xenophon and the Greens. They voted against social advancement for those who live in disadvantaged areas! You can go through all the platitudes and histrionics, but the fact is that you had the opportunity to vote for justice but you voted against it. That is as simple as it gets.
This is who you voted against: Dalby; Kingaroy; Rockhampton, which is Labor town, both state and federal; Hamley Bridge; Angaston; Riverton; Ballina, another Labor town; Gympie; Nambour; Warwick; Gladstone; Bundaberg; Orange; Dubbo; Northam; Bunbury; Busselton; Tamworth; Lismore; Shepparton; Wagga Wagga; Nowra; Lithgow; Mount Gambier; Byron Bay; Singleton; Branxton; and Dungog—yes, you also voted against your people down in the Hunter Valley. You voted against those people because of the urbane society that you are trying to create—this urbane Green-Labor clique. They believe that they have the right to go into a tertiary institution but nobody else does. It is not there for other people. This is part of the bumper-sticker morality that now pervades this place.
It is quite clear and simple: you could have voted for fairness, you could have voted for equality—you could have voted for the capacity of people in inner regional areas to go to university after a gap year—but you voted against it. I can assure you that after two years in the workforce—which is what they will have to do with their, on average, 30 hours a week in 13-week blocks over 18 months—people will peel off. People will make their decision: ‘Bother it. I’ll stick to doing what I’ve been doing.’ They will have a new social network, a new girlfriend or boyfriend and a new job, and they will not go. So you have compromised their capacity for social advancement in life—if you believe, as I thought Mr Whitlam did, in a tertiary education.
It is so obscene for a party that spent in excess of $81 million on an ETS that never went anywhere, which even they themselves denied. That amount of money could have been used to educate people. Education is right at the top of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. There are people who will go without food to educate their kids. There are people who will go without a better house, without new clothes and without a car. One people’s principal desires is the education of their children. But you voted against that and now we have to put up with this absolute and utter hypocrisy that is being blurted out by all and sundry around the chamber, these amazing platitudes. In this new, Kafkaesque bureaucracy, they have found it in their souls to leave people behind. And what do they offer? ‘Oh well, we’ll send it to an inquiry.’ We only have days till the end of the year. You know that. There are time constraints. To say that this is a surprise is a load of rubbish. This has been fought and people knew that it was coming, that the time was coming. The coalition had to act. Senator Nash, Senator Williams and Senator Mason acted to try and bring a resolution on this.
I do not know what is going to happen to the whales; I really don’t. I do not know whether they are going to be saved or whether they are going to be slaughtered; I just do not know. What I do know is what is going to happen to those kids in regional Australia. I do know what is going to happen there. They will not get the chance for the same standard of education and of life as is delivered to people in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne. I do not know what precedence in the scheme of things the gay marriage bill should take. But apparently Senator Brown believes that the gay marriage bill, whales and everything else are more important than delivering equality, in its most seminal form—the capacity to deliver to people the ability to advance their lives via education.
Then they talked about being out of time. That made complete sense when, last night, I watched as they started going back into the address-in-reply to the Governor-General’s speech! No, you are not out of time—you are just completely and utterly disorganised. This whole parliament has turned into a farce and a joke. You have nothing that you are going forward with and you just leave the crucial issues behind.
So what are we going to say to the regional people who you so earnestly told you were going to look after when you attained the government benches? What are you going to say to the people of Ballina? What are you going to say to the people of Rockhampton? How does this one actually work? ‘We believe in you, but we don’t believe you should go to university’? ‘We believe in you, but we believe that you’re a second-rate citizen compared to someone in Sydney or Melbourne’? ‘We believe in you, but’—wink-wink, nod-nod—‘we believe in you just a little bit less than we believe in the whales’?
That is apparently where Senator Brown is: he has more concern about things in the South Seas that he has no power—none whatsoever—to affect. And he puts that up as an excuse to leave regional people out. Today, he, Senator Xenophon and the Labor Party could have put up a change that would have made people’s lives better. They could have made people’s lives better. They could have done something constructive that would have actually taken people ahead. They could have been decisive. They could have been compassionate. They could have shown foresight. They could have stuck to their vision of who they were as a party when Gough Whitlam brought in greater access to tertiary education. But, no—they descended into hypocrisy, they descended into the murk and they turned away from regional Australia. (Time expired)

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2010-11-16,"—I was quite interested to note that the Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill 2010 is not only on the Notice Paper but is actually being debated—and I think it is a very exciting occasion. I was looking back at some speech notes that I had which were dated 21 February 2010 and they said the bill was listed for debate on 18 March 2010. I noticed that the first thing I was going to talk about back then was the fact that, on 22 October 2009, the Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, told the House of Representatives that it was important that the Australian Preventive Health Agency be up and running on 1 January 2010. She said it was ‘essential that the legislation be passed without delay’. Unfortunately, like so many of the wonderful reforms of the Labor government, this has come to nought and has been delayed and delayed and delayed.
The opposition have no basic objection to this bill but we do have some very strong reservations around the achievability of the great promises that were made by Minister Roxon and the government. I think it is worth noting that the Australian National Preventive Health Agency was an election promise of the Rudd Labor government in December 2007. But it is now almost December 2010, so Minister Roxon’s definition of ‘without delay’ must be slightly different from mine. I guess that when the government have so much mess to clean up, so much waste to try to spin their way out of, it is not surprising that they have had neither the time nor the inclination to do something which from 2007 to 2009 they regarded as essential and urgent.
I was recently very pleased to get an email from the Bushwalking Society of Australia. Very much along the lines of the coalition’s view on the subject, they suggested that walking is very good exercise. They also pointed out that you do not need an awful lot of bureaucracy to undertake walking, that you do not need to spend $133 million on awareness and promotion programs and social marketing programs to get walking happening and that walking could be a cheap and easy answer to improving the health of Australians. It is not simply about telling people what is good for them; it is about encouraging them to understand why it is good for them and why making healthy choices in their lifestyle and diet is worth while for them. If it were simply about saying, ‘Eat your veggies,’ everyone in Australia would at some stage have become a healthy person. We have concerns now that a generation who have not been told to eat their veggies is developing.
But let us have a look at why that is happening. Education around nutrition is not happening. That is because people are so much busier and because there is a food market—sometimes pejoratively referred to as ‘the fast-food market’—that simply meets the needs of busy consumers. There is no problem, in my view, with food marketers who meet the needs of consumers. But we need to unpick that a little more and make the point that it is about meeting the ‘needs’ of consumers. If consumers want chips with an extra dollop of fat on the side, that is what the market will give them. If consumers ask for salads and other healthier options, that is also what the market will give them.
I am very concerned that, with this bureaucracy, we might end up with a move towards a nanny state. The agency that is established by the bill will advise the minister on matters related to preventive health; gather, analyse and disseminate information; conduct awareness campaigns; make financial assistance grants; develop national standards and codes of practice; manage schemes rewarding best practice; and any other function as determined by the minister. To say the least, that is a very open-ended list of functions—and some of the amendments that have been suggested are aimed at ensuring that there is transparency and oversight of exactly what the agency does.
The bill also creates the Australian National Preventive Health Agency Advisory Council, which will advise the CEO. Back in October last year Minister Roxon said the agency would be receiving $133 million over four years to undertake its activities. I wonder whether the government intends to index that money, given that it has taken so long for this body to get off the ground.
The agency arose from the 30 June 2009 report of the National Preventative Health Taskforce, Australia: the healthiest country by 2020, which seemed both ambitious and somewhat ambiguous in its title. I wondered whether it was suggesting that the agency would make Australia the healthiest country in the world within 10 years—a laudable aim, but I suggest that it is as unlikely to be recognised and achieved as Prime Minister Hawke’s promise back in the 1980s that no child would be living in poverty by 1990. We need to do far more than we have done in assisting disadvantaged people, Indigenous Australians and people with disabilities before we can begin to boast about looking like the healthiest country in the world.
The response to Australia: the healthiest country by 2020 became, like so many other things that this government started but did not quite finish, tied up in the recommendations of the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission, which is still wending its tortuous way through many different procedures. I think the government is now up to something that is alleged to be action around the review of the review of the review of the ministerial advisory council’s advice to the COAG meeting on the review!—and so it goes.
Again we have the issue of the structure of this body being such that it will suffer from the same fragmentation and the same problems that other attempts to reform hospital funding and health funding in Australia have suffered from. Right now we have a situation where the Queensland government does not, or cannot or will not—the answer is a bit hard to know—provide data in certain health areas to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in a way that allows it to be compared to other states’ data. There are consistent problems in getting data that is nationally comparable in Australia. Of course, the issue here is that the federal government cannot compel the states to provide comparable data. Why, in fact, would a state provide data if their current record on health and hospital funding was about subterfuge and hiding funding in hollow logs wherever they could so that they were away from scrutiny by the state oppositions and by this parliament?
The government seems to think that it is good public policy to set up this preventive health agency in what is still a very uncertain situation—something of a policy and procedural vacuum—around what happens in health. There are also currently moves to set up a safety and quality authority to oversight the safety of the delivery of hospital services throughout Australia. Once again, of course, there is no standardised data from all the states. There is just the hope that—perhaps, maybe!—sooner or later everyone at COAG will see their way clear to do it all the same way.
There is a suggestion not only of setting up an agency to oversight health and welfare but of having other authorities to look at pricing and the like. You can see that in health we are building agency and authority after agency and authority—a massive brick wall of bureaucracy. And there is no guarantee whatsoever that these new agencies will improve the delivery of services or the types of services being delivered, given the failures that this government has had, not only in negotiating coherent agreements in the area of health and hospital funding, but also in delivering any of their projects which involve serious and complex implementation. I could go on for ever and ever on that issue. So we remain concerned about what this will all mean.
In the explanatory memorandum that Ms Roxon circulated this time around—it has ‘2010’ on it so it must be one of her later efforts—you see that she talks about the functions of the CEO in terms of what the agency will do. Dot point number six of 10—more than halfway down the list—it says that the CEO will  manage national-level preventive health promotional activities, including education promotional and community awareness programs relating to preventive health, including but not limited to the promotion of a healthy lifestyle and good nutrition, reducing tobacco use, minimising the harmful drinking of alcohol, discouraging substance abuse and reducing the incidence of obesity amongst Australians. For example, the national program provides funding to the National Preventative Health Authority for national level social-marketing campaigns on obesity and tobacco.
As I said, that is No. 6 out of 10 tasks or criteria for the CEO of this new organisation. It seems to me that it should be far, far higher up the list. What is a preventative health agency for? If it is going to be collecting data and providing evidence based recommendations, either at the minister’s request or on the CEO’s own initiative, I think we need to get the data collection right first—and, as I already pointed out, this is just not happening. The data collection and the standardisation of the data collection is as difficult for the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare as it has been for a number of years because the state governments—primarily the state Labor governments, particularly the government of my own state of Queensland—simply do not cooperate or see the necessity of properly cooperating.
Collecting and analysing information relating to preventative health is actually seen as a more important task for this agency than undertaking preventative health promotional activities. I do not think there is any exaggeration in the concerns that the opposition has about this potentially being a great, big bureaucracy not doing very much. We are not going to improve the health of Australians by collecting data, by looking at the data that has already been collected or by replacing, presumably, in some ways the work of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, which already collects data. It is fine to collect data, but collecting data is only one task, and by no means the major task, that you would expect a new body that is costing millions and millions of dollars to undertake. You would expect this to be an active body that would actually be doing something. Terms such as ‘promotional activities’ and ‘community awareness programs’ do not sound as pointy as one might hope if we are talking about educating people about how to be healthy, why they should want to be healthy and the dangers of not being healthy.
Senator Barnett has already discussed the epidemic of obesity and diabetes in Australia. This can only get worse as the population ages. We have bodies already collecting whatever data is available. We do not need this body to reinvent the wheel; we need this body to get on with doing some real work on educating the public on the topic of what constitutes good health and a healthy lifestyle.
We should also look at some of the other areas in which this government has behaved somewhat oddly when it comes to the health of Australians. I was interested to note in today’s media that, for the first time since the Fraser government, there are now more than 10 million Australians with private health insurance. I am pleased about that. Judging by the legislative measures that those opposite are attempting to undertake, they are not pleased about that. A lot of their activities are about trying to decrease, cap and stop moves towards private health insurance.
—Sorry, Sue, you got that one wrong.
—I cannot imagine that the cap that is being proposed is going to assist people to come into the area. Catholic Health Australia and dozens of other witnesses have already said that, if you means-test it, you will limit the number of people who use it. It is pretty clear that controlling and limiting the size of the private health insurance system is a reason for the actions of the government.
I am pleased that we are back to having 10 million Australians on private health insurance. That industry often promotes healthy lifestyles—it offers such things as discounts on gym membership and the like—but, as I said before, these sorts of basic, intelligent, practical measures do not suit this government. It wants to spend millions of dollars on building bureaucracy and collecting and reviewing data rather than on undertaking the education of Australians.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2010-11-16,"—It is a pleasure to rise to make a few brief comments on the Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill 2010. Everybody believes in having a healthier society, promoting health outcomes and encouraging healthier lifestyles amongst all Australians. These are motherhood statements. These are things that I think we all share a common desire to achieve. This government is very good at pitching itself in a position to make motherhood statements that support the types of things about which everybody nods their head and says, ‘Yes, we agree with that.’ Faster broadband for everybody is a great idea. Everybody likes faster broadband; never mind the $43 billion cost or the details that come with it. An economic stimulus package to save us from recession is a great idea; this side of the chamber supported part of that. Never mind the fact that it plunged the country into debt. It delivered a whole lot of programs that, in and of themselves, sound like a nice idea, such as more money for schools—what a great idea. We all support new infrastructure for schools; it is a shame that we gave them buildings that they did not necessarily want and could have used that funding for far more practical education outcomes. Here we are now with the motherhood statement of preventative health and healthier outcomes for everybody, to be achieved by setting up this new agency.
This dates back, as Senator Boyce so ably outlined, to 2007, to some Rudd government promises and the government’s desire to be seen to be doing something about preventative health, to be seen to be tackling issues that on occasion grab the tabloid newspaper headlines—obesity, alcohol abuse and smoking rates. These are the things that they see as sexy. Indeed, you can track back and find that announcements such as these around the Preventative Health Taskforce and so on and other measures that this government has pursued all happen to be conveniently timed for when there is some kind of tabloid newspaper binge on preventative health subjects like the three I just mentioned.
The government commissioned a report from the National Preventative Health Taskforce. The report was handed down in the term of the Rudd government. Quite a sweeping series of recommendations came out of that task force report. If you tally up all of their ideas and recommendations, the National Preventative Health Taskforce came up with, I think, 26 potential pieces of new legislation; 18 potential new policies, programs or frameworks; seven potential new or extended bureaucracies of some sort; and 71 other different and diverse recommendations for some form of government action. That is an awful lot of government action.
Of course, the government—because they are not so good on action themselves—have decided to pick up one key recommendation of the task force, and that is to establish the National Preventive Health Agency, and so we have this legislation before us. My fear as we embark on establishing this agency is that they are going to look at the report of the task force and its recommendations for potentially 26 new pieces of legislation, 18 new programs or frameworks, seven new bureaucracies and 70-odd other recommendations and they are going to see that as their remit—they are going to see that as the types of things they should be doing. That means that they are going to be intruding into lives and all manner of things that, by and large, should be the decisions for sensible, responsible, free-thinking adults.
Senator Boyce quite cogently made some of those arguments about the importance of instilling responsibility and choice in people when it comes to these matters. However, the government is going to impose on us this new agency, with a broad and far-reaching array of objects and powers and hundreds of millions of dollars to spend, most of which is to be spent on non-defined social marketing campaigns. It will be spending this taxpayer money in an attempt to change behaviour. More particularly, it will be providing and making recommendations directly through to government on anything that it sees fit to relate to this preventative health agenda. It is those recommendations and what government does with them that will provide the real threat to the freedom of individuals to make reasonable, fair choices in the future.
I go back to the 316 pages of the Preventative Health Taskforce report—316 pages largely of nanny-statism, of people sitting down and saying: ‘We know what’s best for you. We know better than you how you should lead your life. We of course know what is best for your children; we know better than you how you should raise your children.’ There are a lot of truths in that; there are a lot of people who make mistakes. But there are limits on the capacity of government to reach in and ensure that children are raised the way that we may all think is ideal. There are limits on the capacity of government to reach in and ensure that you lead the type of healthy lifestyle that some may think is ideal. And those limits are there for good reason—because, frankly, we should be able to lead the type of lifestyle that we think is appropriate. Yes, occasionally, we need a bit of encouragement—even a bit of a nudge, though I do not want that word to be misused—to ensure we know what is right to do and particularly to ensure that we understand what the sensible choices that we should be making are. Hopefully, if this agency does the right thing, it will enhance people’s capacity to make sensible choices but it will not deprive them of the capacity to make those choices in the first place.
I know that my colleagues in the other place and Senator Fierravanti-Wells here will propose a range of amendments, or have already proposed some amendments—many of which are, hopefully, to instil a little bit more direction, a little bit more restraint and a little bit more balance into this preventive health agency. Hopefully they are not just to ensure that we have a group of people who can engage in ‘group think’ sitting around the table but to ensure that there is some external input—some industry input, some input from people who might have opinions that differ. I would urge the government to accept this concept of adding some industry input into the membership of the agency and into the advisory council in particular. There needs to be greater transparency, ensuring that we have published the type of information and recommendations that the authority is making. The public, who will fund this agency, and the parliament have the right to know what this agency is recommending to ministers, to know what types of things it is proposing. If it is a litany of the types of things proposed in the Preventative Health Taskforce report, there will be a concern that it is overreaching in its remit and is driving us down the path of a state-knows-best type of approach. This really is a case of trying to get the balance right between ‘state knows best’ and individual choice and responsibility.
The coalition are supporting the passage of this legislation because we recognise that there is more work to be done in the area of educating people and ensuring a greater understanding by all Australians of what we should engage in to live a healthy lifestyle. But the challenge for this agency will be to ensure that it is constructive in the spirit and the way in which it goes about that—that it is an agency that promotes understanding, knowledge and responsibility, not an agency that deprives people of choice. That means that it needs to spend its time ensuring that the information provided through health networks, GPs, schools, parenting options, childcare centres and all of the types of avenues that exist to better inform families, parents and individuals of the impacts of the choices they make is capitalised upon and pursued aggressively.
I hope it does not mean that this agency will spend most of its time talking about advertising bans, recommending higher taxes, wanting to put warning labels of ever-greater size on different products, wanting to traffic-light different food options and wanting all manner of trade restrictions. These are the things that stand in the way of business. These are the things that stand in the way of individual choice. These are the things that, frankly, are a step too far for government in many instances in its role in promoting healthy and responsible choices. It should not go to the extent of telling people how to live their lives.
I noticed a quote from Tim Wilson, a very good young writer and commentator who works for the Institute of Public Affairs. It was a solemn warning published in February this year:
Once established, this nanny-state bureaucracy will outlive governments and exist solely to recommend how government should regulate businesses and people’s lives to achieve paternalism.
I hope Mr Wilson is wrong and that that is not the case. He makes the valid point that, once established, this agency will quite likely outlive this government and will serve under future governments, so I hope that those ultimately appointed to the agency, the current government and, importantly, future governments prove me wrong in my concerns and, in particular, prove Mr Wilson wrong in his concerns, that it does not grow into a massive nanny-state structure, that it is not a bloated bureaucracy and that it does not make unreasonable recommendations to government; that it understands what I think is a reasonable remit, and that is to focus very specifically on promoting responsible choices and encouraging more Australians to make those responsible choices into the future.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2010-11-16,"—I thank the senators who contributed to the debate. Chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes account for about 20 per cent of total healthcare expenditure. We know that risk factors contribute to over 30 per cent of Australia’s total burden of death, disease and disability. The Gillard government recognises the importance of taking decisive action to address these issues for our community now and into the future. The bill establishes national infrastructure to help drive major change in the way we behave and how we look after our own health. The agency will be providing evidence based policy advice on preventative health matters.
As the minister stated in the second reading speech, governments can play a leadership role by gathering, analysing and disseminating the best available evidence and implementing programs and policies based on that evidence. In March 2010 the minister, with the agreement of the Australian Greens and Senator Xenophon, decided that $50 million from the national binge-drinking strategy will be rolled out through the agency rather than through the Department of Health and Ageing. As the agency was not established at that time, the government has allowed the Department of Health and Ageing to start work and ensure that delivery of the initiatives is timely and not held up.
Recently, a consultation paper was released for feedback on the $25 million Community Sponsorship Fund, which aims to provide an alternative to alcohol industry sponsorship for local community sporting and cultural organisations. Feedback on the consultation paper closes on 19 November. It is envisaged that grants will be provided next year. These programs will be transferred to the agency once it is established, in accordance with our agreement with Senators Xenophon and Siewert.
This agency is important because it will permanently embed preventative health thinking and action into the future, as an enduring institution. Australia’s efforts in health prevention have been among the best in the world, but, given the challenges that we face, we must harness and focus all of our resources to become better at preventing disease. The agency will play an instrumental role in meeting this challenge and will actively engage and collaborate with partners, both government and non-government, to influence change leading to preventative health gains. It is important that the bill is passed in this sitting to allow the agency to commence operation as soon as possible. The time to act is now. We must delay no longer. I commend the bill to the chamber.
Question agreed to.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2010-11-16,"—Tonight, I would like to talk about an area that has been neglected for decades but where there is now hope, a ‘light on the hill’, thanks to the federal Labor government. I speak of the way in which we support people in our community with disabilities. Bruce Bonyhady AM, Chairman of Yooralla and member of the Disability Interest Group, which produced the report Shut out: the experience of people with disabilities and their families in Australia, said:
Support for people with disabilities is delivered through a welfare and charity model that is frequently in crisis. This is after decades in which Policy Reforms have largely bypassed the Disability Sector.
Recently I visited the St Giles Society, a Tasmanian not-for-profit organisation based in Launceston, which supports 5,000 Tasmanian families with children with disabilities—and a great institution it is, with wonderful people and staff who work within it. Ian Wright, CEO of St Giles, reported that the awareness of benefits of early intervention for young children with difficulties such as delays in developmental milestones, speech and writing problems, attention deficit behaviour and the sensory processing of noise and touch are much more broadly understood than in the past. Referrals to St Giles have doubled in the past 10 years. Programs such as Launching in Learning have changed this awareness. Children who are referred to St Giles can wait six months before they can receive their initial assessment.
Maggie McKenzie, formerly a senior physiotherapist at St Giles, whose daughter is nearly 20 years of age but, unfortunately, was born with Down syndrome, talked about going from being regarded as an expert in the treatment of children one day to being seen as a ‘dumb’ mother the next. Maggie, who now runs her own private physiotherapy practice on the West Tamar in northern Tasmania, talked about how time-consuming accessing the fragmented and limited services can be. She said that, during the summer school holidays, she had to either employ someone to work in her practice or employ someone to look after her daughter. Maggie went on to talk about the difficulties for people with disabilities once they turn 18. There is no St Giles for these people. There is, now, nowhere. She said:
If someone with a disability as a result of a car accident is referred to me, the Motor Accident Insurance Board will pay for their care, but for disabled people, say, like my daughter, who are referred as part of the Enhanced Primary Care program, they would be out of pocket by $100 for the same level of care for each treatment session.
Why are disabled people being referred to Maggie and not to a publicly funded therapy service? Firstly, it is because this is an area of her expertise, but, mainly, it is because services for disabled adults were run down during the Howard era.
Peter Lloyd, a former state representative of the Australian Quadriplegic Association, Victoria, agrees about the difficulties that adults with disabilities experience. He said:
For most disabled people life is a struggle—there are times when it is really hard to come to terms with.
My scooter needs new tyres and battery, these are not covered by the insurance scheme—I have no idea where I can find the $600-$800.

My dog eats better than I do. What complicates things even further is when disabled people have multiple problems e.g. Type 2 Diabetes—just food costs alone—to get the type of food you should eat is more expensive than budget products. It all just adds up.
These are additional challenges for people with disabilities. Now, I know that the federal Labor government have taken steps to improve the lives of people with disability, promote participation and create a more inclusive society, particularly for children and their families.
The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has been ratified. The Better Start for Children with Disability initiative will ensure children with disabilities that affect their development have access to intensive early intervention therapies and treatments from expert health professionals. In the first year, around 7,880 young children diagnosed with sight and hearing impairments, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome or fragile X syndrome will be eligible for services under the program. Children under six with a diagnosis of one of these disabilities will be eligible to receive up to $12,000 for early intervention services. From 1 July next year, children will be able to access critical early intervention services like speech pathology, audiology, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and psychology advice. A maximum of $6,000 can be spent in any financial year, and families will have up to their child’s seventh birthday to use the funding. In addition, about 20,000 children will also be able to access new Medicare services for diagnosis and treatment under this program. A Medicare rebate for the development of a treatment and management plan will be available for children under the age of 13. Medicare rebates will also be available for up to four allied health diagnostic services and for up to 20 allied health treatment services per child, in total, with relevant allied health professionals. Treatment items could be used by children up to the age of 15, provided they receive a treatment and management plan before the age of 13 years.
The Better Start for Children with Disability initiative builds on a similar program for children with autism that has been successfully implemented by the federal Labor government. That program has provided more than 8,500 children with autism spectrum disorder with early intervention funding since 2008. This total package will cost $122 million over four years.
There was $100 million in capital funds in May 2008 for the states and territories to build more than 300 supported accommodation places for people with severe disabilities being looked after by ageing carers. However, the light on the hill that I mentioned earlier is that disability organisations and people with disabilities are looking towards part of a landmark study being undertaken by the Productivity Commission. The National Disability Insurance Scheme will be a major transformation of how we support people with disabilities. People with disabilities deserve the same opportunity as other Australians to participate in our community, have a job where possible and live meaningful lives. As Bruce Bonyhady says, we need a scheme that is available to all people with disabilities—people born with disabilities; accident and injury victims; and people with medical conditions or mental illness. Beneficiaries would be eligible for lifelong assistance, and people will be treated equally, with no fault consideration. All of these items will be covered: care and support; therapy; aids; equipment; home modifications; timely intervention; person- and family-centred care based on needs, with case management, brokerage and advocacy as needed; lifetime planning; and family and carers receiving tailored support. At least 700,000 Australians are looking for this radical change in our approach to their support.
I commend the action that was taken by the former Parliamentary Secretary for Disability and Children’s Services, the Hon. Bill Shorten. I want to commend him for the work that he did and also for the amount of time that he spent travelling around the country and ensuring that people with disabilities were given a strong voice and had strong advocacy. This government has proven already that it has the capacity and the commitment to be able to deliver these changes. Senator McLucas has always been an outstanding advocate in this chamber for people with disabilities. I know that in my home state of Tasmania Senator Carol Brown is another strong advocate who has worked with me, along with Senator Bilyk and others, to ensure that Tasmanian families with children or young adults with disabilities have a strong voice and are being listened to and heard by this government. I want to commend the government for what it has done and what it will continue to do.
Again, I would like to place on record my thanks for the outstanding work that is being carried out within the community of Tasmania by the St Giles organisation. It has been a longstanding organisation. I have had a family connection, with some family members working there in different capacities in the past. It is an organisation that, as I said, has in the last 10 years had an increase in referrals. That is something that, as a government, we need to be aware of at both a federal and a state level to ensure that we provide facilities, services and support for these families. In particular, we have to ensure that we have respite services for these families. Again, I would like to commend to the Senate the work that has been done thus far. We are awaiting the Productivity Commission’s report, which hopefully will ensure that we provide even better services going into the future.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Support of People with Disabilities</title>,Adjournment,24,1
