"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-10-20,"—I acknowledge on behalf of the opposition that we have reached agreement with the government on the complete legislative package for the Public Service bills, which are now before the Senate. We have overcome the final obstacle in our negotiations with the government, that is, the conditions that will apply to the use of temporary employment in the Public Service. The government and the opposition have reached agreement on the regulations which will limit the use of temporary employment in the Australian Public Service. The opposition is pleased 
 that the government has now acknowledged that there need to be clear restraints on the use of lengthy temporary employment in the APS.
Through amendments to the bill negotiated by the opposition the new act will enshrine the principle that the APS is a career based service with the usual basis for engagement being as an ongoing employee. This will be supported by a fair and transparent process relating to the termination of employees on specified grounds. The new act and associated regulations will therefore provide the framework for greater employment security in the APS.
We have achieved a substantial movement in the government's original position of wanting to be able to  engage people on a temporary basis for up to six years with little restraint. We now have a general limitation of 18 months on specified-term employment with some significant restraints on the ability to extend such employment up to three years. The revised regulations will permit persons to be employed for a specified term up to 18 months.
Under the proposed Public Service Commissioner's directions, engagement for longer than 12 months must be on the basis of merit. An employee engaged for a specified term for their particular skills or to replace an ongoing employee who is on extended leave or transfer may have their engagement extended up to a total of three years only if the original circumstance of their engagement continues to exist and the agency head has certified that it is in the public interest that their services be retained until the circumstance in relation to which they were engaged has ceased.
An employee engaged for a specified term related to a temporary increase in the workload of an agency which is not expected to be sustained may have their engagement extended up to a total of three years only if the increase in the workload is due to the implementation of a government policy that involves a temporary increase in the ongoing work of an agency. However, in both these circumstances involving extension of engagement up to three years, agency heads must be 
 able to demonstrate that they cannot manage the situation through the effective management of their ongoing work force. We believe this places a firm obligation on agency heads to have regard to the staff turnover within their agency to assess whether they can effectively manage the circumstances through the use of ongoing employees and subsequent redeployment to other jobs when those circumstances cease. In other words, there will be a strong incentive for agency heads not to waste the investment they make in training and skilling employees through a failure to maximise ongoing employment in the agency.
The government have stated that they want to `encourage employment under the new bill rather than resort to alternative and uncertain employment practices'. We share this objective and we urge the government to pursue it by directing agency heads to use the employment categories in the new act and phase out the use of `independent contractors' and `labour hirees'. The opposition will closely monitor the operation of the new provisions to ensure that they are appropriately applied. I am sure that the CPSU will also be vigilant in keeping agency heads honest in using the new temporary employment arrangements. We would expect that there would be no increase in the proportion of the APS work force engaged on a temporary basis. Employment security is fundamental to all employees in both the public sector and the private sector. The improvements that we have negotiated to the bill and the associated regulations will lessen the current high level of job insecurity evident in the APS. That has been an important principle as far as the opposition is concerned.
In conclusion, I take this opportunity to reiterate that, since we entered into these negotiations with the government, it has been our objective to achieve a legislative framework for the Public Service which will endure beyond the term of the Howard government. We wanted a framework that would be equally acceptable to a future Beazley Labor government, a framework that would encourage continuity, stability and certainty—all of which we believe are essential prerequisites for an effective and thriving Public Service. 
 We are confident that the legislative package that we now have before us and the regulations that will be brought forward by the government in due course achieve those objectives.
In view of our agreement with the government on the last remaining obstacle in our negotiations—the regulations which will govern the use of temporary employment in the Public Service—we will be supporting the government in moving that the chamber not insist on its amendments to the Public Service Bill and the Parliamentary Service Bill. I think it is appropriate in this circumstance that the minister at the table, Senator Ellison, representing the Public Service minister, Dr Kemp, acknowledges that the description I have given of the agreement that we have reached on these regulations on temporary employment is completely consistent with the government's own understanding of the situation. In the event that that acknowledgment is given by the minister, we will see very significant reform occurring today to the Public Service Act of this country which, as I have indicated, will stand in good stead for many years to come.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-10-20,"—At the outset I acknowledge Senator Faulkner's comments and the position as he has outlined it. This legislation provides a careful balance between devolved responsibility and approved accountability. In developing the bill, the government has negotiated in good faith with the opposition in recognition of their position as an alternative government and has sought reasonable compromise and bipartisan support.
Before the bill was debated in this chamber last week, agreement had been reached on amendments to the bill which were acceptable to the government and the opposition, with one exception. The circumstances under which agency heads would be able to engage non-ongoing employees was a matter of contention. The government was unable to accept the Senate amendment to clause 22. Since that debate there have been continued negotiations between the government and the opposition, and also consultation with the 
 Community and Public Sector Union, about the circumstances in which people can be employed on that basis.
I take the opportunity to reiterate what I said last week during the debate on this bill—namely, that the government has appreciated the positive approach taken by the opposition. Negotiations have continued in the spirit of goodwill and with the intention of developing a realistic and workable alternative approach. Agreement has now been reached on the use of non-ongoing employment in the APS, and I would like to place on the record how the new employment arrangements are expected to operate.
Clause 22 of the bill allows an agency head to engage employees in one of three categories—ongoing, for a specified term or a specified task and for duties that are irregular or intermittent—while recognising that the usual basis for engagement is as an ongoing employee. Regulations will limit the circumstances in which persons may be engaged as a non-ongoing employee for a specified term or for the duration of a specified task. Agency heads will have the flexibility to engage persons for a specified term of up to 18 months to meet a temporary increase in workload in the agency or part of the agency, to meet a temporary demand for particular skills, or to replace an ongoing employee who is on leave or undertaking other duties.
Provided that the original reason for engagement still exists, agency heads will be able to extend the engagement of an employee engaged to meet a temporary demand for particular skills or to replace an ongoing employee for up to a maximum of three years if they certify that it is in the public interest to do so. Agency heads will also be able to extend engagements undertaken because of a temporary increase in workload, if the reason for the engagement still exists, to a maximum of three years if the increase is due to the implementation of government policy. This reflects the nature of government, where programs often have a two- to three-year lifespan. Before extending the engagement of an employee engaged for a specified term to replace an ongoing employee who is on leave, temporarily assigned to other duties or moved 
 temporarily to another agency, an agency head will need to ensure that there is no scope to use their existing ongoing work force to cover the temporary work increase, the demand for skills, or the replacement of ongoing employees.
In addition, the employment of an employee engaged for a specified term can only be extended in circumstances where the agency head cannot manage the temporary increase in workload, the demand for particular skills or the need to replace APS employees through the use of the agency's ongoing work force. Agency heads may also engage persons for the duration of a specified task when the service of the person will no longer be needed once the task has been completed, provided that existing staff members have the opportunity to express interest and be considered. There are no time limits for this category as it is linked to the length of time needed to complete the specific task. This flexibility means that the agency head is able to determine the nature and extent of the task to be performed. The regulations will also allow agency heads to employ persons for the purposes of gaining employment experience.
To ensure that there is transparency in decision making, service-wide employment schemes will be specified in a Prime Minister's direction under section 21 of the bill, and agency-specific schemes will need to be notified in the Gazette by agency heads. The regulations will also provide that a person who has been offered ongoing employment may choose to be engaged as a specific-term employee for a period of up to three years. This recognises that some people, often professionals, may wish to work in the APS only for a short period, and also provides an employment option for people on a secondment or interchange to the APS from overseas organisations, academia and the public and private sectors who might wish to retain their main employment relationship. This obviously provides some flexibility. The government considers that this framework provides the flexibility agency heads require to meet their operational needs, while ensuring transparency and accountability in relation to the engagement of non-ongoing APS employees. I 
 commend these bills—and the motion in particular—to the Senate, confirm the arrangements as outlined by Senator Faulkner and once again place on record the appreciation of the government in relation to the cooperation showed to it by the opposition.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-10-20,"—I want to indicate that the Democrats do not support this move to not insist on the amendments. We did, generally speaking, support the agreement as struck between the Labor Party and the government. However, there were within that significant compromises. In our view, this is an important principle and compromises too far on what were very significant changes in relation to employment on a temporary basis. We heard no real arguments to support this extension from the current arrangement of 12 months to 18 months, just as there were no good arguments to support the extension to a maximum of six years. There is already, as I understand it, within the Public Service a great deal of employment that goes on on a temporary basis and great nervousness about employing people beyond 12 months. This will set in train a further exacerbation of what I see as a problem. It is reflected beyond the Public Service, of course. The casualisation of the work force has been identified many times in this place as being a bad thing. It seems to the Democrats that extending this period within which public servants can be employed on a temporary basis is a move in the wrong direction, so we will not be supporting this move.
	 Question put:
	 That the motion (Senator Ellison's ) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,1999-10-20,"—When I concluded my contribution last night, I was outlining to the Senate the facts in relation to the way in which this government has treated public education since 
 1996. Immediately upon taking up office, in its 1996 budget this government cut $350 million to public education and private schooling was deregulated. In 1997 equity programs were abandoned. In 1998, despite increased numbers in public schools, the enrolment benchmark adjustment took effect. That stole $11.9 million from public schools to pay for increased enrolments in private schools. In 1999 around $800 extra per child for private schools by the year 2003, and only around $100 extra for public schools, was injected into this country's education. Also, the enrolment benchmark adjustment takes a further $21 million from public schools.
In the last 3½ years we have seen $800 million in total lost from public education under the Howard government. When Prime Minister John Howard came to office, there was 54c in recurrent expenditure going to public schools for every dollar that went to a private school. It is now unbelievable and quite clearly a measure of injustice that this amount has been reduced to 42c, equalling a total loss of $800 million.
But some would argue that Minister Kemp has another agenda and that it has been revealed quite clearly in the last fortnight. In respect of his plan for higher education, we notice that, as of Monday, there is still on the table an attack on the unions within the education arena in higher education and that he continues that attack on unions in the public education arena. He explained in the Sydney Morning Herald on 13 May this year that the budget was `part of a wider strategy'. He went on to say the ability to support choice is, from the Commonwealth government's point of view, `a major driver for reform' in the government sector. The plan is to provide a competitive environment which will force the state education ministers to `push ahead with the reform process and stop being intimidated by unions'.
With that effect, I assume he is meaning the Australian Education Union or even the Independent Education Union. Again, he continues with his obsession about what he believes is a dominance by the trade union movement of the education sector, not only by the AEU but also by the NTU in the 
 higher education arena. That is a claim that, of course, cannot be legitimatised, given that this week there has been a negotiated settlement, for example, in the Northern Territory for a 10 per cent wage increase without, I declare, any intimidation by the unions and without any industrial action but with a concerted campaign of negotiation.
The equity concept has been abandoned. Equity programs targeted to assist the poorest and most disadvantaged of our children were established 20 years ago after a significant struggle by parents and teachers. The money, which totals $170 million, from these programs has been transferred to literacy support, an important priority, but it should not be at the expense of guaranteed support across all areas of need.
Public schools in this country struggle with a $2 billion deficit and are now seriously underfunded. Nationally, we face a deficit of at least $2 billion in that sector. The increased burden on parents and the community to make up the difference through voluntary contributions, such as fundraising and sponsorship, is clearly an unacceptable move on behalf of this government in respect of the way in which it treats public education.
Federal and state governments must accept the responsibility to fully fund public education. Federal and state ministers are responsible for $4.6 million missing from their budgets. In the early eighties Australia spent 3.6 per cent of GDP on schools; in 1995-96 Australian governments only spent 2.7 per cent, so we have seen over the years a decrease in the commitment of money that we actually spend on education. That flies in the face of us wanting to be a skilled country, a knowledgeable country, a country that can in fact contribute, through the learning outcomes of our people and workers, towards the economy and turnover.
Federal and state governments must accept, I believe, that investment in schools must increase dramatically, with the initial target being to meet the $2 billion. This can only be done in partnership, and therefore state and federal governments in particular should feel responsible for the absolute neglect we have seen in our public school system since 1996.
In finishing, I believe you should be left in no doubt as to why earlier this year parents and teachers launched a campaign to demand that this federal government, as a first step, put into the budget the $800 million that it has taken from public schools through a loss in parity over the past four years. In June this year, parents and teachers together launched a campaign titled, `Public school children deserve a fair share' with a press release jointly launched by the Australian Education Union's Federal President Sharan Burrow and Mr Ian Morgan, the President of ACSSO, which is the Australian Council of State School Organisations. Mr Morgan said, `Every coalition politician in Australia has a responsibility to deliver equitable, quality education to the whole of Australia.' He went on to say that he felt:
The 1999/2000 budget is an attack on public schools and a windfall for the private sector.
He said students in private schools would receive nearly $800 extra funding each on top of the government's already generous funding of the private sector.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-10-20,"—The Democrats will not oppose the bill that is before us today, the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1999 . However, we believe public schools will get very little out of the budget measures implemented by these amendments. These allocations for the year 2000 include $36.3 million for the National Literacy and Numeracy Plan and $26.4 million for the National Asian Languages and Studies in Australian Schools strategy. I note that these amounts are somewhat lower than the allocations set out in the May budget papers. In May NALSAS was to receive $30 million, so $3.6 million is somehow missing. The literacy initiatives were to receive $41 million, which means that a little under $5 million has gone. This is hardly surprising given Dr Kemp's habit of making funding figures look far more glamorous than they actually are and of disguising inflation and indexation as new additional funding.
The bill also provides for an extra $1.9 million in short-term emergency assistance for non-government schools, and this is to smooth 
 over difficulties experienced by disadvantaged schools in the transition to the new SES funding model. I will discuss that model a little later. Lastly, capital grants for non-government schools will be increased by $10.1 million to maintain them at the real levels prevailing from 1997 to 1999. I welcome the inclusion in the budget of national teacher professional development through the Quality Teacher Program, but I also note its absence in this bill.
We note that this is an emaciated version of the professional development program abolished in 1996. Teacher development is now valued at a total of $77 million over four years compared with $45 million every year between 1993 and 1996. It is funny that a government intent on withdrawing money from schools and blaming teachers for poor literacy outcomes should want to devote fewer resources to their development. Senator Carr has pointed out that only $15 million has been legislated for, but not the remaining $62 million for the following three years.
There is nothing in this states grants bill to address the needs of large numbers of alienated youth. There is nothing for learning difficulties. The impact of the Common Youth Allowance has been somewhat surprising. On the basis of the DETYA figures, schools groups anticipated an increase for Victoria of between 2,000 and 3,000 16- and 17-year-olds compelled to return to school in order to keep receiving the allowance. According to a recent survey by the Australian Education Union, 22 per cent of schools had unusual enrolment increases in 16- and 17-year-olds. The actual numbers of returning students were small.
These young people do exist: 15,000 exemptions were granted nationally in March this year. The reasons included substance abuse, learning difficulties, homelessness, incapacity, caring responsibilities, pre- and post-natal, and community service and juvenile justice orders. It appears that we have lost many young people well before they have turned 16 or 17.
It would have been a pleasant surprise to see some federal initiative on teacher shortages in this bill. I am told that the Queensland and Western Australian education departments 
 are trying to recruit teachers from Europe, the US and South Africa. This is certainly a turnaround from the responses that I received when I wrote to state ministers last year. They all denied that there was a problem. I eagerly await the forthcoming Preston report on teacher shortages. Unlike last year, this report has been compiled with the assistance of the states. Hopefully it will spur some federal action, too.
The section of this bill that allocates transitional funding to non-government schools in readiness for the new SES funding model should remind us that a sea change is about to occur in schools funding. It is the legislative debut of the SES model. In itself, this debut is of marginal importance—$1.9 million in transitional funding for the neediest non-government schools. While the Democrats have significant problems with this model, which has not yet been set, we will not be opposing this small allocation of money.
We are very fortunate that cabinet has rejected Dr Kemp's plan for deregulation of university fees and a voucher system. There was, quite rightly, a public outcry at Dr Kemp's ambitions for a two-tiered tertiary education system. Unfortunately, Dr Kemp has a similar free market revolution in mind for secondary schooling. Dr Kemp has remarked that he envisages a future `where distinctions between government and non-government schools will become outdated and increasingly irrelevant'. Yet the beginnings of this revolution have largely escaped the outcry that accompanied the elite blueprint for universities.
First, Dr Kemp introduced the Enrolment Benchmark Adjustment. The formula works by taking money away from the public system if the proportion of non-government enrolments rises in a given year. Even if the actual numbers of enrolments are rising in both sectors, money gets taken out of the public system. My calculations show that, between now and 2007, public schools stand to lose $121 million through the Enrolment Benchmark Adjustment.
But the new SES model threatens to trigger far larger losses to the public system. Non-government schools will be allowed to raise 
 any amount of money they like without this being taken into account when their level of funding is calculated. Elite schools will be treated no differently than the poorest Catholic schools. The government promised that no school, no matter how wealthy, would be worse off. In effect that means only a small percentage of schools will have their funding determined by the SES model. So much for a newer, fairer formula. The government has, from the word go, decided that the formula on its own is not good enough. The promise to the Catholic schools to fund them all at the former category 11 has no equity rationale at all as far as I can see. As we know, Catholic schools vary enormously in terms of the fees that they charge, their location and the socioeconomic status of students.
Dr Kemp's free market model is far from needs based, and the Democrats have a problem with this. We would rather see more money go to the neediest non-government schools instead of throwing more money at schools that are already wealthy. At many non-government schools, spending per student is something of the order of $13,000 per annum, including state and federal grants, fees and the like, whereas the cost for a secondary student in the public system is around $6,000—less than half the amount spent on moderately well-off private schools.
I am disappointed that the opposition have seen fit not to support our amendment to their second reading amendment condemning the government for quarantining wealthy schools from the needs based funding model. It is one thing to be cynical of Dr Kemp's literacy hoax and to call for increases in funding to government schools, but the ALP have completely nobbled themselves when it comes to attacking the heart of Dr Kemp's agenda, which is to prop up the private system at the expense of the public system. We are talking about fair distribution of funding within the non-government sector, and that will not happen under the government's SES model. How the ALP can ignore this equity question is beyond me. In the view of the Democrats, it is time for Dr Kemp to look at educational and outcome guarantees rather than affluence 
 guarantees—and I think that is what is represented in this legislation.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,1999-10-20,"—The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1999  proposes to implement some of the government's undertakings from the 1999-2000 budget. The measures provide additional spending of $36.3 million for the National Literacy and Numeracy Plan and for literacy improvement strategies for the middle years of schooling, and $26.4 million to extend funding for the National Asian Languages and Studies in Australian Schools strategy in the year 2000.
Other measures include $10.1 million annually for the years 2000-03 to maintain funding for the non-government component of capital gains programs at the same level as 1997-99 and to provide an additional $1.9 million for Short Term Emergency Assistance for 2000 to allow schools which are experiencing severe financial hardship or facing problems of viability to apply for STEA during the transitional period to the new SES funding for non-government schools, to make minor technical amendments to the headings in the act and to change the name of the literacy program to the Literacy and Numeracy Program. We support those measures; they are a very small contribution on the part of this government to an increase in education funding.
Measure that against the government's record on funding for education. In the almost four years they have been in office, they have slashed something in the order of $2 billion from education funding. These government cuts include: a total of $961.59 million taken out of higher education and university funding; a reduction in discretionary funding—$215 million; a reduction in operating grants to universities—$623.54 million; the phased abolition of the Commonwealth industry places scheme—$67.4 million; abolition of the Merit Based Equity Scholarships scheme—$38.9 million; and a reduction in the Higher Education Innovation Program—$16 million.
With regard to HECS, there have been increased charges in the differential rates, 
 removal of $313 million of federal funding and the lowering of the repayment threshold again, taking away $817 million from students—a total of $1,130.41 million. Other cuts include: vocational education and training—$242.47 million; student assistance in a range of measures that were previously in place—$536 million; the cessation of case management of secondary students on the homeless rate of Austudy and Abstudy—$14½ million in 1996; cessation of the schools incidental allowance for secondary students on the homeless rate of Austudy and Abstudy—$11 million in 1997; raising the age of independence for Austudy from 1 January 1997, which cut out $241 million; tightening of the means test, further reducing funding by $185 million; introduction of a two-year waiting period for Austudy for newly arrived migrants—$43.95 million; reduction in the maximum rent assistance payable to singles in shared accommodation, which took effect from 1 July 1997—$730,000; and a further saving in improved targeting. It is called improved targeting, but that is a matter for debate.
Against that, we know that this government, having slashed some $2 billion in funding for education, has a plan to further slash funding. We know that the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp, proposed to do a range of things in his cabinet submission, including the deregulation of fees in universities. We know what that would have cost because we have already seen the example of a Melbourne university that is already charging around $72,000 for degrees. We know that he proposed to introduce vouchers for use in public and private institutions and a loan scheme with commercial interest rates. We know the government was planning to do those things. The Prime Minister tried to say that was simply not true, but the fact of the matter is that a cabinet minister does not prepare a submission to cabinet without some discussion with his cabinet colleagues. He has apparently gone through a process where there have been a number of discussions to develop this submission to the point where it would have become reality. 
The very reason the Australian public should not trust the government is that we have seen on a number of occasions already when they have said they would not do certain things—we had the never-ever GST but we have got that, and that is a further impost for people in the education system—they have turned around and done exactly the opposite. This submission to cabinet is a plain example of that.
The minister, Dr Kemp, would also have us believe that, somehow, he discovered literacy and numeracy; nobody else had ever done anything about that before he arrived on the scene—he is the sole crusader for literacy in Australia. The fact of the matter is that in 1994 Labor in government set up a literacy survey under the Working Nation plan. That was the first national survey in schools to collect data on how children in years 3 and 5 were performing in the key areas of reading and writing. The study was called the National Schools English Literacy Survey. We provided some $17 million in 1995-96 for the Early Literacy program.
The states have also undertaken their own initiatives both individually and collectively to provide for adequate literacy levels among schoolchildren. The Commonwealth, state and territory education ministers agreed to a national literacy goal in March 1997. The goal was to ensure that appropriate steps were taken to provide every child leaving primary school with adequate numeracy and literacy levels. The interesting thing about this is that the minister's own state colleagues did not include him in the process. His own state Liberal colleagues—and this is back in 1997—in Victoria, Tasmania and Queensland went out of their way to distance themselves and called on him to cease his political stunt. His comments on 60 Minutes, even though they were in 1997, showed that he tried to score a political point from the work of others. Anyone who follows this issue would know about Dr Kemp's attempts to mislead Australian parents about literacy levels by shamelessly manipulating the results of the National Schools English Literacy Survey. Of course, this was recently covered by Four Corners. On that program, the now former 
 minister for education in Victoria, Mr Phil Gude, said of Dr Kemp that he was deliberately and mischievously `manipulating data to portray literacy levels at a perilous level'.
One of the other measures in this bill is the extension of funding for the National Asian Languages and Studies in Australian Schools strategies. This was one of our initiatives when we were in government. This is a program that we instigated, and this minister is trying to take the credit for it. Again, we support the measures proposed in the bill, because it is a very small improvement in terms of funding for education. But, as I said before, this government has severely slashed funding over the course of its almost four years in government and had planned to do that even further.
I suppose when you analyse that in terms of a commitment to education, we really need to look at what we are actually spending on education in terms of a percentage of gross domestic product. Since this government has been in power it has declined. When we were last in government, spending on education was around three per cent of GDP; it is now down to 2.3 per cent. Of course, the government would try to convince us that, somehow, it has provided for more university places and that things are all rosy and are being improved, but the reality is entirely different. I suspect the minister and the Prime Minister certainly saw that with the reaction they got when the leaked cabinet submission hit the deck. The students, the parents of students and the parents of potential students are certainly not very happy, and I guess that that is the only reason the Prime Minister, being the person that he is, said that Dr Kemp's cabinet submission was not going to become a reality.
But the leopard never changes his spots. This Prime Minister gave commitments to the public of Australia about other things and then turned around after elections and did exactly the opposite. This is not unlike what we have seen in another area, where we have a minister in this place dealing with welfare issues who also does not have a cabinet submission, I do not think—although we may find that out ultimately—but at least has some 
 hidden green paper about welfare. I suspect what they plan to do for the future. That should be of great concern to the Australian public, because they have done nothing really to develop initiatives to help either poor people or improve the education standards of this country.
Whilst we get all of the rhetoric from the Prime Minister—and it is rhetoric that should be backed up by action and support—it is important to this country that education is supported, because it is from that base that we provide for the future. We do have to be a smarter country, and therefore it is important that we have the right sort of investment and the right levels of investment in education in the future to ensure that we stay ahead of the game. As we go down the road of globalisation of the economies of various countries and we move into the era of a greater and freer trade system, it is important, because we are a small country in terms of population, to maximise the opportunities that we have. Education and the provision of education services is one of them.
In developing our technologies, et cetera, we need to ensure that the people who go through the education system have the right support and the right opportunities provided to them. We cannot continue to rely on the things that we have in the past. That is a fact. We have to be smarter. We have to go more into manufacturing and, again, this is another area where this government has failed dismally. We just have not had the right initiative and the right drive from this government in heading the country in the direction it ought to be going, in terms of the population size that we have to compete in the world marketplace. If we do not do that, if we do not see some turnaround in that, then we are going to confront major problems.
As I said, despite the claims of the government, expenditure on education is now down to 2.3 per cent and going down—and the plan was to make it go down even further. How does that sit with the need for us to improve our education system? If we look at some of the other areas in the government's 1999-2000 budget, there is an equity issue in the funding for public schools—the schools that 
 cater for the less well off—versus the funding for private schools. The government increased funding for private schools, and there is nothing wrong with that, but they gave nothing to the schools that almost 70 per cent of children attend. That is the problem. If you are going to give funding for schools, then you ought to give it equitably. Private schools received an increase of $210 a year per student, which is 21 times greater than what is received per student by public schools. As I said before, the 1999 budget abolished the merit based equity scholarships for university students from poorer families, rural families and families of non-English speaking backgrounds. Where do we stand in providing opportunities to go to university for those people who are less well off or who are isolated?
In May this year, just before the budget, the Prime Minister did an interview with Neil Mitchell on Radio 3AW. He was asked, `What sort of budget will it be?' and the Prime Minister answered:
I think very much a budget about the education future of this country. I think you will find quite a bit in it about education.
We did, but it was not good for education. He went on to say:
I think it will be a theme that will be very good for education and what I might call the future intellectual capital of this country.
If that is the sort of investment you are going to make in the future intellectual capital of this country, you would not want the Prime Minister making other investments for you, because you would not do too well.
Then we come back to Dr Kemp's cabinet submission. That really points out what sort of investment we are going to make in the future intellectual capital of this country. We are going to make it even tougher for people, particularly those who are less well off, to get an education. For example, the American universities Yale and Stanford charge fees of around $A37,000 a year, while a private university in Melbourne has just announced the introduction of a two-year post-graduate law course at a cost of $72,000. That is just a forerunner to what we could expect to see under Dr Kemp's new regime—the education 
 reform that he says is essential. It is very clear from the leaked cabinet submission what Dr Kemp intended for education in the future of this country. Under the heading `Imperatives for Reform' it states:
The government has committed itself to education being a major theme of its second term.
It states further:
Good education policies will have major benefits in terms of jobs, wealth creation, social inclusion, cultural dynamism and intellectual creativity.
I do not know how we are going to get that if we are talking about a significant further reduction in funding—and that is on top of the $2 billion that we have already had.
While we are supporting some of the measures in this bill, we condemn the government very seriously for the cuts they have made to the education system of this country. They have made it more difficult for people to get an education, and it is going be more difficult in the future for people to get an education and to assist this country to become the smarter nation we need to be to compete in world terms.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Quirke, Sen John",ALP,1999-10-20,"—I would like to make a couple of comments about literacy, but, before I do, I want to say that I think the argument about who is getting what in terms of the education cake is an important one and it needs to by fully investigated. It is an argument where the various competing influences in the private and state school systems can argue with each other and through government for adequate resources to perform the jobs they do in the mixed education community that we have.
Some people might say that I come to this with either clean hands or dirty hands, depending on which side you come from, having taught in both state and private school systems for 13½ years—and I spent a bit of time in the TAFE system too.
—A very good system.
—I do not know whether I have told Senator Carr that, but any time he has interjected about TAFE I have supported him fully.
But I have to say this: in essence, one of the problems with Australian education and 
 the provision of education in this country is that the outcome at the other end sometimes is disappointing. I think it is disappointing because what you find is that governments are prepared to fund education to a certain level. They will fund 80 or 90 per cent of that education budget, but they will not fund what is necessary to address some of the obvious problems, and those are, primarily, literacy and numeracy.
I send my kids to state schools. I must say they get a good education; I am satisfied with the school they go to. One is in kindy and next year will go to the same school that the other two go to. The school provides a good balanced educational service. The problem is that, when it comes down to actually finding the dollars to help with some of the literacy issues, that school unfortunately is reduced to the level of being a pauper. It is in a basically poor area and, as a consequence of that, it needs added resources.
The way this is done in my state, and I am sure it is the same in most other states, is that schools go out and, through various fundraising activities and other sometimes more entrepreneurial activities, raise several thousands of dollars every couple of months. In some instances, some of the state schools in the more affluent suburbs raise tens of thousands of dollars every couple of months, and in fact add to whatever the education program is by soaking the parents and the local community out of moneys. Really, in essence, we are paying our taxes to achieve these outcomes and using these resources so that our kids can get the necessary programs.
In the school that my kids go to, there is firm competition amongst a lot of students for very meagre resources. Those resources are provided by the state and the school. They are provided to teach kids better literacy, to bring in programs and to provide teacher time—sometimes one on one, sometimes one to a group of kids. For a child to actually get onto this program, a whole number of steps have to be gone through. It is the case that, at the end of all these steps, the funding is not necessarily secure. There are a few other problems which have nothing to do with this minister and this government. They are to do 
 with the state government in South Australia—and I am sure it is the same in some of the other states—and how they address these problems or, in fact, do not address these problems.
Senator Murphy said that the first national literacy standard in this country was carried out in 1994. If that is correct—and I am sure Senator Murphy is right—then I am absolutely shocked at that. If I went to similar OECD countries, I would find that we are 20 years or more behind on that particular issue. I think if we were to assess adequately the outcome at the end of primary school, we would find that we would be lagging well behind other OECD countries. I think one of the problems with this is that it is a bit like going down to the car yard and buying a nice new car without a radio, a heater, doorhandles or anything else. We provide a large amount of money for education, but then we do not take the extra couple of steps to provide a bit more to help in some of the areas, particularly in respect of some of the students who need that assistance.
I know that about six years ago in South Australia schools in Elizabeth—we called it the peachy road belt—raised by their own voluntary means about $1,800 a year. That is all they could raise from parents and friends who would come to the many gala days and whatever other activities they held in their communities. In the area that I represented at that time, as the state member for Playford, the average amount raised was somewhere between $6,000 and $8,000, so it was a more affluent area. But when I then went into the eastern suburbs, I found that some of the schools there were getting $50,000, and that was not an unrealistic figure at all. So, naturally, in the eastern suburbs, where literacy was less of a problem because of the educational level of parents, I found that the bulk of the resources that was being raised voluntarily was going in precisely the areas where it should not have been going.
Governments, both state and federal, will probably come back to me and say that they had the PEP program, this program or that program, but at the end of the day they only ever covered a small proportion of what the 
 real need was. So far I have talked only about primary education; I am going to talk about secondary education in just a minute. I think what is required is an adequate level of funding to take us to the next step. One would suggest that some of the private schools already have an adequate level of funding to achieve this and other goals. It is certainly true that in South Australia, the Pulteney Grammar School, in particular, has an excellent program for the first couple years of schooling to make sure that those children who are not picking up the literacy and numeracy standards are identified and in fact catered for and the outcomes are very good.
Of course, Pulteney Grammar is one of Adelaide's best schools; it is also one of the most expensive. I see the Acting Deputy President disagrees with me; I know he is an old Scotch boy. I do not know very much about Scotch but, having being a graduate of Elizabeth High School, I must say that what I know about these schools is what I have picked up over the years both since I left teaching and professionally when I did teach in both systems. But not every private school is in the same category as Pulteney Grammar School. There are a large number of private schools—I think in my day when the funding formula was different to what it is today they were category D and E schools—at least in South Australia. That meant there was a struggle: a struggle for parents to meet those fees and a struggle for the school to even survive. In fact, in many of these schools the class sizes were actually larger than they were in the state schools further down the road and the level of resources was considerably less.
The level of education and what we achieve are going to determine what we will be in the 21st century. It is a national problem. It needs to be addressed not only at the state government level but at the national government level. We need to make sure that we get the best possible outcomes for our money and that they match those of our OECD partners.
We need to make sure that two premises are followed in respect of primary school literacy, numeracy and other programs. The first is that we have an adequate level of funding to address the problem. That certainly is not the 
 case anymore. If it ever was the case—and I doubt that—it certainly is not now. The other very important premise is that we need to put the money where the problems are. I suspect that has been poorly directed. Despite all of the equity programs that I have seen, very few of them seem to work very well. Very few of them seem to target real need because, in essence, not only do you have very poor schools but you also have some very poor students in some of the more affluent areas, particularly in some of the more affluent areas that I could name here now in the capital cities and in regional Australia as well. As a consequence of that, an adequate level and support of resources for literacy and numeracy programs in particular in our schools is long overdue.
I want to make a point in terms of secondary education. I will not take long on this because I have raised this matter here before. In my home state there is talk of actually bringing back the teaching of history in schools. It disappeared because education departments and their bureaucracies found it easier to use words such as `society and environment', `social sciences' and `social studies'. Many years ago a bureaucrat said to me, `Look, John, it is like this: you can call it that and then you can shove up any teacher you have got spare at that time who has done anything in that area—who has done anything at all, even a science graduate—and they can entertain the masses for the necessary 40-minute lesson block.' That is what has happened and we have paid a price for that.
We have also paid a price for the fact that we do not concentrate on English and some of the humanities that require accurate language skills. That accuracy of language skills traverses the whole range of professional development in this country. If people cannot read and write properly or at a sufficiently adequate level to enable them to carry out their jobs, then it impacts on their particular life and, more importantly, it takes from the skills that are desperately required in a whole range of different endeavours in our economy. Obviously, a person with ability to write good, precise English argument is an essential person in a whole range of different profes 
 sions in this country. That is never more so than in the 21st century. Yet, in secondary schools there was a greater concentration 20 years ago than there is today on courses which taught those disciplines in my home state, and I know it is the same in other states.
The sequential development of literacy skills in secondary education is essential. The teaching of English, the teaching of history and even the teaching of other related disciplines that require precise written argumentation and the development of that skill have been under assault over about the last 20 years. I would hope that that is reversed. That is also a national problem that needs to be addressed and needs resources to address it. It also requires education authorities to see the problems and do something about them, and not just go along with fashionable developments that may suit them in the short run.
This  States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1999  is about satisfying the government's desire to put a level of resource that they feel comfortable with into primary and secondary education in this country. It is not enough. The measurement of outcomes is not adequate and I think some national priorities and some national perspectives on this need to be discussed with the various state education agencies. Even with just some discussion we could get some better outcomes than we have had. This bill is an admission in a sense that we are making very slow progress. We need to make much more dramatic progress into the next century. In particular, the minister has made a number of comments particularly about literacy in this country. If he is serious, he has to see that as a whole-of-school education problem. He has to put the resources in there. He has to achieve some of the goals that I think are necessary to establish some of the benchmarks and to go out there and make sure that we are getting the very best for the dollars that we are spending.
Amendment (by Senator Allison) proposed:
At the end of the amendment, add:
""; and (c)	  selectively applying its new funding formula for non-government schools with the result that the wealthiest 
 private schools will be quarantined from any reduction in Commonwealth funding"".",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-10-20,"—We cannot support the amendment that the Democrats have moved to my second reading amendment. I indicate to the Senate that the opposition has expressed its very grave concern about the declining level of real funding support going to public education in this country. We have said that the brochures that were distributed by Dr Kemp this year to every school in this country—which claimed that direct funding for government schools between 1996-2000 has risen by 25 per cent or $382 million—were completely untrue.
What we said was that, if you consider the effect of cost increases since 1996, cost increases have been in the order of 12 per cent, and enrolments in schools have increased. So if you consider the amount of money that is spent against the number of people it is spent on and the effect that that money actually has in the marketplace given the rising cost of schooling, you find that the increase in government expenditure is about 100th of what Dr Kemp was claiming in the letters he sent to parents in this country. I have indicated in my second reading contribution that I will expect an explanation from the government as to how much money was actually spent on those propaganda brochures.
Dr Kemp's claim, when examined closely, indicates that only $1.50 extra is being spent on students. But if you look at it in real terms—that is, what the money actually does—then the Commonwealth funding per government school student has declined. The calculations that I have presented to the Senate suggest to me that the funding has fallen from $606 per student in 1996 to less than $598 four years later. When you look at the government's figures and get away from the glossy propaganda efforts of this government, you see that the real situation is very different for ordinary Australians, for parents who are trying to meet the costs of educating their children at government schools. The government talks about the moneys it pays to the states, and when we look at the amount of money paid in general assistance grants, here too there are no real increases in funding. The 
 government's propaganda efforts should be exposed for the sham that they are.
Senator Allison's amendment, however, does not fix that problem. What Senator Allison's amendment relates to is a detail of a bill that is in fact not before the parliament. When we do see that bill, we will of course give a full- throated response. I see that Mr Evans is in the advisers' box today; I look forward to discussing these matters in detail with him at the estimates hearings.
In the meantime, we simply make the point that the government should be condemned for not providing an increase in government school funding which actually corresponds with the increases that they have made to the non-government sector. On the information that is in fact available to us, it probably will not be until April next year that we will see this bill that is implementing the government's major changes to school funding. So I think there is a need to examine the changes that are supposed to begin in 2001. I can guarantee the minister right now that, when he does introduce that bill, there will be a major Senate inquiry into such a fundamental change. I notice that the department officials are obviously looking forward to the prospect. I am sure that we will be able to provide them with plenty of opportunity to justify this government's decisions and to explain the gross inadequacies and inequities of this government's policies.
Schools will need time to adjust to the new arrangements. In that context, funding stability is important to them. The current funding quadrennium ends in December next year, so now that five months have passed since the budget announcement, the minister should seek to stop working on this ideological agenda in terms of higher education that has been handled so appallingly, and he should now start to focus on the more practical issues of getting the schools legislation into the parliament in time for this chamber to consider the government's proposals seriously and allow us to debate them fully.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-10-20,"—The government opposes this further amendment to the second reading motion. It does so on 
 the basis that this amendment moved by the Democrats talks about the new method of funding for non-government schools. The government has not yet introduced legislation which deals with this, and it is I think more appropriate that any debate in the Senate be dealt with once the government's legislation is known.
I point out to the Senate that this new method of funding—the SES method of funding, as it is commonly known—will not take effect until 2001. That is some two years away. I am not saying that there should not be public debate about it. What I am saying is that this amendment is really focusing on the bill which we are dealing with today—the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1999 —which has nothing to do with that proposed method of funding for non-government schools. Therefore, the amendment is really out of place. It is premature, it is irrelevant to this bill, and I will also say that the content of it is incorrect. There is no selective applying of funding with the result that the wealthiest private schools will be quarantined from any reduction as such. The method of funding is a much broader proposal than that. I think that for the Democrats to put it that way is really quite misleading. The government opposes this amendment for all those reasons—
—So you support mine?
—I might add that we do not support Senator Carr's amendment. Having dealt with the amendment by the Democrats, I will now respond to speeches made during the second reading debate. I thank senators for their contributions and will perhaps refer to Senator Quirke's contribution first. Senator Quirke said that he came to this chamber with clean or dirty hands depending on which side you came from, indicating that he had taught in both the non-government and government sectors. The government does not accept that you would have dirty hands teaching in either of those sectors. The government would say that Senator Quirke, having been a teacher in either of those sectors, comes to the Senate with clean hands.
I have met many teachers in both the government and non-government sectors who are very good teachers. Those two sectors the government supports. The government wants a strong government sector and a strong non-government sector. We do not look upon it as being one versus the other, although there are some in the opposition who no doubt do. Senator Carr might advance that argument in the committee stage. The government certainly does not look upon those two sectors as being adverse to each other or in competition with each other or that one is right and one is wrong. Both are essential to the furtherance of good education in this country and the government supports both of those sectors strongly.
In relation to Senator Quirke's concerns about how Australian students achieve satisfactory outcomes, the Commonwealth government, with state governments, has agreed to participate in the OECD program of international student assessment, where there will be international comparisons in relation to the outcome of students in such things as literacy and numeracy. That is a very important step. For those senators who criticise the government's proposals and reforms in relation to literacy can I say this: never before in the history of this country has there been such an advance in the areas of literacy and numeracy as there has been in the last three years. We have seen for the first time ever in the history of Australia the implementation of national benchmarks in years 3 and 5 for literacy. We are looking at a completely cooperative approach from state, territory and federal governments to the question of literacy.
A survey was conducted which revealed that there was an unacceptably high level of Australian students who did not have appropriate skills in literacy and numeracy. When travelling around Australia visiting schools when I was the minister responsible for schools, the government's efforts in relation to literacy were endorsed overwhelmingly wherever I went. You need go no further than Australian parents to realise how high a value they place on Australian students having high levels of literacy. I say that to those senators 
 who criticise the government's approach to the question of literacy.
Senator Allison mentioned that we needed to equip teachers with the skills to carry out the government's programs and that the government had in some way neglected teachers. The government in its quality teacher program has committed to $77.7 million over four years for professional development. The appropriation of that is being dealt with in the same way as the previous Labor government, that is, by virtue of an appropriation bill which, as I understand it, has some $15 million set aside. But that does not mean that we are stepping back from the promise that we made to the people of Australia when we went to the federal election last year. What we are appropriating is entirely in accordance with our program of over $77 million over four years for the professional development of teachers.
This is a very important point. Whilst we as a government have introduced these reforms, at the same time we have to equip Australian teachers with the ability, with the professional development, to deliver on those reforms and to assist them in how they go about their professional duties. I reject emphatically that in any way we have stepped back from that undertaking, that commitment. This $15 million is just a step forward in the overall funding of over $77 million in that regard.
Senator Carr criticised the government's method of funding. I reiterate that the way we are doing this is no different to how the Labor government appropriated moneys in relation to a similar program. There has been criticism of the amounts of funding in these bills. I think it was Senator Allison who said that the amounts referred to were less than in the budget. What we have here is $38.3 million for the year 2000 to increase funding under the literacy and numeracy programs. We will introduce supplementation subsequent to these bills which will take that to the figures mentioned in the budget. Similarly, we have $27.9 million for NALSAS, National Asian Languages and Studies in Australian Schools, and again there will be supplementation in relation to that.
What the government is saying is that there is no diminution of funding here. We have simply got these amounts that we have mentioned in these bills and then supplementation will be forthcoming which will take those amounts to the levels that were mentioned in the budget. There is really nothing untoward in that. There is a process which has been used by this and other governments and it is entirely in accordance with standing practice. I just want to make that very clear for the record.
Senator Crossin mentioned the proposed funding model for non-government schools. Again I would say to the Senate that Senator Crossin is talking about a program which, as I mentioned earlier in relation to Senator Allison's amendment, is going to come into play in the year 2001. The government is yet to introduce legislation in relation to that. There has been widespread public debate and consultation on that funding proposal and no doubt there will be further public debate, especially when the government's legislation comes forward, but this is not the bill which is relevant to that. This bill does not deal with that SES funding model. Senator Crossin's comments are in the same category as the amendment pressed for by Senator Allison—that is, irrelevant to this bill and somewhat premature.
The question of funding has been raised by senators in the chamber. The government stands by its statement that between the years 1996 and 2000 there has been a 25 per cent increase in direct funding to government schools. This equates to some $382 million. Senator Carr continues to disregard the additional moneys provided through enrolment growth and the payment of supplementation on grants and which represents significant extra funding for government schools each year. In 1999, Commonwealth recurrent supplementation to government schools will increase by 5.5 per cent. This is a very important figure to remember. This supplementation in 1999 will increase by 5.5 per cent. This is well ahead of the CPI which, in 1998-99, was only 1.2 per cent. That reveals an excess in supplementation of 4.3 per cent, which Senator Carr fails to recognise.
It is also important for the record that we clarify the real situation in relation to our financial assistance grants. Senator Carr disputes a reference in the government schools flyers, which he mentioned earlier, to a three per cent real increase in these grants to state schools and the capacity they have to apply some of this increase to government schools. In 1996, state and territory governments agreed to enter into state fiscal contribution agreements with the Commonwealth for a period of three years. Some states contributed from their financial assistance grants payments while other states contributed through a reduction in a variety of non-educational programs or through their own revenue raising. There is no evidence to suggest that any state reduced funding to education and training as a result of these agreements.
In 1998-99, we saw the final year that the states were required to repay the state fiscal contribution. When this is taken into account, there is a three per cent real increase in financial assistance grants between the years 1998 and 2000. That might seem somewhat complex but it has an important effect, and the important effect is a three per cent increase in those financial assistance grants which are so important to the various state governments. That entirely negates the point that Senator Carr tries to make in relation to any reduction in funding by this government. This government has an excellent record on education funding. As I mentioned earlier, this government has seen reforms in education—literacy and numeracy being two of a few.
In this bill we see further funding for National Asian Languages and Studies in Australian Schools—something which I found to be very popular in all the schools that I visited. As we know, Australia is situated in South-East Asia. This is a very important program for the future of the up-and-coming generation of Australians and also for Australia. Asian languages and studies not only promote harmony within Australia in terms of our diverse cultural background but also, importantly, give Australian students, Australian leaders of the future, an ability to communicate with our Asian neighbours in their 
 own language and to develop an understanding of their customs and cultures.
Turning to literacy: as I mentioned earlier, we have seen unprecedented cooperation between the various governments of the states and territories and the Commonwealth. This has led to a situation where, at long last, we have a standard gauge across Australia on literacy. It is now the foundation for this country to go forward in building a program for the future for the development of literacy across the nation. We are also doing the same with numeracy. The opposition and other senators might want to pick up on what various state ministers have said about the Commonwealth's reforms, but I would ask the Senate and the community at large: if these governments are so critical of us, why did they adopt our proposals? Why did they join with the Commonwealth government in advancing literacy and numeracy in Australian schools? They did that because they could see there was a need for it and the community wanted it done. That is what we have seen happen.
The second reading amendment moved by Senator Carr is one which completely misunderstands the Commonwealth's reforms in relation to literacy. It attempts to make a political point where none is really worth while. It cheapens, or attempts to cheapen, something that is a thoroughly worthwhile program for Australian students. To suggest that this government has pursued literacy in a cynical fashion is to cheapen the reform which has been adopted across Australia by parents, teachers, government and non-government sectors and also state and territory governments.
The second part of the motion talks about failing to provide government schools with additional resources. I stand by my previous comments in relation to the increase in funding by this government. This government stands on its record of having increased opportunities and funding for government schools. That is on the record, and Senator Carr cannot run away from it. All the amendments he might want to move in this chamber will not change the good work the government has done in relation to education.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-10-20,"—I move:
At the end of the motion, add ""but the Senate:
	 (a)	 notes that the quality of Australian education institutions is of prime importance to our future, both economically and culturally; and
	 (b)	 condemns the Government for damaging the quality of Australian education by:
		 (i)	 punitive cuts to universities;
		 (ii)	 a lack of commitment to equity issues; and  

		 (iii)	 mismanagement of the education export industry"".
This bill sets the maximum amounts for operating and other grants to the higher education institutions by varying the amounts already legislated under the Higher Education Funding Act 1998 for 1999-2000 and inserts an amount for 2001. It sets the maximum funding level for expenditure on international marketing and promotion of Australian education and training services by Australian Education International for the 2001 funding year. It seeks to amend HEFA to make provision for funding 60 medical places at James Cook University for 2001, and it seeks to provide funding for science lectureships of $14.7 million and research infrastructure of $73.6 million. These are initiatives which were announced in the budget.
The debate on this bill could not have been more timely. I have no doubt that the minister welcomes the opportunity to canvass these issues this particular week. Last week, Dr Kemp's true agenda was made public. Stripped of its rhetoric, doubletalk and all the spin doctoring that one has come to expect from Dr Kemp, a pattern of deceit has emerged from the propaganda machine that he has developed. Dr Kemp's submission was revealed last week, bare for all to see, and what an ugly sight it was.
Having starved universities of funds since the savage $840 million cuts in 1996—and of course all the additional cuts, which I will deal with later on—Dr Kemp's ideological plan is to deregulate the system and to turn higher education in this country into a commercially-driven market free-for-all. Dr Kemp has been obliged to admit in that submission that he and his policies have led to a crisis in higher education—a crisis very much of his own creation. What he has been obliged to admit, but what he will not say publicly, is that `demand for higher education in Queensland, New South Wales, Western Australia and Victoria is unlikely to be met'. That is a direct quote from the submission. The submission also states that there is `no capacity to reduce huge regional disparities in . . . participation', and that people from `affluent capital city suburbs are five times more likely 
 to go to university' than people from the least affluent areas. It states that `universities are currently in a difficult financial position.'
His own cabinet submission admits that `already, eight institutions appear to be operating at a deficit and some regional campuses are at risk'. He indicates that there are `higher student-staff ratios and less frequent lecture and tutorial contact'. He says that universities have outdated technology and, as a result, universities are `progressively less capable of delivering what government wants, industry needs and the community expects'. As a result of this, Dr Kemp, in his own words, tells us that `there is a perception of declining quality'.
I expect, when the government have read this submission again and refreshed their memories of what their minister was saying, that they will be only too happy to vote for our second reading amendment. I expect every member of the government to rush over here and support that amendment because they know the truth of it. The truth of it is demonstrated by the fact that the government minister, Dr Kemp, has revealed the truth in his own cabinet submission.
—We'll join you over there.
—I see Senator Abetz is here yet again. I would have thought that Senator Abetz would have learned something from his recent performances in this chamber and have been obliged to keep himself a little under control. I expect Senator Abetz to join with the opposition and support us in our second reading amendment.
What we see is a dismal list of woes. We note from Dr Kemp's own documents that there is a perception of declining quality. There is no clearer indication of the truth of this than that he presents this information to his colleagues, presumably in secret—he had no expectation that such opinions would be revealed. What he seeks to do after creating a crisis is to exploit that crisis, and he then suggests that the solution is deregulation of fees. He seeks to propose a university tuition subsidy which follows the student—by any other name, a voucher. He seeks that there be no guaranteed minimum amount of funding for institutions. He also seeks to have another 
 bash at universities, which are struggling thanks to his own starvation policies, and he seeks to propose a student loan scheme with a real rate of interest.
Of course, the government claims that all that is off the agenda: `No, sorry. Sorry, we didn't mean any of that. Having been caught red-handed, we don't really mean it any more.' This is despite the fact that this is the second time that such propositions have been before the cabinet this year. So how could anyone possibly believe the denials that this government issues on a regular basis? From what we have before us, it is clear that this government's interest in education—particularly the sorts of policies that Dr Kemp has been pursuing—is predicated on assumptions which will see a return to policies of the 1950s. He sees this as a modernising process: his idea of modernisation is to return to the fifties. We will see a situation where fewer and fewer people of modest backgrounds will be able to attend university, and universities will be places for the wealthy and the privileged. He seeks to establish a new set of arrangements which return to a system of administration in universities for the privileged few. The big eight universities will do very well; the rest of the universities will be reduced in status and some may not be able to continue at all.
We see that those who thought that John Howard's code of ministerial conduct was meant to mean something can now see for themselves that it means very little indeed. We were told that governments were supposed to be frank and honest. But we have noticed that there can be no frankness and no honesty from this government when we see the propositions revealed in that cabinet submission, which demonstrate that what they are saying in private and what they are saying in public are two different things altogether. So when Dr Kemp says that there will be no vouchers—yet he uses the terms that are used in that cabinet submission—you can clearly see that this is a situation in which, to quote the Bard, `a rose by any other name would smell as sweet'. I would say that a `universal subsidy which follows the student' smells just as bad as a voucher.
That is the government's policy, despite the claims that are made when they are caught. That has been the government's secret policy since their election. I have absolutely no doubt that they will pursue that policy because it is predicated on an ideological obsession—an ideological obsession that Dr Kemp and the Prime Minister happen to have. They happen to believe that, if you have a position of privilege and power, you should be able to exploit the resources available in this country to entrench that privilege and power. We see that Dr Kemp and the Prime Minister are chained together by what I regard as a bond of mutual deceit and dishonesty. The true intent of the government has been revealed to the public. Of course, the government has sought to rule out these various scams once they are revealed, but the truth remains that this government developed a cabinet submission on the direction of cabinet itself. As it was with the GST and as we have seen with Senator Newman and her changes to the social security system, when governments claim they are not doing things, you cannot for a moment believe them under this regime.
What we see before us is that the government have presented a whole series of problems but would appear to have no solutions for them. That is what we are expected to take on face value—that the government acknowledge that there is a crisis but they do not have any solution to that crisis. We see, however, one final thing remaining of that original package, one final thing remaining in terms of their public admissions: that is, they plan to introduce sweeping industrial relations reforms to the higher education sector to do over the workers in universities in order to balance the books. So what we have noticed is a re-run; the proposal is a re-run of the waterfront dispute, but this time with the universities instead of the docks. This is a plan to make workers in universities pay and pay and then pay some more for the government's policy disaster. They seek to predicate this on the fundamental premise of coercion—which, of course, we were told was illegal under their Workplace Relations Act. They are seeking legal advice to get around their own act—and that is revealed in clause 
 32 of the cabinet submission. We are looking forward to seeing that legal advice, because I am sure it will be contested in the courts as the government seeks to pursue this policy, this ideological obsession.
In the past the government have said that their concerns are demonstrated by their merit based equity scholarship scheme—which the government are now seeking to remove. After cutting six per cent from the universities' operating grants, increasing HECS charges by up to 125 per cent, lowering the repayments threshold to around $21,000, abolishing the Commonwealth-industry places scheme and slashing half a billion dollars from student assistance, any reasonable person would say that the Commonwealth education ministers might not be able to sustain a case that they are interested in equity. Any reasonable person would suggest that enough damage has already been inflicted in this portfolio. Any reasonable person would also suggest that it is time for Dr Kemp to go. They would suggest that his slashing of a further $39 million by the abolition of the merit based equity scholarship scheme is totally unjustified.
I would suggest that this government is predicating its education policies on a premise that it can in fact proceed to produce fewer opportunities for young Australians. The opportunities that remain will of course go to those with the greatest capacity to pay. That is what they mean by user pays: if you have got enough money, you take advantage of opportunities that are presented.
The merit based scholarship scheme was only a tiny token offered by the government in its 1996 cuts to the higher education budgets. This minor concession to the needs of students who were locked out of the university as a result of its changes to HECS is now being withdrawn as well. This government constantly talks about increased moneys available for higher education. Yet again we have the pea and thimble trick being presented by this minister. We have seen student income support cut by $500 million. We have seen HECS payments charges increased by $313 million. We have seen the lowering of the repayment threshold to many thousands of 
 dollars below average weekly earnings, taking a further $817 million from students and graduates. When Senator Vanstone announced the merit based equity scholarship scheme, she told us:
The facts are that if you come from a socio-economically disadvantaged background or a rural or geographically remote area, your chances of going to university are less than if you come from a high status background and live in an urban area . . . 
These measures are aimed at bringing higher education within the reach of ordinary Australians. They are a practical demonstration of the Government's real commitment to fairness and equity in higher education.
What a joke. What a complete joke. One thousand scholarships were offered in 1997, building to a pool of 4,000 in 1999. The scheme has scarcely begun and we now see it being axed. This followed the so-called sounding out of the effectiveness of the scheme which was carried out by DETYA in what can only be described as another bodgie survey. They involved university equity officers being asked via email for their views on the scheme, in such a way that it could be easily assumed that the government was seeking to improve and enhance the scheme rather than axe it.
This is the whole problem when you are dealing with this government. You have to be very careful in appreciating what the intention of the government really is, because it is usually not the intention that they say. There were 19 equity officers who responded to the suggestion that by providing a grant at the time of the study rather than a HECS exemption the scheme could be improved and financially disadvantaged students could be retained in the universities. Instead of using this amount of money in the ways suggested by the survey, the government has used the findings to abolish the scheme. This is a further demonstration of the government's lack of any real commitment to equity. Opportunity and access are the casualties along the Howard government's road to user pays in education.
Let me turn to Australian Education International. I am sure that this will be a matter that I will have to pursue in the committee stage of the bill. It is a matter of great con 
 cern to me. This bill provides funding to the end of 2001 for Australian Education International, whose job is to promote Australian education world wide. It was originally set up in 1994 under the name of the Australian International Education Foundation. The AEI is fully funded by government and it represents all sections of the industry—schools, ELICOS, TAFE, and private training providers in the higher education institutions. The government's management—and I say there is very strong evidence of mismanagement—of our education export industry has been the focus of a good deal of attention in recent times and I can assure this government it will be the focus of a great deal more attention in the times ahead.
We have seen this government being obliged to move back onto the back foot because it is quite clearly unable to react effectively to the developments that are occurring within this industry. It should be anticipating them. It should not be forced to respond to the opposition in the way it is. It should be ahead of the game. Given the resources that are available to government, one could expect it to at least have some knowledge of the developments in this industry and be able to move ahead to anticipate actions rather than being forced by the opposition to take up various inquiries. Take the Greenwich University, for instance. The government has apparently had ample warning of the plans to establish this institution of very doubtful provenance. What it was obliged to do was to establish an inquiry into the bona fides of the institution, its management and its courses. It was not until these issues were pursued by the opposition that such action was taken.
The AEI, which has been spending a great deal of time promoting Australian education, has not taken sufficient care to protect our reputation in that promotion effort. It has not been paying sufficient attention to protecting our reputation for quality and integrity, which are the fundamental ingredients in the success of this industry. It is appropriate that we ask the government to give some thought to the way in which it is sorting out the issues that have been presented, particularly in view of the impact of the advances in the technologi 
 cal delivery of education. We have seen what has happened with Greenwich. At the end of the review process we will see new criteria established. I trust that these will be rigorous criteria; that they will be criteria from which we can genuinely measure the quality of educational institutions such as Greenwich.
I would ask the government: what avenues are open to the government to fix up the problems—problems of its own creation, brought about as a result of the incompetence of the minister for territories in not being able to respond to the blindly obvious problems that presented themselves and in signing off on a proposition to grant the authority to establish a university effectively under Australian law through the territory of Norfolk Island in such away as to allow that institution to exploit the reputation of this country?
I might take the opportunity in the committee stage to discuss the review of the ESOS Act, particularly the question of the massive abuses that are appearing with regard to international students by a number of bogus colleges and shysters that are currently operating in this country. This review, which the government has again sought as a means of silencing the opposition, does not address the fact that this government has enormous powers available to clean up the industry but has not used those powers. This is a bill which the opposition is, of course, obliged to support. We ask, however, that it be amended in the terms of the amendment that I have circulated. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-10-20,"—The Democrats are in a similar position in that we have to support the funding bill before us, and indeed we will. I also put on the record now that the Democrats will be supporting the second reading amendment that has been circulated in the name of Senator Kim Carr on behalf of the Labor Party. The Democrats will be moving a further amendment to that second reading amendment, which I believe will be circulated shortly.
The  Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1999  sets out funding for the higher education sector in 2001 and varies the 
 amounts for 1999 and 2000 already provided for in the Higher Education Funding Act 1998. It also sets out a number of funding priorities announced in the 1999-2000 federal budget. Some of these are to be welcomed, such as the money—$14.7 million—that has been put aside for science lectureships. I think we have all been alarmed at the declining enrolments in science courses around the country, and we would be the first to suggest that more needs to be done to encourage participation in those particular fields.
I might add that this is a very similar debate to that that we were having back in 1996 with the then science minister, Minister Peter McGauran, who acknowledged that there was some concern—indeed, his higher education minister at the time, Senator Amanda Vanstone, acknowledged that there was some concern—about a lack of participation in science and science based courses around the country. The answer from this government of course was to put up the rate that students pay in the Higher Education Contribution Scheme for science and some science based courses, so much so that students who commenced their studies after 1 January 1997 would be paying $4,855 per annum for HECS. If you round that out, in three or four years you are looking at a debt of at least $20,000. I hardly think that is a financial incentive to enrol in a science course. Nonetheless, the science lectureships is a program we support. We also welcome the so-called commitment to regional education through the funding of 60 additional places in the medical faculty of James Cook University—although I would also add that recent events have led all in the sector and many outside it too, I suppose, to question the government's real commitment to regional and rural campuses.
However, this bill also contains a number of regressive proposals. Foremost among them is, of course, the defunding of the Higher Education Equity Merits Scholarships Scheme, which Senator Carr referred to in the debate. This was a scheme introduced, I guess, as a buffer to the quite deleterious funding cuts and deleterious changes that were introduced under the former minister for 
 higher education, Senator Amanda Vanstone, back in 1996. Clearly, the justification or the rationale behind the introduction of the scholarships was to address the significant equity and access concerns in the higher education sector—that is, the idea was to grant HECS exemptions to students facing barriers to accessing higher education. Figures regarding access to education by specific equity groups show that, while women and students from non-English speaking backgrounds have greatly increased their participation in higher education, much needs to be done to achieve similar results within the indigenous population and for potential students from low socioeconomic backgrounds.
When these exemption scholarships were introduced, the Democrats raised a number of concerns about their inadequacy in actually addressing some of the real barriers that exist to entering higher education, especially for disadvantaged groups. We highlighted not only the current disincentives, fees and charges, et cetera that are barriers to access but also the measly amount put aside. Four thousand scholarships over four years was never going to address the significant barriers that so many students face. We found it difficult to believe at the time that this scheme was ever going to overcome many of the disincentives imposed by this and previous governments in the years since the introduction of the scheme.
You have to remember that these barriers in many ways have been compounded by not only university funding cuts but also HECS hikes, changes to student financial assistance with the introduction of the common youth allowance with the higher age of independence, the changes to the differential levels of HECS, the percentile increase on the repayment of HECS as well as the reduction of the threshold to unrealistic levels—the threshold at which graduates begin to repay their debts—and the up-front undergraduate fees in some cases. So we were always concerned that these scholarships were not going to address the significant access and equity concerns that existed. Nonetheless, though they were measly, they were some buffer 
 against some of the radical and regressive changes that were introduced by the government in 1996.
I note that Senator Carr referred to Senator Vanstone's comments and rationale at the time. I notice that even Dr David Kemp in a speech two years ago to the lower house actually said:
As higher education numbers expand we must make sure that opportunities to participate are widespread.
Indeed, Dr Kemp. He went on:
People with disabilities, people from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds, women in non-traditional areas of study, people from rural and isolated areas, people from non-English speaking backgrounds and Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islanders are all beneficiaries of the merit scholarships introduced in 1997.
He went on:
These scholarships provide exemption from the HECS charge to an additional
1,000 effective full-time student units each year. By the year 2000 the scholarships will provide exemptions of 4,000 equivalent full-time student units, which means that well over 4,000 students will benefit each year.
I ask the minister now: does he see no reason for these scholarships to continue? Does he genuinely believe that as a consequence of the government's changes to higher education students from those very disadvantaged backgrounds whom he describes no longer need some form of assistance? I guess at least the pretence is gone. There is no suggestion now by this government that it is even going to pretend in some token way to assist those students who are disadvantaged in the sector.
Indeed, Senator Vanstone in this chamber, in this very place, back in August 1996 in response to a dorothy dixer from Senator O'Chee—no doubt exercising some seriously needed damage control on the issue of the 1996 budget changes and so-called reforms to higher education—boasted proudly:
We are introducing 4,000 equity and merit based scholarships. If, by returning to universities the HECS contributions for students, they over-enrol we are, in fact, encouraging universities to provide more places.
She went on to talk about the impact of free education and how she believed access was 
 greater for wealthier students at that time. She justified the merit equity scholarships, suggesting that this would overcome some of the disadvantages and the barriers that some students face. Obviously, those words do not mean anything more to this government, certainly not to the current minister David Kemp. He sees no need to provide such opportunities about which he boasted quite strongly in 1997, and no doubt even more recently.
Generally it must seem for many in the sector that every time we debate a higher education funding amendment bill in this place it is a bit like Ground Hog Day. There always seems to be some upheaval, some turbulence in the sector, usually created by the government of the day. In 1996 we saw a raft of broken promises, not the least of which was the government backing down on its so-called election manifesto promise that it would not cut operating grants. Since then we have seen increases to fees and charges, deregulation of some undergraduate places and cuts to student financial assistance. The list goes on.
Only this week, as Senator Carr has said, we have seen the expose, if you like, of the government's true agenda, or more specifically Dr David Kemp's agenda, for higher education in this country. I note that in his speech to the House of Representatives on the very bill before us, Minister Kemp makes no secret of his agenda—the fact that `universities must take principal responsibility for increasing their income'. He acknowledges that they have made substantial efforts in that direction, not because they necessarily want to be more `entrepreneurial', to use the minister's word, but they have had no choice. How ironic it is that this government could suggest that the higher education sector as a whole is greatly in need of assistance and then fail to acknowledge that most of the problems have been created by this government as a consequence of funding and other cuts that it has made in the last few years.
He went on in his second reading speech to the House to suggest that universities will, including money collected from students via the HECS system, receive almost $5.6 billion 
 from the government. This is the crucial point. A lot of the money that is now being directed to universities is money that is being recouped from the students themselves. Never before in this country have we seen such a high contribution from individual students. The government cannot afford to claim some kind of credit for increasing funds and funding allocations to universities when a lot of this money is coming from the steep fees and charges that the government has imposed on students.
He goes on to boast about the fact that the government has allowed universities to offer full fee paying undergraduate courses, enabling students to do the course of their first choice. What rubbish! It enables those students who have money, those students who have wealth, those students who can get loans or who have rich parents and friends, to get the course of their first choice. It certainly does nothing for those disadvantaged students whom Dr Kemp and Minister Vanstone were quite happy to refer to when they were boasting about the merit equity scholarships.
Dr David Kemp does not end there. He goes on to talk about the assistance being provided to James Cook University and the so-called government commitment to regional universities. I think everybody has recognised what a complete myth that is. That lie has been completely exposed as a consequence of the leaked cabinet submission which targets regional institutions. It acknowledges the difficult financial status that some of those institutions are in—about eight of them, as I recall. So it is acknowledged by this government that they are already facing financial hardship. We had the rescue package introduced by Senator Vanstone a couple of years ago—again an attempt at damage control as a consequence of the 1996 reforms. But that rescue package was specifically targeted at regional and remote universities because the government was starting to understand then that their cuts were going to result in campus closures and indeed—and I will not be surprised if this happens—in institutions shutting down.
The minister concludes his comments to the House by referring to the merit based equity 
 scholarships scheme. The government should hang its head in shame or at least have the guts to admit that it never really cared about providing access and equity in the first place. If it really did believe its own rhetoric in relation to the scholarships, at a minimum it would be continuing them and not using them as a blatant savings measure under this budget.
We have seen student-staff ratios up; we have seen fees and charges up, we have seen salaries at a low point due to this government's and the previous government's unwillingness to meet long overdue wage claims by general and academic staff in our higher education institutions. We have seen HECS up, we have seen decline in government funding and we have seen operating grants cuts. It is a sad, sad time for the sector. The only offers of support that David Kemp can come up with include the proposed introduction of vouchers and of fixed interest rates for HECS, or the abolition of HECS or blatant deregulation of fee charging arrangements in the sector when we already have up-front fees for some undergraduate courses and, as a consequence of the reforms of the Labor government, deregulation of the postgraduate sector.
So this government's agenda is quite clear. It is a narrow vision for higher education. If you couple that with Dr Kemp's almost religious pursuit of his voluntary student unionism legislation—which I recognise is on the Notice Paper, so I won't reflect on that—
—Hear, hear!
—I acknowledge Senator Abetz's interjection. As everybody knows, he is a champion of voluntary student unionism.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—I acknowledge the much louder interjection suggesting shame. Those people yelling shame in the chamber understand that it is a misnomer, that voluntary student unionism is not about greater choice for students. It is not about individual choice and responsibility; it is about emasculating those services that are provided on campus that assist all students, 
 but primarily those students who do not necessarily have the same wads of cash as some members in this place, in order to finance their own education, whether that means paying up-front fees and charges, paying for child care or coping with catering, shelter, housing and welfare.
These services mean that campus life is a holistic experience. They mean that people can participate in sport, in recreational facilities, or they can choose not to. In fact, in most cases on campus they can exercise their own conscience. They can make a conscientious objection and not be a joined-up, fully paid-up member of the union. I put it on the record that the Democrats strongly support the conscientious objection clauses which I understand operate in a majority of student union constitutions now and hopefully 100 per cent soon. We recognise that there are some students who need the vital services that are provided by a student organisation on campus. For that reason, the Democrats will continue our long and proud record not only in relation to universal membership of student organisations but also of continuing to vote down any attempt to introduce and increase fees and charges which we see as a psychological and financial disincentive to enter into and participate in higher education in this country.
We find the reforms that were outlined in the cabinet-in-confidence submission by Dr David Kemp incredibly alarming, and one of the most alarming is the prospect of student loans. This, as callously acknowledged by the minister in his discussion paper, is one of the most contentious elements of the proposed package. We still do not place a lot of faith in the arguments, claims or pledges by the minister representing the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs in this place—or indeed Dr David Kemp, or indeed the Prime Minister—that they will not introduce these things, because they said the same thing in 1996. At that time they promised they would leave operating grants untampered with.
Senator Crossin interjecting—
—Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President: I hear your 
 comments, Senator Crossin, about `never ever'. It is no wonder the community is often distrustful of politicians. In this case students will make it clear tomorrow. Students, staff and the community will make it clear to this government that they should not even countenance any of these proposals, that they should not consider any of the suggestions put forward by Dr David Kemp. I believe the students say it best when they say, `Hey, hey, ho, ho: David Kemp has got to go.' The resignation of that minister is long overdue. You need a minister for education who actually believes in the concept of education, who believes that education is an investment in this nation's future, that it is not simply a budget measure from which you can recoup savings but a way of ensuring that all Australians have the opportunity to further their skills and knowledge and participate in a democratic and enlightened society.
Even Roderick West, the author of the West report that Dr David Kemp conveniently buried some time last year—the report contained a number of recommendations which I believe have been resurrected in the cabinet-in-confidence submission—does not support the loan proposal outlined in Dr Kemp's paper. These proposals will subject young Australians to crippling debt burdens just as they are leaving school. We are condemning young people in our nation to debt. In every policy debate that I see taking place in OECD nations, such as the US, France and the UK, policy makers in government are discussing proposals like giving 18-year-olds grants to give them a strong start in their adult life. Yet this government is going in the exact opposite direction by proposing to give young people debts of up to $120,000. That is what we are talking about if we abolish the HECS system. That is what we are talking about if people have to have top-up vouchers or make up some kind of gap payment. That is what we are talking about if people are paying fixed interest rates on their fees and charges. It is extraordinary and disgusting beyond belief that these proposals even made it to paper. The minister should go.
These proposals are being advanced at a time when access to education by those from 
 lower socioeconomic backgrounds is declining. This government wants to place disincentives, like a debt of $100,000, in the way of Australians. It is even more ironic, and a little disgusting, when you look at some of the education backgrounds of people sitting in this government, indeed on the frontbench. I do not begrudge them their publicly funded higher education. In fact, I think that is the way it should be. But it is interesting to look at a piece in the Daily Telegraph, I believe by Malcolm Farr, which listed a number of members who received their education for free. It listed Peter Costello, the Treasurer; the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Michael Wooldridge; the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, Joe Hockey; the Leader of the National Party of Australia, John Anderson; and of course the Minister for Justice and Customs, Amanda Vanstone. Let us not forget that she was the woman who was wielding the knife in 1996. Larry Anthony would have left the University of New South Wales debt-free. Lucky Mr Anthony. According to this article, the Special Minister of State, who now joins us in the chamber, would also have received a `free ride at the University of Western Australia'. I do not begrudge these people their education, but how dare they begrudge the education of other Australians—not just young people, school leavers, but mature age Australians—whose income, whose lifestyle, whose health and futures, and their children's futures, depend on access to education. I move:
At the end of the amendment, add:
	 ""; and (c)	  opposes:
			 (i)	 the introduction of vouchers, real interest rates for HECS and cuts to operating grants; and
			 (ii)	 deregulation of the higher education sector"".
Debate interrupted.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-10-20,"—Last week at this time, I made some remarks in regard to the referendum to be held on 6 November for the proposed republic. Today I would like to make some further remarks on this most important issue. The situation is becoming more and more clear each day that those who are advocating a no vote, particularly those associated with Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy, are intent upon resorting to any sort of scaremongering and, indeed, I would say deliberately misleading and downright false assertions in order to try to ensure that the vote for an Australian head of state does not succeed.
As we know from past referenda, it is often very easy to simply sit on the sidelines, throw in bombs or hand grenades, and thereby scare the Australian public into voting against reasonable and sensible change. That is what I believe is happening on this occasion. For instance, I read an article by Geoffrey Blainey, who referred to the case being put forward by the pro-republicans as similar to Waltzing Matilda. He made references to the swagman, the jumbuck and so on.
As I have listened to many of the false arguments from the monarchist cause—and I will come to some of those in a moment—I was reminded of an episode in the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn when Huck and Jim were on the raft and their serenely idyllic world was invaded by two scoundrels. Those two scoundrels claimed that they were descendants of royalty. One of them claimed he was the descendant of the Duke of Bilgewater who had been deprived of his title. The other, not to be outdone, claimed he was the dauphin, the son of Louis XVI and the rightful heir to the throne of France. Huck, of course, saw through these scoundrels and in a rather memorable phrase said:
It didn't take me long to make up my mind that these liars weren't no kings nor dukes at all but just low-down humbugs and frauds.
I would never make that suggestion in respect of the monarchy, but I do make it in respect of those who are out there propagating the cause to retain Queen Elizabeth and her heirs 
 and successors as our head of state. Many of their arguments are fraudulent, and they are nothing more than humbugs.
Let me turn to some of those arguments. I have already addressed some, as I said, in my speech last week, but let me turn to a few others. One of the arguments that has been advanced is that a constitutional monarchy is inherently better than a republic. That of course is just a completely false assertion. Among stable democracies in the world there are both constitutional monarchies and republics. There is nothing inherently more stable about a constitutional monarchy than there is about a republic. Indeed, we have seen in this century quite a number of monarchies cease to exist because of the despotic and aristocratic nature of their regimes.
The fact that Australia is a constitutional monarchy does not mean in itself that it is more democratic or more stable. It is a completely false argument to assert that our democracy and stability stem from the simple fact that we are a constitutional monarchy with the Queen as our head of state. Rather I would submit that the fact that we are a stable democratic country that has enjoyed relative peace for 200 years is due more to our geographical position in the world than to the fact that the Queen of England is our head of state.
Further, the monarchists cannot have it both ways. They cannot on the one hand say that our very essence of stable democracy is due to having the Queen, the monarch of the United Kingdom, as our head of state, and yet on the other hand argue that she has really nothing at all to do with the running of this country. Of course, that argument is also being advanced. It is being advanced particularly and continuously by people like Sir David Smith, who argues that in reality the Governor-General is our head of state and the Queen is largely irrelevant. We would submit that she is largely irrelevant to the continued functioning of this stable democratic country. If we move to a system where we have an Australian as our own head of state—someone who lives here, is an Australian citizen, identifies with Australia, is proud of Australia and is able to stand up both within Australia 
 and overseas as a representative of Australia—then we will be just as democratic, just as peace loving and just as stable on 7 November as we are today or on the day before the referendum. So that is a complete furphy.
The other argument that is advanced—I heard the Prime Minister putting this again this morning—is that the system ain't broke and therefore why change it? I make the point, firstly, that the system is broken. It is not broken in any substantial way that threatens our way of life or our democratic system, but it is broken to the extent that we are one of the few nations on earth that does not have one of its own citizens as the head of state. If it is good enough for the Prime Minister to be an Australian citizen—in fact, it is mandatory for the Prime Minister to be an Australian citizen, as the High Court has found—and if it is important enough for the captain of our cricket team, our Wallaby team or any other group that represents Australia to be an Australian citizen, then why can't an Australian citizen be our head of state? What is so particular and peculiar about that position that it should be reserved exclusively for members of a royal family resident in and ruling the United Kingdom? It is fairly fundamental, I would think, to a nation's stature, to its destiny, to its pride in its history and to its confidence for the future to have one of its own citizens as the head of state. At no stage have those who support the no case from the monarchist cause been able to answer that fundamental question as to why it is that no Australian is worthy enough to hold that position.
What we have seen in the other great lie is that those from the monarchist cause, such as Kerry Jones, Sir David Smith, Dame Leonie Kramer and others, have been supporting an argument that tries to cash in on the other group opposing the yes campaign, that is, the direct electionists. They, the monarchists, are so bereft of arguments to try and sustain the proposition that the Queen of England should be our head of state that they have jumped onto the direct election bandwagon. So we have Kerry Jones out there promoting a no case on the basis that this model is not the republic we should have—as if somehow she 
 supports some other republican model. When put to the test, she has had to admit that she does not really support any republican model. But if she can, by way of subterfuge or sophistry, win the day and convince people to vote no, she will stoop to any argument. There is no honesty or integrity in that argument at all. Indeed, that has been proved by the fact that the advertisement that was put forward by the monarchist cause, by the no campaign, has actually had to be withdrawn. This is the monarchist anthem, as sung by James Blundell.
—Are you going to sing it?
—No, I cannot sing it. The first verse says:
There's a baker in his kitchen
There's an old bloke on the land
There's a grocer at the market
There's the guy who lends a hand.
I will not dwell on the fact that this is somewhat sexist. What I will focus on is the fact that, whether it is the baker in the kitchen, the old bloke on the land, the grocer down at the market or the guy, the mate, who lends a hand, the fact of the matter is that none of those people can ever be an Australian head of state under our current system. That is the hypocrisy in that anthem: that none of those people who have built this great country can ever aspire to be the head of state.
The other point I wanted to make in my remarks today is that Australians are not afraid of change. Indeed, we have seen substantial change over the years and, despite the doomsayers, it has not led to the breakdown of the fabric of our society or of our democracy. It was Robert Menzies who in World War II announced that we were at war as a consequence of Great Britain being at war. That was in 1939. Just two years later John Curtin, the then Prime Minister, stated:
Without any inhibitions of any kind, I make it quite clear that Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom.
We had to cope with change then. We had to cope with a change in our relationship with the United Kingdom in order to save this country. 
Change has continued. We introduced decimal currency and moved away from the system of pounds, shillings and pence, which was the English system. Prime Minister Menzies did that. He actually wanted to call the currency the royal, but we settled for the dollars and cents terminology. We were able to cope with that change, which was a huge change to this economy and an expensive change, but one which represented a break from our imperial past. It was a similar situation when we changed to the metric system rather than having the old inches, feet, yards and miles. Those of us who are old enough remember how hard it was to try and learn that system and to learn our arithmetic. It was another substantial change in this country achieved without any difficulty. We changed our national anthem. It took a number of years, but we changed the anthem. Interestingly enough, we still have God Save the Queen as the royal anthem of Australia. Not many people would realise that, if the Queen were opening the Olympic Games, as she is supposed to be entitled to as our head of state, the national anthem to be played when she was opening the Olympic Games would not be Advance Australia Fair but would be God Save the Queen.
There have been other changes, including abolition of appeals to the Privy Council, abolition of the imperial honours and so on. The Australian people are able to cope with change, and I believe that we will be able to do so again on 6 November.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-10-20,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. The minister would be aware that I asked these questions at estimates some months ago, because he was at the table at the time. But I asked a very specific question which I think the parliament deserves an answer to, and that is: why did the minister for health take 18 months to close off applications for eligible MRI machines when concerns were raised with him by the department in May 1998? They were supposed to have signed the contract by then. Why did he wait 18 months before he closed off their ability to claim for that eligibility?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health: MRI Scans</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-10-20,"—My question is directed to Senator Herron in his capacity of representing the minister for health. Is the minister aware that the minister for health has publicly asserted that he has acted quickly in responding to concerns about the MRI scandal, despite being warned on 5 May 1998 by the department that there may be a problem, being told in August 1998 by the department that there was a problem and 
 the concerns raised publicly by Labor since February 1999? Can the minister explain why the minister for health acted to close off applications for eligible MRI machines only in October 1999, some 18 months after first being warned of the problem? Why did the minister for health then express astonishment that radiologists were still submitting applications, when he left open that massive window of opportunity for them? If it takes 18 months for the minister for health to act quickly in responding to concerns, how does he react slowly?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health: MRI Scans</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,answer
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-10-20,"—Madam President, you can always count on the Labor Party for one thing: the conspiracy theory. As I said yesterday, the minister has answered questions in the other chamber. There were questions asked in the estimates committee as well and those matters have been raised in the other chamber. He has provided detailed answers to those matters and has made a number of statements on the public record. If there is anything further that needs to be added to that, I am happy to get back to Senator Evans with an answer from the minister.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health: MRI Scans</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,answer
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-10-20,"—Senator Evans's estimate is that it was 18 months. The minister took appropriate action. As Senator Evans would recall, at the Senate estimates committee there was discussion of this matter and there were investigations proceeding. Undertakings were given at that time that certain information should not be divulged because it may prejudice those investigations. If there is anything further that the minister 
 wishes me to give to Senator Evans, I am happy to approach him about that.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health: MRI Scans</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,answer
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-10-20,"—My question is directed to Senator Newman, the Minister for Family and Community Services. Can the minister inform the Senate how much of the gold medal disability strategies budget was allocated to the glossy information folder that contained a biro, a copy of the minister's press releases, a notepad and a shiny lapel brooch? What information has been produced for this strategy that refers to the Disability Discrimination Act and the lawful obligations of all proprietors under this act?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Disability Services: Discrimination</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-10-20,"—Would the minister take the question on notice and also answer the following supplementary question. Can she confirm that the public relations firm that coordinated the strategy tendered the lowest price but has also admitted to having zero knowledge of disability related issues? Does the minister still believe, as she told the Life Matters  radio program recently, that this contract provides `a good educational exercise for them'? Why was there no requirement for the firm to have an understanding of disability related access issues given that that is one of the objects of the strategy that they are being paid to promote?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Disability Services: Discrimination</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1999-10-20,"—I presume that Labor never gave anybody a biro when they came to the launch of a major initiative.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Senator Mackay has asked Senator Newman a question, and Senator Mackay is entitled to hear the answer without her colleagues around her shouting.
—Madam President, I am not really sure whether Senator Mackay is interested in the answer. The focus of the gold medal access strategy was on sensitising business to the needs of people with disabilities for access to premises and services, et cetera, and the opportunities business was losing as a result of people with disabilities not being able to access those goods and services.
The total budget for this strategy is $2.1 million over three years; I have answered that in the Senate already. The amount allocated to event management, including the launch, the symposia, the awards, the information and public relations tasks associated with the strategy, is of a maximum of $1.23 million. The balance of $0.87 million is for administrative costs over three years. I do not know if this will help Senator Mackay, but the estimated cost of the symposia series is $430,000 for eight events around Australia, and that figure includes venue hire, invitations, catering, speakers, advertising and fees.
—How much for the biros?

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,1999-10-20,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that 15 sitting days after today I shall move that the following delegated legislation, a list of which I shall hand to the Clerk, be disallowed.
The list read as follows—
1.	 Health Insurance Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 5) as contained in Statutory Rules 1999 No. 176 and made under the Health Insurance Act 1973 .
2.	 Judicial and Statutory Officers (Remuneration and Allowances) Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 1) as contained in Statutory Rules 1999 No. 171 and made under the Judicial and Statutory Officers (Remuneration and Allowances) Act 1984 .
3.	 National Health Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 4) as contained in Statutory Rules 1999 No. 174 and made under the National Health Act 1953 .
—I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard  a short summary of the matters raised by the Committee.
Leave granted.
The summary read as follows—
Health Insurance Amendment Regulations 1999 (No.5) Statutory Rules 1999 No.176
Item 1 of the Schedule adds seven item numbers which, if requested by oral and maxillofacial surgeons, will be within the Medicare Benefits Schedule. These changes take effect from 1 September 1999. The Explanatory Statement, however, suggests that these amendments are the correction of an oversight, which occurred when the Diagnos 
 tic Imaging Services Table was amended from 1 March 1999. It would appear, therefore, that there has been a period of six months when dental practitioners could not claim for such services.
National Health Amendment Regulations 1999 (No.4) Statutory Rules 1999 No.174
The amendment made by item 3 of the Schedule changes the benefit arrangements for private health insurance funds participating in the South Australian Psychiatric Patient Trial. The Explanatory Statement advises that there will no longer be a minimum benefit payable, but `participating funds and facilities will be able to agree a benefit level which does not exceed the daily fees and charges incurred'. Thus, it would appear that this item replaces a minimum  level of benefit with one that is described in terms of the possible maximum  level of benefit. This may not be sufficiently precise to ensure that patients are adequately covered for such treatments.
Judicial and Statutory Officers (Remuneration and Allowances) Amendment Regulations 1999 (No.1) Statutory Rules 1999 No.171
The Regulations omit the offices of the Privacy Commissioner and the Director of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and set the annual rate of remuneration for the office of the Australian Electoral Commissioner.
The Explanatory Statement advises that the amendment made by item 1 in the Schedule removes the reference to the Privacy Commissioner from the Principal Regulations, as from 11 January 1999. However, that Statement does not explain why the Regulations are no longer to provide for the payment of remuneration of the Privacy Commissioner, nor why the removal of that office from the Regulations was done retrospectively.
Senator Chris Evans to move, on the next day of sitting:
That the Senate—
(a)	 notes that there are serious concerns about the integrity of the process that led to the decision of the Minister for Health and Aged Care (Dr Wooldridge) to extend Medicare funding to magnetic resonance imaging machines; and
(b)	 requires that there be laid on the table by the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care (Senator Herron), no later than 3 pm on 22 November 1999, documents containing the following information:
	 (i)	 the dates on which each contract for a magnetic resonance imaging machine is purported to have been signed prior to the 1998 Budget deadline of 12 May 1998 
 but, because there is an ongoing Health Insurance Commission investigation, the Senate does not seek any identifying information about these contracts, merely the dates they were claimed to have been signed,
	 (ii)	 minutes of all meetings between the Department of Health and Aged Care officers and representatives of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists during the period 10 February 1998 to 31 May 1998, and
	 (iii)	 copies of all advice provided by the department to the Minister on the radiology agreement and the extension of a Medicare rebate for magnetic resonance imaging services.
Senator Hogg to move, on the next day of sitting:
That the time for the presentation of the report of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee on the examination of developments in contemporary Japan and the implications for Australia be extended to 30 March 2000.
Senator Bourne to move, on the next day of sitting:
That the Senate—
(a)	 notes that:
	 (i)	 the Indonesian Parliament voted on the evening of 19 October 1999 to annul the 1978 decree incorporating East Timor as the 27th province of Indonesia, and
	 (ii)	 East Timor will now move to become an independent state under the auspices of the United Nations; and
(b)	 congratulates:
	 (i)	 the East Timorese people on this important step towards a peaceful, prosperous and independent future, and
	 (ii)	 the new Indonesian Parliament on carrying out its obligations under the 5 May 1999 agreement between the United Nations, Indonesia and Portugal.
Senator Chris Evans to move, on the next day of sitting:
(1)	 The following matter be referred to the Community Affairs References Committee for inquiry and report by 22 November 1999:
	 Proposals for changes to the welfare system contained in the document referred to in the orders of the Senate of 30 September 1999 and 13 October 1999, and the compilation and treatment of that document, together with the 
 documents referred to in the order of the Senate of 19 October 1999.
(2)	 The Senate directs:
	 (a)	 the committee to hold a public hearing on 12 November 1999, and on such other days as are necessary to conclude the hearing on this matter; and
	 (b)	 officers of the Department of Family and Community Services, who appeared at the estimates hearing of the Community Affairs Legislation Committee on 2 June 1999 to appear at the hearings of the committee referred to in (a) to give evidence on this matter.
(3)	 For the purpose of the hearings referred to in (2), three members of the committee shall constitute a quorum.
Senator Forshaw to move, on the next day of sitting:
That the Senate notes that:
(1)	 surfing is a recreation and sport enjoyed by and participated in by many thousands of young and not so young Australians;
(2)	 many Australians have been successful in the sport of surfing thus promoting our image and reputation both in Australia and around the world as well as helping to develop a successful surfing industry in Australia;
(3)	 Mark Occhilupo has just won the world professional surfing title; and
(4)	 congratulates Mark Occhilupo on his great achievement, on his personal determination to succeed and his dedication and contribution to surfing for over 20 years.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,1999-10-20,"—The fact that we are debating a further issue in relation to higher education is probably unfortunate for the government this week. The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1999  places the Labor Party in somewhat of a dilemma. While we need to approve the passage of this bill for the necessary funding it will provide to the universities in the coming 12 months, we are reluctant to support at this stage any view or any action that this government is taking in relation to higher education. The government has been reluctant to put this bill on the Notice Paper for most of the year, and it would be even more reluctant to do so today after the events of the last fortnight.
Let me say in my opening remarks that in the last 10 days we have witnessed an outrageous attack on the higher education sector in this country. We have seen attacks on the universities' autonomy and attacks on the relationship between staff and students about who is going to pay for higher education in this country as opposed to it being a public benefit committed to and funded by the federal government. Not only does it reveal a fundamental lack of understanding of higher education by this minister but also the events of the last fortnight have highlighted exactly what path the minister has wanted to take higher education down ever since he took over the reins from the former minister, Senator Vanstone, who did not exactly sprinkle the sector with the wonderful wealth that this country ought to invest in the higher education sector and who was relegated to a less senior position in cabinet. There are probably many people who would join with me in suggesting that that is exactly where Dr Kemp should head after his absolutely outrageous attempt to try to hide his agenda for higher education. But he was caught out.
The government are now backing away at 1,000 miles an hour but, like their policy of the `never-ever' GST, this is going to be the `never-ever' policy in respect of higher education—deregulation of fees, vouchers for use in public and private institutions, a universal loans scheme with a real interest rate and an attack on the industrial relations environment, which is still on the agenda. The government are pedalling backwards at 1,000 miles an hour in the media, in the House and in this chamber simply because they have been caught out. If we had not been given the information that was contained in the cabinet submission—a document that was developed at the request of cabinet—it would still be in the government's back pocket. The government would throw it on the table, probably hoping to implement it well before the next federal election.
Let us have a look at some of the proposals and myths surrounding what the government 
 are attempting to do. One myth that the government would lay before the community is that the deregulation of fees would have helped to meet the unmet student demand. Dr Kemp, in fact, is saying that the unmet demand will be met by lifting limits on the number of places that the universities can offer. The key is that any extra places will have to be full fee paying places. The government have not proposed to increase the number of publicly subsidised places, you would notice, in the last fortnight, except possibly as a sweetener in the short term. In fact, since the coalition were elected, demand for university places has actually fallen by 4.4 per cent in 1997 and by 4.1 per cent in 1998. The fall in demand among mature age students is around 10 per cent. The reason for the fall in demand is simply the increased cost.
The government will probably say that what they have done is throw extra money into the higher education bucket. But the reality is that you lower the threshold for HECS, and that is how that additional money has been made up—students have paid the additional money. It has certainly not come out of the public purse. They will probably say that they are increasing opportunities for students. The only opportunities will be for those who can pay. The coalition have already reduced the number of publicly subsidised places. In 1998 there were 16,500 fewer fully funded places than had been budgeted for in Labor's forward estimates. That is a figure that is obtained from the DETYA Higher education report for the 1999-2001 triennium.
I heard Dr Kemp say on the 7.30 Report last week—one of the very few interviews on the 7.30 Report where I have actually seen Kerry O'Brien get fairly cross with the person he was interviewing—that this will not necessarily increase the cost to students. Dr Kemp acknowledges in his paper that in fact some universities will position themselves at the premium end of the market and that cost behaviour is unpredictable. As I mentioned in our censure motion of Dr Kemp last week, we already know that in the US—the system that, really, this government want us to emulate—the costs of higher education tuition have 
 soared. A commission on national investment in higher education in the United States actually recommended that increased public investment was needed to arrest the crisis occurring in higher education in that country. In Canada, students are seeking to declare themselves bankrupt on the basis of soaring student debt.
The Association of University Staff of New Zealand, hearing the news of what was happening in this country, last week issued a press release—which I have in front of me—expressing astonishment at the proposals. It says:
The Association of University Staff of New Zealand (AUSNZ) today expressed astonishment that the Australian Minister for Education was planning to introduce a funding model along the failed New Zealand lines.
So we have a look at what is happening internationally in respect of funding for higher education—we turn to the United States and to New Zealand. We look at what is happening there and cannot learn lessons from increased student debt and the lack of public confidence in their higher education systems. Oh no, we have to try to emulate them here! We have a look at what is happening overseas and disregard the facts, the figures, the opinions, the numbers of staff enrolments and graduates and try to copy what is happening, particularly in New Zealand.
The executive director of the university staff association in New Zealand said that the national government—that is, the New Zealand national government—was currently resiling from that funding model. The funding model he is talking about is, of course, the student loan debt at normal interest rates. He went on to say:
Student loan debt currently exceeds $NZ3.3 billion and, at present rates of growth, student debt will exceed the nation's public debt by around 2025.
So one would have to say that there is a situation in New Zealand that we would never want to copy and never want to have here in Australia—but not this government. This government has decided that it is probably a good thing and it is going to jump on board, except that it has had to pedal backwards very fast in the last fortnight. This government will 
 also probably say that deregulation will give universities greater autonomy. It seems from the cabinet submission that Dr Kemp wants more, not less, control over the universities. He wants to tell universities what they can and cannot do in respect of their enterprise agreements, and I will get back to that in a minute. He wants to make the universities, not the government, responsible for equity, and he will use those threats and has continued to use those threats to withhold funding.
There is the ultimate myth being put about by the government that the funding for universities is increasing. The minister claims that income available to universities is increasing, based on projections about the increasing proportion of income that comes via fees and charges. In fact, government income to universities has been steadily decreasing since 1996, as the government's own figures show. They suggest that, under the current arrangements, in the year 2000 government funding to universities will be below 50 per cent of the total operating revenue—around the same level it was in 1990.
What was even more amazing were the statements by that minister last week in the House of Representatives, prior to the release of the documentation to cabinet and prior to the Labor Party being prepared to tell the truth about what the government were intending to do in respect of higher education. Dr Kemp was asked a question about taking responsibility for universities and those that have been forced to operate at a deficit. He was in fact asked: `Do you . . . accept that there are regional campuses whose very existence is now at risk as a result of your policies?' This was a question that Michael Lee asked of Dr Kemp last Wednesday, and Dr Kemp's reply, which is in Hansard, was:
The suggestion that there are regional university campuses at risk is absolutely absurd, and I completely reject that.
We have actually seen in the cabinet submission an admission by this government that there are regional universities at risk, and they go so far as to say that there are eight of them. They have not identified them, but if anyone has been watching the way some 
 regional universities have been trying to cope with not meeting student demand and not meeting their targets, with the amount of funding that they have been given by this government, as little as it is, it is not too hard to work out which eight universities are working at a deficit and which regional campuses are at risk.
In another question last week, Mr Lee asked about higher staff-student ratios, less frequent lecture and tutorial contact, outdated technology, and gaps in key areas of professional preparation. He asked the minister how he reconciled those facts with his claim that the government is intending to raise the quality of university education. The answer to that question, surprisingly enough, was:
The government's policies for higher education have put the universities in a position where they have greater capacity and autonomy to manage their own affairs.
Again, if one looks at the proposed document that went before cabinet, one has to ask: why is it that this cabinet-in-confidence document says that `higher education institutions' capacity to respond flexibly and efficiently to merging student and employer demand is hamstrung' but, in answer to a question, the minister said that his policies were providing them with greater capacity and autonomy to manage their own affairs? Whom are we to believe: the public image of Dr Kemp or the private image with backdoor, in-the-pocket secret documents that are produced only for cabinet?
Probably the most outrageous and continued attack that we have seen over the last 10 days in terms of the government's obsession and absolute passion for trying to deregulate the workplace by attacking the trade union movement is their  attack on the operations of the National Tertiary Education Union and the Community and Public Sector Union. Why? Because those unions have an increasing membership from the university sector, and because they have, over the last number of years, been as effective as they possibly could in a sector that has been strangled for growth and for efficiencies.
In the cabinet document, Dr Kemp says that there are workplace rigidities in universities, 
 and he points the finger at the retention of unwieldy government structures and the persistence of an NTEU-dictated bargaining agenda. It is interesting to note that, since 1996, Dr Kemp has continually refused to meet with officials from the National Tertiary Education Union. They have not been accorded one meeting with this minister, particularly since he took over the reins from Senator Vanstone. He talks about the retention of unwieldy government structures. By that I assume he means inside the university sector, but that is just further evidence of how little he knows or understands about what is happening in the university sector.
I want to take senators through some of the impacts that government funding has had on universities and what the union and that sector have tried to do. Since 1996, enrolments have increased by 6.6 per cent, but the average staff equivalent in the general staff area has diminished by 5¼ per cent and academic staff has diminished by 3.5 per cent. So universities have in fact lost 4.55 per cent in their staffing budgets. And why have they done that? Because with a decreasing budget they have had no choice but to put staff off and to offer redundancies. They have had no choice but to offer people either casual or contract work instead of making them permanent employees in the university sector.
The staff-student ratio in the higher education sector was 14.5 to one in 1994, and in 1998 it was 17.9 to one. That is a figure you would expect in a senior secondary class of years 11 and 12. So there has been an increase of nearly four students per class in the higher education sector.
Let us have a look at salary increases. For the period 1991 to 2000, the NTEU, in consultation with their members, have been able to give their staff a 17.9 per cent wage increase. Let us have a look at that in comparison with other sectors. Engineers in this country have had a 23.4 per cent increase in wages; teachers, on average, have had a 19.8 per cent increase; the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation have had a 21.2 per cent increase; and the Australian Public Service have had a 19.4 per cent increase. So in a nine-year period, aca 
 demics and general staff working in universities have had the lowest increases of workers in these sectors.
We have a picture here of universities struggling with funds. They are downsizing, they are making staff redundant, they are putting staff on contract or making them casual, and they have had the smallest wage increase in nine years compared with other industries—other scientists, other academics, other engineers. And yet the minister still believes that they have an unwieldy government structure and that they are dominated by the persistence of the NTEU. Clearly his knowledge is out of date.
But wait, there is more. They will actually be allowed to get a little bit of funding—a two per cent salary supplementation—if they agree to some of the workplace reforms. Senator Carr mentioned today that this government is off getting legal advice, as it did with the wharfies and the building unions, and now it is going to start its attack on the higher education sector.
What an insult to academics and researchers in this country. It is no wonder that they are leaving the university sector in droves when all this government can do, on top of the outrageous policy it has released in the last fortnight, is to now offer them only a two per cent salary increase in relation to what has not been achieved over the last nine years. It is an insult to the higher education sector in this country and to those people who work in that sector. I think it is an absolute abrogation of the higher education sector. This federal government needs to seriously look at its policies in respect of higher education, to take that sector seriously and to fund it seriously for the public good.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"West, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-10-20,"—I rise today to enter this debate as one who lives and works in the rural regions of this country. The government talk about expanding funding to the higher education sector but they fail to tell the general community that the vast majority of this increased funding that they maintain has gone to this sector has resulted from changes that they made to the HECS repayments and, therefore, has been paid for by students who have 
 worked hard to get their degrees and to contribute something to this country.
The government does not really seem to care about that particular issue. They are not concerned about what the needs of a student might be, what the needs of the tertiary sector might be and what the needs of this community might be in Australia. We have seen in recent months very strong, very rabid and radical rhetoric and hard-nosed ideology coming to the fore in terms of higher education. We have seen the VSU—the voluntary student union—legislation still hanging out there as a spectre in the mist. It is still hanging out there because there are members of the government who still are ideologically driven to see this introduced.
For ages we have argued about the impact that this would have upon education and upon the ability of student unions to provide a range of services to students and people on university campuses. The universities themselves used to provide these services but, because of the tightening of the financial screws by this government, they have had to be paid for by the student unions. We have seen that happen and we know that that spectre is out there in the mist, as I have said. I wonder when the government will reintroduce that legislation. The Senate inquiry that examined the impact of the VSUs was overwhelmed with submissions from regional universities and facilities all expressing grave concerns about the impact of the abolition of student fees upon their students, their campuses and the communities that they support.
It is not as if a university in a regional community is totally isolated from the rest of that community. It is an integral part of the community in which they reside. It is an integral part of the life of that town or city. It provides integral employment opportunities for people within that town. It provides a range of jobs from cleaning and menial labouring tasks to the employment of professors, academics and people with PhDs. And it allows people to study for PhDs. That is the value of a regional institution and a regional university. It provides communities and regions not just with a learning place for students to come to but also with an intellec 
 tual pool that enables them to supply consultants if some organisation in the community needs them. A university is able to take part and participate in the activities of the region and have an input and provide expertise in the evolution and the development of proposals, policies and issues. It is able to be involved in the identification and assessment of problems and issues that affect the region and assist in the formulation of responses.
This is what universities contribute to regional areas. They contribute far more than just turning out graduates. They are part of our community. They provide their expertise to our community. They also enable research to be undertaken in rural and regional areas. Although sandstone universities in the cities—such as Sydney University, the University of New South Wales, the Australian National University and Melbourne University—get the vast majority of the money, some money does come out to the institutions in the rural and regional areas. This enables very focused research to be carried out that often has more of a bent and direction towards the needs of rural people. This is often research that is rurally oriented and based and, therefore, is of great value to these communities and to Australia because it enables research to be carried out that encompasses the whole of Australia. It also enables people in rural areas to actually undertake research and their PhDs.
What does this government want of its community? Does it want all the PhD people to be actually residing on the eastern seaboard with a small pocket around the Swan River, the Torrens River in Adelaide and maybe some in Tasmania? Is that what it wants? Or does it actually want the people in regional areas to have the same resources as people in city areas? One really does have to wonder.
In the context of rural and regional institutions and the VSU, one also has to look at the services that were provided to institutions by student unions. Student unions provided things like a free legal service for students. This service was not needed because students are a bunch of rabblerousing delinquents who are always being called up before the courts because they have committed some student prank. Students, like everybody else, have 
 needs that might require some legal advice. On a number of campuses they provided dental and health services. Assistance with financial aid is provided by student unions on a number of campuses. They also provide sporting services and sporting facilities and those facilities are used very often by the whole community. It is not just the university football club or the university cricket club that might play on their grounds. It is often a resource and facility for the whole community. This needs to be remembered and not forgotten.
We have had that hard-nosed ideology in recent times. As I say, it is now, like a spectre in the mist, hidden away for the time being. But what have we seen in recent times? Last week a cabinet submission fell off the back of a truck. The contents of that submission must make anybody in any institution or anybody considering higher education shake in their boots. It certainly has shaken the universities in regional areas to their foundations. It has got everybody in rural and regional Australia absolutely furious. It is not very often in education, particularly with universities, that you actually get the academics, the administration and the students—the whole group involved in the university—plus the community in total agreement. But let me tell you that right at present out there in the bush this proposal has the community saying as one, `It is not fair, not right.'
We all know the Prime Minister has stepped in and said, `Oh, no. It won't happen.' I am sorry. Most people out there are now very sceptical of those reassurances. They heard those words when Telstra was going to be sold. They heard them when the GST was going to be introduced. Believe me—the people out there are very sceptical and that is reflected in the leader writers' columns of the regional media. The Northern Daily Leader editorial of Friday, 15 October, says very simply:
Will this be a kept promise?
That is a question that is on the minds of everybody out there. Will this be a kept promise? It says:
WE WILL possibly never know if federal Minister for Education, Employment and Youth 
 Affairs David Kemp was seriously floating the concept of a deregulated fee system for university students.
. . .              . . .             . . .
. . .. we may never know because Prime Minister John Howard yesterday went on to record that Australia, under his leadership, would never introduce American-style university funding.
But it goes on a bit later on to say:
It should be remembered that while Prime Minister Howard is an honourable man, there are promises which, once given, must be kept as a matter of honour and there are political promises, which have a tendency to be subject to the winds of convenience and memory loss.
What is to say that that is not one of those promises? This government has a history of it. They did it with Telstra. They have done it with the GST. What has happened? With the GST we saw the Democrats cave in. A few minor amendments were made and off we went. We have got it, whether we like it or not.
I have grave concerns because it is unfair. What will be the impact upon education of these sorts of fees where people could be paying up to $100,000? People will say, `Oh, no. It couldn't be that much.' But we are talking market rates. We are talking compounding here. We are talking big figures.
I have an article from the Central Western Daily which quotes the manager of the Orange Agricultural College Student Union. That is not an institution that would be classified or considered to be a raging red institution. It is part of Sydney University but it is also an old agricultural college and has been steeped in conservatism for most of its life. But they are saying things like `it is unfair, ill conceived and elitist'. When we get organisations and bodies like that using those words, I really think that people need to take account of what they are thinking. Quoting the student union manager, the article goes on to say:
""From my perspective it will have an enormous effect on rural universities like ours,—
that is the Orange Agricultural College of Sydney University—
CSU Bathurst, CSU Riverina and the University of New England. I think if this ever came to fruition, 
 which I hope it doesn't, we would end up having a system like the United States,"" he said.
Mr Redden said the already powerful institutions like Sydney, NSW, Macquarie and Monash universities, which now attract the bulk of research funding and students, would become even more powerful under a pay-to-learn system that excludes poorer students.
He said the national workplace was demanding more tertiary qualifications, the government was promoting the smart country yet the Education Minister was placing financial barriers in front of potential students.
""If this proposal ever saw the light of day, I am not sure that average Australians, whose mum and dad struggled to pay the mortgage and struggled to put them through school, would ever get to university,"" he said.
That is one comment. There is also great concern in Dubbo, because the Charles Sturt University is looking to develop a campus at Dubbo. I would recommend to everybody an article by Professor Cliff Blake, the Vice-Chancellor of Charles Sturt University, entitled `Don't disadvantage the bush', which appears in today's Australian . He argues very cogently the damage this measure will do. He makes this very valid point:
Children from isolated and rural families, women, Aborigines and the growing number of people who seek to re-enter education as a second chance opportunity, are all over-represented among students at the newer regional universities. 	 These are the groups least able to afford heavier debt burdens to finance their university education. They would be unable to repay loans at commercial interest rates, especially if the rate of repayment was not income contingent.
He also talks about the impact of the GST, which I mentioned a little while ago. He says:
Although tuition fees will be exempt, other costs—travel, accommodation, food and textbooks—will be subject to the tax.
Regional universities are the principal providers of distance education and are committed to flexible delivery.
. . .              . . .             . . .
Many regional universities are also required to operate on more than one campus to enhance access and to service local communities.
Because of multiple campuses, these universities are often required to duplicate some services. They do their level best not to 
 duplicate, but it is not possible to not totally duplicate. Professor Blake says further:
In a system preoccupied with economic efficiency rather than issues of access and equity, regional universities would find themselves less able to provide trained personnel in areas such as health studies, teacher education and business. They would need to reduce the number of campuses they operate, the number of courses they offer and/or the modes by which those courses are delivered.
This is going to cause them problems if they get a reduction in the number of courses and a reduction in the number of new campuses. This is going to downsize their university. It is going to run the risk of impacting upon them financially. So it is a major concern. They are concerned in Dubbo because CSU is looking to establish a campus there; it is in its nurturing stage, its very early stage. They are very concerned, because it has not properly got off the ground yet and this could well nip it in the bud. The Pro Vice-Chancellor of Charles Sturt, Dr Peter Hodgson, is quoted as saying that enrolments at the new campus could be `seriously adversely affected' if country students were unable to access HECS loans which offered minimal interest rates. He is further quoted as saying:
Charles Sturt University does not believe there is any need to reform the current HECS system which gives low-income students the opportunity to receive a tertiary education.
We do have real concerns that any changes to the system could have serious implications for the Dubbo campus and for country students.
I know several students who are undertaking distance education and are using the Dubbo campus. They find that it is a very good option for them. There is a course that enables enrolled nurses to upgrade their qualifications to become registered nurses. Being able to do it by distance education from the campus at Dubbo means that when they have to do their study blocks they do not have to leave town or they do not have so far to travel. These are the sorts of courses that lead to a better skilled work force in the regional and rural areas. Most of the women doing this course are married; they have mortgages; they have families; they have other commitments. If you told them that they had to be charged commercial interest rates to repay or to pay up-front, they would not be able to do it, they 
 would not even consider it, because the commercial interest rates would make the repayment of their fees something that was beyond their wildest expectations.
We have a shortage of registered nurses in this state, in this country. When we see this sort of thing happening, when we see these types of proposals being bandied around by the government—although we are now told they have gone into the bottom drawer, one has to wonder how long they will stay there—it is not just for the universities that we have to be concerned. It is for issues like the number of registered nurses in rural and regional areas. Because these people are upgrading their qualifications from enrolled nurses to registered nurses and because they are already established in the rural areas, with family there, they are going to stay there. They are going to become a very important pool of professional resources for us. We need to be able to offer them the full range of facilities so that they can continue to study in their own regions.
We do not want this government to have proposals that are going to affect the ability of people who live in the regions to be able to access regional universities. This government has to be condemned for even thinking along these lines. People need to be alert that that bottom drawer can easily be slipped open and that that proposal can resurface. It has happened before: it happened with Telstra, it happened with the GST.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,1999-10-20,"—I rise to support the second reading amendment moved by Senator Carr this morning. The amendment is very telling in respect of this government's performance. It notes that the quality of Australian education institutions is of prime importance to our future, both economically and culturally, and it condemns the government for damaging the quality of Australian education by its cuts to universities, its lack of commitment to equity issues and its mismanagement of the education export industry. But the government does not stop there, not at all. The higher education report for the 1999-2001 triennium put out by the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs provides a damning indictment 
 of this government's performance. In a way it holds the portent of what Dr Kemp recently endeavoured to implement. It is set out in the overview of the report, which states:
Each year the minister responsible for higher education announces the details of Commonwealth funding for universities for the coming triennium in a higher education funding report.
It then goes on to say:
In the past these reports have described developments in the previous years . . . 
Paraphrasing, it then goes on to say that this year's report has a `wider scope'; I emphasise that. Why? We now know why; Dr Kemp had another agenda. But when we examine the objectives that were put forward in the higher education report the government's objectives for higher education are stated to be to expand opportunity, to assure quality, to improve universities' responsiveness to varying student needs and industry requirements, to advance the knowledge base and contribution to national and global innovation and, continuing the quote from page 1:
. . . to ensure public accountability for the cost-effective use of public resources.
What have they done? They certainly have not done that. What they have done speaks volumes for what Dr Kemp has outlined. It speaks very loudly indeed for this bill. This bill sets the amounts for grants to higher education institutions for the year 2001 as well as varying the amounts for 1999 and 2000. It also takes the extraordinary step of phasing out the Higher Education Equity Merit Scholarship Scheme. So instead of promoting, it is detracting. I would like to comment on the government's proposal in this area to scrap the Higher Education Equity Merit Scholarship Scheme. If you go to the report that was put out in March 1999 and look at what they have to say about the equity scheme on page 65, you will see that it goes through and sets out the merit based equity scholarship scheme in 1999 and the allocation of the various institutions, of which the total sum, over the page, on 66, is in the order of $3,000. It says:
A review of the effectiveness of the scheme has recently been carried out. Options—
there is an `s'—
for the future are to be considered by the government during 1999.
That is code for: `There is only one option—close it down. Let us not look at the objectives that we set ourselves back on page 1 about expanding opportunities; let us look at the objective of closing them down.' You would have to be Nostradamus to be able to read between the lines of the March 1999 higher education report and get to the true meaning. Only with the effluxion of time do these matters get teased out by Dr Kemp, put down and brought out. Only through that process are we able to discover what he has in store for higher education. Page 1 of the higher education March 1990 book states:
. . . to provide a wider scope . . . to provide an outline of developments in higher education teaching . . . to provide the objectives . . . 
This is all set out on page 1, neatly, cleanly and concisely. But none are followed. You have to go to the code and read between the lines to find out, or be Nostradamus—one or the other.
This policy they put forward—the option, rather than options—was the only positive policy they had in respect of higher education, and they have scrapped it. The proportion of students from rural, isolated and low socioeconomic status backgrounds declined between 1991 and 1997. These groups remain significantly underrepresented in higher education. It is simply incomprehensible that this government would remove the one incentive given to these people to pursue further education. In my home state of Queensland it is extremely difficult for people in rural areas to attend university without government assistance. These people have already suffered as a result of skyrocketing HECS charges and more restricted access to Austudy. With the scrapping of the scholarship scheme, it just ends up being another kick by this government to these people. Unfortunately, this backward step is not all that surprising. It is symptomatic of this government's user-pays philosophy on education, ensuring that it is only available to those who can afford to pay.
This bill also details funding for tertiary education institutions up to the year 2000, as 
 I have earlier stated, which this government proposes will remain at the same level it was 15 years ago. It would be unthinkable that any other government-provided social service of this importance would be expected to operate with the same level of funding that was received earlier last decade. If you go to the report, again you find the code which talks about it. The report talks about emerging issues on page 23. It states:
The higher education sector is adjusting to changing circumstances and its financial health is improving.
Which is code for: `There is no need for more funding; it is okay. She'll be right, mate.' That is what they are trying to say. The government obviously believe that education is of low priority, that it does not warrant any increase in funding. In fact, they believe that it deserves to lose funding increases won under the former Labor government. Labor continues to believe that not only is it the right of all Australians to access higher education but that the government has an obligation to ensure that quality education is provided through appropriate funding levels. The meagre funding proposals in this bill yet again highlight the Howard government's appalling record on higher education; one which all members of this government should be ashamed of.
Since this government came to power in 1996 the HECS charges have increased drastically, the repayment threshold has been lowered to well below average weekly earnings and funding was slashed by over $800 million. This record alone, with the alarming changes recently proposed in a leaked cabinet submission, sends a message to all Australians that this government does not care about your rights to an education unless you can afford to pay for it yourself.
At a time when the rest of the world is embracing education as the key to each nation's future, the Australian government is punishing those who want to pursue further education through imposing on them ever increasing debt and substandard learning environments. This government's record looks even worse when compared with the success of former Labor governments. Labor govern 
 ments ensured that tertiary education was within everyone's reach. Under Labor, participation in tertiary education was based on merit, not on your ability to bear a considerable debt.
Labor invested heavily in our nation's future by committing just under three per cent of GDP to investment in education, as compared to this government's paltry 2.3 per cent. This government should stand condemned for its lack of planning for the future of this country through the neglect of the education of its people. It is this government's obligation to ensure that our people, particularly young people, are equipped with the skills and knowledge to enable them to contribute to society in the future. Education is a right which should be open to every Australian. An educated population is vital to the growth and advancement of our country. This government should be judged harshly, and will be judged harshly, in years to come for its failure to realise this.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-10-20,"—I thank senators for their contributions and reiterate that the government has reaffirmed its previous stance on a number of matters of higher education. Although not relevant to this bill, it is important for the record to reaffirm this once again: fees will not be deregulated, vouchers will not be introduced, HECS will not be charged for TAFE, the current HECS system will remain, there will be no additional loan system or a real interest rate attached to the current HECS system, and the current system of government subsidies and funded places will remain, as will the prohibition on charging fees for HECS liable places. That fairly and squarely meets the second reading amendments which have been proposed by both the opposition and the Australian Democrats and makes it quite clear to the community at large as to where this government stands on those issues.
I note that some senators in this debate have mentioned the abolition of the merit based equity scholarships. The equity and access centrepiece of the current higher education system is HECS. The HECS deferred payment arrangements ensure that a 
 student is not prevented from going to university because that particular student cannot afford to pay fees up-front. It allows across-the-board access to higher education. Changes to the HECS system have been ruled out and, as Minister Kemp has said, the current HECS system will remain. I might add that no-one with an existing merit based equity scholarship will lose it. Existing scholarship holders will continue to be HECS exempt for the duration of the scholarship. The status quo in relation to HECS will continue. It is the government's priority that there be access to tertiary education by all Australian students who are willing and able to participate in that sector. The unmet demand for undergraduate places has almost been met.
The government believes that there has been an increase in enrolments in the tertiary sector since it has been in office. Minister Kemp announced a sum of money for salary supplementation for individual universities. There is funding of $250 million over three years, which will be made available on the condition that universities undertake workplace reform in the interests of students and academics alike. That spells good news for universities across Australia. I notice that the NTEU has criticised this, but one has to question its motives for doing so, because what we have here is a reform and funding for that reform which are a step forward in terms of salaries and workplace arrangements in universities across Australia.
The arrangements for universities in Australia have been that the government has allowed fee paying students domestically and this has made increased revenue available to universities. It has allowed those students who previously were unable to access courses in the tertiary sector to now do so. These are fee paying domestic students. This has increased access and also revenues to universities. The government has also announced tax reform for those areas of the private sector that want to contribute to the tertiary sector, and that has been welcomed as well. The remainder of the points that have been made can be dealt with adequately at the committee stage. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-10-20,"—Let me outline the position of the opposition. We will be opposing the government's motion. Therefore, we will be voting to insist that the amendments carried by the Senate when the bill was dealt with a month or two ago should stand. The government in the House of Representatives has moved, and it was carried, an amendment which would establish a Forest Products Advisory Council. That is the amendment that Minister Ellison referred to a moment ago. Our position is that we believe that the amendments that we originally moved in the Senate but which were not carried—to establish a Wood and Paper Industry Council—are more appropriate and, accordingly, we will be moving an amendment to once again put that to the Senate. That amendment, I understand, has been circulated and is set out on sheet 1617. 
To summarise our position, we will oppose the government's motion insofar as it relates to not insisting upon the Senate's amendments previously carried. In relation to the government's proposal for a Forest Products Industry Council, we will move an amendment that would establish a Wood and Paper Industry Council. If that amendment is not carried by the Senate—but we hope that on this occasion the Democrats will reconsider their position and support it—then we would, rather reluctantly, ultimately support the government's proposal. Although we believe it is a long way short of the desirable outcome, it is nevertheless better than nothing. I hope that is clear. That may therefore require the vote to be taken separately, although we are happy to have the issues treated together.
—In the light of your comments, can I confirm that you would now like the question to be divided?
—Yes, thank you, Mr Temporary Chairman. I note also that Senator Brown has circulated two amendments to be moved in addition to the amendment that has been carried by the House of Representatives, namely, the amendment establishing a Forest Products Advisory Council. I will indicate our attitude to Senator Brown's amendments at the appropriate time.
I will now make some remarks in regard to the government's refusal to consider any of the amendments that were carried by this Senate. I remind the government and senators generally that this debate spanned six days. It was lengthy and detailed, and there is no doubt that a lot of attention was given to the important issues by the Senate at that time. Further, this is a matter that has been widely canvassed for quite some time. We are therefore very disappointed at the way in which Minister Tucker flippantly treats the very considered amendments carried by this chamber. His response publicly after the Senate carried the legislation with those amendments was, in his usual bullying fashion, to try and stand up the Senate and the parliament and say that he would consider withdrawing the legislation. His attitude was that these amendments would not be given any serious con 
 sideration at all by him or the government. His message to the Senate was, `You had better pass my bill, or else.' That is reflective of his attitude all the way through the development of this legislation.
When he came to deal with the bill last week in the other place, he demonstrated his hypocritical and inconsistent approach; and he demonstrated that his approach is a political one, not one that is based on a balanced approach and a balanced assessment looking for a balanced outcome in a very difficult issue. For instance, he rejected our perfectly reasonable objects clause, yet in his opening remarks in the debate in the other place last week he stated:
The Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 provides legislative support to the outcomes being achieved under the regional forest agreement process. The government is working cooperatively with the states to implement the National Forest Policy Statement, which is the framework for a long-term and lasting resolution of forest industry, conservation and community interests and expectations concerning our nation's forests.
So at the very outset he acknowledges the importance of the principles of the National Forest Policy Statement, but he point blank refuses to even include in the bill an objects clause that will reflect the principles of that statement.
Subsequently, however, in his own amendment establishing the Forest Products Industry Council, in what is clearly a political move designed to win over some support from the union movement for his proposals, he has agreed to include recognition of the wood and paper industry strategy. It is rather ironic, because the wood and paper industry strategy was one developed by the previous Labor government as a consequence of the principles of the National Forest Policy Statement. That was a strategy that was abandoned by this government when it came to office, but now this minister, in a rather cynical way, is prepared to give recognition to that in his half-baked proposal for a Forest Products Advisory Council. It is clearly inconsistent. Why on the one hand object to a perfectly reasonable, sensible and necessary objects clause but on the other hand in another amendment give some recognition to it? I will 
 come back to the Forest Products Industry Council and our proposal for the Wood and Paper Industry Council a little later.
The minister has also gone around the country in his usual fashion attacking the Labor Party and attacking the Senate, claiming that we are frustrating the process. He is now claiming that somehow, as a result of this legislation not being passed, all RFAs will not be completed by 31 December this year. The delays are due entirely to this minister. If one has followed his performance over past months, one can see him chop and change from day to day or week to week. One day he is attacking the industry and the New South Wales government for their agreement on the north coast forests, trying to play the role of an environmentalist. The next day he is attacking the Western Australian government. There is absolutely no consistency in his approach, and that has been demonstrated by his reaction to the amendments put forward by the Senate.
I turn quickly to one other issue. No doubt I will need to make some further remarks on it later in this committee consideration. The minister has claimed, in his reasons for rejecting our proposal for disallowance procedures, that they are unconstitutional. It is quite clear that his arguments just give support to the old maxim that you can get whatever legal advice you want if you frame the question accordingly. In what has to be one of the greatest jokes of all time from this minister, he says that we do not need a disallowance process or a parliamentary scrutiny process. I quote from his reasons:
Further, if there is a concern that RFA requirements are not being complied with, it is open to parliament to amend or repeal the bill.
This is a bill that, when enacted, is supposed to give certainty to this industry. Yet this minister says he will not accept parliamentary scrutiny at the outset of the process but that, if there is a problem somewhere over the next 20 years, the parliament can come back and amend the legislation. That is a nonsensical proposition and a dangerous proposition for this industry.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-10-20,"—The Greens will not be voting for the House 
 of Representatives resolution that we should drop the amendments that the Senate put to the House. Even with those amendments, the forest industry gets lay down misere through this regional forest agreements legislation. I will remind the committee that this legislation is basically a corroboration of the regional forest agreements whereby the Prime Minister has signed away the powers and responsibilities of the federal parliament to the states and the woodchip corporations over Australia's native forests for the next 20 years. In particular, the legislation provides that, where the forests—or the wildlife in them—are to be protected by federal decree in those 20 years, the woodchip corporations are to be compensated by Australian taxpayers for the value of those forests for which the woodchip corporations have never paid a red cent—nothing at all. What has astounded me about this whole process is that those very woodchip corporations have cried crocodile tears over jobs in the forests right down the line and yet there is no provision in the legislation and no move by the House of Representatives—that is, the government—in this process to provide for compensation for workers who lose their jobs, not even for the reskilling of them.
This is a heist of the Australian people's forests for a small number of rich corporations to maraud the unprotected forests of this nation, largely to send those forests as woodchips to Japan, Korea, China and other destinations in the Northern Hemisphere where they are converted into paper and enter the disposal cycle. The grandest forests of this country end up in the landfills of the Northern Hemisphere, and where the forests are destroyed the wildlife is destroyed with them.
As I have explained to the Senate in the previous full debate on this matter, the cycle in Tasmania is to cut down the grand forests, firebomb to prevent any regrowth of rainforest or competing species, and then poison the area with 1080 to kill any wildlife coming into the area. And this legislation is to compensate that process, augment it, foster it and extend it. As you will remember, Mr Temporary Chairman Lightfoot, during this debate when I asked the government representative about—and challenged that representative 
 over—so-called ecologically sustainable logging that this legislation is supposed to foster, she sat glued to her seat because there is no defence of the doublespeak.
Ecologically sustainable logging, according to Prime Minister Howard's pacts with several premiers, means total destruction of the forests and their replacement with genetically modified, fast growing eucalypts or pines for the further enhancement of the woodchip corporations' interests further down the line. All this is totally unnecessary because, as you know, there are enough plantations in this country to provide all its wood needs.
Even when it comes to the balance of payments, the myth that is put about by people—including the government spokesperson on forests and so-called conservation, Mr Tuckey—is that we are somehow imbalanced in a way which requires us to continue the destruction of our native forests. In fact, we export twice as much wood as we import. The problem is that the industry, because it is rapacious and greedy, does not downstream process in this country or create the jobs here. It allows that to happen elsewhere and we import goods based on wood at twice the cost that we export our wood. So we end up basically with this terrible process where we export much more than we bring into the country, but we pay more for what we bring into the country than what we export. There is nothing in this legislation or in the amendments coming back from the House of Representatives that is going to meet that problem and get Australia the advantage that it could have through downstream processing of its plantations, protection of its native forests and a commitment by the industry, as well as government, to look after the jobs of those in the forests.
The regional forest agreement signed in Tasmania is a fraud. It is a fraud that has been perpetrated on the workers in the industry. Those Tasmanian senators who are present will have read the weekend press in Tasmania which highlighted a group of transport operators committed to the logging industry. They talked about how they had come to this parliament to protest against conservationists and in favour of the wood 
 chipping industry but in the last few weeks, in the wake of the regional forest agreement whereby Prime Minister Howard and others indicated that they were acting in the `interests of the workers', they have been dumped. They have huge repayments on their machinery and they have no way of paying them. Some of those men and their families are going to end up in bankruptcy.
Where is the logging industry? Where is the government? Where is the Bacon Labor government in Tasmania, which supports this fraudulent process? Where is the Prime Minister to succour these people who have now been put on the garbage tip and have been thrown out of work, along with nearly 500 others who have suffered a similar fate, since the woodchip organisations managed to get the Prime Minister's and the Premier's signatures on the bottom of a regional forest agreement? Then we are asked in this Senate to endorse that process.
The sad thing about this is that even the Labor Party's amendments left Tasmania out in the cold. There is no review process in these proposals either from the House of Representatives or from the Senate to enable the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement to be vetted by the Senate. We are supposed to accept, as a parliament, a mechanism whereby the Prime Minister and the state Premier have signed an agreement to hand across the forests to the sectional interests of the big corporations who are not based in Tasmania—neither their headquarters nor their shareholders are—but at the same time to underwrite them should there be any future federal move on behalf of the nation or Tasmanians in particular to protect our forests. The whole process is shameful. It is disgusting.
Nevertheless, I am hopeful that these minimalist amendments which the Senate agreed to will be insisted upon. How dare the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, who has conserved nothing since he entered that portfolio, rail against the Senate for these minimalist amendments which, amongst other things, would see the regional forest agreements on the mainland, with the exception of the early agreements signed in East Gippsland and in Victoria, brought before the parlia 
 ment. The taxpayers are underwriting them; should not the parliament be vetting them? Of course it should. As a Green I will be supporting these amendments for the little improvement that they do make to what is a parlous sell-out of the nation's interest, which the regional forest agreement process and this legislation represent.
I have to foreshadow that I will be moving amendments to the amendment brought up here from the House of Representatives so that if there is—and this is another gift to the industry—a forest products, taxpayer funded council set up, it is not just those who wield chainsaws that are on the council but also representatives from the forest related tourism industry, because that is where the job creation in forests is in Tasmania. There are more people getting jobs out of the preservation of our forests, intact, in Tasmania—more than 3,000 these days—than are involved in the destruction of native forests.
I will also be moving an amendment to say that there should be represented on such an industry council people who are interested in forest related water industries, because there has been a lot of contention not only in this country but also right around the world about the damage to water catchments that accrues from logging—and not just through the pollution of streams by direct run-off and by soiling of streams. I remember an indigenous person in Sarawak describing their river, which used to be pristine and full of fish but now was neither, as looking like a river of Milo—referring to the Nestle product—because that is just what their river looked like. Rivers in Australia downstream of logging operations look much the same.
Of course, there is the added hazard after the logging industry has moved in of the spraying of pesticides and, on occasions, herbicides into the fast growing plantations. These are particularly vulnerable, genetically modified plantations which replace these forests very often in the headwaters of rivers which are used for a variety of other purposes, including drinking water for people living downstream. Water is an industry these days and that very important commercial as 
 well as environmental entity should be represented on any such council.
Earlier I supported the proposal put forward by the Labor Party as an alternative, which I think is superior, and I would make a minor amendment to ensure that a representative of the Australian Conservation Foundation is on the council that is proposed there. I support the Senate's stand on this matter. I hope that the Senate will remain resolute. I take the opportunity again to condemn the legislation while adding support to these very minor, around the edges amendments which the Senate has made and put to the House of Representatives and which the House of Representatives is, in the interests of the woodchip corporations, trying to eliminate.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-10-20,"—The reasons why the government does not support these amendments and in particular the amendments which tie regional forest agreements to a new objects clause, thus enabling disallowance by either house, have already been explained to the Senate in the previous debate and I do not propose to go over those matters again. I would, however, like to take a few moments to explain to the opposition the practical consequences of their disallowance proposal. This amendment would require that proposed RFAs be tabled in each house, and each house then has 15 sitting days to disallow. This is to be preceded by certain procedural requirements, including publication of the proposed RFA in the gazette, and it includes the RFAs signed in Western Australia, north-east Victoria and Eden.
It is highly probable that there would be an attempt to disallow all these RFAs in the Senate, and the opposition itself has implied that it will seek to disallow the Western Australian RFA. Given that the remaining uncompleted RFAs are not likely to be signed before mid-December at the earliest, the consequence of the opposition's amendments would be the immediate cessation of woodchip processing in all areas except those where RFAs were signed before 1 March 1999, because the exporters would have no guarantee that their product could be shipped. 
 The parliamentary sitting schedule means that this would be the case even if the government were to move to extend the existing licences for a short period and regardless of whether or not the RFAs were eventually disallowed by the Senate. The mere fact that Senate approval was required would prevent a woodchip exporter from processing residues.
For those RFAs disallowed by the Senate there would be no certainty of a final resolution at all, given the need to negotiate sequentially with the states and the Senate. No doubt the Greens and the Democrats would be very pleased with this outcome, but it would cause massive disruption to the native hardwood timber industry in Western Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and possibly even Tasmania. Timber mills would either close or lay off workers, and contractors would be unemployed. These impacts would hit hardest in small mills where sales of residue play a larger part in cash flow. There are no circumstances under which the government would allow this to happen and therefore it cannot support the amendments. I am surprised, Senator Murphy, that you are supporting these amendments, given your usual stand on the rights of the workers and the way in which you want to support industries in Tasmania, because your state will be hit hardest by these.
—You will hear from me in due course.
—There would also need to be a freeze on industry development and restructuring assistance negotiated as part of RFAs, further penalising industry and stifling investment prospects. Industry has pushed the need for RFA-led certainty legislation, and it has strongly expressed the view that it would be more secure without the bill rather than have an amended bill as proposed which would deliver additional uncertainty. Therefore, the only thing that these amendments are achieving is delaying the bill until after all the RFAs are signed and preventing the government from getting on with the job of restructuring the industry under secure RFA regimes. After all the RFAs are signed, the effect of the amendments would be to prevent almost all woodchip exports for a period ranging 
 from some months to indefinitely—a position which I am assuming the opposition will not promote.
As we all know, the government has previously tabled advice from the Office of General Counsel that the parliamentary scrutiny provisions proposed by the opposition are unconstitutional. I note that the shadow minister for justice argued against this view in the other place and raised some interesting legal issues. However, at the end of the day, an argument about whose legal advice is better will not matter one whit.
The real vote on this bill will be taken by those people who are contemplating major investment in this industry which, I remind the Senate, currently runs an annual trade deficit of almost $2 billion. Those people are telling us that they will not invest without the security provided by this bill as originally put forward by the government. So the choice is now with the opposition.
Senator Forshaw, you mentioned that you were disappointed. I am also disappointed with the attitude of the opposition. You can either support the government in not insisting on these amendments or you can again support the amendments which I have clearly explained to you would cause unemployment among the very people whom you claim to represent. You would also cause massive disruption to an industry which you purport to support. The choice is yours.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-10-20,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the documents.
Documents Nos 22 and 23 deal with the way our companies are regulated in Australia. These reports come out of Treasury. They used to come out of the Attorney-General's Department but, in recent years, corporations have been regulated through the Treasury because the government wants to give emphasis to the function of companies involved in producing goods and services so that the country can become more wealthy, and that is a good thing. But companies are not simply about that. There are other aspects of them that should be looked at. These two reports are interesting in their contrasts. The first is a report from the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee. That is a committee dedicated to enabling company law to be so arranged as to give companies the ability to flourish as they should. They have much to do with matters like CLERP.
The other report is from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. It also deals with the sorts of things that the first report deals with. In addition, it points out the other issues that are very much alive in the corporate world. On page 33 of the report, the Chairman, Mr Alan Cameron, notes that, during the period that this report covers, `$6.5 million was recovered for miners who worked at Cobar. An amount of 87 cents in the dollar was recovered for those people.' Unfortunately, there is no mention here of other areas where workers have been left without their due reward—areas like Mount Schank, Wodonga and others which have now become famous.
What this report does is to indicate that companies now affect the lives of all of us—not only our working lives but also the lives that we may lead in terms of leisure. Companies affect the environment. There is now a provision in the Corporations Law requiring companies to give an account of how they 
 have looked to the care of the environment during the course of a particular reporting period. That is important to understand: companies are now so fundamental to the sorts of lives that we all live that it is time this parliament became more and more conscious of that fact and made laws that require companies not only to produce the income and wealth they do but also to act in a way that is consistent with the sort of life that we all want to lead. We have dealt with the way that powerful interests have acted in the past, and it is now time for us to look at companies—not only multinational companies but companies generally—to see them for what they are and to make our laws so that not only the economy is looked to but also every other aspect of our lives.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1999-10-20,"—I rise tonight to continue a series of speeches drawing the attention of the Senate to problems in regional Australia. We had previously discussed a number of specific regions and difficulties faced by smaller centres in rural and regional Australia—centres on the New England of New South Wales, in western Victoria and in the Hunter Valley. The key theme of the speeches was that the role of government had to shift from being a doer and a director to being a change leader in line with the 1994 McKinsey report. Last week I focused on some of the influences of worldwide economic forces as they are impacting on specific industries and which in turn impact on various regions. I spoke last week about the BHP shut down of the investment in most of its steel operations. I expressed my disappointment at that time that BHP was not prepared to stay in a comprehensive steel industry and that the vision of the founders of BHP, in particular Delprat and Lewis, had been lost in the passage of time.
I rise today on a matter of great public interest in another industry—that is, the revolution that is currently sweeping across the banking industry. Last Wednesday, Westpac announced its plan to axe a further 3,000 jobs across Australia. Since 1991, Westpac has axed some 10,000 in total and 
 this further cut will reduce its staff by another 10 per cent. It will also close another 300 branches. According to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald on 14 October this year, the latest axings from Westpac include 700 jobs in rural and regional New South Wales, 800 in Queensland, 300 in Victoria and 295 in back office jobs in a number of states. According to the report in the Australian on 14 October, Westpac will close down 200 rural branches. Of these, Westpac anticipates that some will be converted to in-store operations with the hope that staff that are shed might get a job there. According to the Newcastle Herald on 14 October, Westpac wants to achieve a national savings of $300 million.
The effect of this in my own region will be that branches with five staff or less will go in this national restructuring. The future of branches in this area—including Belmont, Cardiff, Cessnock, Charlestown, Maitland, East Maitland, Hamilton, Kurri Kurri, Morisset, Newcastle, New Lambton, Raymond Terrace, Swansea, The Junction, Toronto, Wallsend and Warners Bay—is unclear. Not surprisingly, the Hunter Region Organisation of Councils has been scathing of the Westpac restructuring. The Hon. Milton Morris, former minister from 1965 to 1975 in New South Wales, had this to say:
This is an absolute kick in the teeth to country regions particularly. The rapacious attitude and the greed of the banks knows no bounds.
The Managing Director of Westpac, Mr David Morgan, says that there is still too much excess capacity in his organisation. What a change of attitude! If we go back 20 years, I remember one particular banking company screening TV ads of a man fighting his way through the bush and pushing branches out of the way, the ad carrying a caption that a certain bank had branches everywhere. That is what they were pushing at that time. This was seen as a great thing. Of course, that is no longer true.
I gained some insight into why the banks have changed their minds when I had a senior executive from one of the big four banks come to see me. He went through the way in which they decided to close their branches. It is a very simple method: they list them in 
 order of profitability—most profitable through to least profitable—and then close the least profitable. You do not have to be an expert to work out where the least profitable are; they are usually in regional and rural Australia.
—But they are still profitable.
—They are still profitable, that is true, but they have a lower profitability, so they are shut. If the banks are making money, in my mind, there is no reason why such branches should not remain open. The combined profits of the big four banks was $9.2 billion last year. Isn't that enough? Have the banks really lost their way on the balance between the interests of their stakeholders? Let me remind the Senate who their stakeholders are. Sure, it is the shareholders; but it is also the customers, the staff and the community. The banks are now totally focused on shareholders, with very little interest in the customers, the staff or the community.
Recently, in the launch of his book, Managing in Australia, the former Telstra CEO, Frank Blount, commented very astutely:
The role of CEO is to optimise long-term shareholder value.
It does not mean that you block out everything else like your social responsibility in communities where you work, play and invest.
You've got to balance all 4 stakeholders—community; staff; customers and shareholders.
That was said by a person who was a leader of one of the biggest organisations in Australia up until recently. In the bid to make more profit, the banks are forgetting that they are a necessary service that should be available to all Australians, including people living in rural and regional areas. The Australian public have become understandably cynical about the commitment of the banks to their area. How much profit is enough and when will banks really start giving back to the community? What they are doing instead is actually taking from the community, particularly in rural and regional Australia.
If you look at the pattern of the close down of branches, you see that in 1994 there were 6,747 bank branches in Australia, whereas in 1998 there were 5,615. Therefore, more than 
 1,132 branches have shut down. Since 1993, out in the rural and regional areas, there has been a 20.5 per cent reduction in the number of country branches by the big four banks. Even more shutdowns are on the horizon. Is the solution for the banks just closure and axing jobs?
There are some hopeful signs that the banks are starting to respond to community outrage. After I visited Tenterfield about a year ago I issued a press release welcoming ANZ's decision not to close any more rural branches in the next 12 months. Westpac announced on 13 October this year that by the year 2000, 200 traditional branches will be converted to in-store operations. That shows some sign of improvement, rather that the banks taking the attitude that they are just going to leave town. As I said before, 300 branches have been closed and 200 transaction centres are being opened. But they have scaled down their operations and lost a total of 100 branches.
Colonial State Bank was the leader in the establishment of in-store branches, and they should be congratulated on that. When I was in Tenterfield I did go into their corner store bank. It is set up in a corner, there are full banking facilities, with three people behind the counter, all the logos, all the stuff that is there when you normally go into a bank, and it operates out of a local business. This is great news for local business because when people come into the hardware store to do their banking, they are obviously going to do some shopping as well. So it is win-win situation all around.
But we have to recognise that what the banks are doing here is cutting their overheads considerably, and those that are keeping open the in-store banking operations should be congratulated; they manage to cut their costs but still retain their service. One would hope that the banks would adopt a socially responsible position whereby if they were the last bank to leave town, from this point on, they would actually open one of these in-store branches and leave that sort of thing behind.
What we have to realise, as we move through to using this new technology in this new information age, is that some of the technology does not replace face-to-face 
 service. The government has introduced rural transaction services, which take up part of the slack. One would hope that this will substitute until the banks take a socially responsible position.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Australia: Banking Services </title>,Adjournment,22,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-10-20," asked the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 25 August 1999:
(1) Is it correct that Centrelink staff are not required to give their full names to members of the public or clients.
(2) Does this not make an already unequal relationship even more demeaning and disempowering, given that clients have to disclose personal details while the staff member can choose to remain anonymous.
(3) After a person becomes eligible for intensive assistance: (a) how long does that person have to wait before it is provided; (b)	 does the waiting period vary from region to region; if so, how: (c)	  does it vary over time; if so, how; (d) is there any limit to the waiting period; and (e) what factors determine the length of the waiting period.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Centrelink: Staff</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,25,1,question
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1999-10-20,"—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
(1) It is not policy or practice for Centrelink staff to withhold their names from the public. Centrelink is committed to providing a quality service to the public. The only circumstance where a Centrelink staff member has the option of not disclosing their full name is when they have been threatened or harassed by a customer. Under the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991, Centrelink has a duty of care responsibility to protect the health and safety at work of its staff. Most customers do not behave in a manner which would require staff to adopt such a means of securing their safety. However, when a staff member is threatened or harassed by a customer, the staff member may choose to use only their first name in correspondence to the particular customer who has made a threat.
(2) Centrelink takes its responsibilities to both customers and staff seriously and does not believe that the protection of a staff member from a threatening and potentially unsafe situation, as outlined above, to be demeaning and disempowering for the customer.
(3) (a)The period between the time a job seeker becomes eligible for Intensive Assistance and their 
 referral to a Job Network member depends on the number of job seekers who have previously been assessed as eligible and the number of positions available with local Job Network members.
As job seekers are placed in employment, or exit Intensive Assistance after completing their placement with a Job Network member, new job seekers are referred to these members.
Referrals occur in chronological order of the date job seekers are assessed as eligible for this assistance.
(b) Yes. It varies according to the number of Intensive Assistance places available and the rate at which job seekers leave Intensive Assistance either for work or because their placement has finished. In areas with a more active labour market, or more successful Job Network members, this turnover will be quicker and waiting times shorter.
It also depends on the number of eligible job seekers within a particular area. In areas where there are comparatively more eligible job seekers, the waiting time for referral could be longer.
(c) Yes it can. If the employment within a particular area increases and more job seekers in Intensive Assistance return to work, more vacancies are created with the Job Network members. Also, job seekers awaiting placement with a member may find work prior to referral and the waiting times in that area can decrease.
If there is a downturn in employment, and more job seekers are identified who are eligible for Intensive Assistance, the number of job seekers leaving Intensive Assistance to return to work may reduce and waiting times may increase.
(d) There is no maximum waiting time for referral to Intensive Assistance. However, each Intensive Assistance placement lasts for 12 to 18 months (with a possible extension of up to 6 months if the Job Network member believes an employment outcome is likely). As job seekers complete their Intensive Assistance placement or leave for other reasons such as employment, other job seekers are referred.
This ensures that there is a turnover of job seekers through Intensive Assistance giving each eligible job seeker a chance to participate.
(e) Waiting times are determined by the number of Intensive Assistance positions available in a particular area, the number of job seekers who have 
 been previously assessed as eligible, but are still waiting referral, and the number of job seekers leaving Intensive Assistance because of employment or other reasons (like completion of placement).",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Centrelink: Staff</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,25,1,answer
