"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2010-05-11,"—I rise today to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 1) Bill 2010. The bill establishes a free superannuation clearing house for small services businesses with fewer than 20 employees. In addition, it makes changes to the tax treatment of managed investment schemes, managed investment trusts, the entrepreneurs’ tax offset and consolidations. Schedule 6 makes a number of housekeeping amendments.
The coalition supports the amendments contained in the schedules 2 to 6 of this bill. Many of these amendments will enhance investor certainty about the tax status of investments and, hence, should encourage additional investment. In particular, the changes to protect investors and managed investment schemes are a worthwhile response to the high-profile collapse of a number of these schemes. Under current arrangements investors can claim immediate deductions as long as a capital gains tax event does not occur within four years after the end of the income year in which the amount is first paid. These changes will protect the returns of investors from unanticipated, uncontrollable changes which cause schemes to collapse before the four-year rule is satisfied. Recently, the insolvency of several managed investment schemes has had a devastating and unexpected effect on investor funds. The Australian Taxation Office has not had the scope to provide relief to investors in these circumstances. This bill will change that and allow investors to keep their deductions where a capital gains tax event occurs because of factors outside the control of investors. Importantly, these amendments will apply retrospectively from 1 July 2007 providing some welcome relief to those affected by the recent collapses of some managed investment schemes. This bill also amends the tax law to allow managed investment trusts to make an irrevocable election to apply capital gains tax on the disposal of certain assets, such as shares and real property. Again, these provisions will provide greater certainty.
Schedule 4 introduces an income test for the entrepreneurs’ tax offset. The entrepreneurs’ tax offset was introduced by the former coalition government and took effect from 1 July 2005. Its aim was to provide greater incentives for very small businesses in the early stages of their development. This bill limits access to this concession by applying thresholds to taxable income over $70,000 for single individuals and $120,000 for families. Currently, eligibility for the entrepreneurs’ tax offset is not restricted by sources of income other than those derived from the small business. The coalition is concerned that these amendments will deter some from starting a business. This bill also makes some changes to the consolidation regime from a tax perspective. This regime has been continuously improved and the changes presented here stem from proposals of the former coalition government in 2007. Finally, schedule 6 contains a number of housekeeping amendments. It makes a number of minor changes to the existing tax law to ensure they operate as intended.
I turn now to schedule 1 of this bill, which introduces a superannuation clearing house. The coalition supports a superannuation clearing house for small businesses. The clearing house will provide small businesses with free access to services which allow them to pay their superannuation guarantee contributions in a block to an approved clearing house. Small businesses are then relieved of the need to split contributions into individual payments according to each employee’s respective superannuation fund. A clearing house provides scope to achieve economies of scale and reduces the overall costs of Australians saving for their retirement. This will reduce red tape for small business while maintaining choice for individuals to choose their own superannuation fund. Lower costs will improve the ability of small businesses to compete and will increase productivity and, ultimately, the wages of Australian workers.
The government likes to talk about slashing red tape and increasing productivity but has been slow to act in these instances. The government originally promised to establish the clearing house by 1 July 2009. Senator Sherry released a discussion paper in November 2008, but then over 12 months went by with no further news from the government. The deadline passed without a murmur. The superannuation industry was left doubting whether the reforms were progressing. There are private operators which already provide clearing house type services to businesses. How could they invest with any certainty while the government sat on changes that would affect the industry substantially? We should not be surprised by the government ignoring these effects. This government does not understand business. Few of its members have ever run one. As in so many other areas, the government put a high priority on discussion and consultation but less on actually delivering results. It appears that an election year has finally woken the government from its slumber.
Notwithstanding the coalition’s broad support for these changes, the specific proposals that are in front of us here are different from those that the government initially proposed. We do not think that many of these changes have been adequately explained. Originally the government proposed to tender the operation of the clearing house to the private sector. The Prime Minister made this promise in his original 2007 proposal. At the time, Senator Sherry claimed that the government’s proposal would not create a new bureaucracy, because the government would leverage off existing private sector providers. The discussion paper in late 2008 continued to support a tendering process, yet in November last year something changed. Suddenly the government announced that Medicare would operate the clearing house; no consideration was given to the private sector operators. On top of the uncertainty the government generated by inexplicably delaying the establishment of the clearing house, it then took away the option for private sector operators to provide these services as promised. What changed in the 12 months after the government released its discussion paper? No-one knows, and the government has provided no explanation. As one company payment adviser said:
We did not hear from Treasury or anyone associated with the Government after putting in our submission. We worked to develop this solution and a few other people looked at what they could do to provide a solution to small business. And it was quite a shock late last year for a press release to say that the Government was going to give it to Medicare.
The coalition has two major concerns with this surprise decision. First, it would appear that the government is again rushing the implementation of a new program without doing sensible due diligence beforehand. Second, the special advantages that this bill provides to Medicare could have harmful effects on competition in this sector and ultimately push up the costs for businesses with more than 20 employees. The Senate inquiry on this bill has revealed that Medicare is worryingly unprepared to deliver these services to small business. It might be easier if I simply listed all the things that Medicare has not done.
Medicare has no estimates on the cost of providing free clearing house services. How much will costs be affected by the ultimate take-up by small businesses? We do not know. The government has allocated $16.1 million over four years, but we have no certainty of whether this is enough. Second, Medicare has not finalised its data-processing system or the types of payments that are to be accepted. Third, Medicare has not developed key performance indicators for the scheme. It cannot say how it will deal with any of the errors that arise. Fourth, Medicare has no targets for business take-up or time lines for getting the system up and running by the due date, nor has it committed to any time lines for remitting contributions to personal accounts. Medicare told the Senate inquiry that it could not commit to a time, because it did not know if there would be ‘issues with matching and some requirements for us to do follow-up work’. Funds that are not quickly transferred to the relevant accounts can have adverse effects on investor returns. We would have seen that lately. Medicare has not revealed how it will deal with the massive quarterly peaks in workloads when payments arrive. Sixth, we have not been assured that Medicare will establish a sufficient database to protect the life insurance and other entitlements of members.
It is almost unbelievable that the government had not worked through these issues before committing to use Medicare as its approved clearing house. If it had made a request for proposals from the private sector for these services, the government could have asked for all this information in bid documents. We would then be in a position to undertake proper due diligence, review the capacity of different providers and use pressure on different competitors to sharpen their pencils and provide the best deal for taxpayers. Instead the government has chosen a provider without any of this information being available. We are in the dark, and Medicare itself appears to be in the dark on its ability to deliver.
The government and Treasury have claimed that Medicare has been chosen for risk management reasons, but when the chosen provider cannot inform us of the kinds of details that normally would be contained in a bid document, how rigorous can that risk management process be? As Craig Osborne, Managing Director of MicrOpay, commented:
Medicare is not looking at the full detail that needs to be achieved when there are adequate private enterprise solutions out there ... To run with a government agency that doesn’t have a track record in collecting this information and collecting these sorts of funds, and doing the disbursements and matching and cross-checking that’s needed to ensure the system is efficient, has not been addressed or even contemplated.
The Senate inquiry had a number of existing private providers which could provide clearing house services. These providers already have road-tested systems to process transactions. They know how much each transaction costs and they could implement the government’s policies quickly. Indeed, many of these providers would likely perform clearing house functions for much less than the estimated $16 million cost to Medicare. One private clearing house operator has already begun free services to small businesses without any government inducements. But overpaying for things has become a very bad habit for the Labor Party.
We have further reasons to be sceptical of the government’s decision to ignore these private providers and their reasons for it. A failure to manage risk is becoming a pattern. We have seen them ignore the risks highlighted to them on the pink batts program, with tragic consequences. We have seen them ignore the risks of rorting the solar hot water rebates. We have seen them ignore the risks of cost blow-outs in school halls. Once again here, we see a government that is being reactive, waiting for the risks to materialise before acting. We need a government that proactively identifies and mitigates risks in accordance with the best due diligence practices.
This whole delayed and incomplete process is reflective of the inherent paradoxes at the heart of the Labor government. They are slow to act but then hasty to decide. They spend years asking questions but then ignore the experts. They are busy creating announcements but do not follow them through to implementation. In summary, they are incompetent. They are managers of public policy—not necessarily a do-nothing government but an achieve-nothing government. The coalition believes that the government should return to their original plan. We believe that a competitive tendering process would provide the strongest guarantee for the transition to a clearing house which provides free and seamless service to small business while providing no interruption to the services and returns that members expect from superannuation funds.
But in addition to the process of establishing a clearing house there is also the actual impact that these arrangements will have on the existing providers in the sector. In particular, this bill delivers the approved clearing house a number of special advantages over its competitors. First, this bill provides that employers will be able to discharge their superannuation guarantee obligations by making a bulk payment to the approved clearing house on the 28th day of the month in each quarter when the payment is required. But current private clearing houses must themselves process the payments by the 28th day of the month in which the payments are due, which means that employers must make payments in advance of that date. Under these conditions, why would any employer not choose Medicare as its clearing house? Obviously there is a cash advantage in the cash management capacity of sending to a clearing house that has a later date of real acceptance.
Second, at the moment the Australian Securities and Investments Commission requires clearing houses, as financial service providers, to issue product disclosure statements which must detail the conditions of the facility, the fees and charges, how transactions are to be made and authorised, and any risks associated with the facility. So Medicare will have a lower compliance burden than private operators, and small businesses could end up with less information on the terms and conditions of their facility.
One of the last acts of the Keating government was to introduce principles of competitive neutrality in the delivery of government services. In simple terms, this requires governments to ensure that their own enterprises compete on a level playing field with private competitors. This bill contains elements that contradict the principles of competitive neutrality. Medicare will have a clear advantage over private sector clearing houses. The coalition view is that there is a simple way of correcting this issue. There is a real opportunity to create a more efficient superannuation clearing house market by extending the definition of ‘approved clearing house’ to privately operating clearing houses holding an AFS licence and subject to prudential requirements—a change of the term to include privately operating clearing houses. This will create a more level playing field and allow employers to make their superannuation guarantee payments to a number of clearing houses with the same deadlines. The government should also select a government subsidised clearing house following a competitive tendering process. The coalition’s changes would increase competition and could be expected to lower fees in the sector.
As I stated earlier, the coalition supports the broad changes in this bill. We support the changes to give investors greater certainty about the operation of the tax system. We support the principle of establishing a superannuation clearing house to lower compliance costs for small businesses. However, we do not support achieving this by giving a government entity an unfair advantage over private suppliers and private businesses and the aspirations of other Australians to participate in this market if they so choose. The coalition’s proposed amendments will maintain a level playing field among clearing house suppliers. Competition is the best way to ensure that these services are delivered at a lower cost—and the government on budget day should be more focused on lowering costs than at any other time during the year—and, more importantly, that these services are delivered in a way that guarantees no interruption to the timeliness of superannuation payments and accordingly protects members’ benefits.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2010 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2010-05-11,"—On the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 1) Bill 2010, which I think is generally supported except for some issues about the Medicare clearing house, I will deal with just the issues that the Senate Economics Legislation Committee was asked to look at, and they were whether the legislation will have unintended consequences for the superannuation market, whether it is anticompetitive in relation to privately operated clearing houses and whether Medicare is an appropriate agency to operate the clearing house.
Superannuation is very important to Labor governments and to our constituency. It is the basis of the savings pool of Australia and is particularly important for the retirement incomes of ordinary Australians, because they do not have the ability to increase their money through private savings that other people do. Therefore, superannuation and the administrative requirements around it are clearly of great priority for Labor governments. That is why this bill in relation to superannuation has been particularly well considered and is a good solution to the problem. The problem, as was outlined, is that many small businesses, with the choice of funds which was introduced in July 2005, have some administrative difficulties in sending off the superannuation guarantee payments to a variety of funds under a variety of different data arrangements. So the government promise before the election was to create a clearing house for small businesses such that they could simply send the superannuation guarantee fund to that clearing house. As soon as the clearing house received it, those small businesses would be in compliance with their obligations under the superannuation guarantee system.
So initially, as the opposition outlined, the government did indeed envisage that the clearing house would be put out to tender. But, despite Senator Joyce’s diatribe on risk and the evaluation of risk, he did not once in his speech mention the key piece of advice which persuaded the government to change that original proposal to have private companies do it. That key advice was that if a clearing house is put out to tender there is a risk that a private company, in the event of incompetence, fraud or outright failure, could potentially affect employee entitlements of all employers using the clearing house. In other words, if there were some problem within the private clearing house, employees who expected that their superannuation was going to their fund might suddenly find out that, as a result of fraud or some other failure in the private clearing house, their superannuation had not been going for years into the fund but had disappeared into a clearing house.
This is the situation we have occasionally seen in the United States with private funds. It would mean that employees, ordinary Australians, would suddenly find that they did not have the superannuation that they thought they had. This is clearly a huge risk for ordinary Australians and it would mean that the Australian government would therefore have a contingent liability—and I have certainly heard Senator Joyce wax long and lyrical about the dangers of contingent liabilities. So, rather than ignore it, the government dealt with the risk proposed by that, and the way they did it was to provide a government agency to deal with this. Rather than set up a bureaucracy to oversee, regulate and deal with the possibility of a failure of a private company—and then not even have that guaranteed to work—they decided that it would be more prudent and less risky on many levels to set up a government agency.
Fortunately, there is a government agency used to dealing with money coming in from small groups in small amounts, and dealing with it quickly and efficiently, and that agency is Medicare. Medicare are already doing this kind of work. In their evidence to our committee, Medicare were very confident of their ability to perform this additional responsibility well and efficiently, and they were very clear about this. Senator Joyce talked about KPIs and various other things and said that Medicare admitted that they did not have these procedures in place. But this was a gross misrepresentation of Medicare’s evidence. Medicare have set up a working group with involved parties to deliver a flexible, responsive and appropriate set of guidelines. They are confident that they will have those in place by the time this is up and running and they are confident that they can do it within the budget required.
Small businesses were happy with that response. Indeed, AustralianSuper very concisely illustrated that. As they said in the Senate Economics Legislation Committee report:
Australian Super also did not agree that allowing existing clearance houses to participate would be a more efficient way of processing superannuation for small business:
If the government were to offer subsidies to existing clearing house providers to focus a service on this segment of the market, they probably could have done it, but it would have to have been in conjunction with legislation introduced as we have seen Medicare looking at—mandatory electronic data, mandatory data standards, licensing, a guarantee on floats, and service standards on how long a clearing house can hold onto the money and send it to the funds. If your question is, ‘Could private clearing houses provide this service with the subsidy going to them?’ the answer is: yes, they could have, but it would not have been as effective as the model that we are looking at now, unless it were in conjunction with a whole list of additional criteria.
AustralianSuper raised in there another point—that Medicare now has the ability to organise the data standards and the arrangements so that they are uniform across the sector, making it even easier for small business to provide the correct data in a uniform manner that will enable further efficiencies in the sector.
As for the private sector being cut out of this sector, they are able now—and they will continue to be able—to provide a clearing house service if they wish. But the committee took evidence that, of the two million small businesses in Australia, only around two per cent are currently being provided with clearing house services by SuperChoice, the largest private provider. The private providers have not been especially active in seeking this business and, if they have, they have clearly not been very successful, because only two per cent of those small businesses are operating with them. We have to remember that this is only for small businesses employing 20 or fewer people. Private clearing houses are still able to get business from any small to medium enterprise that has 20 or more players. It is not as if the market is being taken away from them; they are still free to complete in that market.
Speaking of 20 or more employees, the one area of the bill that the committee did make some recommendation on was the limit of 20 being monitored to make sure that businesses that had spikes in employment were adequately catered for. We were assured that there would be some flexibility in there, but we would like to make sure that those businesses that might employ 10 or 15 and have a seasonal spike and put on another six, seven or 10 employees, will not be disadvantaged by the system and have to leave it temporarily.
It is quite clear from our evidence that the government were presented with an unacceptable risk in dealing with the issue of tendering out to private services for this clearing house. They dealt with the risk in a pragmatic and responsible way. I was very pleased to see that that then got industry support from a broad range of sources. Industry was very pleased that this happened—both small businesses and the superannuation industry. It is a rational and reasonable response and I would urge the chamber to support this bill.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2010 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2010-05-11,"—We believe this bill, the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 1) Bill 2010, providing for Medicare to be the clearing house for superannuation for small companies, will significantly disadvantage private organisations already in the field. It is interesting that during the 2007 election Kevin Rudd promised that the Labor government would establish a superannuation clearing house by 1 July 2009. Labor, of course, have failed to meet this promise. Prime Minister Rudd also promised that the clearing house would be contracted to the private sector. The discussion paper on the legislation issued in November 2008 also stated that the government would contract the clearing house to the private sector. However, in November 2009 the Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law, Mr Bowen, announced that Medicare would be awarded the contract. In other words, there was not to be any competition. The fact that there were private companies already providing this service was ignored. The government decided that Medicare, which had no experience at all in dealing with superannuation, would be awarded the contract to provide this clearing house service.
We find that very hard to accept and understand because the private clearing houses not only have a lot of experience in this area but are obviously going to be competitively disadvantaged by Medicare coming into this market. Treasury has not been able to explain why Medicare was awarded the contract by the government. We on the coalition side feel that the government should be getting best value for money, and yet no competitive tender was issued. We find that quite hard to understand. Witnesses to the Senate inquiry on the legislation, which I was involved in, indicated that Medicare has no experience in the superannuation field and does not know what it is getting itself into. It is inadequately prepared and it has not developed a business plan to provide this service.
The government has awarded $16.1 million to Medicare to operate the clearing house over a four-year period. However, many experts in the private sector have said that the costs will inevitably blow out and that Medicare will not be able to provide the service within this budget. Private sector companies have provided these services in the market for years and have designed and implemented innovative technology to deliver low-cost services to employers and superannuation funds. We find it very hard to understand, as I said, why the private sector has not been offered the opportunity to participate in the provision of this service.
At the inquiry, the Superannuation Information Centre submitted that the decision to send the clearing house to Medicare means that there is serious potential for large-scale economic waste. They pointed out that it is not clear if Medicare will be subject to the same professional indemnity insurance that private clearing houses are required to hold. Senator Hurley has said that there was concern that the private sector might default in some way and that employees would find that their funds for superannuation had not been passed on to the superannuation funds. But, of course, if these private sector companies have indemnity insurance then that is not a matter of concern. It seems that Medicare does not have private sector indemnity insurance and it may be that the real concern is whether or not Medicare will be the defaulter and whether employees may be at greater risk if Medicare is handling this service. If in some way there is a problem meeting deadlines and so on, employees may not be covered in the way they would be were the service provided by the private sector. These are very serious concerns that we in the coalition have with this legislation and we certainly believe that more consideration should be given to it.
But basically we are really concerned about why the government has not explained the reason for breaking its commitment to tender the service to the private sector, that Medicare has not publicly made a business case for establishing the clearing house and that many operators in the superannuation sector have expressed concern about the anticompetitive nature of this decision by the government.
We really do believe that there is a very strong case for private sector superannuation clearing houses to be given the opportunity to compete for this market. The sector’s largest clearing house, SuperChoice, told the Senate inquiry that currently it is processing around 20 million contributions on behalf of 50,000 employers, 40,000 of whom are employers with fewer than 20 employees. They account for two million-odd employees. SuperChoice said: ‘Overall we project about $7.2 billion will be cleared through our service. We estimate that it is around 20 per cent of the entire clearing market.’
The superannuation fund contracts the clearing house transactions to companies like SuperChoice who provide their services to the employers free of charge through their chosen super fund. We in the coalition believe that if the government goes ahead and introduces its own clearing house operator and enforces preferential regulations on that operator when compared to the currently operating clearing houses, the legislation has the potential to seriously impact upon the business of those privately operated clearing houses. In other words, giving this contract to Medicare may well so adversely affect some of these privately operating clearing houses that their businesses will be made non-viable.
At the inquiry which the Senate Economics Legislation Committee held, Westpac made the following comment in its submission on the different superannuation guarantee requirements:
This important difference means that private sector clearing houses, such as Westpac’s QuickSuper, will be forced to compete in a market distorted by the change and no longer uniform or equitable from public and private sector participants. This will have negative consequences for small business who choose to continue to use private sector clearing houses.
Westpac recommended that the legislation be amended to ensure clearing house standards are the same across both the private and public sectors.
While the intentions of Medicare may be to provide a superannuation clearing house to those employers who cannot currently access a free service, the legislation and regulations will allow absolutely any business with fewer than 20 employees access to a free service, and that is where the threat to the viability of the private superannuation clearing houses comes in. For example, the 40,000 employers who use the SuperChoice clearing house service will have an overwhelming incentive to switch to the free Medicare clearing house due to the far less stringent requirements for discharge of super guarantee payments through Medicare.
The government has recently said that the way superannuation can be strengthened is to drive efficiencies, reduce administrative costs and thus increase returns, and this is the exact opposite of what the superannuation sector will achieve by this bill in its current form if it is passed. As IFSA stated in their submission:
If the Item 3 amendment is passed as drafted, we would be concerned about the erosion of the “level playing field” in the provision of clearing house services.
IFSA has long maintained that competition is the key to an efficient and cost-effective superannuation system and that this should occur on a level playing field. Quite obviously, if Medicare is allowed to be the sole provider and it is providing its services free of charge, there will no longer be a level playing field.
AFSA, another superannuation provider, suggested that the legislation could be improved by amending it so as to provide a path forward whereby private sector organisations could achieve approved clearing house status and that that would provide a level playing field. They said:
The path forward could include the establishment of operating standards combined with regulatory oversight, as envisioned by the government’s original statement. Importantly, this would ensure clearing houses meet certain minimum requirements and provide a wider range of employers with the opportunity to meet their SG obligation by contributing through a clearing house.
We in the coalition are very disappointed that the government has broken its original commitment to put this clearing house service out to tender and can only say that it is typical of the 1930s socialist approach of the Rudd government. The government has to do everything and yet out there in the community we have these very efficient private sector superannuation clearing house operations. There is absolutely no reason why these organisations should not be given the opportunity to participate in providing superannuation clearing house services to these companies which are the target of this legislation.
Quite worryingly, Medicare’s evidence to the inquiry demonstrated that the agency has not completed a business plan to a level which would have been required in a competitive tender process, and in the course of their evidence Medicare made the following comments to the hearing. Firstly, they said:
We do not have any targets at this point in terms of the number of businesses which are going to use the system.
In other words, they have no idea how many businesses are going to use their system. Therefore one has to ask: how are they going to gear up to provide the service?
They said that they did not go and cost an alternative provider. They said: ‘We are considering options to accept employer payments. We have looked at the alternatives. We have not reached any firm decision on that and we are still talking with the industry about that.’ Medicare said:
We have a wide range of KPIs … I cannot imagine we would deviate from the normal Medicare ones. We have payment cycles of 14 days for some things as well as other time frames.
This may mean that they miss the deadlines for the payment of super into the super funds if they stick to their existing 14-day time frames for payments.
Then there is the question of upfront validation. Medicare said:
We do not check with the fund at that point to ensure the member details match up when the employer sends us a payment. … At this stage we are not planning to do that sort of validation.
One has to wonder what sorts of standards private Medicare will have in acting as a clearing house for superannuation and whether the slack approach, the apparently vague approach, demonstrated by these statements of Medicare—that indicate they have not really come to grips with the requirements of providing superannuation by time deadlines—is going to mean that the employees are going to be disadvantaged by the vagueness of the Medicare operation.
Private clearing houses also have raised concern about Medicare being awarded this contract, on exactly these grounds. SuperChoice said:
… a significant underestimation of the costs to build and operate an effective clearing house, particularly in the time frame that Medicare has been given—
is a matter of concern. They continued that there will be:
… likely poor employer experiences as a result of rushing into operation of a functionality based service offering, which will lead to growing employer complaints and an increase in red tape for employers; relatively low benefits for super funds, which will be offset by the cost to access the clearing house; an inequitable landscape, where 85,000 employers who employ 7.7 million employees are not offered the same level of benefits that SME employers will access through Medicare; and ultimately a missed opportunity to support the industry to advance its e-commerce aspirations.
The Superannuation Information Centre submitted that the decision to send the clearing house to Medicare means there is a serious potential for large-scale economic waste.
In conclusion, I say that, given the evidence available, Medicare and Treasury have not been able to prove that Medicare can handle the scheme at the budget provided without risk to employee superannuation payments. Many in this industry have legitimate concerns about how Medicare will operate the scheme. I think that leads to the conclusion that this is bad legislation which needs to be amended to provide choice to employers rather than forcing them to use the Medicare system.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2010 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2010-05-11,"—I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 1) Bill 2010. As many speakers have alluded to on this side, the bill introduces a number of measures, the majority of which are supported by the coalition. However, as has become a hallmark of the Rudd Labor government, as history since Rudd Labor have been in power now dictates, everything that this government does you need to look very carefully at. You need to carefully review the details of their legislation. In reviewing the detail of this legislation, we find incorporated quietly into the provisions of this bill, in the hope no-one will see them, provisions that are of real concern to the coalition. These provisions relate to the government’s policy to implement a superannuation clearing house for small business. Surprise, surprise: the provisions that are of concern to the coalition relate to yet another broken promise by the Rudd Labor government. But nothing is new in that regard. Those on the other side continue to mismanage and waste taxpayers’ money. They are chronically incapable of delivering sound government to the Australian people. And we are going to see in question time today the shaking and the quivering when they are made to answer questions in relation to their proposed super tax.
Kevin Rudd Labor is all talk and no action. This is yet another broken promise. The government promised to protect our borders; they failed on that. They have monumentally and tragically failed on the Home Insulation Program. They have failed to deliver value for money to taxpayers with the so-called Building the Education Revolution. They have failed in relation to the creation of their GP superclinics. The list goes on and on. The question that the Australian people are entitled to be asking this government is: what exactly does Mr Rudd stand for? The only thing on this side we can see him standing for is short-term political opportunism. Everything he does ends up in a policy backflip, a backdown or a disaster. The only thing Kevin Rudd is prepared to fight for is himself, especially in light of the rumours circulating regarding the new Labor leadership team—and the bad news for Mr Rudd is that his name is not on it. Julia Gillard and Craig Emerson must be very happy at the moment. What do we have with this legislation? Yet another broken promise by the Australian Labor Party.
Why do we say it is a broken promise? During the 2007 election the Labor Party promised to the people of Australia that they would establish a superannuation clearing house by 1 July 2009. The question that we now need to consider is: did the Labor Party deliver on that promise? The answer is a resounding no. The Labor Party failed to deliver on an election commitment to the Australian people. However, there was of course, in typical Labor style, a flurry of action in relation to this now broken promise. What did the Labor Party do? An amount of $16 million was allocated to the clearing house in the 2008-09 federal budget to form what the government called an election promise to reduce the superannuation red-tape burden on employers. What did they then do? They issued a discussion paper for the clearing house, which was released in November 2008, seeking submissions by 19 December 2008. Then what happened? Absolutely nothing. There was a deafening silence from the Rudd Labor government. We did not hear one word from them, which may be okay for those sitting on the other side, but the industry was left guessing as to what may happen in relation to the potential changes to its regulatory environment. But, again, as is the history of the government, you expect nothing more and nothing less.
I said that this legislation represented two broken promises by the Rudd Labor government, the first being their blatant failure to actually deliver on a commitment that they gave to the people of Australia prior to the 2007 election. What was the second? On 26 November 2009, after they had failed to deliver on their election commitment and realised that they had to do something because the industry were saying, ‘We’re up in arms. What are we going to do? We actually don’t know what is going on,’ they released an exposure draft on the superannuation clearing house legislation. What did they quietly do through the exposure draft? They announced that the Labor government would not tender the clearing house to the private sector and had decided to fund Medicare to deliver the service rather than the private sector. What do we have by that announcement? Another broken promise by Rudd Labor because, in 2007, when Mr Rudd was the opposition leader, he issued a media release. On 10 May 2007, Mr Rudd stated very clearly that the clearing house would be contracted to none other than—no, not Medicare—the private sector. Mr Rudd, as a potential leader of this country, said to the people of Australia, ‘If I am elected, the clearing house will be tendered to the private sector.’ One has to ask: did Mr Rudd ever have any desire to actually deliver on that promise? It is a blatant election breach, so the answer to that is a clear and resounding no.
What do we now have? We have the legislation before us, which represents part of a broken promise to the Australian people. But, in November last year, without any warning, without any explanation, the Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Law announced that the clearing house would be awarded to Medicare. One has to ask: where did that decision come from? How can the minister go from, in 2007, a pre-election commitment that the clearing house would be awarded to the private sector to, in 2009, saying, ‘We’ve awarded the superannuation clearing house to Medicare’?
What we do know, though, is that there are leaked Treasury minutes from the working group on the issue that indicate that Treasury consider that clearing house operations under Medicare will lack functionality when compared to that offered by the private sector and, in particular, that BPAY is to be the only payment method supported, not direct credit or direct debit—something that people often use—and that industry standard data formats will not be used. How is that for efficiency? But I tell you what: based on the government’s reputation, I would prefer the evidence from the leaked Treasury documents as opposed to believing any statement from those opposite. The government is clearly vulnerable in deciding to award the clearing house contract to Medicare and, in so doing, it refuses to answer the question: why did the government award the contract to Medicare? It is a very simple question.
Treasury, during a recent estimates sitting, refused to answer any questions. In the explanatory memorandum on this bill the decision is mentioned only once. Then we had Medicare claiming that they had completed costings on this proposal but then they refused to publicly release what those costings were. I would have thought that the public are entitled to know just how much this funding of Medicare will cost them. Medicare have also admitted that they have not finalised their system for data processing and the types of payments to be accepted. That is in stark contrast to what could have been occurring in the private sector. Contrast Medicare’s situation to that of Australia’s largest superannuation clearing house, SuperChoice. They made a detailed submission to the government. They stated in their submission that they would be able to implement the government’s policy at a fraction of the government’s anticipated cost of $16 million. I thought Mr Rudd was all about savings. That is all the spin that he gives to the Australian people, but what is the substance? It is absolutely lacking. SuperChoice’s submission refers to $1.57 million in start-up costs, $200,000 per month in operating costs and between a $15 and $60 per month cost for each employer using the scheme, depending on the take-up. That is a stark difference to the $16 million under Medicare, which has been quoted by Rudd Labor.
So what do we have again, in contrast? SuperChoice and other private providers have detailed computer systems already in place and could easily incorporate additional employers under the government’s plan. Instead, what do the government do? They say: ‘No, no, no. Forget about functionality, forget about operational efficiency, Medicare can do it even if they are required to create and implement a processing system from scratch.’ Talk about reinventing the wheel at taxpayers’ expense! There has been no justification provided by the Rudd Labor government as to why it awarded the contract to Medicare. If I were a member of the Australian public—and I am—I would be very, very worried. I would have thought it more appropriate for Medicare to be discharging its core responsibility of delivering services to the Australian public than designing a computer system from scratch and doing something that, quite frankly, it should not be doing. The questions the Australian public should be asking—and which those on the other side should be answering—are: how will Medicare deal with the quarterly massive peaks in workload created by the operation of the clearing house? How are they going to staff this? Are there going to be additional staff provided to Medicare—again, at additional cost to the Australian public? The public are entitled to know the answers to these questions. Medicare’s preparation to operate the clearing house is an example of a government agency getting involved in a sector where private companies have been operating efficiently for many, many years. Giving any government—let alone a Labor government—control over millions of dollars of superannuation payments is a very, very dangerous thing.
So what have the coalition done? The coalition have proposed an amendment to the legislation. That is right, the coalition want to assist the government in meeting its 2007 election commitment. We support the superannuation clearing house for small business. We believe it will lower compliance costs associated with the SuperChoice system. However, the coalition have a responsibility to hold the Rudd Labor government to account in relation to its political waste and management of taxpayers’ money. Our amendment to this legislation is therefore a very, very simple one. The amendment will merely force the government to have Medicare compete for the private tender. That is it. It is all about choice—nothing more and nothing less—which is something those on the other side are fundamentally opposed to. The amendment does not actually tell the government how it will achieve this choice; it simply requests that the decision to name Medicare as the operator over private sector clearing houses be made transparently and with good reason.
‘Transparently’—isn’t that a word that Mr Rudd used prior to the 2007 election? Has Mr Rudd come clean with the Australian people on the issue of transparency? This legislation continues to affirm that he has not. Unlike Medicare, private superannuation clearing houses have already invested millions and millions of dollars in designing efficient systems that process millions of transactions every year. Why is the government so insistent upon reinventing the wheel? Our amendment does not give the project to the private sector; it merely ensures that the private sector has a chance to compete for it. What we want the government to do is to ensure that it chooses the most effective and most efficient option for delivering clearing houses to small business. The question I ask those on the other side is: given the very, very clear election promise that Mr Rudd made to the people of Australia in 2007, are those on the other side going to stand here today and vote down the coalition’s amendment, which effectively means they will be voting against their own election commitment? This is the commitment Mr Rudd made prior to the November 2007 election.
As I said at the beginning of my contribution, the opposition support many elements of this bill. However, we have major reservations about the impact of the proposed government clearing house. This part of the legislation is nothing more and nothing less than a backward step by the Rudd Labor government. To depart from a very, very clear and explicit election promise to have a service that is provided on a contestable basis is a failure by the Rudd Labor government. In his speech on this legislation my esteemed colleague Luke Hartsuyker, the member for Cowper, said:
We have no problem with the allocation of the job of the government funded clearing house to Medicare if Medicare is able to compete with private sector operators and put in a bid that is price and service competitive and offers the same degree of amenity or better amenity than is being offered by private operators. But there is a very distinct possibility that we are going to squander large amounts of government money and see a more expensive solution and a less customer orientated outcome.
It is the Australian taxpayers who will lose out in the end if this legislation goes through in its current form. It is their money that is going to be squandered by the Rudd Labor government. To ensure that taxpayers are getting value for money, to ensure that private businesses do not suffer, to ensure that life insurance is protected and to ensure that this exercise does not turn into yet another of the bungled Rudd Labor government’s exercises, I urge those on the other side to support the coalition’s amendment.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2010 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2010-05-11,"—I rise today to make some remarks on theTax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 1) Bill 2010. I particularly want to comment on the forestry managed investment schemes part of the legislation, and to note that what this particular amendment is doing is protecting the right of a taxpayer to claim and retain a deduction for investment in forestry managed investment schemes where the four-year holding rule is breached for reasons outside the taxpayer’s control.
Clearly, this is being brought in because of the failure of a whole range of managed investment schemes—in particular, Great Southern, Forest Enterprises Australia Ltd, Timbercorp, Environinvest, Radiata Plantations Ltd, and on and on the list goes. We all know that, because of the recklessness of the managed investment scheme product, we have a situation where investors got an upfront tax deduction. The government moved to bring in an integrity measure saying that you had to hold that investment for four years so that people did not just move in, take on the investment, get the tax deduction and move out.
In my view, we should have abolished managed investment schemes altogether. That is still my view. I would be very interested to know why the government maintains their support for forestry managed investment schemes when we have a glut of wood product from one end of the country to the other and one end of the world to the other. Now is the opportunity to protect our native forests if we want to have any value at all left in this wall of wood that is now in Australia. But, having said that, the situation we now have is to protect those people who made their investment in these managed investment schemes, and they are not the ones who sold out of them—rather, the company that they invested in collapsed.
In talking about these managed investment schemes, though, I think we need to go a lot further than we are here. We really need to ask: what is the role of the tax commissioner and the discretion that the tax commissioner offers in relation to these particular products? I am aware that, in 2000—and this is from a paper by Dr Judith Ajani—the government responded to the Ralph review of business tax with, amongst other things, division 35 amendments aimed at removing the practice of presenting consumption expenses for non-commercial activities as business expenses. That led to a test on division 35 rules for commerciality.
The test was that business people had to pass one of the following: that they had an assessable income from the activity of at least $20,000, or had produced a profit in three out of the past five years, or used real property or an interest in real property worth at least $500,000 on a continuing basis, or used other assets worth at least $100,000 on a continuing basis. Leaving aside very important arguments about the commerciality test’s arbitrary and inequitable nature and scope for improvement, a review of matured hardwood plantation MIS investments would probably find that most of them failed the first test, and probably no plantation MIS investor would pass the other three tests.
So what has happened is that plantation MIS investors have received dispensation from division 35, with the ATO commissioner exercising discretionary powers in specified areas. The commercial loss provisions, which are specifically addressed in product rulings, require the tax office to consider the commercial viability of plantation MISs. And, in using his discretionary powers to give plantation MIS investors the right to deduct investment costs against income earned from other activity, the commissioner must have judged that plantation MIS investments are inherently commercial by some criteria. But we have no publicly available data on the tax office’s operation of division 35.
Since 1998 we have had a series of tax commissioners. They have all used their discretion to give a product ruling, essentially, on these managed investment schemes. It is a tick for the tax concession, and therefore it is also a tick on viability—it is sending a clear message to investors that the tax commissioner has made a judgment that these must be viable financial investments to have achieved the product ruling and to have achieved the tax concession.
So I think it is really about time, as Dr Ajani points out in her paper, that we had a really good look at the tax office and the commissioner’s rulings and discretionary power, and at the reasons why that assessment of viability was made, when we have had, subsequently, collapses from Great Southern, Forest Enterprises, Timbercorp, Environinvest, et cetera. How could the tax commissioner have been giving, essentially, this nod of approval about financial viability when, clearly, that has not stood the test of time?
Dr Ajani argues:
To create the information for policy debate and policy making, evaluation and monitoring, it is recommended that:
Treasury and the ATO conduct five-yearly reviews (with the first to be undertaken immediately) of the process and information used to rule on plantation MIS dispensation from Division 35 commerciality tests.
The ATO, ASIC, Treasury and Productivity Commission establish a publicly accessible plantation MIS reporting and monitoring system where, at a minimum, the key variables—return on investment, wood yield and woodchip prices—are tracked over time for each project.
and that:
The Productivity Commission’s ERA estimates be expanded immediately to include assistance through plantation MIS using, in the first instance, Approach 1—tax deduction for true costs only.
I think we really have got to the point where we need some explanation from the tax office and the tax commissioner as to the basis for their discretionary use or interpretation of that particular section of the tax act. I would be very interested in the division 35 rules in trying to understand what criteria were used for judging that plantation MIS investments are inherently commercial. We have never, ever seen that from the tax office, but it is about time we did because a lot of people have lost out through this process in rural and regional Australia. It has led to a complete distortion in land use. It has led to a clash between food security and wood product, and now we have what is a complete collapse in the wood products industry around Australia. This is probably one of the biggest examples of a public policy disaster that Australia has seen, and certainly as rural and regional Australia see it at the moment. When you look at the complete collapse of the timber industry and the whole of the forest products industry in Tasmania, you can sheet home a lot of the blame to a complete failure to look at the market realities of the wood products industry globally and the failure to recognise the glut and the distortional influence of managed investment schemes.
I also give notice that I will be moving an amendment to this legislation in the committee stage to abolish the tax deductibility for carbon sink forests, given what I have just said in relation to the glut of wood products around the country and because of the need to test the tax office ruling in relation to whether the upfront costs of land are incorporated in the tax deduction. I recognise that there is a statement saying that they are not, but we will wait and see what a court has to say about that, given the way that that has been packaged and the advice I have from a leading tax barrister in that field who is looking at the law. It is very clear to me that, if we are to have carbon sink forests in rural and regional Australia, they must be biodiverse and permanent, not some other dodge for yet another excuse to go in with monoculture plantations and again make some sort of profit out of that distortional influence in rural and regional Australia, particularly as it pertains to land prices and, as is coming down the line, food security.
Today we have a report on the loss of biodiversity across Australia. It is 30 per cent less than we had in 1970 and, at that rate, we will be losing all species by the end of the century. It is a pretty sobering kind of analysis of what is going on with our wildlife around Australia. What we desperately need in the face of climate change, peak oil and this species crisis are policies that lead to the restoration of ecosystems, the maintenance of existing ecosystems and the protection of existing carbon stores in terms of forests and native vegetation, not some distortional policy, such as the government has in place here, which is yet another example of having monoculture plantations to try to benefit from taxation minimisation schemes. This is something that the coalition also needs to look at very carefully in its climate change policies and to make sure that there is recognition that what we currently have in carbon sink forests legislation is totally flawed. It does not have biodiversity and it does not have permanence in its sights. It is just another one of these poorly thought-through schemes. So I indicate that, when we get to the committee stage, I will be looking at that and moving an amendment on it.
I also want to say that I think it demonstrates a complete lack of courtesy to the Senate for the government to have dropped in a whole swag of amendments three or four minutes before this debate. I did not see them until 25 past 12 today. I do not know whether the coalition had the opportunity of seeing and being briefed on the amendments that were dropped here just before this debate began; perhaps the coalition may wish to clarify whether they did have that opportunity. I did not and I am not prepared to proceed beyond the second reading stage until there has been the courtesy of a briefing to the various parties in this place as to what these amendments mean. I note that there appears to be a connection between managed investment schemes and managed investment trusts. I do not know what that means and I would appreciate some explanation. I note that page 19 of the Bills Digest says:
As the Explanatory Memorandum for the current Bill explains, a wholesale trust ‘is a MIS [Managed Investment Scheme] that has wholesale clients and is not required to be registered under the Corporations Act 2001’
I notice that, in one of the proposed amendments we have, ‘Proposed subdivision 275(a) extends the concept of managed investment trust to certain widely held trusts that do not otherwise meet the definition of a managed investment trust.’ I want to know whether, under some circumstances, managed investment schemes are regarded as managed investment trusts and what these amendments mean in terms of their treatment. It may be, as the minister has claimed, that this is just a technical amendment that has no significant meaning in the scheme of tax law. I am not an expert on tax law by any stretch of the imagination and do not pretend to be, but I would appreciate an explanation from the government as to the connection between the changes being proposed for managed investment trusts and managed investment schemes in terms of how the two operate and connect. If the government does want the Senate’s support for amendments, particularly in areas like tax law, which is hugely complicated, it has an obligation to circulate those amendments not with a couple of minutes to go before the debate.
To conclude, I am glad that ASIC currently has out a consultation paper regarding managed investment schemes. In my view, it is about time that ASIC took its responsibilities in relation to these schemes a little more seriously than it has in the past. When I wrote to ASIC about the fact that I regarded these managed investment schemes as no more than Ponzi schemes, I got a note back saying that it was beyond the capacity of ASIC to make judgments like that and that they had to look at the product disclosure briefs in their offerings to make sure that they adhered to certain regulatory disclosure, but no judgment could be made as to the veracity of those. In my view, that is misleading investors.
I am pretty disgusted all round with the way managed investment schemes have worked. For the life of me, I cannot understand why the government would continue with this structure of managed investment schemes when it is very clear that they have been a disaster in terms of forest policy, wood products and the price of agricultural land and now they are a disaster for a whole range of investors who went into them not because they were interested in wood products but because they were interested in minimising their tax. Once you separate the reason for the investment from the outcome, as occurs with managed investment schemes, you are setting up a disaster.
I would like to see the government get rid of managed investment schemes altogether. I think we are going to be cleaning up the mess from those schemes for a very long time to come, especially as they pertain to land use in rural and regional Australia, wood supply and the wood products industry around Australia—not to mention integrity. I am particularly keen to know from the tax commissioner the basis on which he has deemed, since 1998, for more than a decade, these managed investment schemes to be commercially viable. The community has a right to know why the tax office gave that tick of approval.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2010 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-05-11,"—I endorse wholeheartedly Senator Milne’s comments in relation to managed investment schemes. I note that Senator Milne will be moving an amendment to the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 1) Bill 2010, which I will be supporting, in relation to managed investment schemes. If I could add to one of the criticisms that Senator Milne made about these schemes, not only do they affect issues around wood products, agricultural use and land use, they also affect water. They distort the water market. They act to intercept water that otherwise would be going to river systems, which completely distorts both the use of agricultural land and the inflow of water into our river systems. So I will be supporting that amendment strongly, and hopefully the government will see the logic of clamping down on these schemes.
I should also foreshadow that I will be moving, in the same vein, in a sense, as Senator Milne’s amendment, an amendment to formulate a test, to be known as a ‘public benefit test’, against the aims and activities of entities, whether they be religions or charities, to receive tax-free status. My colleagues know of my position in relation to the Church of Scientology and of my moves to have an inquiry into it. We should go down the path of having a public benefit test, and this bill is as appropriate a vehicle as any other tax amendment bill to deal with these matters.
In relation to this particular bill, ask any small business owner and they will tell you that one of their biggest burdens is red tape, with administrative costs on par. It is time consuming, frustrating and confusing, and anything that reduces time and money spent on administrative duties so that they can focus on the business itself is ideal. Small business owners can have anywhere from one to 20 employees, and it is more than likely that each of these employees has a different superannuation fund, so many small businesses opt to use a clearing house service, where the provider receives a total deposit for all its employee super payments from the employer and deposits the relevant moneys and funds accordingly. The establishment of a government-run optional superannuation clearing house seems a logical step which will, most importantly, enable employers to extinguish their superannuation obligations with a single payment to the approved clearing house. This means that, once the employer has made their payment to the clearing house fund, they will not be liable for a superannuation guarantee in instances where the superannuation is, for whatever reason, not paid to the employee’s fund.
I understand the concerns of the opposition and of some stakeholders in terms of the allocation of this project to Medicare and the effect that it has on competition in the sector, and I note Senator Cash’s impassioned speech about the promises that were made at the last election, but it seems to me that the issue is about the implementation of this. The issue is about facilitating this for employers, and the clearing house is the way to go. I note that the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia says that this measure was:
The most significant first step in lowering administration costs for employers ...
and therefore it is to be welcomed.
I will speak to the opposition’s amendments when they are moved, during the committee stage. It is important that we consider the risks involved in this going to a private fund. Given the time constraints, I think it is more appropriate to ventilate the issues in the context of amendments that will be moved by the opposition in the committee stage. I support the second-reading stage of this bill. I will listen to the arguments in relation to the opposition’s amendments; but, from what I have seen so far, this seems to be a sensible way forward in dealing with the issue. Administratively, it seems to be the cleanest and most effective way of relieving the burden on small businesses of their superannuation obligations where there are multiple funds involved.

Given that this great big new tax will raise $9 billion per year compared to the $8 billion per year interest repayment required in 2012-13 to service Labor’s great big debt, doesn’t this just prove that the government is raising taxes simply to pay for its reckless spending to the detriment of jobs in the resources sector—or is it all just a great big coincidence?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question

We will have a company tax rate falling from 30 per cent to 28 per cent from 2013-14. We will have a resources super profits tax that only taxes projects when they become profitable, not on what they produce. We will have a resources exploration rebate that will provide an immediate cash rebate of 30 per cent for eligible exploration expenditure.
But that is only part of the resources super profits tax and what it is all about. It is also about providing essential infrastructure that will enable Australia’s resource industries to achieve their full export potential, starting with a $700 million investment in the period 2012-13. It is also about sharing the rewards of the resources boom so that all Australians get a return from the exploration of this non-renewable resource. It is about equity and it is about social justice.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2010-05-11,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research (Senator Carr) to questions without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Abetz) and Senators Cormann and Macdonald today, relating to taxation.
The minister’s answers to the questions asked today bordered on absolutely delusional, and they demonstrated to the people of Australia just how out of touch and just how disconnected the Labor Party are with both the domestic and the international reaction to Rudd Labor’s supertax. The minister had the gall to call us on this side economic—what was it?—‘knuckle draggers’. I have to say the only economic knuckle dragger in this place is the minister.
This proposed tax is economic vandalism; it is economic lunacy from a dangerous government that does not have a clue about economic management. Even the Labor premiers are now running a mile from Rudd Labor and its proposed supertax. Look at what the Australian says today, under the headline ‘Labor states back big mining companies on resources profits tax’:
South Australia’s Labor Treasurer, Kevin Foley, has declared he plans to travel to Canberra with BHP Billiton to lobby his federal colleagues to change the resources tax, while Queensland Premier Anna Bligh yesterday called on the Rudd government to “get it right” on the tax or it would threaten jobs around the country.
This is the impact of Mr Rudd’s announcement to date. The article continues:
Mining investment and exploration continued to be threatened yesterday as $300 million was chopped off the takeover bid for Macarthur Coal in Queensland … Incitec Pivot stopped drilling for phosphate; Xstrata cancelled projects; and Macquarie Bank advised clients Australia was “now seen as being a high sovereign risk destination to invest” …
What an absolute joke! Under this government, Australia’s sovereign risk is now being questioned.

Senator Sterle interjecting—

—Senator Sterle, the people of Western Australia are listening today, and you should be ashamed of yourself. Stand up for the people of Western Australia; do not sit back there and cop what Mr Rudd is going to do to our state, which is to well and truly finish it off. This is nothing more and nothing less than a blatant tax grab by the Rudd Labor government.
The bottom line with those opposite is that you are part of a big-spending, economically irresponsible government, and the only reason that you need to tax the living daylights out of the industry that is this country is that you have record levels of debt, which has soared up, and you need to satiate your out-of-control spending. Mr Rudd claimed he was a fiscal conservative prior to the 2007 election. I tell you the Australian people are not laughing at that, because they actually took him on his word, and he blatantly misrepresented himself. It is the Australian people who are now going to have to pay back the debt that the government have incurred.
But the bad new for the Australian people is they will not have jobs. They will not have jobs because you are going to destroy the industry that employs hundreds of thousands of people in this country. The joke going around at the moment—and this is from Labor people back in my home state—is that Mr Rudd is the worst prime minister since Billy McMahon. Then the Labor people offer their apologies to Billy McMahon for actually putting him in the same category as the underachiever, Mr Rudd. Mr Rudd is nothing more and nothing less than an underachiever. He is going to destroy this country. He is dangerous for Australia.
This so-called superprofits rent tax will have dire consequences for the industry in Australia which is the most significant to this country, and dire consequences will flow on to the Australian economy. You have to begin to worry when the Canadians actually send a delegation over here to work out what investment they will take as it is driven offshore. Chinese companies are on the record as already redirecting investment to Africa, Asia and South America. And, in relation to the impact on the average Australian, forget about the so-called increase in superannuation; no amount of increase in the superannuation levy is going to make up for the damage that you have done to superannuation investment with your announcement. This new superprofits tax will discourage investment in our mining industry, put projects at risk and send jobs overseas.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2010-05-11,"—I know I have only five minutes—I would love to have a lot longer, and my turn will come—but there are a few things that I think we need to correct for the record. As a proud Western Australian who made my living on the back of supplying the mining towns in the far north and the goldfields, I think there is no more important industry, certainly in Western Australia, than mining. I am not belittling our other industries, which employ a lot of people, but I think we have to clear up the hysterics from the other side and unfortunately from News Corp et cetera—they love to run the hysterics too.
In the last six months I have had the pleasure of assisting the Hon. Gary Gray, the member for Brand—
Opposition senator interjecting—
—If you do wish to listen, you might learn something, you peanut. Sorry, Mr Acting Deputy President, I retract that—it’s not fair to peanuts. I have had the pleasure of assisting the member for Brand, the Hon. Gary Gray, who is the chair of the Prime Minister’s National Resources Sector Employment Taskforce. In all fairness, I do not expect those opposite to know what was going on, because the government has been quietly getting on with the work. That task force was put together by the Prime Minister to provide an answer to Minister Ferguson and Minister Arbib on where we will find the labour for all of the 84-odd projects announced, which are probably to go to final investment decision in the next couple of years. Unfortunately there are some wild—

Senator Cormann interjecting—

 (Senator Trood)—Order! Senator Cormann!
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I suggest that Senator Cormann should listen; he may learn something.
—Doubtful!
—Yes, you are right, Senator Abetz; that is doubtful. I agree with you! I am being very hopeful in saying that Senator Cormann could learn anything!
There are a lot of mistruths and ridiculous figures being espoused around the country about how many workers we may need, should these projects go to final investment decision. With the great work of the task force, which includes mining representation, gas representation, tertiary education representation and construction representation, the best figure which has been agreed to by the members of the task force is that we would probably need about 80,000 construction workers if these projects were to go to final investment decision. As best as we can ascertain, those 80,000 workers would be needed in the next five to 10 years. Of that, we would need some estimated 30,000 production workers to run those plants. That is a far cry from the figures that we have heard today.
The West Australian—and it is fine newspaper—has unfortunately been conned or fooled by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Western Australia into thinking that, in a state with a population of some two million, in the next seven years we will need some 441,000 workers just in WA. I can tell you now, Mr Acting Deputy President—and it is on the record—that, if you were to check with the Chamber of Minerals and Energy, with the Minerals Council of Australia, with APIA or with whomever else you may want to check, you would find that that figure is absolute nonsense.
To come back to the figures that have been thrown around today—and you can see where the hysteria and the hype come from—they go off the record and become absolutely ridiculous. I encourage opposition senators, if they are going to get up and speak for the big end of town, to do a couple of things. One, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, if you on the other side have financial interests or shares in any of these mining companies or resource companies, the decent thing to do would be to declare it before you start ranting and raving and attacking the Rudd government. That is a process of the Senate, one which I would follow if I had those shares or those interests, which I do not.
—I don’t have shares!
—Senator Cormann says that he does not have any. I did not actually mention Senator Cormann; I just said that, if any of you Western Australian senators had financial interests, you should put your hands on the table and declare them.
I do not have a lot of time left but I will use this opportunity to say that there is a very devious cause being run too. It is coming from the Minerals Council of Australia through their CEO, Mitch Hooke, who made it very clear in the Australian on 9 April 2010 that he wants predominantly 457 visa workers employed in this industry.

"Williams, Sen John",NATS,2010-05-11,"—I would like to have my say on the answers given to questions put to Minister Carr here today. Senator Carr said that this great big tax on our mining industry will increase job opportunities. How, when you increase the taxes on industry, when you reduce investment and when you reduce exploration, is that going to increase jobs? I find that amazing.
—This is straight out of North Korea!
—Straight out of North Korea—exactly! It is a $9 billion tax. Those on the other side should be honest about this and tell the Senate that this is about a $9 billion tax collection to pay the interest on the debt that the Rudd government has accumulated. We are today looking at a $140 billion gross debt. In simple figures, five per cent on $140 billion is $7 billion. But, wait, there’s more: the debt has grown by more than $1 billion a week.
What this is about is tonight’s budget. It is so that the Treasurer can say, ‘We are bringing the deficit down; we are bringing $9 billion extra in every year by strangling the goose that lays the golden egg in Australia.’ That is what this is about. This is the industry about which Mr Rudd, prior to the 2007 election, said: ‘We must change our economy; we cannot be reliant on the mining industry. If it falls over and commodity prices crash, we need to have another source of income.’ What is he depending on? It was the mining industry, but now he is depending on taxing it as much as he can. I find this amazing. This is simply a great big tax to finance the great big debt.
We know where the great big debt came from. We can talk about Building the Education Revolution and the waste of money there. You will hear more about that in the near future, despite the Auditor-General’s report. We can talk about the waste in the pink batts fiasco, where we had a $2.6 billion program which is now costing $1 billion to clean the mess up. That is what this tax on the mining industry is about: collecting money to pay for the huge debt that the Rudd Labour government put our nation into. But that is nothing new: look back at the history of Labor, whether it be at the state level or the federal level, and tell me of one Labor government that, when they were thrown out of government, had reduced debt. Name one occasion.
—Never!
—Never! This is what they are about: building debt and throwing money around willy-nilly. Then all of a sudden they say: ‘Well, now we have a problem. We have a $7 billion, $8 billion or $9 billion interest bill. How are we going to fund it? Oh, we will go up to the big end of town.’
Who owns those industries? Who owns Rio Tinto? Who owns BHP? The workers of Australia, those with superannuation, own them. What we are doing is strangling the future, the retirement fund for the working families, the working Australians that the people on the other side of the parliament are supposed to represent. You are strangling their retirement, because they are the people who own those industries. One accountant has given me figures today saying that 10 to 20 per cent of investment portfolios are directly in mining shares—for example, BHP and Rio Tinto. So you are strangling the workers’ retirement funds. You have already seen the damage that you have done to the stock market because of the announcement of this huge tax on that industry.
There is one thing that is interesting: when this tax is brought in and implemented by the Rudd government, Australia will pay about twice the tax of the mining industries in Canada, Brazil and China, yet we are expected to compete. What we are going to see—and we have already seen it—is the pulling out of investment and of exploration. Companies will tend towards South Africa, Indonesia, Brazil—you name it—anywhere where there are fewer costs so they can get the same product and make more profit. That is how free enterprise is. What this government is doing is simply scaring business out of our nation.
The one concern I really have is the fertiliser industry. Incitec Pivot have told the Stock Exchange that they will stop drilling for phosphate as a result of Labor’s new mining supertax. We have been importing our fertiliser onto our farms for years and here is an opportunity to have our own fertiliser in Australia and get a distinct benefit for our nation, but our Incitec people have said, ‘What’s the point of going ahead; we’ve been taxed out of existence.’ That is what this tax is going to do, and that is why we on this side of the parliament will oppose it from the very beginning until Mr Rudd does another backflip and does away with it.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Research and Development</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,6,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2010-05-11,"—I have to say that, in the last 20 minutes, the debate around this issue has been characterised very much in the sorts of contributions we have had from senators across the way. It has been extraordinarily hysterical, and it has been littered with misinformation. Unfortunately, Senator Williams, you are leaving the chamber. It would have been an opportunity, potentially, for you to get some clarity on what this tax is about. The government’s tax reforms are about making Australia a more attractive investment destination, including for the resources sector.
The resource superprofit tax is designed to ensure that Australians get a fair share from valuable non-renewable resources. Resource taxing is a better way to tax resources because it taxes only the profits and it fully recognises the large investments made in mining. A tax such as this rebates state royalties. Royalty and excises are based on volume or value and they do not rise with profits. It is important to remember that in 2008-09 the resource sector generated close to $90 billion of superprofits. Superprofits are profits above what a competitive business would normally expect to earn. In that same year state royalties and Commonwealth excise returned only $12.3 billion to the Australian budgets. The effect of these proposals is in fact a rebalancing. Ten years ago Australians, through their government, received $1 out of every $3 of profit reaped by the resource sector. Today it is $1 in every $7 of superprofit. Surely that needs some attention.
—So what is a superprofit?
—I will go back to that, although I did explain. They are profits above what a competitive business would normally expect to return. As I said, 10 years ago $1 in every $3 of profit was returned to Australians from rental on a non-renewable resource. Today it is $1 in $7.
Profit based taxation does work. For example, the 40 per cent petroleum resource rent tax has existed for over 20 years. The $50 billion Gorgon project was approved under the 40 per cent petroleum resource rent tax. To say that it does not work is simply a furphy. In fact, I encourage leaders of the large mining companies and LNG producers to work with our government to roll out the delivery of the resource superprofit tax for our community.
It is important to remember also that there have been many economists who do not oppose the introduction of this tax. I look to Professor John Quiggan’s commentary on this issue. He goes through a range of arguments about why it is a good idea—a sensible, fair and equitable idea—to introduce a profit tax rather than user royalties and excise. I think his most compelling argument is where he says:
The political economy argument. Ever since I can remember, and probably before that, mining companies have been threatening to pack their bags and go overseas. They’ve made these threats when they were upset about tax policy, about environmental restrictions, about Aboriginal land rights, about union wage demands and work practices and when they were in a bad mood for no particular reason. But, even though lots of Australian industries have disappeared, or contracted drastically for a range of reasons, the miners are still here. The reason is obvious. They can leave but they can’t take the minerals with them. It’s precisely this immobility that underlies the case for—
as he describes it—
RRT—
that is, a resource rent tax. (Time expired)

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2010-05-11,"—I rise to take note of the pathetic effort by Minister Carr to try to defend Prime Minister Rudd’s absolutely indefensible supertax on the mining industry in this country. In recent weeks, the Prime Minister has made Australia the laughing-stock of the world. He has put Australia in the situation where the Canadian Minister of Finance, Jim Flaherty, has indicated Canada will now have a tremendous competitive advantage. That minister is over here looking for opportunities. There has been a massive reduction in the value of Australian resource companies in the last week and a half. With it, we have seen a massive erosion in the value of superannuation and shares for Australian retirees and Australian workers—the very people those opposite should be standing up for and defending.
Amongst other things, the Prime Minister has vilified foreign investment in this country. When since 1788 did we use anything other than foreign investment to support and grow industries in this country? As has previously been said, we are already seeing the major mining companies walk away, close up investments and close up opportunities. We now have the Prime Minister and the Treasurer saying, ‘Why don’t they come and talk to us?’ Surely they learnt something from the emissions trading scheme—that is, that they should have gone and spoken to those companies in advance.
We have had figures presented to us in the last few minutes, but let me give you the figures from the Australian Taxation Office on the contribution of the mining sector to this country. According to the ATO, the resources sector pays 13 per cent more tax than any other sector in this country. In the last year alone, the resources sector paid to Australian governments, federal and state, $22 billion. When added to the $22 billion surplus that this government inherited from the previous government, they have squandered $44 billion plus, plus and plus.
Do not go past what the Wall Street Journal said last week. It said, ‘This economic thinking runs counter to everything that has made Australia rich.’ So what have we seen in recent times? We have seen losses. The super funds of retirees and working Australians have gone out the window. Seven hundred thousand Australians have shares in BHP, quite apart from those who have super funds. We just heard the senator opposite speak about the petroleum resource rent tax. Does she not understand this: firstly, it is a tax at the government bond rate plus five per cent, and it is only a prospective tax not a retrospective tax; secondly, the offshore oil and gas industry does not pay royalties to any states. In the petroleum resource rent tax we have this factored in. This stupid tax is being set at the bond rate, currently six per cent. I invested some money the other day for an elderly relative in a nursing home. I rang my bank and they said, ‘We’ll give you six per cent while that person does absolutely nothing for it.’
What an absolute joke this is. We have been made a laughing-stock. Only in the last week have we learnt about the $170 billion of projects in the mining and resource sector and the 500 companies—not just one, two, three or four big companies. As the Queensland Labor Premier and the South Australian Labor Premier have both said in recent days: ‘This is a disastrous tax; it has got to be reversed.’ Let us look at Labor’s gambling for a moment. Under this new tax, this nationalising of the Australian mining industry, we have the government sharing the profits.

Senator Cameron interjecting—

—But also, if Senator Cameron would take note, they will potentially share the losses. Mining is a very fraught industry, as we all know. The situation we will have into the future—and the Australian taxpayers need to know this—is that the government have forced themselves on the mining companies and the government will be paying out losses of up to 40 per cent, as mining companies do not always make profits. If ever there has been a widening of the difference between Labor and Liberal, we have it in the way the cake is made. Labor divides up the cake until it becomes crumbs; Liberals grow the cake to improve it for everybody. (Time expired)

That the Senate records its deep regret at the death on 13 April 2010, of Bernard Francis Kilgariff, OAM, AM, former senator for the Northern Territory, and places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
Bernie, as he was known, was born in Adelaide in 1923 but moved to Alice Springs with his family as a young boy. He was the first Territory student to achieve a year 10 intermediate certificate.
After he finished school, Bernie served in the Australian Army during the Second World War. He fought in Papua New Guinea in the 2nd/5th Battalion, 6th Division of the Australian Imperial Force. Upon his return, he became very active in his local community and was well known for being one of the first tourism entrepreneurs in the Alice.
Bernie had a distinguished career representing the people of Alice Springs, starting when he was appointed to the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory in 1960. He served in the Legislative Council until 1968, at which point he continued as a member of the new Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory until 1975. He was Speaker for two years until he was elected to federal parliament as one of the first two senators for the Northern Territory in 1975.
Bernie campaigned hard for the establishment of self-government for the Northern Territory, which was achieved in July 1978, and he remained a vocal advocate for statehood for the Northern Territory for the rest of his life. I am sure that Senator Scullion will have more personal reflections on what was clearly a very committed and active life advocating for the Northern Territory.
Bernie remained in the Senate until 1987 and played a significant role in the formation of the Country Liberal Party. During his time in parliament, he served on a number of Senate legislative and general purpose standing committees as well as a number of Senate select and joint committees. He was also a member of parliamentary delegations to China, Japan, Romania, the former USSR and Hungary in 1978; Saudi Arabia, Oman and the United Arab Emirates in 1982; and Thailand and Indochina in 1984.
It is worth noting that, during Bernie’s 27-year political career, he never once lost an election. Not many of us can say that. In 1989, Bernie was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia and, in 1996, he was elevated to a Member of the Order of Australia. The recognition was for continued service to the Northern Territory through the Northern Territory Landcare Council, the Anti-Rabbit Research Foundation, the Cattlemens Association, the Australia Day Council and St John Ambulance. He was also invested as a Knight of the Order of St John. In 2001, he received the Centenary Medal for service to Australian society through the parliament.
Unfortunately, Bernie passed away on 13 April this year. He will be fondly remembered for his passion for politics and his lifelong commitment to the people and causes of the Northern Territory. Fittingly, he was accorded a state funeral at Alice Springs.
On behalf of the government, I offer our condolences to the family of Bernard Francis Kilgariff, particularly to his wife, Aileen, and their many children: Danny, Andrew, Frances, Helen, Claire, Brian, Anne, Michael, Kathryn and John. It is a full life well lived and a tremendous record of contribution to public service.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Mr Bernard Francis Kilgariff OAM, AM</title>",Condolences,10,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2010-05-11,"—On behalf of coalition senators, I too extend our sincere condolences to the family of former Senator Bernie Kilgariff, a senator for the Northern Territory and a member of the Country Liberal Party, who died on 13 April this year at the age of 86, after a long and very rich life. His contributions have set the bar high for those who follow. His life was full in so many ways. His life was inspirational and a living expression of the coalition philosophy.
Mr Kilgariff was one of the modern pioneers of Central Australia and was instrumental in the formation of the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory. He was born at Mile End in South Australia in 1923 and arrived with his family in Alice Springs at the age of seven.
He went on to make extensive contributions to the outback, pastoral, aviation, construction and resource industries, defence, tourism, Aboriginal affairs and the community—all in partnership, with the support and encouragement of his wife, Aileen, and their 11 children. I note: no baby bonus or paid parental leave was needed here. His 11 children were undoubtedly a great apprenticeship for his later role as whip of coalition senators.
Mr Kilgariff’s political career started in 1960 in the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory. He went on to become the first Speaker of the first fully-elected Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory in 1974 and then, in 1975, he was elected as one of the first Territory senators and one of the first senators to represent the newly-formed Country Liberal Party. From 1979 he represented the Liberal Party. I recall meeting with the then senator when I was a very young President of the Australian Liberal Students Federation seeking support for voluntary student unionism, which I note was finally achieved about four or five years ago. I had the privilege of steering the legislation through this place, never expecting it would take so long.
Mr Kilgariff retired from politics in 1987 and continued contributing to every facet of the community for the rest of his life. His contributions were rightly recognised through the Order of Australia. He received the Medal of the Order, OAM, and the Member of the Order, AM, in 1996. On receiving the Order of Australia, Mr Kilgariff said:
It sounds corny, but the biggest pleasure of my career has been representing people.
Mr Kilgariff exemplified commitment to and engagement with the community. He genuinely wanted the Northern Territory—and I quote from his maiden speech in the Senate in 1996—to be ‘capable of performing mighty feats which will be to the benefit not only of the Territory but of Australia’. He was a devoted servant to the parliament and the Northern Territory.
To Mr Kilgariff’s widow, Aileen, and his children and grandchildren, the coalition extend our sympathy in their bereavement and place on record our appreciation of his public service throughout his life. I know Senator Scullion, who so ably represents the Northern Territory and the Country Liberal Party in the Senate, will provide additional supportive comments.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Mr Bernard Francis Kilgariff OAM, AM</title>",Condolences,10,1,speech
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2010-05-11,"—I rise to join the Leader of the Government in the Senate and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate in the condolence motion for the loss of former Senator Bernard Kilgariff. All Australians should honour the enormous contribution of my mate, one of the Northern Territory’s first politicians and the founder of the Country Liberal Party, Bern Kilgariff, who was born on 30 September 1923 and sadly passed away on 13 April this year.
Bern had a lifetime of outstanding community contribution and was well liked by people from both sides of the political divide, representing the Northern Territory as the first Speaker of the Legislative Assembly and as the Territory’s first senator. In 1929 he arrived in Alice Springs with his family on one of the first Ghan trains from Adelaide. I was very lucky, particularly in the first few years of the Senate, to enjoy some of the stories that Bern used to tell about his early days growing up in Alice Springs. As you can imagine, it really was a joy to see Alice Springs in the late 1920s and early 1930s through the eyes of someone who had spent so much time there and seen so much change.
Bern went on to serve in the Australian Army during the Second World War, built and operated motels and service stations in Alice Springs, turned his hand to farming and pastoralism and was instrumental in opening up Central Australia to tourism. He was a very experienced guy. If you spent any time with him and there was a bit of old agricultural equipment or a car of some age he would straightaway tell you how they had improved that part. I often used to say, because he was so knowledgeable, ‘What’s that bit there?’ And he would say that that was a such and such and it used to hang off the something or other. He always had such an intimate knowledge of almost every aspect of life. Certainly in the pastoral industry, he was somebody who looked back with some sadness at the changes in the opportunities that presented to our first Australians. He reflected on a time when Aboriginals in Central Australia were the absolute backbone of the pastoral industry and saw with some sadness that they no longer enjoyed the same opportunities they had when he first got there.
One might wonder whether there was anything, as an individual, that Bernie could not do. We need only to look at some of the positions he held in the Northern Territory. He was Chairman of the Northern Territory Housing Commission, Director of the Central Australian Travel Association, President of the Alice Springs Art Foundation and Chair of the Alice Springs Community College. In 1974 he founded the Country Liberal Party—and, in this place, we may appreciate the difficulty of that. He was instrumental in securing for that party, as a brand new party, 17 of the 19 seats in the first Northern Territory Legislative Assembly election. I do not think it matters what side of parliament we are from; we must all acknowledge that as an incredible feat. Bern, they certainly were the halcyon days, mate!
Bern was very passionate about the Northern Territory. I can remember, when on the few occasions a keynote speech I gave in the Northern Territory did not include statehood, he would come up to me and remind me very forcibly that I had forgotten the first principle—that if we were ever talking about the Northern Territory we needed to remember that statehood was an absolutely fundamental part of the future. Bern, it is never far from our minds, mate.
Bern was recognised in a number of ways, including being given the Order of Australia. I think he would have reflected on how wonderful that was, but I know that in 2008 being invested as a Knight in the Order of St John, specifically for his contribution to the St John Ambulance service, would also have given him a great deal of joy.
He was also named Senior Australian of the Year for the Northern Territory in 2003. That acknowledgement was a reflection of how Bernie, even in his later years, was a very active person in the community, continuing to advocate right across the board. I still remember that at any time I could get a phone call with his voice on the other end saying: ‘Nigel, it’s Bernie. Just a couple of ideas.’ He would then go into some aspect of politics or his thoughts of the day. He was always worth listening to. He had an incredible mind and often had a different angle that you would never have thought of. In politics it is very refreshing to see somebody who has such a wonderful insight into Australian life, and I am sure that was a reflection of his great experience.
Those people who knew Bern will know that one of his most famous sayings about opportunity was, ‘If a tram goes past, hop on it and see where it takes you.’ As I have moved around Australia—not just the Northern Territory—I have found that as soon as someone knows I am a senator and I am from the Northern Territory they say, ‘You’d know Bern Kilgariff.’ I would say, ‘Yes, of course I know Bernie,’ and we would have some sort of conversation. Bern’s tram took him right around Australia and right around the world. He had a great many opportunities. He took every single one. I think the hundreds of people who turned out at Bernie’s state funeral in Alice Springs last month were a reflection of that. It was a fantastic funeral. It was a fitting farewell to a man who contributed so much to his community and so much to his country. I would like to extend my condolences to Bernie’s wife, Aileen, and to his family, who lost a wonderful husband, father and grandfather.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2010-05-11,"—I quote:
Trust is the key currency of politics, and unless you can be trusted to honour that to which you’ve committed to do, then, I’ve got to say, you’re not going to obtain the enduring respect of the Australian people.
Those prophetic words were spoken by no other than the Labor leader himself on 29 February 2008, some two years ago. Put simply, the Australian people no longer trust Labor, because Labor has not honoured the people of Australia by keeping its promises. Indeed, Labor discards its solemn promises as easily as we discard our used tissues: it spares them not another thought.
The list of broken promises, this shameful record, must surely be vying for a place in the Guinness Book of World Records. Who else could recklessly make so many inflated promises—inflated both in number and actual size—and then so dismissively walk away from them other than Labor, led by the promise-making, promise-breaking duo of Mr Rudd and Ms Gillard—and, might I add, every single Labor member and senator in this place?
We all recall the galling, high and mighty pontifications of the odd couple of Australian politics telling Australians that the greatest moral challenge of our time was climate change. That was why we needed their big new tax on everything by 2010: because to delay until 2011 or 2012 and go with the rest of the world was simply irresponsible. It was immoral, no less. We then had the indecency of the Prime Minister, during question time, blaming a heatwave on climate change to underscore the importance and urgency of Labor’s emissions trading scheme, only to have it delayed by one year and then out to 2013—after not only this election but the one after that as well. The great moral challenge of our time simply evaporated. Why? Because Labor never meant it. They had focus group testing and a series of phrases clearly tested very well, and they regurgitated them, but without conviction, without sincerity and without belief, but with absolute cynicism, with connivance and with manipulation of the Australian people in mind.
The list of cynical promises and overblown commitments that Labor took to the last election is mind blowing. Remember Fuelwatch? Treasury officials worked 37 hours straight to deliver to a cynical political agenda and delivered a policy debacle. Fresh from the humiliation of that debacle, the government simply turned to GROCERYchoice, with similar cynicism and similar results.
We can turn to Ms Gillard’s trifecta of debacles. Remember the huge promise of a laptop for every student? It was the toolkit of the 21st century, we were told—but it was empty and it was not connected, and the cost blew out. Let us recall the Building the Education Revolution program—just a minor blow-out there of over $1,000 million. The worst example of Ms Gillard’s trifecta was the commitment that no worker would be worse off under their industrial relations changes. Remember that? Tens of thousands of Australian workers today are worse off—some in excess of $120 per week worse off—and all Ms Gillard can say when confronted is that her new Fair Work system is working ‘as expected’. If it is truly working as expected, why didn’t Ms Gillard tell the Australian people before the last election that tens of thousands of Australian workers would be worse off? And, of course, as minister for training, Ms Gillard was responsible for the lack of training in that literally fatal debacle with the pink batts. And Ms Gillard is seen as one of Labor’s leading lights. You can see how bad they all are when somebody with such a ministerial record is seen as one of the leading lights.
But it will be noted that these breaches of promise are in the area of economics, workplace relations, environment, climate change, education, consumer affairs and health as well. Just witness the private health insurance rebate, which Mr Rudd and Ms Gillard so solemnly promised to keep—and discarded just as easily. Look at the non-GP superclinics.
We turn to family policy. Remember the chest beating about the double drop off? How outrageous that was and that the Howard government had done nothing about it! That was why we needed 260 new childcare centres all to be funded, quite responsibly, by Mr Rudd. What did they do? I think they built three and then simply dumped the policy—no apology, no contrition; just greasing their way to the next issue hoping that people would forget that which they have broken.
I could go to border protection. What a great promise that was: that Mr Rudd would turn the boats back in the seas. Indeed, he has welcomed them with open arms and we now see the greatest flood of illegal immigration into this country for many years—I believe, ever.
Then we have the Japanese whaling debacle. Remember that? We were going to take Japan to the International Court of Justice, and how weak was Mr Howard in not doing so! Unfortunately, a lot of Australian people believed that rhetoric. What have they done? Absolutely nothing other than—and here is a hint as to when the election is going to be—they will consider taking Japan to the International Court of Justice in November or thereabouts if nothing has occurred by then. We all know the election will have come and gone by November on the basis of that promise.
What we have with this government is all inflated brash promises based on cynicism, not on the evidence or the national interest. I make this observation: the people of Australia wanted this Labor government to succeed. The people of Australia elected them. But Labor, with a huge well of goodwill to draw upon, have failed the Australian people to the point of blatant betrayal. The Australian people now see the Labor Party for what it really is: a party without character, a party without backbone, a party without belief and a party that has betrayed—remember this phrase?—the working families of Australia. Labor and its leadership team have betrayed the Australian people.
The coalition, on the other hand, under Mr Abbott’s leadership—
—What are your policies?
—A very timely interjection, Senator Pratt. On the other hand, under Mr Abbott’s leadership the coalition is plain talking. We have genuine direct action plans—no need for programmatic specificity and other nonsensical gobbledygook, no need for spin. We just have plain talk and direct action, which are such a breath of fresh air to the Australian people after three years of a barrage of stifling, meaningless verbiage.
—Give us one credible policy!

Senator Bilyk interjecting—

—Just in case those Labor senators think that the list I have raised is exhausted, let me take them through the list: the Commonwealth takeover of hospitals by July 2009; GROCERYchoice, Fuelwatch and delaying the ETS, which I have already mentioned; prudent government spending; capping IVF treatment; no budget deficits; simplifying GST paperwork for small business; GP superclinics; delivering health services to military families; providing for the homeless; taking a hard line on terrorism; taking a hard line on immigration; private health insurance; reigning in corporate salaries; the bank deposit guarantee; responding—remember this one?—to the 2020 summit; that no worker would be worse off; building a broadband network for only $4 billion, for which the figure is now $43 billion and, I suspect, will increase; restricting employee share schemes; and living in Kirribilli House. Remember that outrage? Where is he now? Swanning around in Kirribilli House.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2010-05-11,"—I am nearly speechless after that diatribe of completely unfactual rubbish. What a load of rubbish! In response to the matter of public importance today, I would like to make it very clear, particularly for those opposite, who seem to live in some sort of alternative history paradise, that the Australian people understand that the Rudd government has been delivering and will continue to deliver. It is doing that knowing that those sitting opposite could not and did not deliver in 11 years of government—11 years! The blatant hypocrisy of those opposite is astounding, especially with regard to the MPI for today.
When I read what the MPI was for today, I was instantly reminded of John Howard’s promise of the never, ever GST. In fact, one of the things that I think I will best remember—and a lot of other people will too—about the Howard government is the notion of ‘core’ and ‘non-core’ promises, non-core promises being the kind that you do not have to keep.
A classic example of this—and there were many quotes, but I have limited time today—was the doorstop interview of 2 May 1995 with John Howard and a journalist.
Journalist: So you’ve left the door open for a GST now, haven’t you?
Howard: No, there’s no way that a GST will ever be part of our policy.
Journalist: Never ever?
Howard: Never ever. It’s dead. It was killed by the voters at the last election.
It makes you wonder, doesn’t it? It also makes you wonder about Mr Abbott’s ‘Work Choices is dead’ comments too. I do not think that has actually been a promise, but it does make us wonder.
Let us not forget John Howard’s promise that he would keep interest rates at all-time lows. History, of course, tells us a very different story there. In fact, so arrogant and out of touch were he and his government that he said Australian families had never had it better. Obviously, Australian families did not agree with him, did they?
Let us put this into perspective. The Rudd government have been governing since November 2007 and already we have delivered on many of our worthwhile election promises, some of which I intend to outline—

Senator Joyce interjecting—

—Thank you, Senator Joyce! I intend to outline some of those election promises for those opposite. It comes as no surprise that those opposite want to whinge and moan. They have made a habit out of it; that is all they do. They have no policies. They have some plans, allegedly, but no policies. In fact, all we get from those on the other side is nagging, grizzling, moaning—they are like spoilt little children. We just turn off to it after a while. Where are their policies on improving the health and education systems? Where are their funding commitments to local communities? I will tell you where they are. They are not there; they are nonexistent. The complete audacity of those opposite is evidenced best by looking right here in the Senate, a Senate which is currently being obstructed by those opposite. They have nothing constructive to add. They are just opposition for opposition’s sake.
Being a passionate advocate for Tasmania, it does give me great pleasure to inform the Senate of some of the many funding promises that have been and will continue to be honoured by the Rudd government. Let me start with Franklin. Delivering on the Rudd government election promises in the electorate of Franklin has been the very energetic and hardworking federal member for Franklin, Julie Collins. Ms Collins has worked hard to deliver on every election commitment to the local residents of Franklin since being elected in 2007, all of which of course will be of ongoing benefit to the people across the electorate.
The Franklin electorate commitments included $15 million to fund construction of the Kingston bypass—tick; $12 million to fund the Huon Valley regional water scheme—tick; $10.5 million to fund stage 1 of the south-east Tasmania recycled water scheme—another tick; $5.5 million to fund the Clarence GP super clinic, about which I thought I heard the previous speaker say there was none—tick; $166,000 for the Green Tea program—yet another tick; $155,949 for the redevelopment of the Dennes Point community centre—tick; $35,000 for the Cygnet gymnasium—tick; $10,000 for the Kingborough Lions soccer club—tick; $10,000 for the Rokeby Cricket Club to install nets—tick; and $10,000 for the Port Huon Sports Centre—tick. Those are just an example of some of the promises that have been met in Tasmania. The Rudd government is delivering on its promise to the Australian people—
Honourable senators interjecting—
—This is a sustained exercise in irony, Senator Joyce!
—The exercise of the MPI from your side is just an exercise in complete futility. The people of Australia know that the Rudd government does keep its promises, is continuing to keep its promises and will continue to keep its promises. We will give the kids an opportunity to obtain skills and education.

Senator Joyce interjecting—

—Do you think that is not a worthy cause, do you?
Opposition senators interjecting—
—That is what amazing about you guys: you sit there and you laugh about things you know that we have done. We have kept those promises— (Time expired)

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2010-05-11,"—I do not know how many of the interjections Hansard would have caught. I just want to put on the record profound relief that the chamber just showed that you got the Green Tea program in Tassie right. I want to speak briefly about one of the things that the Rudd government has got very wrong—and I like green tea.
—You don’t?
—No, I do. I am a big fan. It is just a relief to know that something has been going right.
On the matter of radioactive waste, the Rudd government has been nothing short of a disaster. The government has not delivered in the spirit of or to the letter of very simple commitments that it made in the run-up to the 2007 election. So, in the context of this debate on the Rudd government’s broken promises, I want to return briefly to the heady days of the 2007 election campaign, with Kevin Rudd in opposition castigating the Howard government’s approach to radioactive waste management, which had been, I should say, appalling. But the Rudd opposition at the time—quite senior ALP spokespeople and to a person all of their Northern Territory representatives and candidates in both Houses—made very strong commitments in the area of radioactive waste.
Let us reflect briefly on what the promise was and what the 2007 election platform said. Chapter 5 stated:
Labor is committed to a responsible, mature and international best practice approach to radioactive waste management in Australia.
Accordingly, a Federal Labor Government will:
not proceed with the development of any of the current sites identified by the Howard Government in the Northern Territory, if no contracts have been entered into for those sites.
repeal the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act 2005.
establish a process for identifying suitable sites that is scientific, transparent, accountable, fair and allows access to appeal mechanisms—
this is pretty simple language. If elected, a Rudd government was also to:
ensure full community consultation in radioactive waste decision-making processes.
commit to international best practice scientific processes to underpin Australia’s radioactive waste management, including transportation and storage.
I was working as one of the advisers to Senator Rachael Siewert when this legislation was first rammed through the Senate towards the end of 2005, in the same sitting fortnight as the former government’s Work Choices legislation, Welfare to Work legislation, the legislation abolishing compulsory student unionism and, of course, the infamous terror laws, which are all still on the books. They found time to ram through radioactive waste dump legislation as well. Again, the ALP condemned that. They called the legislation—accurately, in my view—extreme, arrogant, heavy-handed, draconian, sorry, sordid, extraordinary and profoundly shameful. Some of these words were put to us by Senator Trish Crossin, Senator Carr and Warren Snowdon, MP. Of course, they were spot on. They took a very clear and unequivocal position on this issue into the closing months of the 2007 election campaign. So that was the promise, and exactly when has it been broken? Indeed, is there a case to say that it has been?
The first thing that happened subsequent to the Rudd government taking office after the 2007 election was that radioactive waste management issues were mysteriously taken out of the science portfolio, where they had been right through the period of the Howard government and well before, and given to Martin Ferguson in the resources and industry portfolio. That is a bizarre decision to make, quite honestly: to transfer radioactive waste management from the science portfolio to the resources portfolio; to give it to somebody with absolutely no expertise, no subtlety and no idea, really, about any of the commitments that had been made by the Rudd government and by its representatives in the Northern Territory and around Australia in the run-up to the election. So it was given to this minister with no background, no expertise and no willingness to follow through with the ALP’s election commitment, and we waited for several months for the government to fulfil that promise. It was pretty simple, really: repeal the legislation and replace it with something scientifically defensible that actually brings the community along, rather than simply ramming something through, as the former government had attempted. We started to get pretty edgy. This was at the time when I took my place in here, and I started testing the ALP on whether they actually would come through with this election commitment. On a couple of occasions we brought motions through here and watched the government vote against the exact same language that was in their policy document in the lead-up to the 2007 election. We were not asking them to do anything, simply to note the language in those policy commitments, but the ALP lined up against the Greens and voted against it. That was interesting.
In 2008, the government-dominated Senate Environment, Communications and the Arts Committee conducted an inquiry into my private senator’s bill to fulfil the ALP’s election commitment for them: a repeal of the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act. That committee did some very good work. It was very collegial. We travelled to Alice Springs, and we had hearings here in Canberra. We heard from the agencies with the lead portfolio responsibility for radioactive waste management, from the industry and from environment groups around the country with a very large membership with a strong interest in these issues. In Alice Springs we heard from some senior traditional owners from around the Territory, because at that time four sites were still under consideration and they were very strongly opposed to the approach of the former government and wanted to know why on earth the ALP had not followed through with their commitment. Senator McEwen, who is with us this afternoon, chaired that committee. We in the Australian Greens had quite a degree of affinity, and we signed on to the majority report. We had some additional comments but the recommendations flowing from that report were quite satisfactory to us in large part in that they said that the government should do what they said they would do when in opposition. The committee came out with a set of recommendations that were not perfect, as far as we were concerned, but that we could live with. We shared common ground at that time on the objective of establishing a consensual process of site selection, which looks to agreed scientific grounds for determining suitability and the centrality of community consultation and support.
So what exactly happened after that? Nothing at all. The first thing that the government did was to ignore the committee’s recommendation that the repeal bill be brought in to this place at the beginning of the first quarter of last year. That did not happen. It took a full year for the minister to get around to serving up what we have before us now. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee was given, in the government’s view, 11 working days to inquire into to the government’s repeal bill, which in fact is nothing more than a rather shabby and amateurish cut and paste of what the former government had been proceeding with. At least with the former government you knew where you stood. What we have now with the Rudd government is exactly the same approach with an added dash of hypocrisy, because when they were in opposition they had been castigating senators and MPs on this side of the chamber for doing what they are now quite clearly doing in attempting to ram it through this place. That is indeed a broken election commitment.
Who cares? Who was the Labor Party making this election commitment to in the run-up to the 2007 election? Chiefly, of course, the people on the front line, the people targeted to host, against their will and without their consent, a facility hosting Australia’s most dangerous industrial waste materials—radiotoxic waste, the low-level material that ticks for a period of approximately 300 years, the long-lived intermediate level waste, the old reactor cores and the spent fuel that has been reprocessed overseas and returned to Australia, which is deadly for tens of thousands of years, for periods that will last several ice ages from now. The government are attempting to force this facility on to a cattle station 100 kilometres from Tennant Creek in a direct violation of the commitments that they made in the run-up to that election. For the people who are on the front line, and who are facing this juggernaut now in the name of Martin Ferguson, sitting in an office in Canberra planning this assault on their sovereignty and on their rights to stand up for country and culture, that election promise has been violated. For ALP voters, who during the federal election campaign put their trust in the representatives that the ALP would send to Canberra, the promise has been broken. For anybody who preferenced the ALP, including a large number of Green voters who helped carry the Rudd government into office, the promise has been broken. For environment groups, with tens of thousands of members around Australia who have taken a long interest in this and who have played an enormously important role in galvanising community support around the country for communities on the front line, the promise has been broken and for every Northern Territory citizen who thought the ALP would be able to serve up something better than what we have seen now that promise has been broken.
So now what we see is a 2007 election promise becoming a 2010 election liability. I see it as a very important part of my job in the remaining months, whether or not the Rudd government succeeds in blasting this flawed and disgusting piece of legislation through this place, to make sure that right around the country this is not seen as a Northern Territory issue. When the Senate committee sat in Darwin we had rallies as far away as Hobart, Perth and Melbourne, a very long way from where that Senate committee was hearing evidence from the traditional owners on the front line, from the Northern Territory Chief Minister and from people right on down the line. This is not an issue that is going to go away. This is an election commitment that will haunt the government in this election campaign.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Rudd Government</title>,Matters of Public Importance,18,1,speech
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2010-05-11,"—It is a little more than three years since the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Kevin Rudd, planted himself in front of some rural fencing against the beautiful background of the Nambour countryside. Looking straight down the barrel of a camera, he read from a script prepared for him by an advertising agent, and he said: ‘When it comes to being an economic conservative, it is a badge I wear with pride.’ Several months later, when he delivered the Labor Party’s policy speech for the 2007 election, the line that resonated in that speech—the one line everybody will remember, though we remember it these days for a very different reason than we did then—contained the words ‘this reckless spending must stop’.
Mr Kevin Rudd and his team were elected by the Australian people on 24 November 2007 to be the government of Australia because the Australian people trusted them. They did not know very much about Kevin Rudd at the time, but they knew that he was a fresh face. They knew that he was a glib, articulate and, evidently, intelligent public spokesman for the Labor Party. They put their trust in him. They trusted that he was as good as his word. After he was elected, he maintained that he was a politician who could be trusted. When he spoke at the Australian War Memorial in March 2008, only five months after he was elected, Mr Kevin Rudd said:
We’re going to adhere to the integrity of the budget process but all working families ... will be protected by our Government in the production of that budget and we will honour all of our pre election commitments.
—Just another lie.
—Yes, just another lie. He went on:
Every one of them, every one of them.
They were Mr Rudd’s very words in the first blush of electoral success, five months after he was voted into office. A few months later, he addressed the National Press Club and, reflecting on the government’s first year, he said:
When we formed government, I said I had no intention of recycling the absolute cynicism of previous governments—making a swag of pre-election commitments then reneging on them ...
That is what he said then. As late as year, Mr Rudd seemed to continue to command the confidence of the Australian people, if the opinion polls are any guide. But you know, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall, as every senator in this chamber knows, that there has been a significant change of sentiment across this nation over the Easter recess. What those of us who know Kevin Rudd well knew would happen—particularly those of us who have known him from the Queensland days, the bad old days even before he was a member of parliament—has happened: the people have found him out.
—You all sat there mute.
—Quite right, Senator McGauran. The Labor Party, who must have known what he was like, sat mute and defended the indefensible. Let it not be forgotten that these are the people who wanted to make Mark Latham Prime Minister in 2004 and told us how good he was, until he was found out by the Australian people. They knew what Kevin Rudd was like too, but this time the con trick worked. This time, the Leader of the Labor Party was not found out before the election in the way that Mr Mark Latham had been.
What we have had over the Easter recess is what I call the ‘Mark Latham moment’—the moment when the penny dropped with the Australian people that Kevin Rudd was not what he represented himself to be, that Kevin Rudd was as cynical a politician as god ever put breath into. That moment came, in particular, when Mr Rudd humiliatingly and comprehensively abandoned, for electoral reasons, what he had only four months earlier described as ‘the greatest moral, social and economic challenge of our time’—the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.

Senator Bushby interjecting—

—Of course, Senator Bushby, if he was a man of courage, he would call a double dissolution on the issue. But it is not likely now. What the Australian people have discovered about Kevin Rudd is that for him promises have no meaning. Do not worry about core promises and non-core promises. There are no such things as core promises in the Rudd government; there are merely expendable words—words that get you from one news cycle to the next but contain no integrity, no commitment and no purpose.
This government must be such a disappointment to its supporters, to those who serve as its ministers and those who serve as its apologists on the backbench. You must have known about this man—this man you elected as leader in extremis when you had run out of other options four years ago. The Australian people have now woken up to the fact that he cannot be trusted, that nothing he says can be believed, that he stands for nothing, that he has no core values, that he has no guiding philosophy, that he has no policy courage, that he is a hollow man and a hollow political leader.
This is the first Australian Prime Minister in the lifetime of anybody in this chamber today—and I am sorry to say this about a Prime Minister of this great country—about whom one must say has a character problem. You would not have said that about John Howard, loathe him or love, nor would you have said it about Paul Keating, Bob Hawke, Malcolm Fraser or Gough Whitlam, or any Australian Prime Minister I can remember. Regardless of what you thought of his policies, regardless of what you thought of his style of government, every Australian Prime Minister on both sides of politics I can remember in my lifetime was a person of character, a person steadfast in their beliefs, whatever those beliefs may have been. This man has no steadfastness in his beliefs because he has no beliefs. He has no core values and his commitment to any sense of values is nominal, transitory and temporary. He is a politician who lives from news cycle to news cycle. The hollow man, caricatured on ABC television, now leads a government tainted forever in the public mind and to be forever condemned in Australian history as the government led by the man who stood for nothing.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Rudd Government</title>,Matters of Public Importance,18,1,speech
"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2010-05-11,"—We are a government that has faced up to enormous challenges, including a financial crisis that threatened the livelihoods of Australians right across the nation. I am proud of the way that we have faced up to these challenges. It has been done with courage, conviction and purpose. We make no apology for coming into government with a big agenda, with big aspirations for this nation and with a determination to address more than a decade of neglect of Australia’s interests under the Howard government. It was a decade where unfairness was entrenched and where the proceeds of the last resources boom were squandered while productivity stalled. It was a decade where the big issues in health and education were ignored. Under Mr Abbott’s watch $1 billion was ripped out of public hospitals and nothing was done about a chronic shortage of nurses and GPs. It was a decade where working Australians suffered the insecurity of Work Choices—a policy that Mr Abbott rules out in name but will not rule out in practice. It was a decade where the stolen generation was denied an apology and where asylum seekers were used as a football for political gain.
But I am not going to waste further time talking about the Howard years because we all know that the forthcoming election is at the core of this debate today. This debate is about what Australians want from their future government. That is why today I stand proud. Like my colleagues, I stand behind our achievements and our commitment to reform in the national interest. I know that we are well placed to deliver on our commitments. We can look forward to a bright future because we have avoided a global recession through the strong and decisive action that stimulated the economy and saved a quarter of a million jobs by investing in local communities and essential infrastructure. We are delivering on better health and hospitals, ending the blame game with the states and putting together a $15.6 billion plan, including commitments for thousands more doctors and nurses and caps on waiting times.
We are providing a fairer distribution of the nation’s wealth in ways that also support economic growth. For example, we have delivered a massive increase in the childcare rebate. It was a great Labor initiative that was good for families and good for the economy. We have also delivered a long overdue increase to the pension—reforms to make the pension more sustainable. We also have a plan to ensure that the surplus profits generated by this mining boom are shared, not squandered. We have a plan that will benefit all Australians through lower company taxes, especially for small businesses—

Senator Brandis interjecting—

 (Senator Marshall)—Senator Brandis, I ask you to come to order. You were mostly heard in silence and I ask you to give the same courtesy to Senator Pratt.
—He is just a bully.
—Senator Collins, I think I can do without anyone else’s help. The Senate chamber will come to order.
—We have a plan for better super, especially for low-income earners, and for more infrastructure, especially for the mining states like my own. These are responsible reforms for a stronger economy and a fairer Australia. We are delivering on our education revolution through the My School website, the national curriculum and new facilities for all schools around the nation.
Our commitment to justice and social inclusion has seen the removal of children from detention centres and an end to inhumane temporary protection visas, a plan that is tackling homelessness around the nation, equality for same-sex couples and their children in 85 laws, an apology to the stolen generation and a commitment to closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. We have had to fight tooth and nail for many of our reforms and the numbers in this chamber also mean that we have not won them all. Climate change remains the greatest environmental challenge of our time and one that can be fully addressed only when those opposite show the vision required to do so.
You talk about broken promises, but what you deliver are broken policies that have not worked—like your blame the states health policy under your leader, Mr Abbott, which ran down our health system and like your plan to put a massive new tax on business to make higher parental leave payments to those who already earn the most. It was a policy that broke Mr Abbott’s no new taxes policy just five weeks after he announced it.
Then there are your policies that are policies in name only, like your leader’s statement that Work Choices is dead, and the policies that you renege on under Mr Abbott’s leadership, like your commitment to put a price on carbon. So, as you sit there in your obstructionist, broken policy zone, think about this: the Rudd Labor government will be getting on with creating jobs and managing the economy, reforming our health and education systems, and making Australia a better and fairer place for all Australians.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Rudd Government</title>,Matters of Public Importance,18,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2010-05-11,"—Welcome, Australia, to Labor’s philosophical brothel of ideas where any virtue is for sale—purchased for popularity but never loved beyond the dirty, grimy bed where these ideals have been laid down to be abused and deflowered by the Labor Party and by their cohort of senior ministers. It is the philosophical brothel of ideas. It has no substance, it is so tacky, it is so horrible; and everybody—even the Greens—feels they have been used. That is the resentment that is welling up because people—even we on this side—believed that Kevin was serious about what he said. But we were duped.
Now we have this incredible many and varied personality. It has always amazed me. This personality started with ‘2020 Kevin’—that earnest man sitting on the carpet, cross-legged with his clipboard and taking down notes. He was taking notes, he was listening to Australia, he had a thousand people around for tea and he was going to make them all feel satisfied. What did we get out of that? What a revelation: we got the republic. I thought we had already heard that idea. Anyway, that is what we got from that. Then we had ‘Combat Kevin’. This man wants war. He had a war on obesity. He had a war on drugs. He had a war on inflation. He is a very violent man. He had a war on unemployment. He had a war on executive salaries. He was going to help the disadvantaged but he was going to have a war on homelessness. When he was not at war he was starting revolutions. He had a Building the Education Revolution. It was revolution and wars. It was him in his DPCUs with his Steyr under his arm. He was out there having wars.
Then we had ‘Earnest Kevin’, who was saying ‘sorry’ but not actually doing anything about Indigenous disadvantage. He was having review after review; he was having reviews on reviews. He was a man who lived in reviews, who lived as a dilettante wandering across the nation picking up daisies and thinking about the world. It was ‘Earnest Kevin’—
 (Senator Marshall)—Senator Joyce, you are really skating very close.
—He had jets and he believed in visiting people—wherever they lived. This is earnestness.
Then we had ‘Copenhagen Kevin’. He was going to cool the planet from a room in Canberra. He told us so. He was going to do it by himself. He did not need anybody else; he was flying solo on this one. He was really going to show us how big his muscles were! The unfortunate thing was that he was not only going to cool the planet; he was also going to try to cool everybody’s house. He was going to spend $2.45 billion cooling everybody’s house. But, far from cooling people’s houses, he actually ended up burning down in excess of 110 of them. Tragically, there were deaths associated with this. So much for ‘Copenhagen Kevin’.
Then we had ‘Casualty Kevin’. He was dressed up in a blue smock. He had a little plastic blue hat, a plastic blue jacket, and he had his little plastic pants and his plastic booties on. And it came with an association: he had Nicola in blue as well.
—Senator Joyce, I have really cut you a lot of slack, in one sense, but I think you need to bring yourself back to addressing people by their correct names and titles.
—The Prime Minister was dressed up in blue. He was very blue; and I know that. And he looked at the camera, and he winked at the camera, and he took his little blue smock and he disappeared. I was wondering what he was going to do. Maybe he was going to operate on somebody. I did not know. But I earnestly believed that today he was in blue and he was going to do something. It was all part of the rhetoric. The last one we have is ‘Castro Kevin’. This is the one who nationalises the mining industry.
—Again, Senator Joyce, I have pulled you up.
—‘Castro Prime Minister’—this one believes in nationalising the mining industry. This manifestation—in the ritual of new images being displayed for the Australian people—is peculiar in the extreme. Where was this promise at the last election? Australia has not heard something like this since 1949, when they were going to nationalise the banks. Don’t worry; it almost brought about a civil war, but let’s just put that behind us. Let’s forget about the new guard and all the things that occur when you nationalise industries. People are asking very serious questions about where we are now. What on earth has happened to this nation? It has devolved into something that is quite peculiar. You are getting all these manifestations, and it is costing you only $1¼ billion a week. What a bargain! What an absolute bargain! It must be a bargain to live at the philosophical brothel of ideas for only $1¼ billion a week—
—Is that million or billion?
—It is billion. It is ‘b’ for ‘bravo’ and it is ‘b’ for ‘billion’—and that is what it is costing Australia to live at this place. This is incredible. How did we get ourselves into this bind? How could Australia honestly stay with this person for another three years? How could we possibly even venture down the path of living at this philosophical brothel for another three years? Look at the absolute hypocrite that Mr Rudd has made of Minister Wong. I honestly believe that what Minister Wong said was what she believed. But now, in his absolutely mercenary way, he has not only let down the Australian people; he is also destroying his colleagues, one after the other. He does not care who he shoots. He does not care what he does. It is beyond his capacity to have empathy and to actually understand what is happening.
Look at all the people who are going to be cast aside and who are going to be made to look like hypocrites. Whether you are Peter Garrett or Penny Wong—next it will be Combet—you would do well to stay away from the Prime Minister. But there is one thing I do not want you to do: don’t you dare change him, because we want him there. Don’t you dare change to Julia Gillard; you leave Mr Rudd right there, because he is turning into our biggest asset. We will watch tonight with wonderment as they put forward Wayne Swan to try to shade out Mr Rudd. Now we know that this is how far it has descended: Wayne Swan is going to save Kevin Rudd. That is where it has got to and that is what we will see tonight on television. It has really become total and utter pathos.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Rudd Government</title>,Matters of Public Importance,18,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2010-05-11,"—Unfortunately, this debate has declined significantly. Some elements of humour do not cover the types of references that have been covered by opposition senators. Rather than argue their point—and I will come to what I think has been the main point in this debate—we get the sort of rhetoric that came from Senator Joyce about ‘brothels of ideas’ and ‘deflowerings’ and ‘being used’. We get all sorts of opinion as to the character of the Prime Minister from people who know very little about the man—in fact, from the same people who said very different things about John Howard when he was in government. I seem to recall reports about Senator Brandis’s references to John Howard as ‘the rat’, and yet he has the arrogance to come in here and say that our Prime Minister has no character and to claim that the very same Mr Howard is a man whom he holds in great regard.
In my short time today, I want to concentrate on what I think has been the main point—which Senator Brandis alluded to—and that is: this is about honouring promises. This is not about keeping promises regardless of changed circumstances; this is about having a plan, having an agenda and honouring the promises you have made. The best example I can give, just by virtue of my personal experience in this area and in the past, is what I would characterise as the national agenda for children. We refer to it as a national agenda for early childhood in Australia, but I recall when the minister of the day back in the early 2000s said that the Howard government would eventually introduce a national agenda for children. He claimed this for roughly five years. And we waited, and we waited, and we waited, and nothing happened.
Perhaps one of the most audacious claims of this opposition, when they mark their little tick boxes for what promises have been kept and what promises have not been kept, is when they talk about the 260 childcare centres that were part of our broader strategy of a national agenda for early childhood, because those centres were designed to rectify what the previous government had done to the market in child care. The promises that it made at that time were never kept. The promises of Barnaby Joyce’s former colleague Larry Anthony were never kept. The ministerial standards and the character that were meant to be part of the Howard government never occurred. That man left this parliament and went on to be a director of ABC child care and took fees from them during this process. I was only reminded a couple of weeks ago when he appeared in the Federal Court. We have seen the details of his consultant’s fees, his director’s fees and his lobbying on behalf of ABC child care, yet this opposition has the audacity to say that, because there are now changed circumstances in the market for long day care places, we have adjusted our policies in that area. We have, for some very good reasons which the government is able to justify and which are supported by the sector. Not only did we need to spend $58-odd million to rectify the problems around ABC child care—

Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—

—Opposition senators raise their arms at the reference to $58 million. Is it nothing, Senator? What the former government did in this sector was one of the most outrageous elements of the previous government. Today we have a much broader agenda that is being delivered and being implemented. We have promises such as: access to early childhood education for four-year-olds, which is being delivered, and national quality standards, which are being delivered. And, yes, we do have promises around accessibility to child care, which are being delivered.
In your usual trite way, you address the commitment in relation to childcare centres, but it is what you do not say that is critical. You do not say that the number of childcare centres has grown by 1,000 over the relevant period. So our earlier promises are less relevant today than they were when they were made. They were made at a time when the previous government was deliberately denying us market data so that this sector could not be planned competently. So we come into government, we deal with the collapse of ABC child care—which had been allowed to grow into an enormous monopoly of delivery—and we stabilise the sector. Then, after we have had access to the relevant information, we are able to assess what the real growth in the sector has been and we see that accessibility has been improved by changes in the market and that an extra thousand childcare centres have been delivered within the market. And only a fool would proceed with a policy once they understood what change had occurred.
Those opposite talk about integrity, quality and character, but I look back on just this one issue you claim is a broken promise and I remember what Prime Minister Howard allowed his minister to do in this sector. Let us look at some of that whilst I am on that point. Let us look at the fundraisers and the lobbying that was allowed to occur in ABC child care. That is the nature of the character of the former government—which you do not find in this government. You cannot find the casualties that occurred under the Howard government amongst our ministers.

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2010-05-11,"—I am delighted to speak on this subject this afternoon. One interesting thing I would say at the outset about this MPI is that it does seem to have been the inaugural outing of the Liberal Party’s new Senate leadership team. We have seen Senator Abetz and Senator Brandis put themselves through their paces in attempting, to use that worn old phrase, to develop a narrative for the Liberal Party.
I guess when one considers the subject of broken promises, one has to concede at the very outset that those opposite are very well credentialled indeed when it comes to broken promises. Let us look for a moment at Howard’s and, indeed, Abbott’s record with respect to broken promises, because for 11 years those opposite governed this country on the back of one broken promise following another. ‘There will never, ever be a GST’ was the pronouncement before the 2006 election, and of course we all know what became of that promise. ‘No worker will be worse off’ was the solid undertaking from those opposite when introducing Work Choices. That commitment is now a matter of record, a continuing stain on the honour of the coalition. John Howard declared in 2001:
… I re-state the assurances I have previously made …
Nobody’s benefit will be cut as a result of changes to the social security system.
Yet only a short time later, in June 2002, the Howard government cut the pensions of some 200,000 disability support pensioners.
In 2004 John Howard swore that he would keep interest rates at record lows. Mr Howard told an interviewer at the time: ‘There won’t be any pressure on interest rates from us.’ This, of course, was followed by five interest rate rises, which again stands as a lasting testament to the fact that those opposite cannot manage a boom and do not have the stomach to manage anything else.
We should not simply confine these broken promises to the former Prime Minister. Tony Abbott himself has star qualities in this debate. In October 2004 Tony Abbott himself gave ‘an absolutely rock solid, ironclad commitment’—those were his words—that the Medicare safety net threshold would not be raised. After the election the threshold was indeed raised. In an interview with Laurie Oaks, when questioned about this spectacular backflip, this spectacular piece of callisthenics, Tony Abbott admitted that the government had indeed been aware of significant budget blowouts in this particular item before the election. Laurie Oakes remarked:
But your word’s not worth much any more, is it? A Tony Abbott commitment now will rouse horse laughs.
That was 2005, but the horse laughs continue, because those opposite today have the stomach, have the gall, have the cheek, to come into this place and try and accuse the Rudd Labor government of being behind ‘a litany of broken promises’. Let us take a moment to look at the profound deceit that sits behind and underpins that proposition. Since the Rudd Labor government came to office those opposite have worked assiduously as saboteurs in this place to block the government’s program. They have left no stone unturned in their resolve to obstruct and stymie the democratic mandate, a mandate secured by Kevin Rudd and Labor in 2007.
I have procured a list of all of the various pieces of legislation that those opposite have successfully blocked in this place and I seek to mention only some of the highlights for the edification of those opposite: the luxury car tax imposition, the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill, the business investment partnership bill, the climate change bill version 1, the Household Stimulus Package Bill 2009, the Migration Amendment (Abolishing Detention Debt) Bill, the Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy Surcharge Thresholds) Bill 2008, and the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill. It is a short taste of a much longer list which stands as testament to the fact that you have left absolutely no stone unturned in your commitment to blocking the program of this government. For you this might indeed be a list of pride, because you have successfully sabotaged and dismantled, at every available opportunity, the program of this government. Having succeeded in that heinous task all too often, you now have the cheek to come into this place and try and complain about the fact that some of this government’s commitments have not been achieved—the fruit of your own obstructionism. It is an absolute outrage.
Of course, the greatest of those outrages, at least to my mind, is in relation to climate change. While those opposite seek to crow about the fact that climate change legislation has been successfully defeated in this parliament, they do not seem to take the bow for succeeding in achieving that. That bill was brought to this parliament and it was successfully blocked by the coalition and the Greens. Undeterred, the government continued with its resolve to create action on climate change. Penny Wong and Greg Combet, undeterred, entered into negotiations with the Liberal Party. As we know, when it comes to breaking promises those opposite have absolutely superb credentials. So it is no surprise to us that, having reached an agreement with the opposition about the passage of that climate change legislation, the catherine-wheel of the Liberal Party’s climate change policy finally came to rest over the corpse of Malcolm Turnbull. Having finally reached a resolve to be climate change deniers—after 10 or 11 permutations—you blocked that legislation for a second time.
Let us consider the enormity of that deed, because not only were you reneging on an agreement you reached with the government, not only did you tear down your own leader to achieve it, but you did it in the face of your own commitments to the Australian people and in the face of your own policy.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2010-05-11,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
It is pleasing to hear that the South Australian government is responding to the Senate’s resolution on the issue around dialysis in Central Australia, and I thank Minister Hill for taking such an interest. However, it is interesting to note that the letter is already somewhat out of date, because the minister talks in his letter about working on a solution for the APY Lands and exploring the feasibility of providing dialysis services on APY Lands, meaning patients would no longer have to travel.
I note the media release of last Friday from the Minister for Indigenous Health, Rural and Regional Health and Regional Service Delivery, Mr Snowdon, in which he announced that there is going to be a joint study to look into delivery of kidney disease treatment in Central Australia. Again, it is very pleasing to note that the federal government, the state governments of South Australia and Western Australia and the Territory government are joining together to look at the delivery of these services. However, unfortunately the announcement did not include terms of reference for the inquiry. It did say that the inquiry will be completed by the end of the year, which in one way is pleasing in that at least it has a set end date. But, in the meantime, we are still seeing patients urgently needing access to dialysis.
I also note that there was an agreement, which turned out to yet again be an announcement of a tri-state agreement over the provision of dialysis support in Central Australia. It says that some resources will be made available for people interstate—in other words, patients in South Australia and Western Australia accessing dialysis support in Alice Springs. The problem with that is that, while the South Australian government said that they would continue to support existing patients in Alice Springs, by the sounds of it—and it is very difficult to get access to the real information—it appears that from then on they will only fund access for eight patients to receive dialysis in Central Australia. That is in fact a halving of the number of people from South Australia, the APY Lands, who will be able to access Central Australia. That of course means that people on the APY Lands are going to have to travel to Adelaide, Whyalla or Port Augusta. That is, in some instances, over 1,000 kilometres, so that means that people have to relocate permanently from their communities.
I remind the Senate that the debate and the discussions that we have been having have been about enabling people who live in Central Australia to access dialysis support close to their community so that they do not have to travel and remove themselves from the community. Having to do so means that their family is disrupted, they are isolated from their community and they are isolated from their families or their families have to move. They are often receiving treatment and support that is not necessarily entirely culturally appropriate.
Very often these patients do not speak English as a first language. They are often relocated to areas where they do not have people that speak their language or are able to support them in the manner in which they would be if they were supported in their community. I am pleased to see there is some progress. I urge the South Australian government in the interim to ensure that patients on the APY Lands have access to dialysis support in Alice Springs so that they do not have to relocate in some cases over a thousand kilometres from their home. It is essential that the people are able to remain either in their community or close to their community. I remind members that these lands are only 400 kilometres rather than a thousand kilometres from Alice Springs. There are often family members on dialysis already in Alice Springs. In other words, they are not isolated from their communities if they are able to access dialysis support in Alice Springs.
My next urging is that as soon as the government releases the terms of reference for this study that engages very strongly with all communities and all service providers the first consultation be undertaken. In fact, around the issues of the terms of reference, as soon as this study is completed a commitment should be given by both the Commonwealth government and the state and territory governments to come to a long-term planning solution to provide dialysis support in Central Australia. That support needs to be innovative, provided in community, involve training, provide support for nursing staff and accommodation for that nursing staff and ensure that people do not have to travel sometimes over 2,000 kilometres, as in my home state of Western Australia if they have to relocate to Kalgoorlie or Perth, but enables them to remain in community and receive that support. Of course, in the longer term we want to ensure that people do not get to the point of end stage kidney disease. We want appropriate health programs in place that ensure that they do not ever get to the stage of needing dialysis.
