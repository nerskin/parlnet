"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2007-02-27,"—The Senate is considering a package of some 11 bills—the Tax Laws Amendment (Simplified Superannuation) Bill 2006 and 10 others—to implement important changes to Australia’s superannuation system. The earlier motion was to provide exemption from what is known as the ‘cut-off’ to allow these important pieces of legislation to be dealt with expeditiously—because they are important pieces of legislation. I indicate, on behalf of the Labor Party, as the shadow minister responsible for superannuation matters that Labor will be supporting these bills.
We support them for a number of reasons. Firstly, Labor strongly supports superannuation. We have championed superannuation for some two decades and the reforms of the Labor government in the 1980s and 1990s were some of the most profound economic reforms in Australia’s history. Compulsory superannuation, and I emphasise the word ‘compulsory’, is still contributing to the economic health of our nation and the impact is compounding—just like the retirement balances of almost all employees.
In addition—and this has not been remarked upon enough in this public debate about superannuation—Labor’s superannuation guarantee has been one of the greatest fairness measures for the distribution of wealth in this country that has been seen since the introduction of a decent industrial relations system 100 years ago. If we, Labor, had not made superannuation compulsory and comprehensive, more than half of today’s workforce—low-middle income, casual, part-time, contract and women workers, in sectors such as hospitality, retail, transport and manufacturing: some 92 per cent of the workforce—would not have superannuation today. It would have remained the preserve of the higher paid, of executives in the public sector, rather than becoming the great national system we now enjoy.
Secondly, we also support this package because it includes measures which will help simplify a very complex system. This government has been unable to resist unwieldy, complex regulation. We have seen it in taxation, we have seen it in financial services reform and we have seen it in superannuation. Red tape and enormous compliance costs, particularly in the area of financial services, have been the hallmark of the Howard Liberal government. So anything that reduces the load that they in part are responsible for is welcomed.
Thirdly, in this area of economic policy, we must plan for the long term. And, with bipartisan support, these reforms will maintain stability and certainty around an area of long-term public policy, the environment for savings and investment, and retirement income planning.
Fourthly, Australia can now boast of one of the strongest funds management industries in the world. We now have the fourth largest volume of savings under management per capita, and we are growing very strongly. Australia—and I can say this proudly—is a world leader in many aspects of financial services because of our long-term strategy of superannuation. These are high value added industries, paying higher than average salaries and enmeshing Australia with the world’s leading economies. This will further underpin our prosperity throughout this century.
Finally, these changes will improve the retirement incomes of many Australians. For the group of Australians I referred to earlier, the majority low-middle income earners, the superannuation savings they see when they read their annual superannuation statement today—although the average balance is still modest at about $19,500—are down to Labor’s introduction of compulsory superannuation. If it had been left to the approach of the current Liberal government, who opposed that fundamental reform, the current balance on superannuation statements for the majority of Australian workers would read ‘zero’.
Despite the changes in this package, Labor believes that fundamental superannuation reform challenges remain, and I will touch on those briefly later. I will put some issues on superannuation in perspective. The primary purpose of the Australian superannuation system is to allow Australians to provide a comfortable standard of living for themselves in retirement. It is fundamentally an add-on to the age pension for most Australians. And a strong superannuation savings system has several economic consequences.
Firstly, by encouraging people to save for their own retirement, an effective superannuation system will increase retirement incomes, thereby improving living standards in retirement. Secondly, in the context of future budgets, these reforms will take off some of the pressures that will be generated by the ageing of our population. And I note the personal assurances of the Treasurer, Mr Costello, that this will occur as a consequence of this package. In this context, Labor would like to see the long-term impact of revenues modelled in the Intergenerational report. We would certainly like to see evidence that would underline the usefulness and fiscal responsibility of this particular package.
As Australia’s population ages, a super system that provides adequate incomes in retirement will ease fiscal pressure and ensure we continue to deliver budget surpluses and lock in our economic prosperity. That is consistent with Labor’s budget rules, the first of which is that Labor will keep the budget in surplus on average over the course of the economic cycle. Secondly, a large and growing pool of superannuation savings has supported the growth of Australia’s equity markets, boosting returns for investors both through superannuation and through other investment vehicles. The total pool of superannuation savings under management is large and growing. APRA reported in September last year that it had reached $945.6 billion, and on one projection it will reach $1.8 trillion by 2011 and $3.3 trillion by 2017.
There are important economic consequences which flow from this enormous accumulation of savings. As Australians’ superannuation assets continue to grow—and a brief note of caution with one year in seven on average being a negative rate of return in a defined contribution system—Australian superannuation funds are investing directly in overseas assets and through foreign debt and equity markets. In some ways it is disappointing that some of the funds of Australian workers’ savings go offshore for want of Australian projects to invest in, but this is necessary from a diversification and maximising rate of return perspective. It also demonstrates Australia’s financial maturity and economic power as we invest globally to secure future prosperity.
The fact that superannuation funds today hold assets equivalent to 95 per cent of our gross domestic product—that is, our gross economic output—proves that Labor is the real party of wealth creation. It is fundamentally an outcome of Labor’s introduction of compulsion some 20 years ago. It was only Labor that had the foresight to introduce a superannuation system that would underpin the retirement incomes of Australian families and provide a valued source of capital for Australian business. Along with the micro-economic reforms of the 1980s and 1990s, superannuation was one reform that turbocharged the Australian economy and led to the prosperity we enjoy today. More than anything else, we must recapture that reforming zeal and embrace a new productivity agenda. Labor introduced compulsory superannuation in exchange for wage restraint as part of the historic accord with Australian workers and, in the process, built superannuation into the remuneration package of almost every Australian employee. It is a wealth creation legacy that Labor is proud of.
At a time when households face the burden of the highest ratio of interest payments to household income in Australian history, the contribution of superannuation savings to Australian household balance sheets is very welcome. As I said earlier, it is a fundamental vehicle not just for fairness but for spreading the prosperity of economic reform throughout the whole community.
Australia’s retirement income system is based on three pillars: the government aged pension, indexed to male total average weekly earnings—means tested; the compulsory nine per cent superannuation guarantee; and additional voluntary superannuation contributions underwritten by a range of incentives. These pillars were, in the main, introduced by Labor governments. They were widely recognised internationally as best practice—a fair, affordable, sustainable system for ensuring dignity in retirement and underwriting our economic performance. I watch with amusement as the Treasurer, Mr Costello, desperate to find an economic reform legacy, claims authorship of the superannuation system. The inescapable fact is that he opposed the system. He has called these changes:
… the biggest reform to superannuation Australia has ever seen.
I sat in this place back in 1992 when the then Liberal opposition, including the current Treasurer and the current Prime Minister in the other place, vociferously opposed compulsory superannuation in this country. They voted against it. The Liberal Party’s record on superannuation has been very poor to date. They opposed the introduction of pension means testing, they opposed the initial three per cent compulsory superannuation in 1987 and they opposed the nine per cent superannuation guarantee bills of 1992. Their defeat would have been disastrous both for individuals and for the economy. As I said, both the Treasurer and the Prime Minister vociferously opposed compulsory superannuation and voted against it in the other place.
We have seen a very erratic display with respect to superannuation policies. We can recall the then Liberal opposition’s 1995 pledge to maintain the three per cent government co-contribution system, taking contributions to 15 per cent. They dropped that in 1997. They introduced the failed savings rebate, which only operated for six weeks. The Treasurer also introduced a so-called superannuation surcharge, a tax by another description, on higher income contributions—another broken election promise—and the Treasurer deemed superannuation holdings an asset for social security purposes. Again, that measure was dropped a few years later. They are just a few examples of the Treasurer’s rather erratic policy approach to superannuation.
Despite all that, Labor has had to put up with the Assistant Treasurer’s rather bizarre fortnightly press releases designed to goad Labor into supporting what is a massive set of legislative changes without even being given the ability to see the bills. We have now seen them and have come to the considered conclusion that we will support them. There was a fundamental lack of information provided not just to us, which is par for this government, but also to the public, particularly when it came to the costing of some of these policies. It is still quite scant in providing a breakdown of costing estimates. I am informed the government is resisting a freedom of information application by one of our newspapers for long-term forecasts of superannuation tax revenue. If the Treasurer is so keen to prove his economic management credentials and is confident that his reforms are warranted, there is no reason for him to refuse access to information.
The package contains some important changes. The primary change is that from 1 July 2007 superannuation benefits paid from a taxed fund, either as a lump sum or an income stream such as a pension, will be tax free for people aged 60 and over. Benefits paid from an untaxed scheme, mainly affecting public servants, will still be taxed; however, at a lower rate than they are now. For people aged 60 and over, the application of a 10 per cent rebate will do that.
Reasonable benefit limits will be abolished. Individuals will have greater flexibility as to how and when to draw down their superannuation in retirement. Under the current rules, funds were forced to pay out the benefits of members who had reached age 65 and who did not meet a work test. Under these changes, superannuation funds are no longer forced to pay benefits.
The concessional tax treatment of superannuation contributions and earnings will remain. Age based restrictions limiting tax deductibility concessional contributions will be replaced with a new set of simpler rules. The self-employed will be able to claim a full deduction for their contributions as well as being eligible for the government co-contribution for after-tax contributions. The tax exemption for invalidity payments will also be extended to the self-employed. The ability to make deductible superannuation contributions is extended to age 75. It will be somewhat easier to find and transfer so-called lost superannuation between funds.
To increase further the incentives to save, from 20 September 2007 the pension assets test taper rate will be halved to $1.50 per fortnight for every $1,000 of assets above the assets test free area. The superannuation preservation age will not change.
Let me turn to some of the impacts of the package. The total cost of the package is $7.2 billion over the next four years. The beneficiaries of the tax-free treatment will be those Australians who have or will have $136,000 indexed or more in super savings. For Australians with substantial retirement savings, this package will provide welcome additional retirement income. At present, neither exit tax nor, in most cases, income tax apply to individuals below that level of $136,000 in superannuation savings.
Research from the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling shows that in 2004, for baby boomers aged between 45 and 60, the average male had $87,000 and the average female had just $35,000 in super savings, with median retirement savings of just $30,700 and $8,000 respectively. To add a dose of reality to this debate: the majority of baby boomers do not benefit from this package because they have relatively low levels of superannuation saving. Effectively, battlers retiring now or in the near future will receive little or no benefit from this particular package. That is not a reason to oppose the package; it is a reason for pointing out that a touch of reality is needed when looking at the impacts of this package. Of course those retiring in future, depending on their age, will receive varying levels of benefit from these measures. The measures in the package both expand and rationalise incentives for small business by applying the same rules and including them in the voluntary co-contribution scheme. Labor welcomes that. These changes will assist people in this vital and growing sector of our economy.
It should be noted that trying to get these costings from the Treasury officials was like extracting teeth. I do not blame the Treasury officials. They do their best but they have their political orders: ‘Don’t provide information to the public or to the opposition of the day about detailed costings.’ They have their orders, and I understand that. Of the estimated $7.2 billion cost of the package, there will be a $4.2 billion direct input to superannuation over four years. That means the government is putting in just over $1 billion extra each year into super. Combine that with a further $1 billion each year from the existing voluntary co-contribution, and a total injection of some $2 billion a year—and that is welcome—is being provided by the government. The incentive approach is likely to see ongoing additional voluntary contributions of $2 billion to $3 billion a year. That is important in helping some Australians to improve their retirement incomes, but it hardly matches the Treasurer’s boast: ‘The biggest reform to superannuation that Australia has ever seen.’
The new flows to super are put starkly into the shade when they are compared to Labor’s compulsory nine per cent superannuation guarantee, which underwrites some $65 billion into superannuation every year. Credit for that achievement should be given to previous far-sighted and visionary reforms, which, I might say, were supported by the Democrats—and Senator Murray is in the chamber. They supported those reforms against the trenchant opposition of the now Liberal government. I think particular personal credit should be given to the vision and drive of the then Treasurer, and subsequently Prime Minister, Paul Keating, in this regard. The reforms laid a strong foundation in respect of our retirement income system and are recognised by the World Bank as global best practice.
The Senate Economics Committee unanimously identified a number of concerns. There is a tax increase in this package. It is quite a nasty tax increase for those to whom it will apply: a rate of 46.5 per cent on contributions—up from 15 per cent—where there is nonprovision of an employee’s tax file number. The Senate Economics Committee looked at this issue very carefully and considered that the exemption rate below which this new tax will not apply, of $1,000 a year, is too low. It represents an annual income of only $10,000. It should be set higher otherwise hundreds of thousands of battlers will face a higher tax rate, not a lower tax rate. That was a unanimous recommendation of the committee.
Labor are not proposing specific amendments to the package in the committee stage. We support the package. Our proposed second reading amendment notes the strong foundations laid by Labor governments in the context of compulsory superannuation, notes the positive nature of the measures, notes the unanimous concerns of the Senate Economics Committee and, I think, is a useful adjunct that should go on the record in terms of this debate. I should also indicate we will be supporting the second reading amendment that Senator Murray is to move in this regard as well. I move Labor’s second reading amendment:
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate notes:
(a)    that Labor governments laid the foundation for Australia’s modern superannuation system by introducing compulsory superannuation contributions;
(b)    that, in supporting the bills, the measures will:
               (i)    improve the retirement incomes of many Australians,
              (ii)    enhance simplicity of the compulsory superannuation system, and
             (iii)    give certainty and stability in the critical public policy area of savings for retirement;
(c)    notwithstanding support for the bills as a whole, the unanimous concern by the Senate Economics Legislative Committee in respect of:
               (i)    the tax increase from 15 per cent to 46.5 per cent of contributions where an employer fails to provide an employee or member tax file number,
              (ii)    the treatment of Australian Defence Force disability pensions,
             (iii)    the disparity in income tax treatment of non-superannuation income for members aged 60 and above of ‘untaxed’ funds compared to members of other funds, and
             (iv)    the need for a subsequent amending bill before 30 June 2007 to address any issues that require further consultation;
(d)    that both the Government’s own projections of new benefit lump sum and pension outcomes indicate a nil or very small improvement in retirement income for those with small retirement savings; and
(e)    the need to develop and implement further policy to improve the retirement savings of middle- and low-income Australians”.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (SIMPLIFIED SUPERANNUATION) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-02-27,"—The Tax Laws Amendment (Simplified Superannuation) Bill 2006 and 10 related bills implement the coalition government’s simplified superannuation reforms announced in the 2006 budget. They are sweeping reforms with a potential to significantly affect over 10 million people, 1.3 million employers and more than 310,000 superannuation funds. The new system will apply from 1 July 2007.
As I have intimated, the purpose of this collection of related bills is to simplify what is presently an extraordinarily complex task—that of assessing one’s current and future superannuation savings and tax obligations. With this purpose in mind, the three legislative purposes that the government is seeking to achieve with these superannuation reforms can be summarised as follows: firstly, to simplify superannuation arrangements for retirees by simplifying and streamlining the underlying legislation so that it can be more easily understood and so that there is greater clarity regarding future income streams; secondly, to improve incentives to work and save; and, thirdly, to introduce greater flexibility in how superannuation savings can be drawn down in retirement.
Interestingly, the Democrats were onto the simplification issue long before the coalition. Former Democrats senator Michael Macklin remembers campaigning for simplification in the eighties, on behalf of the Democrats, with a scheme which did not provide any reduction of tax for moneys paid into a super scheme but for the earnings in such schemes to be tax free and for the payments out of that scheme to also be tax free. The proposed scheme that we are dealing with today goes some way towards Senator Macklin’s Democrats proposals. At that time, the Democrats were attacked by the Liberals, as well as by the Labor government, but did get support for the Democrats view from industry.
More specifically, these proposed measures address a number of more complex social and economic issues that the government has previously highlighted. This includes a forecast population imbalance by 2042, with more than half of the Australian population predicted to be aged over 55, according to the 2002 Intergenerational report, which is due to be replaced by the updated 2007 Intergenerational report. In light of these forecasts, these superannuation reforms also address the increasing fiscal burden of the abovementioned changing demographic in terms of both cost—especially health-care related costs—and the shrinking taxation revenue base.
Another underlying policy initiative of these reforms is that they address the forecast shortfalls in the labour market by providing incentives to work beyond what was traditionally known as retirement age, thus improving the capacity for workers to fully or at least partly self-fund their retirement and thereby minimising the public cost via our unfunded government pension scheme, which is paid through general taxation receipts. Thus, weighing the proposed legislative changes against these broader social and economic changes is an appropriate means of measuring the relevance and quality of the government’s superannuation reforms. The question is: are the government’s propositions socially acceptable, equitable and legislatively responsible?
While the Democrats recognise that this simple super package of 11 bills makes a genuine and systematic effort to simplify superannuation rules and taxation and to encourage older Australians to work and save more, they are still inadequate because they only address part of a much larger problem. The problems remaining in the superannuation system and the broader income taxation system include: those who are retiring in the near future and who have inadequate superannuation funds; the need to significantly improve the disposable income of low-income Australians both in work and in retirement; the need to address the markedly lower super funds accumulated by women overall; and the continuation of unjust discrimination in superannuation against same-sex couples. There is also the opportunity-cost issue and the question of the desirability of spending $7.2 billion on this measure over the next four years, given the other more pressing demands on revenue.
I welcome the government’s package as a genuine attempt not only to simplify and streamline a complex system but also to provide considerable incentives to encourage increased levels of work and saving. That does not mean that I am without caution. In part, that caution is prompted by the difficulty I have in fully assessing the consequences of these changes. Unlike the new tax system that brought in the GST and related reforms, there is a decided lack of modelling, cameos and detailed projections from the Treasurer and Treasury. Treasury has not provided a long-range forecast of tax revenue effects beyond the forward estimates period, which is obviously needed, so there is much uncertainty as to how these measures will play out and affect Australia’s financial future. While I am mentioning the GST in passing, Australian pensioners should remember that they enjoy age pensions being indexed to average male weekly earnings because of the Democrats insistence on that occurring during the GST negotiations. If it were not for the Democrats they would not be as well off as they now are.
In part, my caution also arises from the question of priority. Is spending $7.2 billion on superannuation over the next four years the right priority? That is a hard question to answer, given the competing demands that always exist on taxpayer funds. By their nature these reforms are selective in impact: not everyone benefits or benefits equally. Taxpayers over 60 years of age will benefit most, and wealthier retirees and better-off Australians will benefit more than the less well off. For example, in its submission to the committee inquiry into these bills, the Australian Council of Social Service highlighted its concern that wealthy Australians were the true beneficiaries of the provisions contained in the legislative changes, thereby perpetuating income inequality in retirement. Note that it used the word ‘perpetuating’. These bills do not actually change the situation that those people with more money will continue to have more money. In my opinion these are not, of themselves, faults with respect to these bills. What is important is whether any other measures—strong compensating programs and reforms—are available that will significantly improve the lot of Australians who are not in these retirement categories and who are not beneficially affected by these bills. Unfortunately, there are not.
In part, too, my caution is prompted by a sense of a lack of policy balance. These reforms will benefit many Australians but will particularly benefit better-off Australians. Policy balance and equity require structural reform in the rest of the income tax system, particularly to benefit low- and middle-income earners. That should accompany and follow these superannuation tax reforms. While recognising that Australians will be grateful for the tax relief provided in the 2006 budget, the Democrats remain disappointed that the government has failed to provide a strategic income tax reform plan. Structural tax reform is essential to make the tax system simpler, fairer and transparent. Our income tax system is complex, inequitable and inefficient. It is widely criticised for its churning effect.
The Treasurer has adjusted rates and thresholds within the existing income tax system. He needs to change the system to be simpler, broader based and more equitable. The Democrats say that a structural income tax reform plan should include raising the tax-free threshold significantly to take millions of Australians out of the income tax system. I note a recent OECD report again supported this stance of the Democrats.
The Democrats say that a structural income tax reform plan should include indexing the rates to account for bracket creep; broadening the base by cutting out tax concessions that are inequitable, inefficient, outdated, unnecessary or distortionary; reforming the tax-welfare intersects to encourage welfare to work and remove inequities; and ensuring nominal and effective tax rates remain fair and competitive. If that tranche of measures were to accompany this tranche of measures, then you would have a completely rounded package.
One frequently expressed concern about the Simplified Superannuation plan has been the large potential revenue forgone as a result of the reform. I have, however, been intrigued by the prospect of this reform being a large revenue earner over the longer term rather than a large revenue loser. Unfortunately, I do not have the means to model this theory, but it is a theory that is worthy of debate, especially given the forecast demands on our future tax with our changing demographic profile. Demographically speaking, we are indeed an ageing population. This social phenomenon throughout the developed world presents a number of specific challenges. Perhaps the most challenging of those is the means by which an increasing number of retirees are able to fund their existence at an affordable public cost. The combination of retirement and an ageing population and retirement funding dilemmas are all inextricably linked. The role of government in managing this complex socioeconomic trend is twofold: it must ensure policies and regulatory mechanisms are in place to enable Australians to effectively save for their retirement whilst at the same time ensuring that increased concessions to superannuation do not jeopardise future government revenue that will pay for our nation’s health care, education, infrastructure and other expenses.
So has the Tax Laws Amendment (Simplified Superannuation) Bill 2006 and related bills struck the right balance? Does it offer the best system for partly and wholly self-funded retirees, low-income pensioners and taxpayers alike? How will it fit within Australia’s regulatory and tax framework? These are big questions. I am afraid I do not have the answers and only time will tell.
Striking a balance between protecting taxation revenue and establishing taxation concessions to encourage Australians to save for their retirement is a delicate, difficult and important task. Although not immediately obvious, this trade-off is representative of the socioeconomic divide that continues to grow within our nation. On the one side of the divide sits wealthy Australia, which is empowered to save for its future through a superannuation system that is now well designed for this purpose. On the other side of the divide is low-income Australia—in retirement reliant on welfare via a means-tested general age pension. To fund the retirees of low-income Australia or to subsidise the retirees of wealthy Australia, taxes must be generated.
The critical issue with regard to this funding dilemma is how the government proposes to generate the requisite tax income from a projected shrinking taxable working population to meet the expenses of a retiring population which is forecast to grow substantially. The prospect of raising corporate or personal income taxes on a tax base maintained by a smaller proportion of the population is an alternative that is both politically unsavoury and economically unviable. A more politically and economically sound alternative is to generate additional tax revenue through incentives to encourage Australians to save for retirement and to work beyond the traditional retirement age of 60. That is because if you work longer and you save more, taxes are generated.
Core measures contained within this bill, such as the removal of taxation on superannuation benefits from taxed funds after 60 years of age and scrapping the compulsory superannuation payout provisions, certainly encourage Australians to work longer and save harder, but this is only half of the story. While many of the provisions contained within this compendium of bills will encourage more savings to flow into superannuation accounts and Australians working longer will delay the shrinking tax base, the problem that must ultimately be faced by government is how to fund a growing unfunded general age pension and how to continue to subsidise the growing cost of our hospitals, schools, roads, ports and other resources upon which Australians will continue to universally depend.
Does this simplified super bill possibly establish a channel that can, in part, bridge the divide between rich and poor Australia? Surprisingly, from a counterintuitive perspective, my view is that the answer to this question could be yes. By removing the benefits tax on superannuation which only applies to wealthy retirees and making a number of other structural changes, the government is also removing a significant hurdle to investment in superannuation. With significantly greater investment in superannuation the government could stand to gain substantially from taxation revenue through both the once-off contributions tax and a tax on earnings with concessional rates of 15 per cent at an estimated 7.1 per cent return, respectively.
This could mean that with money pouring into super and a vast sum of money invested—which will grow to trillions of Australian dollars—the government has potentially crafted a growing taxable base that could dwarf the present personal income tax base. The generosity and clarity of the simple super bills is intended to encourage a massive injection of funds into superannuation, which then could turn out to be a very significant revenue earner. In turn it could provide the mechanism by which the government proposes funding the savings gap of low-income retirees and the accompanying plethora of subsidised social costs.
Having said that, an obvious question arises: if this is so, why has the government not expounded more on the forecast growth of investment and therefore tax revenue in superannuation as a result of the changes contained within these 11 bills? The answer may be a simple and a valid one: until the behavioural effects become apparent, one would have to be cautious in predicting the consequence of enhanced savings investment, particularly if it is thought the investment effect might be modest if funds are simply switched from existing investment vehicles to others in superannuation.
Scrapping the benefits tax and cleaning up the legislation are the two big carrots that have been proffered, both of which could carry a negligible expense relative to the tax gains that stand to be made from a burgeoning and taxable national superannuation pool. Maybe this package of bills will turn out to be the government’s secret future cash cow; maybe not—time will tell. From a big picture perspective, Australia could progressively experience a conversion from a taxation system focused on revenue raising via personal incomes, with a tax base estimated at $450 billion presently, to an increased reliance on a superannuation system forecast to have $2 trillion-plus under management by 2015 and growing rapidly. The system works because superannuation is a function of both personal income and growing capital; it is a much bigger taxable base, so it can be taxed at a lower ‘concessional’ rate and still cover the forecast shortfall in personal income tax raised. If this thesis of mine is accurate, then the simple super bill has struck an adequate balance between encouraging more work and encouraging those that can save for their retirement to do so whilst at the same time preserving the means to raise taxation revenue to meet forecast welfare and social costs.
Neither the government nor the explanatory memorandum has attempted to discuss this possibility. Understandably, the government is focusing on what taxpayers stand to gain rather than on what they may lose in the form of future increased taxation revenue. Broadcasting the value and importance of the national superannuation pool as potentially a progressively more important source of taxation is not likely to be part of the government’s spin, particularly if such potential gains are uncertain at this stage. I am of the view that the superannuation system, by its very design, is structured to serve Australians with incomes substantial enough to set aside funds for retirement. This is the essence of self-funded retirement. For low- and lower middle-income Australians, their reliance on the superannuation system will be of a very different nature. Their indexed pension will, indirectly, be reliant upon the same superannuation system for the taxation returns that the reformed system will offer, as opposed to the generation of an income stream substantial enough to self-fund their retirement. So there is a neat intersect between the need to raise taxpayer funds to fund future age pensions and this package of bills, which, by delivering a simplified super system by encouraging greater work and greater savings, will end up, I think, delivering additional taxation revenues, which in turn will help fund the pension system. It is an interesting thesis. As you would have gathered, I rather like the overall effect of these bills. I say that without diminishing those areas about which I have expressed caution. In conclusion, I would like to move my second reading amendment.
—Senator Murray, you can foreshadow the moving of that as there is already a second reading amendment before the chair.
—That is quite right, Mr Deputy President; I knew that really! So I foreshadow my second reading amendment, which has been circulated as item 5204, and I will indicate, before sitting down, that I will be supporting Senator Sherry’s second reading amendment. (Quorum formed)
",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (SIMPLIFIED SUPERANNUATION) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2007-02-27,"—The Treasurer, Peter Costello, took the superannuation industry and financial markets by surprise in the May 2006 budget with his policy of simplifying and streamlining superannuation. People moving into retirement have been actually handed the biggest tax break on superannuation since the time of the five per cent tax on lump sums. Unlike most other countries, Australia has taxed super three times: on entry into a fund, 15 per cent; on earnings from the fund, 15 per cent less dividend withholding tax; and on exit from the fund, anywhere from zero to 47 per cent. In the future, as a result of these monumental changes by the Treasurer, there will be only two levels of taxation, with exit taxation being abolished in the case of a taxed fund, where most of the members reside. So the effect of this simplifying of superannuation by the Treasurer is that gone are the eight very complex stages of computation of tax on what is known as an eligible termination payment, often referred to as an ETP. This means that the financial planners of this world will now focus on investment earnings rather than on planning around the age based and reasonable benefit limits to minimise tax. Too much time in the past was spent on minimising tax rather than on maximising returns.
Commenting on his superannuation budget initiatives, Treasurer Costello said that the measures had effectively made superannuation one of the best possible investment options for Australia and that they would encourage Australians to remain in the workforce. It is interesting to note that, following that announcement, many senior people in the union movement commented that it was the Liberal coalition government that was now the party for superannuation.
Earlier, Senator Sherry waxed lyrical on what the government of his day did in the early nineties, but times have moved on and the initiative has now been taken by the Liberal Party, which is handing out the biggest benefit in known memory. Approximately 85 to 90 per cent of superannuants in Australia are in what is known as a tax fund. When they are aged over 60, they will receive a lump sum with very few strings attached that will essentially be tax free. What is even more important and attractive is that, when this sum is invested in a pension, the income stream following that pension will be tax free. There is another group which comprises the 10 or 15 per cent of superannuants who are in a Commonwealth fund or are state employees, but their super is not taxed to begin with and they will be subject to a separate concessional taxation regime.
For many years now people have been saying that the nine per cent superannuation contribution from employers was not enough to derive a reasonable retirement income. But, as a result of these measures, the capital accumulation which will now be required to produce an effective income stream will, because of the impact of no tax on the stream, be so much lower than it was previously. This will minimise the adequacy issue. This is a great simplification of the accumulation and the draw-down.
Because the tax on superannuation has been reduced for people receiving benefits from tax sources, taxes will also be reduced on benefits paid from untaxed sources for people who are aged 60 and above. Under the plan, it is proposed that the 30 per cent tax on lump sums will be reduced to 15 per cent for amounts up to $700,000, with any excess taxed at the top marginal rate. Pensions received from an untaxed source will be taxed at the marginal rate but will receive a 10 per cent offset. Again, this is a very generous arrangement.
I will give an example of how the system will work. Say a person receives a pension of $56,000 per annum with a deductible amount of $6,000; that $6,000 would represent contributions made from that pensioner’s after-tax income. As a result of that, there would be a taxable pension of $56,000 less the $6,000 that he put in himself—$50,000. The deductible amount of $6,000 would naturally be paid tax free. The tax offset would be 10 per cent of the $50,000, which is $5,000. So the amount of tax payable by the person would be reduced by up to $5,000 depending on the person’s circumstances. In the case that I have outlined, it would be reduced by $5,000. That is a very generous and helpful contribution courtesy of the Liberal coalition.
Some of the other budget changes include the abolition of the reasonable benefit limits, often known as RBLs. These will be replaced with a flat pre-tax maximum of $50,000 in a salary sacrifice type of arrangement and an after-tax contribution of $150,000 per annum with a facility for deductibility up to $450,000 in any one year but still within that three-year arrangement. Members aged over 50 will be able to contribute $100,000 pre tax in one year for five years and this new $150,000 per annum limit on the undeducted contribution applies with effect from 9 May 2006. The Treasurer also confirmed that the tax will exclude the capital gains tax component from the sale of a small business. This will allow each small business owner to contribute up to $500,000 of capital gains into a superannuation fund in addition to contributions allowed under the cap. It is a very generous arrangement and it will be very helpful to small businesses.
Current allocated pensions require a draw-down within both minimum and maximum parameters. What will happen as a result of these significant changes is that a new type of pension will be introduced which requires only a statutory minimum—no maximum—payment to be made. People will be able to take a pension and also work at the same time. That is very valuable in circumstances where we are encouraging people to work after reaching normal retirement age. So there will be a facility for people to be able to have an income which has a taxable component and a tax-free component.
Another very important facility that is given to individuals is that they will have far greater flexibility as to how and when they draw down their superannuation in retirement, and there will be no forced payment of superannuation benefits. In effect, a person could maintain their superannuation account with their industry fund, or wherever it might be, and it will act almost as a bank account does, because they could draw out the money—draw down their funds—as and when they require.
As a result of these changes, the self-employed will be able to claim a full deduction for their superannuation contributions as well as be eligible for the government co-contribution on their personal post-tax contributions. The ability to make deductible superannuation contributions will be extended to the age of 75. Let me give you an example of just how significant these changes can be. For somebody who is earning $1,000 per week, the lump sum saving over 40 years will be $37,000, or an extra $136 per week in pension. I will repeat that to show the impact that simplifying and streamlining superannuation will have on an individual: if an individual is on $1,000 per week, lump sum savings over 40 years will be $37,000, or an extra $136 per week in pension.
To further increase the incentives to save for retirement, from 20 September 2007 the pension asset test taper will be halved to $1.50 per fortnight per $1,000 dollars of assets above the threshold. The effect of this is that it will allow a single retiree homeowner to have around $165,000 in additional assets before they lose the age pension, while a couple can have around $275,000 in additional assets before losing the age pension. This will have a very significant impact on providing security for older people in our society because the benefits and the side benefits of the age pension, in terms of access to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, are very significant.
But not everything has changed. The 15 per cent contribution tax will remain, although any taxable contributions over the new $50,000 limit will be taxed at the top rate. Our friends on the other side of politics believe that the way to tackle this is to reduce the contributions tax by some amount—by how much was never stated—but, while that could provide some benefits, the problem with that approach is that it would not reduce much of the red tape. In fact, according to the Labor Party proposal, instead of having eight stages of computation for an eligible termination payment, you would have nine—further complicating the arrangements that we have sought to eliminate.
The government provided an opportunity for submissions to be made, which were passed to Treasury. This was a massive undertaking. It is a big change and has a big impact on the budget: $2 billion every year for the next three years at least. The matters that the coalition looked at favourably included exiting the existing pension arrangements and so on. In summary, the aspects of the reform are as follows: it will significantly lower the tax impact on superannuation in terms of a tax fund; the replacement of the age based limits with streamlined contribution rules will certainly simplify matters; it will improve the co-contribution incentives for the self-employed; it will halve the asset test taper; and it will rewrite superannuation law to present a much clearer picture. The removal of taxes from three levels—on entry, on earnings and on exit—to only two levels will certainly bring us to the forefront of the lower taxation regime that applies throughout the world.
It is not surprising that around the world people are looking to Australia for taxation reform. I know from experience in Asia that it is Australia they are looking to for reform and for guidance as to how they should shape their retirement incomes. There is a situation where, particularly in Asia, the family unit is breaking down, there is a lot more mobility and, in China’s case, there is a one-child policy. They are undergoing some fundamental rethinking of retirement. The Asians are particularly good savers. At the present time, most of this money just goes into bank accounts. They are looking to get larger returns. They are looking to find an environment and a regime that will provide the security that is absolutely necessary for saving over a 30- to 40-year period. It is to Australia that they are looking.
Australians are at the forefront in providing the IT facilities and the expertise that the Asians are looking for. To the credit of Australia, Australian companies, executives and experts are providing that information and assistance and are contributing to the stability of pension regimes right across the world. I thank them for that, and I thank the Treasurer for his foresight in introducing such a marvellous incentive and initiative.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (SIMPLIFIED SUPERANNUATION) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-02-27,"—I want to speak to just a couple of issues surrounding the Tax Laws Amendment (Simplified Superannuation) Bill 2006 and its 10 related bills which were raised during the Senate Economics Committee inquiry into the bills and have also been raised with me by a number of constituents. Before I do that, I would like to reinforce the key role the Democrats have played over the years in strengthening Australia’s superannuation system and being pivotal in the development of the superannuation system in Australia. It is probably fairly fashionable these days to deride my Queensland Democrat predecessor Cheryl Kernot, but she played a key role as a Democrat senator in the formulation and expansion of the superannuation system under the former Labor government. That is a positive legacy of hers that is still being felt today, and I think it should be acknowledged.
More recently, the Democrats played a key role in negotiating constructively with the current government, as we often attempt to do, in developing a massive expansion in the amount of assistance for low-income earners in maximising their superannuation savings. As part of that, quite wisely, we required regular quarterly reports to be tabled in this parliament about the amount of money being provided to low-income earners through government payments as supplements to their superannuation contributions. The amounts that have been provided to supplement and expand the superannuation savings of low-income earners have proven to be much larger than was originally anticipated. I am fairly sure it now goes well past the $1 billion mark of extra money that is in the superannuation savings of many thousands of Australian low-income earners. Those are just a couple of examples amongst many of the constructive, very important and direct legacy of the Democrat contribution to our superannuation system.
My colleague Senator Murray has spoken to this particular legislation at some length, so I will not go over some of the points that he raised. If I were still in a balance of power position in this chamber I would insist that much more detailed costing projections be provided by the government. I appreciate these things are always an estimate, but when you are making changes of this magnitude there should be at least some effort to project the longer term costings and the scenarios and cameos for different people in different circumstances.
The failure of the government to do that work and to provide those projections is pretty sloppy, frankly. It is the sort of thing that has happened more and more since the government got control of the Senate. That shows that having an independent Senate that can properly review what the government is doing is not just a matter of saying, ‘That’s bad policy and we’ll stop it,’ or, ‘That’s bad law and we’ll stop it’; it is actually a matter of ensuring that the job is done thoroughly and properly the first time around. Even if you support a policy intent, there is a big difference between just letting it roll through without proper examination or proper work being done and looking at it in the necessary detail to make sure, as much as possible, that you get it right the first time and that you have a broad idea of all of the potential effects. The flow-on, long-term effects of all of these changes are hard to predict in lots of ways, but that does not mean that you cannot do a bit of work trying to do so.
A specific area I want to touch on is detailed in chapter 3, I think, of the Senate committee report and relates to the tax on additional assessable income, particularly the way some of these changes interface with the situation for people in military service schemes. The committee report—and it was unanimous on this matter, as I understand it—noted possible inequities associated with members of taxed and untaxed schemes who receive assessable income in addition to their superannuation benefits. One submitter suggested that these changes result in a further inequity for many individuals who have other sources of income or who receive higher superannuation pensions, because it taxes the residual end benefits tax at marginal rates rather than subjecting it to a separate 15 per cent flat tax.
For members of tax schemes receiving a superannuation income stream, additional income is taxed at a marginal rate from a starting point of zero. This category of recipients is therefore able to take advantage of the tax-free threshold and the overall progressiveness of the income tax system when tax is calculated on their additional income. Pension recipients from untaxed funds are taxed at marginal rates and additional income earned by these fund members is combined with their superannuation income stream to determine their assessable income. Consequently, more tax is paid on this additional income by those in untaxed schemes than those receiving a benefit from a taxed scheme. The committee came to the view that this was an anomaly that applies inequitable tax treatment to the same type of assessable income and urged the government to reconsider the way in which total taxable income is classified for those in untaxed schemes.
This links to some extent with concerns specifically relating to the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme. These were also touched on in the Senate committee’s report. The concerns that have been raised with me by a number of veterans relate to the way these benefits are being excluded from the new schemes on the basis that they were untaxed and unfunded. Certainly, some contributors to the scheme state that they did contribute a portion of their salary to the scheme. It was a taxed portion under a compulsory 5.5 per cent contribution, and for a period the government did make a co-contribution of 11 per cent until this scheme was changed.
A number of veterans argued in their submission to the committee that the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme should be considered as at least partly funded so that they could have some of the benefits available to other superannuants. I note that Treasury officials—and I think the Treasurer himself—indicated a commitment that veterans would not be paying more tax under the proposed new regime. But the fact remains that, under this proposed new regime, a lot of other people will be paying less tax and these veterans will not. So there are certainly some grounds for the concern that was expressed, reflected in the view put forward by the committee. The report said:
The committee recognises the unique circumstances in which veterans find themselves. Military personnel rarely have the opportunity to work until the usual age of retirement, especially given the inherent physical risks associated with serving in the ADF. Further, as a consequence of military service many former ADF members are left incapable of undertaking further employment.
That is a factor relating to service in the defence forces that I have spoken on a number of times in this place before. We should realise that it does not just apply to veterans—people who are wounded in action in the theatre of war. Being in the Defence Force is an inherently risky business in general. There are many people injured in peacetime whether in non-warlike service or as part of their day-to-day activities in the ADF.
I have spoken a number of times about how I believe on many occasions, although not all, we are still not adequately assisting ex-service personnel whether they be war veterans or other ex-service personnel who have been injured or wounded in the line of duty. The committee indicated its sympathy for the financial circumstances of veterans, particularly those unable to work. But—and I am paraphrasing here—it indicated the view that, whilst there was some understandable concerns being expressed by those veterans with respect to the treatment of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme, it did not believe that this was the best place to fix it up. The report stated:
... the committee is not persuaded that the tax free treatment on benefits should be further extended. However, the committee strongly encourages the government to examine the adequacy of financial protection that military superannuation schemes provide for incapacitated ADF members, particularly in comparison with other public sector superannuation schemes.
The committee felt that, if veterans are at a relative financial disadvantage due to the inadequacy of their military superannuation funds, redress should not occur through special tax exemptions. In the committee’s view, this would negate the purpose of the legislation and potentially create other inequitable treatment for people facing the same hardships by different circumstances. I can understand the view the committee has put. They basically said, and I am paraphrasing, ‘We agree that some of you are in an unfair position, but this process is not the best way to fix it.’ That is probably correct. But the problem is that, when you are the person in the unfair situation, particularly if you are a veteran or ex-service person, a statement like, ‘Yes, we agree you are getting a bit of a rough trot but this isn’t the best way to fix it; we need to convince the government to do something else,’ is the sort of thing they tend to hear time and time again. Even though this might not be the best way to fix it through the mechanism that is suggested, it does redouble the obligation on government to seek to fix it. It is cold comfort to have your concern acknowledged and then be told that you have to find another way to address it. I think that on all sides of politics we need to be particularly cognisant of the unique type of contribution that Defence Force members make, particularly those who have been injured and those whose injuries are sufficiently severe that they are unable to work again.
Generally speaking, politicians like to wrap themselves in the flag. They like to hang out at military parades, give out medals, be at services, wave off troop ships, welcome them back home and all those sorts of things, but, when it comes to the ongoing day-to-day treatment for those service personnel for the rest of their lives, it often tends to be governments that are the ones missing in action. We need to be doing a lot better in that regard. I think it is doubly important given some of the willingness to use political rhetoric to encourage and promote military activities around the place.
I want to take the opportunity to put that on the record and particularly to urge the government to take into account the committee’s recommendation No. 4 regarding the separate assessment of superannuation income streams and additional assessable income and also the committee’s view regarding the treatment of people in military service schemes. One of the things that can happen with committee inquiries into legislation—unlike committee inquiries into policy areas where governments are meant to provide responses to the various recommendations—is that there is often very much a feeling that, once the legislation has been dealt with, recommendations that do not directly relate to the legislation just disappear into the ether.
Having said that, the government’s record of responding to any committee report is spectacularly appalling, especially since they have gained control of the Senate. It seems like other people’s views no longer need to be even acknowledged let alone responded to. But these are important issues; they were unanimous findings of the committee. I think it is particularly appropriate that the efforts to redress some of the concerns be redoubled, for both the unique aspects of the tax treatment of benefits and, more broadly, the continuing difficulties that many ex-service personnel face.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (SIMPLIFIED SUPERANNUATION) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2007-02-27,"—I rise to continue where Senator Bartlett left off. But, before commencing my contribution to the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Simplified Superannuation) Bill 2006, as a member of the Senate Economics Committee I would like to place on record my thanks to all the secretariat staff and those who contributed to our inquiry. As is often the case with many Senate committees, but particularly the Economics Committee these days, we have a particularly congested time line within which we are to consult with the affected public on potential legislation and then report to the chamber, because the government seems to be in a great hurry to get some of its legislation through. Sometimes we are inquiring into legislation that, when the inquiry commences, the opposition has not really even seen. We have often only seen the title. I place on record my thanks to the secretariat and other staff, and those who submitted to our inquiry on legislation that it took a while for us to see.
Senator Bartlett raises some legitimate points. My colleague Senator Sherry has expanded on the opposition’s general concerns about the costings of this package. The specific concerns that I want to focus on are those that affect our former military personnel and particularly our veterans. Senator Bartlett has outlined the committee’s unanimous recommendation—recommendation No. 4. The committee was moved by the witnesses who were retired from the Defence Force. I particularly want to place on record my thanks to Mr Colin Wade from Mandurah in Western Australia, who is retired from the Defence Force. He gave extended and distinguished service to the Australian Defence Force and retired on the grounds of ill health. Some of the things he endured while in the Defence Force have obviously severely impacted on his day-to-day living. Government policy does not really take into account the impact that it has on people like Mr Wade and his colleagues within the Defence Force.
It seems to me that a good public policy principle would be to look at these people as a separate category. It is, after all, the government of the day, no matter what its political persuasion, that decides to put these people in harm’s way. Therefore, we have a great duty of care to look after those veterans at the end of that service and to recognise the particular physical and psychological impacts that service has had not just on them but on their families. I do not think anyone on the committee failed to be moved by Mr Wade and his evidence. It took an incredible amount of courage and bravery for him to travel across the country. He had to bring support with him to appear before the Senate committee. Interstate travel is something that we in this chamber may take for granted as pretty easy, relaxed and informal. But it is not always that way, particularly if you have suffered severe impacts on your health. It can be a pretty traumatic experience, and it is always a traumatic experience to expose your personal life and history to a roomful of strangers and on the public record. So it is worth acknowledging him and thanking him for taking the trouble to do that, thus allowing the committee to consider the wider implications of legislation like this.
When members of the committee quizzed departmental officials about the impact of this legislation and with whom they had consulted, we were told that they had consulted with ComSuper on the subject of people receiving Commonwealth superannuation and that that was about it—ComSuper are the peak body. I do not in any way want to belittle the contribution that any public servant makes or any of the people who work for ComSuper, but these veterans, these people who have served in our Defence Force, are in a different category. Yes, their superannuation is looked after by ComSuper, but they have a unique set of circumstances. It would not seem unreasonable that the department actually go and consult separately with their representative body rather than just the peak organisation that serves to look after everyone who receives a ComSuper benefit. After all, those veterans, those retired Defence Force personnel, would comprise a very small percentage of the overall ComSuper membership, but they do have unique circumstances. There are not that many other ComSuper beneficiaries that governments of the day can choose to put in harm’s way. Our veterans often suffer long-term physical and psychological consequences from the policies of the government of the day.
When considering legislation like this it is important that we look at the impact in its totality on the entire membership and composition of the membership of ComSuper rather than opt for the standard consultation with the peak organisation. The concerns they would have raised would have reflected the circumstances of a significant proportion of their membership. For the committee members, it was only through meeting with Mr Wade and some of the other witnesses who appeared that we came to understand some of the other implications and impacts of this legislation, and some of the potential solutions that there are to the concerns of these people. I believe that next time we need to hasten a bit more slowly—get the consultation right and look at all the impacts rather than the impact on the vast majority, and every now and then concede that there may be some special circumstances and some people who have had very traumatic lives and deserve special consideration.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (SIMPLIFIED SUPERANNUATION) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2007-02-27,"—The legislation that we are debating today, the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Simplification) Bill 2007 and a raft of related bills, implement the Howard government’s groundbreaking reforms to superannuation. These bills simplify superannuation arrangements for retirees and make the provisions for superannuation much easier to understand. They improve the incentives for people to work and save and they introduce greater flexibility in how superannuation savings can be drawn down in retirement.
In introducing these major superannuation reforms, the Howard government is significantly improving the adequacy of retirement incomes. The raft of bills that we are debating today simplifies the current complex tax arrangements with regard to superannuation and removes restrictions that have previously applied to superannuation benefits. The bills provide retirees with much greater flexibility as to how and when they draw down their superannuation benefits. More than 10 million Australians with superannuation accounts, in addition to the many future account holders who will establish superannuation savings in future years—in many respects as a direct result of the incentives that this legislation introduces—will benefit significantly through these reforms.
To summarise some of those very important reforms: firstly, there is the abolition of the reasonable benefit limits so that there is now no limit on the amount of capital that a person can accumulate through superannuation or put into a superannuation fund. The age based contributions whereby a person can make a contribution to a superannuation fund that is tax deductible and have that taxed at 15 per cent in the superannuation fund, which previously varied according to age, is now set at a flat rate of $50,000 per year irrespective of age.
In addition to that, people under this legislation are able to make an undeducted or after-tax contribution now limited to $150,000 per year. Previously, undeducted contributions were unlimited; people could put as much after-tax capital into superannuation funds as they chose and were able to do. But these measures place an annual limit on that of $150,000, or you can put $450,000 in on one occasion and then not make any after-tax contribution for three years. That ensures an element of fairness with regard to superannuation savings.
Importantly, this legislation ensures that, as from 1 July next year, once a person turns 60 years of age there will be no tax on the benefits they draw down from their superannuation fund. Whether those benefits are drawn down in the form of a regular pension, in the form of a lump sum or through a combination of those there is no tax on the benefits drawn down from a superannuation fund. This is an amazing and major reform to superannuation. Importantly, the provisions made for transition to retirement mean that people can keep working part-time as they approach retirement age and make contributions from their earnings into a superannuation fund, and gain the tax advantages of that for their retirement savings purposes, but at the same time draw down their superannuation either in lump sum form or by way of pension on a tax-free basis. That is a very significant reform among the major reforms under this legislation.
Also, until 30 June this year people can make a one-off contribution of $1 million to their superannuation fund. As I mentioned previously, under the existing regime there was no limit on the after-tax contributions that people could make to a superannuation fund as part of their transition to retirement. Quite fairly, the government in this legislation has allowed a $1 million limit up to 30 June this year, which takes account of that and of the subsequent introduction of the $150,000 per year limit on undeducted contributions. They are very important initiatives.
But one of the most important initiatives with regard to this legislation is the provision that has been made for small business, and I want to focus some remarks on that particular benefit. Small business owners for a long time have been amongst the most enthusiastic supporters of superannuation, particularly in the form of self-managed superannuation funds. The fundamental logic of their enthusiasm is easily understandable. Many people decide to set up their own businesses to ensure their independence, and it is the same motivation that encourages many of them to establish their own self-managed superannuation fund. Under this legislation the link between small business and self-managed superannuation funds, I believe, will become even closer through 2007 and beyond because of the way in which this legislation makes superannuation simpler and more tax effective. It is only one of the many changes that this legislation initiates. It is a policy initiative of the Howard government which this legislation introduces and I want to focus on it today, because the small business sector is of great importance to our economy and to our community.
One of the changes in relation to small business is to allow full tax deductibility for personal contributions made by self-employed business owners as compared with employees of incorporated businesses. No longer does a small business owner have to be the employee of their own incorporated business; they can be in a partnership or some other business ownership structure and as a self-employed person can now gain full tax deductibility for their contributions to super up to that $50,000 per year limit. That is a very important reform as far as small business people are concerned.
But the most important reform, I think, is the exclusion from the annual cap on undeducted superannuation contributions of the proceeds from the sale of small business assets or farm assets that qualify for the standard small business capital gains tax exemptions up to an indexed lifetime limit of $1 million. That applies in addition to the annual cap on undeducted contributions of $150,000 a year or $450,000 on a three-year cycle. This is a very important reform for small business. I welcome its introduction. It was not part of the original package announced in last year’s budget, to which this legislation by and large gives effect. It was an initiative taken during the refinement and consultation process of this legislation. It is an issue that I raised very strongly in the government members Treasury committee and I welcome the fact that the Treasurer finally acceded to including this as part of the package. It is a very important initiative.
It means that when a small business person retires and sells the business for the purpose of retirement they can put in $1 million of the proceeds of the sale of the small business as an after-tax contribution, and if it is a husband and wife business then obviously they can put $1 million each into that fund in addition to the $450,000 on a three-year cycle. So it does make a substantial difference to small business and I think it is an important initiative

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2007-02-27,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Human Services (Senator Ian Campbell) to a question without notice asked by Senator Lundy today relating to a proposed access card.
I do this because Senator Campbell’s contribution reached a new low for the level of arrogance displayed by coalition government ministers. I think it is a sad reflection on the Howard government that, when you combine the contentious concept of an access card with a government with an appalling record on the management of information technologies, it is quite predictable that all we can expect is a dog’s breakfast. Today the pile of mush that is the access card got a bit mushier. The minister refused to back away from extremely arrogant remarks describing MPs who disagree with him as supporting fraudsters and rorters. If you have a read of Steve Ciobo’s contribution to the second reading debate on this issue in the other place, you will get a sense of just how critical the minister’s remarks are of his own party colleagues.
I think his comments are particularly arrogant when they are seen in light of developments today—reports from the coalition party room—that the government has been forced to bend to internal pressure and has now changed guidelines relating to the access card and how old you have to be to be automatically eligible for it. We know that the bill as it stands says that you have to be 18 to get the access card. This contradicts current practice for the Medicare card, which the access card is designed to supersede, because people of the age of 16 or over are eligible for a Medicare card. This is established, sensible policy that has been in place since Medicare was first introduced.
Now, as a result of internal party pressure, the Howard government is apparently introducing guidelines to permit people from the age of 15 to have access to an access card. The problem with this is—and this is where the dog’s breakfast comes into it: how can the bill proceed when it says that you have to be 18 or over but guidelines have now been flagged, introduced or drafted to provide for people over the age of 15 getting this card? We do not know if the guidelines protect the interests of young people. We do not know whether they are going to create a regulation or some sort of administrative instrument. The government itself is clearly engaged in a process of policy on the hop that has not been thought through even within the coalition party room, let alone in a decent debate in the parliament or in the public.
That takes me to a major point throughout the debate so far, and that is the appalling arrogance with which the coalition have treated the public debate. We heard the minister today imply that there was a six-week inquiry into this access card. What rubbish! There are three days worth of hearings within an extremely truncated two-week window in which the senators on that committee have the opportunity to conduct hearings, take evidence, hear witnesses, sift through it and prepare their reports. I challenge the minister to come back into the chamber and clarify precisely how long that inquiry will be, because it is not the six weeks he implied in today’s response to questions. I think it is another sign of the government’s willingness to abuse their majority in the Senate when they inflict these kinds of decisions on Senate committees and force their way through this chamber. These are policy changes that the government have very poor form on.
We know from the debate so far that the access card’s success or otherwise is intertwined with the sorts of systems that underpin it—the software, the hardware, how that information will be accessed via the smartcard and the devices that can read the smartcard information. But I would like to remind my colleagues that this government have very poor form on IT management. I am of course referring to the IT outsourcing debacle that characterised the first eight years of the government’s time in power, where they systematically wasted taxpayers’ money and made false claims about savings on IT. The previous IT outsourcing debacle is a good analogy, I think, because here we are and the government are claiming that this card will create $3 billion in savings over an extended period of time. That savings figure has already been refuted. They are unable and unwilling to accurately benchmark current costs. The Department of Finance and Administration is running the process, and that ought to put the fear of God into every minister who has anything to do with it. The contract costs have already blown out to some $1.2 billion, leaving a mere $400 million between the estimated savings costs and the cost of the card itself. And we know, because of their poor management, that that is likely to—(Time expired)

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2007-02-27,"—I stand to support the views of the government and, indeed, Minister Ian Campbell on this. The key principle is this: you want to support the system that supports you. You want to acknowledge the fact that the abuse of the system means that that are other more deserving recipients who will miss out. This is a point that the Labor Party seems to neglect: it is the people across the country in families, and the old and young alike, who will miss out. They will miss out on the appropriate level of support that they deserve. That is a key principle.
This is a government for all Australians and we want to support the system that supports everybody. Minister Campbell, I must say, should be congratulated for taking up the views—he has consulted widely, particularly in recent times—of not only members of the backbench but the AMA, people in the health industry sector and the like. I want to go back a step and acknowledge the work of the former Minister for Human Services, Joe Hockey, who spent a lot of time and effort—
—Hear, hear!
—Thank you, Senator Mason, for that. He put a lot of time and effort into this to ensure that the Australian government saves money so that we can support the system that supports you and so that those in need can receive support. Basically, the Australian government smartcard is a good system. It is not an ID card. I was one of those who, along with many others in Australia in the late 1980s, strongly opposed the proposal by the Labor Party for an ID card. I think the checks and balances with respect to the smartcard are certainly there.
Members of the Labor Party who were here in the parliament at that time obviously supported the ID card and it is to their shame and disappointment, no doubt in hindsight, that it got so far. Fortunately, through public opinion and the like it was stomped on. But this Australian government smartcard is different. It is going to be simpler, easier and more secure for millions of Australians to access their health and welfare entitlements.
The card will replace up to 17 separate cards. It will be the key for Australians to access more than $100 billion worth of government health and social service payments. It is also going to be a reliable way to ensure that the right people get the right services and payments. Interestingly, an independent report, not a government report but an independent report by KPMG, a firm of respected accountants, has estimated that this one card will save—wait for it—up to $3 billion of fraud over 10 years. That is a lot of money in anybody’s book. That is money that can be used wisely for the people who need it most: those on welfare and those who need it for healthcare services.
I also acknowledge that there will be an ongoing review by Allan Fels and his committee, the Access Card Consumer and Privacy Task Force, and that is important. He has an important role. There will be ongoing monitoring of the arrangements. If there are some technical matters that need to be sorted out or some feedback to be offered to the minister, then of course the minister and the government will take that into account.
We have a policy in this government of continual improvement. If we can make a better, tighter, more efficient service and a simpler, easier and safer system then that is exactly what is going to happen. The other key thing about this proposal that perhaps the Labor Party and others are not acknowledging is the voluntary nature of it. I say to the Labor Party: I want you to support the smartcard proposal. Do not have two bob each way; you cannot walk on both sides of the fence. That certainly seems to be what your leader is doing at the moment—he is walking both sides of the street. Certainly, if you are on both sides of the fence, you will be in big trouble.
—The fork in the road!
—You will be in big trouble, Senator Forshaw—especially you! (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Smartcard</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,7,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2007-02-27,"—I rise to also take note of the answers given by Senator Ian Campbell to questions without notice today. As usual, Senator Campbell fell into the trap of waxing lyrical and in the process made a whole range of outlandish and outrageous statements. One of the statements he made during his answer on the issue of the consideration of the access card legislation was that the Senate committee had six weeks to consider this legislation and he intimated that, if we could not do the job in six weeks, we must be pretty worthless. I note that the Chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration is in the chamber now. I want to pay tribute to my colleague Senator Mason because he has the role of chairing that very fine committee. I know that he has succeeded an equally fine previous chairman.
This legislation was referred to that committee by the Selection of Bills Committee on 8 February. From that date to the reporting date of 15 March is about six weeks. But of course Senator Ian Campbell was being totally disingenuous when he suggested that the committee has six weeks to consider it. The week following that referral was estimates week. There was absolutely no opportunity for the committee to consider the legislation. Also, as all of the senators in this chamber know, the secretariat had to move very quickly to advertise for submissions, and that occurred about one week later. The submissions are now rolling in in large numbers. The committee has established a program of public hearings to meet this Friday, and Monday and Tuesday of next week. Then we have to await the presentation of the chair’s draft to the committee for consideration, and that will probably take about another week or so. Then we have to table within three or four days after that.
This is an incredibly tight timetable. Effectively, when the committee starts its public hearings this Friday it will have under two weeks to report on this very significant legislation that is going to impact on the lives of millions of Australians and their families. The government itself acknowledges that. Every person in this country who currently has a Medicare card—and that is pretty much everybody and their families—is going to be affected by this legislation. It is substantial.
Senator Barnett’s comment that it is a voluntary card is absolutely ludicrous. You cannot participate in the Medicare scheme—the scheme established by Labor and opposed by this mob over there until they worked out that the public actually supported it—without a Medicare card. This is going to be a compulsory card. And it is going to cost $1.2 billion over the next four years to implement this system. But the government says, ‘Oh, you can deal with it in two weeks in a Senate committee and report on it.’ It has taken them years to put this proposal together.
Those of us who were at the estimates hearing two weeks ago and took the opportunity to ask some questions of the public servants at the hearing will recall that the public servants had a row of boxes of papers for this legislation that stretched virtually from one end of the main committee room to the other. We were all petrified when the secretary of the department pointed to this huge long row of boxes and said, ‘I have all the information on the access card here for you.’ I think you would have needed a semitrailer to bring it all up to the parliament. Senator Mason knows that what I am saying is absolutely true.
The opposition is cooperating with the processes for the consideration of this legislation before the committee, but nobody should ever accept this nonsense from Senator Campbell that somehow we have six weeks to do it. It is an outrage that a Senate committee should be expected to deal with this significant legislation in such a short time. There are major problems with the legislation in this proposal, as the government knows. Even this morning they announced further changes to the legislation. They are making changes on the run and yet they come in here and have the temerity to tell us that we should be able to complete the job within a couple of weeks. Frankly, this is going to come back to haunt you—just as you say the Australia Card came back to haunt us. The Australia Card was a good idea; this is not a good idea because you are getting it wrong and it will come back to haunt you at the next election.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Smartcard</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,7,1
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2007-02-27,"—Senator Forshaw is right in the sense that this is an issue we should look at very closely. Certainly, the card has many advantages. It has potential disadvantages as well. It is a difficult issue. What we should not allow to happen, Senator Forshaw, is the rhetoric of privacy to overshadow the debate. We should have a proper debate over the issue, and look at the safeguards.
I think the two aims of this card are, firstly, to combat fraud and, secondly, to improve access. They are both worthy aims. I think both sides of parliament agree with the aims of the process. Combating fraud is an issue of social justice—people should not be able to claim benefits they are not entitled to. Benefits should go to those people who are entitled to them and who need them. In relation to improving access, again I suspect that all senators would agree that access should be improved. There are difficulties at times with people gaining access. I remember last year when the cyclone hit Far North Queensland. People did not have access to welfare, and this access card would have made it easier.
So in a sense we are not really arguing about the aims. I think all senators agree that the aims are appropriate. It is whether the safeguards are sufficient. Those safeguards have been gauged in three locales over the last 12 to 18 months. The consultation has taken three forms. First of all, there has been the independent committee chaired by Professor Fels. That task force has reported twice and the government will continue its consultations with those interested groups to ensure that the implementation of the access card meets the needs and the expectations of all Australians. To date, Professor Fels has undertaken over 160 consultations and has received more than 100 submissions. This is a big-time report. He has looked at it objectively and he has reported to the government.
The access card website has received over 500 email comments from members of the public. The access card information hotline has received over 1,800 calls and there have been ongoing briefings to stakeholder groups and the media. The Fels report is on the web. It has been an excellent summation of the issues.
Secondly, and my friend Senator Forshaw mentioned this, the debate has already commenced in Senate estimates. We did not breach Senate standing orders by debating the legislation; we did look at the process. I accept that there are issues that we have to address. But let us not let the privacy rhetoric and the scaremongering get the better of us. Let us actually have a look and see whether those two aims—of deterring fraud and of improving access—can be achieved with safety and security of privacy. That is really the good public policy issue here.
—Was I right about the boxes?
—I was not quite sure what was in the boxes. It might have been your files, Senator Forshaw! Over the next few weeks there will be a Senate inquiry, which I am chairing and for which Senator Forshaw is the deputy chair. It is an important inquiry. We are sitting for three days.
Let us be quite frank about this. If we all agree—and I think that we do—that the aims to combat fraud and to improve access are good, the question then will be: what are the safeguards for privacy and how do we stop function creep in the utility of the card? You are right about the Australia Card in one sense. It is easy to scare the Australian public about the smartcard. But it may in fact be the right public policy tool—and I think it is—to stop fraud and to improve access. You may in fact score some political points from this, as the Labor Party did with a very good policy initiative such as the GST. The Labor Party was wrong on that but nearly won the 1998 election on the back of it. All I am asking for and all the government is asking for is that this issue be looked at seriously, comprehensively, diligently and with senatorial purpose.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Smartcard</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,7,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2007-02-27,"—I too rise to take note of the answers from the minister about the access card and I acknowledge Senator Mason’s contribution. He really made the case that we do need a much longer and more comprehensive review of the legislation as it stands because there are so many issues outstanding.
First of all, I put on record that there is no-one on this side of the debate against the use of smartcard technology in service delivery. We do want to improve service delivery and reduce fraud in the system. That does not mean that we have to support the proposal we have in front of us with the access card. Certainly the concerns that have been raised and that were belittled by the minister in the Senate today just make us think more clearly about what problems are confronting us. We heard dismissive comments from the minister, who was not really interested in or prepared to listen to the dissent. We heard him belittle his own colleagues on his own back bench about their concerns, which involve not only privacy but also the abuse of this new access card for fraudulent purposes. We heard him mislead the Senate, I think it could be said, in the sense that, as Senator Forshaw said, we do not have six weeks to consider this very important piece of legislation. We have got just a few weeks to consider the issues involved. And this morning we heard that the legislation is being amended as we move to consider it—so this is a moving feast.
This brings us back to a critical issue in the Senate. More and more we are seeing legislation drafted in haste and rushed through this chamber simply on a whim of the government. Such a truncated process does not allow a good public policy outcome to emerge from a comprehensive Senate inquiry; instead we are faced with a limited inquiry. We have dissenting voices. Not only have submissions to the inquiry been belittled; quite genuine concerns held by members of the public are just being dismissed out of hand.
Another real concern that I have is the registration process and how that is going to operate out in rural and regional Australia. The idea that every person over 18—I think about 16½ million people on the government’s estimates—will have to register for this card needs to be examined. How that is going to happen is a mystery to me. It is an ambitious process that the government has really underestimated with respect to both costs and logistics. Yet it is not an issue that the minister wants to hear any constructive comments about, let alone any criticism. That is just one of the issues that concerns me.
We have real concerns from the industry that the entire technology associated with this access card is being subcontracted out to a range of providers. The government’s whole record of technology adaptation and adoption has not been very well proven in the past, so how is the technology around this card going to be safeguarded in the future? There are many issues and concerns that this legislation raises, and the dismissive attitude of the minister today in dealing with questions both from his own side of politics and from the senators on this side of the chamber really did him a disservice that I think we are all going to see much more of.

Inquiry into Gynaecological Cancer in Australia


Commonwealth Government Response to the Committee’s Report:


Breaking the silence: a national voice for gynaecological cancers


February 2007


Introduction


Australia has one of the best systems of cancer care in the world. In comparison to other developed countries, Australia has relatively high cancer incidence rates but comparatively low cancer mortality rates, indicating that cancer survival in Australia is relatively good. The health system in Australia is performing well in lengthening survival through early detection and in the treatment of cancer.


The Commonwealth Government provides significant resources in relation to the prevention and treatment of gynaecological cancers. Advances continue to be made in gynaecological cancer research; during 2000-06 the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) provided more than $44 million for research into gynaecological cancers.


The Government has invested heavily in screening for female cancers, notably breast and cervical cancer. The National Cervical Screening Program (NCSP) has been so successful in detecting and following up pre-cancerous abnormalities that the incidence of cervical cancer has fallen by 57% and mortality by 58% in the past ten years.


The Government also funds a national ovarian cancer program through the National Breast Cancer Centre (NBCC). The NBCC has developed evidenced based guidelines, endorsed by the NHMRC, for the management of women with epithelial ovarian cancer. It is now focussing on assisting with enhancing treatment through the development of a guide for health professionals on multidisciplinary cancer care meetings.


Burden of Gynaecological Cancer in Australia


Each year in Australia an estimated 462,000 people are diagnosed with cancer. Approximately 374,000 of these cases are less threatening types of skin cancer – namely non-melanocytic skin cancer. Over 88,000 people will be diagnosed with other types of cancer and approximately 36,000 people will die per year from cancer. Cancer accounts for 31% of male deaths and 26% of female deaths in Australia per annum. As a group of cancers, gynaecological cancers are the third most common form of cancer for Australian women, and the fourth most common form of cancer mortality in Australian women.

Mortality


Mortality rates for cervical cancer have declined by an average of 5.2% per annum since 1991. These gains are due in part to the success of the National Cervical Screening Program.


Mortality rates for cancer of the ovary and endometrial declined on average by 0.7% and 1.6% per annum respectively between 1991 and 2001.


Survival


The incidence of ovarian cancer has risen over the past two decades. However, the risk of women under the age of 75 years dying from this disease has declined from 1 in 142 (in 1983) to 1 in 176 (in 2004). (Source: Ovarian Cancer in Australia: An Overview 2006, AIHW & NBCC, 2006)


Cancer Australia


Cancer Australia is a new Commonwealth Government agency established to help reduce the impact of cancer in the community. It will provide national leadership to increase coordination of cancer control initiatives and improve outcomes for people affected by cancer.


Cancer Australia will collaborate with consumers, government, health professionals, researchers, cancer organisations and other stakeholders to:

enhance support, information and participation in decision-making for people affected by cancer;
improve the quality of cancer care, and support for health professionals; and
increase coordination and funding of cancer research, and actively support cancer clinical trials.

National Breast Cancer Centre


The NBCC was established in 1995 by the Commonwealth Government in response to community concerns about the human cost of breast cancer. In 2001 the role of the NBCC was expanded to incorporate the Ovarian Cancer Program, which aims to improve the health outcomes for women with ovarian cancer.


The National Health and Medical Research Council


The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), the main health and medical research funding body, provides research support through a variety of mechanisms, including support for individual research projects, broad programs of research, training awards for scholars and postdoctoral fellows, career research fellowships and special strategic research programs.


During 2000-06 the NHMRC provided more than $44 million for research into gynaecological cancers. In 2006, the NHMRC awarded more than $98.5 million for new cancer-related research for over 190 new grants, awarded for periods of up to 5 years. This included research on the causes and treatment of cancers and research that focuses specifically on cancers of particular concern or common in the Australian population: ovarian cancer ($5.7 million) and breast cancer ($12.9 million). Not all of the cancer-related research funding target a particular type of cancer. Some of the research looks at the common mechanisms in cancer, thus having relevance to all forms of cancer. Guidelines, which have either been approved or endorsed by the NHMRC, have been developed for all eight priority cancers, and for the psychosocial care of adults with cancer.


Recommendations and Commonwealth Government Responses


Recommendation 1


2.54 The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government establish a Centre for Gynaecological Cancers within the auspices of Cancer Australia. The Centre will have responsibility for giving national focus to gynaecological cancer issues and improving coordination of existing health, medical and support services and community projects.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government agrees to establish a Centre for Gynaecological Cancers within the auspices of Cancer Australia. Once the Centre has been established, the Government will ask it to undertake an early assessment of existing gynaecological cancer services and to provide a national focus to gynaecological cancer issues.


Recommendation 2


2.55 The Committee recommends, as a matter of priority, that the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers develops a website that is a ‘one-stop shop’ for reliable information on all issues relating to gynaecological cancers, including education, research and availability of services. The website of the National Institutes of Health in the United States is an example of a successful website upon which to base an Australian equivalent.


2.56 In all aspects of its work, the Centre should make optimal use of communications and information technology, including the Internet, to bring people together to discuss issues.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government agrees with this recommendation.


The Government will ask the new Centre for Gynaecological Cancers to develop a strategic plan to guide its work which includes the development of a website and mechanisms to make optimal use of communications and information technologies to support information sharing on gynaecological cancer issues.


Recommendation 3


2.57 The Committee recommends that a working group be formed, with the support of Cancer Australia, consisting of individuals with experience and expertise in gynaecological cancers to best develop the roles, responsibilities and priorities of the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government agrees with this recommendation and will seek advice from Cancer Australia and the relevant professional organisations (see recommendation 2.60) on the composition and terms of reference of the working group.


Recommendation 4


2.58 The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government provide the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers with seed-funding of $1 million for establishment and operational costs.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government agrees to provide $1 million in seed funding to support the establishment and initial operation of the Centre.


Recommendation 5


2.59 The Committee recommends that a national secretariat be formed within Cancer Australia to define the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers' ongoing objectives and to evaluate the success of the Centre after two years.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government supports this recommendation.


The Government will ask Cancer Australia to implement this recommendation.


2.60 The Committee further recommends that the Centre and its national secretariat work closely with Cancer Australia and its advisory groups, particularly the Gynaecological Cancer Advisory Group, and the National Breast Cancer Centre to ensure a cohesive approach to improving gynaecological cancer care in Australia.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government supports this recommendation and notes the benefits of developing a coordinated approach to improving gynaecological cancer care.


Recommendation 6


3.108 The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government commit further recurrent funding for:

basic research and clinical trials on topics relating to gynaecological cancers; and
academic research positions in areas relating to gynaecological cancers.

Commonwealth Government Response


Through the NHMRC, the Commonwealth Government has provided $44 million dollars from 2000-2006 to gynaecological cancer research.


The Government will ask Cancer Australia and the NHMRC to work together to ascertain the current level and adequacy of funding into gynaecological cancer research in Australia.


Recommendation 7


3.109 The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government in collaboration with Cancer Australia:

review the current level of funding allocated to bodies and individuals undertaking gynaecological cancer research in Australia; and
provide leadership in relation to the allocation of research funding for gynaecological cancers; and
improve awareness within the research community about the work being undertaken in order to minimise duplication.

Commonwealth Government Response


Cancer Australia was established by the Commonwealth Government to provide national leadership in cancer control, guide improvements to cancer prevention and care, ensure treatment is scientifically based, and oversee a dedicated budget for research into cancer.


In December 2006, Cancer Australia convened a National Research Advisory Group and a Research Roundtable meeting. The Cancer Research Roundtable brought together key government, non-government and community groups who fund cancer research in Australia. The Cancer Research Roundtable allows funders of cancer research to collaborate and coordinate funding and offers an opportunity to foster research collaboration, reduce duplication and build research capacity.


In 2007 the National Research Advisory Group will oversee an audit of cancer research in Australia. This audit will identify current cancer research activity and inform the development of a cancer research plan.


Cancer Australia and the NHMRC will work together with other funders to minimise any duplication of effort, to keep a watching brief on the ongoing investment of research in gynaecological cancers and will report back to the Government.


Recommendation 8


4.183 The Committee recommends that Cancer Australia work with the gynaecological cancer sector on an ongoing basis to develop national strategies improving the visibility of, and access to, screening, treatment and support services for women with gynaecological cancers.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government agrees that Cancer Australia should work with existing relevant organisations and notes that this is consistent with its role to provide national leadership in cancer control.


Recommendation 9


4.184 The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government's funding and leadership of the National Cervical Screening Program continue and that strategies be implemented to improve screening participation rates for Australian women, particularly for Indigenous women.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government will continue its funding and leadership of the National Cervical Screening Program and has initiatives in place which aim to improve screening rates for Australian women.


The National Cervical Screening Program (NCSP) is funded under the Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements (PHOFAs). Under the PHOFAs state and territory governments are required to implement a range of strategies to improve participation in the NCSP, including participation rates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women.


In the 2006-07 Budget funding was continued to encourage general practitioners to increase rates of participation in the NCSP, particularly in women who were lapsed or had never been screened, including Indigenous women. Since the initiative commenced, almost 190,000 previously under screened women have been screened by their GPs.


The NCSP, at the state and territory level, employs Indigenous staff to advise on communication and cultural matters, and uses Aboriginal Health Workers wherever possible to either provide services or communicate the importance of screening to Indigenous women.


A principles and practices document 
Principles, standards and guidelines for providers of cervical screening services for Indigenous women
 was developed in 2003, in consultation with Indigenous women, to assist in addressing barriers faced by Indigenous women when attending health services for cervical screening, and to maximise their access to cervical screening.


4.185 The Committee further recommends that the Commonwealth work collaboratively with State and Territory Governments to promote the National Cervical Screening Program for all Australian women.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government will continue to work collaboratively with state and territory governments to promote the National Cervical Cancer Screening Program.


4.186 The Committee further recommends that the Commonwealth Government explore the extension of Medicare rebates for Pap tests performed by nurse practitioners, regional nurses and Indigenous health workers who are suitably trained.


Commonwealth Government Response


Medicare rebates for Pap smears provided by a practice nurse on behalf of a general practitioner in rural and remote areas have been available since January 2005. This was extended from 1 November 2006 to provide Medicare rebates for practice nurses to undertake Pap smears and other preventive checks related to women's sexual and reproductive health on behalf of a general practitioner in all areas of Australia.


Recommendation 10


4.187 The Committee recommends that, as a priority, State and Territory Governments provide further funding so that all women being treated for gynaecological cancers have access, based on need, to clinical psychologists or psychosexual counsellors.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government supports this recommendation, noting it is a state and territory government responsibility.


Recommendation 11


4.188 The Committee recommends that Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments work collaboratively to ensure adequate funding for health and support programs in rural and remote areas, such as increased funding for specialist outreach clinics and for the use of modern telecommunications technologies.


Commonwealth Government Response


While the provision of health and support services in rural and remote areas is predominantly a state/territory responsibility, the Commonwealth Government provides additional assistance to rural areas through a range of workforce and health care access programs including: the Medical Specialist Outreach Assistance Program, the Advanced Specialist Training Posts in Rural Areas Program, the Rural Advanced Specialist Trainee Support Program and e-Health initiatives.


Recommendation 12


4.189 The Committee recommends that the Council of Australian Governments, as a matter of urgency, improve the current patient travel assistance arrangements in order to:

establish equity and standardisation of benefits;
ensure portability of benefits across jurisdictions; and
increase the level of benefits to better reflect the real costs of travel and accommodation.

Commonwealth Government Response


Implementation of this recommendation is the responsibility of the state and territory governments. On 1 January 1987, responsibility for the provision of the Isolated Patient Travel and Accommodation Assistance Scheme (IPTAAS) - with funding - was transferred from the Commonwealth Government to the states and territories.


States and territories are best placed to develop and administer flexible and effective measures for those in need, having regard to their own distribution of specialist services and the specific needs of their rural population.


Recommendation 13


4.190 The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government consider a Medicare Item Number for lymphoedema treatment by accredited physiotherapists and the provision of subsidised lymphoedema compression garments, based on need, for women as a result of cancer treatment.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government supports people with chronic conditions and complex care needs to access physiotherapy services through MBS item 10960 which allows up to five allied health services per patient each calendar year.


People with private health insurance may also be eligible for assistance through their insurance.


The provision of medical aids, such as compression garments, is generally the responsibility of the States and Territories.


Recommendation 14


4.191 The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government through the Medical Services Advisory Council (MSAC), review the MSAC's decisions on the use of liquid-based cytology (LBC) and high risk human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA testing in cervical screening processes.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) has completed assessments for liquid based cytology for cervical screening and human papilloma virus testing in women with cytological prediction of low-grade abnormality and found in both cases that there was insufficient evidence to support public funding at the time of the assessment.


In the event that further evidence is made available regarding liquid based cytology for cervical screening, the MSAC will reconsider this technology. MSAC is currently reviewing the use of human papilloma virus DNA testing for triage of pap smears.


Recommendation 15


4.192 The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing, as a priority, develop national strategies surrounding HPV vaccines and testing. Specifically, targeted and customised strategies to:

highlight the benefits of HPV vaccines;
provide easy access to the vaccines and appropriate educational resources, particularly for Indigenous Australians and people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds; and
develop and encourage the use of self-testing for high risk HPV.

Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government agrees that national strategies should be developed on HPV vaccines and testing.


On 29 November 2006, the Commonwealth Government announced funding for a national HPV vaccination program to commence in 2007 under the National Immunisation Program. The program will provide vaccines for females between 12 and 26 years of age. As part of implementation of this program, a comprehensive communication strategy will be developed.


As HPV vaccine does not protect against all cancer-causing HPV strains, nor is it effective in women already exposed to the virus, vaccinated women must continue to have regular Pap smears.


The Commonwealth Government working with the Screening Subcommittee of the Australian Population Health Development Principal Committee have developed a 
National policy for screening women vaccinated against HPV
 for the National Cervical Screening Program to provide information to health professionals and to provide a basis for the development of communication materials for women.


There is currently insufficient evidence to support the development of self-testing for high risk HPV.


Recommendation 16


4.193 The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government, in collaboration with Cancer Australia and the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers, develop strategies and targets to improve referral rates from general practitioners to gynaecological oncologists for women with ovarian cancer.


Commonwealth Government Response


Clinical practice guidelines for the management of women with epithelial ovarian cancer were developed by the Australian Cancer Network and the National Breast Cancer Centre and have been approved by the NHMRC. The guidelines recommend if an ovarian malignancy is suspected that direct referral to a gynaecological oncology unit is the preferred option. These guidelines have been widely distributed. The Government will ask relevant organisations to continue to promote these guidelines to the medical profession.


Recommendation 17


4.194 The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government, as a priority, assume responsibility for the funding, development and implementation of a national data collection and management system to ensure the appropriate and accurate collection of gynaecological cancer data.


Commonwealth Government Response


National data collections of gynaecological cancer cover incidence (from state and territory cancer registries where both the demographic and cancer data items are collected consistently to national and international data standards), mortality, and hospital inpatient admissions for all hospitals in Australia.


Cancer Australia will work with the Australasian Association of Cancer Registries and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare to consider options for improving data collection and management.


Recommendation 18


4.195 The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government in conjunction with the State and Territory Governments to expand the roles and responsibilities of specialist breast cancer nurses to include gynaecological cancers through cooperation with multidisciplinary gynaecological cancer centres.


Commonwealth Government Response


Definition of the roles and responsibilities of health professions is the responsibility of the state and territory governments and professional organisations. The Commonwealth Government currently provides assistance in addition to that of the jurisdictions through the 
Supporting Women in Rural Areas Diagnosed with Breast Cancer
 (SWRDBC) initiative. This initiative currently provides $4 million over four years up to 30 June 2007. On 2 January 2007, the Government announced a further four years of funding to target women in rural and remote areas who have been diagnosed with breast cancer.


Recommendation 19


4.196 The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government explore the need for Medicare rebates for MRI scans of pelvic, abdominal and breast areas.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government provides Medicare rebates for MRI scans of the pelvis (and abdomen) for staging cervical cancer at FIGO stages 1B or greater. The Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) is currently considering MRI for women at a high risk of developing breast cancer. The Commonwealth Government will support further reviews by MSAC where the evidence supports it.


Recommendation 20


4.197 The Committee recommends that Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments commit urgently needed funding and increased specialist resources to reduce current waiting times for women seeking the services of gynaecological oncologists and their multidisciplinary teams.


4.198 The Committee further recommends that maximum surgery waiting times are defined by key performance indicators agreed by treating physicians as not putting patients at risk.


Commonwealth Government Response


The funding and supply of specialist services is a responsibility of the state and territory governments.


Recommendation 21


5.103 The Committee recommends that an urgent review of the adequacy and provision of information to medical and allied health professionals about gynaecological cancers be undertaken by the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers.


5.104 The Committee further recommends that the gynaecological oncology medical and allied health communities, through the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers, have greater input into decisions about education strategies for professionals, women and adolescents.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government agrees with this recommendation and will seek advice from the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers on implementing this recommendation as part of developing its work plan.


Recommendation 22


5.105 The Committee recommends that the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers, with assistance from the gynaecological cancer community, develop culturally appropriate educational material focusing on the risk factors and symptoms of gynaecological cancers. Any such material should specifically meet the needs of general practitioners, nurses (including remote area nurses), Aboriginal health workers, gynaecologists and allied health professionals.


5.106 The Committee further recommends that educational materials be provided to general practitioners to inform them about the sub-specialty of gynaecological oncology and the circumstances in which it is appropriate to refer women to gynaecological oncologists.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government agrees with this recommendation and will seek advice from the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers on implementing this recommendation.


Recommendation 23


5.107 The Committee recommends that Cancer Australia formally investigate the referral patterns of general practitioners at a national level and devise appropriate strategies to address any concerning trends.


5.108 The Committee further recommends that accurate and accessible service directories should be developed in all jurisdictions to support knowledge-based appropriate referrals.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government agrees that information needs to be available to medical practitioners to inform their professional decisions, taken in collaboration with patients, regarding the most appropriate referral and treatment approaches. The Commonwealth Government has supported the development and dissemination of practice guidelines in this regard and will ask the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers to liaise with relevant professional bodies to ensure these are widely disseminated and useful.


Recommendation 24


5.109 The Committee recommends the development and distribution of clinical practice guidelines for all gynaecological cancers (or similar consistent and authoritative information) to ensure standard practice across the healthcare system.


Commonwealth Government Response


The NHMRC has developed clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and management of gynaecological cancers. (Refer to response to recommendation 23).


5.110 The Committee further recommends that the Australian Divisions of General Practice include gynaecological cancer issues in at least one professional development seminar per year.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government will draw this recommendation to the attention of the Australian General Practice Network (formerly Australian Divisions of General Practice).


Recommendation 25


5.111 The Committee recommends that all gynaecologists involved in treating gynaecological cancers associate themselves with a recognised multidisciplinary specialist gynaecological cancer unit.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government will draw this recommendation to the attention of the relevant professional organisations.


Recommendation 26


5.112 The Committee recommends that appropriate educational opportunities be offered to medical and allied health professionals from all settings to increase skills in gynaecological oncology. Appropriate financial incentives or assistance packages should be offered, and given where required.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government will draw this recommendation to the attention of the relevant professional organisations.


Recommendation 27


5.113 The Committee recommends that doctors who are training to be general practitioners be exposed to the concept of multidisciplinary care and the sub-specialty of gynaecological oncology in their training.


5.114 The Committee further recommends that medical professionals receive instruction and experience, where relevant, in diagnosing malignant gynaecological cancers through educational programs.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government will draw this recommendation to the attention of the relevant professional organisations.


Recommendation 28


6.105 The Committee recommends that Cancer Australia, in conjunction with the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers, be given wide-ranging responsibility for the management of coordinated national education strategies targeting women and their families, friends, carers and the broader community about gynaecological cancers.


6.106 The Committee further recommends that a review of all existing gynaecological cancer educational material targeting women and the broader community be undertaken by Cancer Australia, in conjunction with a Centre for Gynaecological Cancers, to review the currency of the content and the appropriateness for the audience.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government agrees with this recommendation and will ask Cancer Australia to consider this in the context of its initial strategic planning regarding gynaecological cancer issues.


Recommendation 29


6.107 The Committee recommends that Cancer Australia and the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers work together to develop a resource pack be developed and disseminated to give women and the broader community consolidated and consistent information about gynaecological cancers, treatment options, support groups and other services.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government will ask Cancer Australia to consider this in the context of its early assessment of gynaecological cancer issues and to report to the Government on this issue.


Recommendation 30


6.108 The Committee recommends that Cancer Australia and the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers work together to ensure that medical facilities and support organisations have visible and current information on-site in the form of posters and pamphlets about gynaecological cancers and related services.


Commonwealth Government Response

The Commonwealth Government will ask Cancer Australia to consider this in the context of its early assessment of gynaecological cancer issues and to report to the Government on these issues.

Recommendation 31


6.109 The Committee recommends that Cancer Australia analyse and assess the approach taken in the United States in the following areas:

public education (for example, the strategies of the Centres for Disease Control in relation to ovarian cancer);
advocacy by gynaecological cancer groups; and
service provision by support groups.

Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government will ask Cancer Australia to consider and compare activities in cancer control in a number of different countries including the United States of America.


Recommendation 32


7.88 The Committee recommends that Cancer Australia collaborate with individuals and groups to identify the best ways to ensure that expertise and experience in gynaecological cancer is represented on national health agencies, particularly Cancer Australia.


Commonwealth Government Response


Cancer Australia has a strong collaborative agenda with all cancer organisations and is establishing national reference groups for a range of tumour groups, which will include gynaecological cancers. These groups will include wide ranging expertise including consumer expertise to advise Cancer Australia on issues that impact on cancer control.


7.89 The Committee further recommends that consumer and community representatives have greater involvement in the decision-making of national health agencies.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Department of Health and Ageing already works with consumers and stakeholders in managing its programs. Cancer Australia’s Advisory Council includes several consumers of cancer services.


7.90 The Committee further recommends that when membership of Cancer Australia's Advisory Council is due for review, one or more consumer representatives from the reproductive cancer sector be appointed to maintain the confidence of groups within those areas.


Commonwealth Government Response


The members of the Advisory Council for Cancer Australia have been appointed by the Minister for their particular expertise and not as representatives of any particular group. The Council's membership includes several consumers of cancer services.


Recommendation 33


7.91 The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing, Cancer Australia and the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers communicate with each other about the content of future work plans in order to avoid confusion over responsibility for the development of initiatives and program delivery.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing has primary carriage for advising the Government on cancer policy issues. This is done in collaboration with Cancer Australia.


Cancer Australia has an important role in providing strategic national leadership in bringing together key cancer organisations, guiding improvements to cancer prevention and care, ensuring treatment is scientifically based; and coordinating and liaising between the wide range of groups and providers with an interest in cancer. Both Agencies report to the Minister for Health and Ageing and work closely together on cancer issues.


Recommendation 34


7.92 The Committee recommends that the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers put arrangements in place to ensure continuity between the work of the now defunct National Cancer Control Initiative and Cancer Australia, particularly in relation to gynaecological cancers.


Commonwealth Government Response


Cancer Australia will continue to build on the excellent work of the National Cancer Control Initiative.
",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,19,1
"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2007-02-27,"—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the document.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I want to say how much I welcome the government’s response to this report and its careful consideration of our 34 recommendations. Right at the start I would like to say that this is a very clear example of Senate women coming together to work on an issue. All of us saw this issue as being above party politics, an issue important to all women in Australia and their families, including their husbands, their brothers, their fathers and their children. For the first time that I can remember, committee members, under the careful chairmanship of Senator Gary Humphries, were able to come together and, with the aid of some expert advice from some of our very highly trained gynaecological oncologists, put together a report which identified, perhaps for the very first time, some of the gaps in the opportunities for information to be given to the women suffering from breast cancer who have not had their own organisation to cope with the difficulties of gynaecological cancers.
I would also like to say at the outset that the work that Helen Zorbas and the National Breast Cancer Centre have done in taking care of this issue since the year 2000 has been absolutely fundamental to and instrumental in making sure that the work done in Australia has been done to the best effect possible. However, I was disturbed to see this week, Natural Ovarian Cancer Awareness Week, that in fact large numbers of women still do not understand that Pap smears will not identify ovarian cancer. There are many tests available for various forms of cancer but, unfortunately, research teams, both here and overseas, have still not found an early warning test for ovarian cancer and, as a result of that, more than a thousand women are diagnosed every year with it.
I think that more than anything this report is an indication that when there was a serious women’s health issue and all of us realised that all of our women—never mind what they might do every three years at the ballot box—wanted it dealt with and wanted expert advice and wanted to have a voice, we all got together. That is why we called our report Breaking the silence, because we believed that it was time to break the silence on this issue.
I would like to acknowledge the government’s commitment to establishing a national centre for gynaecological cancers under the governance of Cancer Australia. This is of course what the committee strongly recommended. We wanted to provide a national focus for gynaecological issues and, importantly, to increase the education and awareness of medical and allied health professionals. I think I also speak for other members of the committee when I say that we could not have done this work without people of the eminence of Professor Neville Hacker, the Director of the Gynaecological Cancer Centre at the Royal Hospital for Women in Sydney, who gave freely of his time and acted as a mentor to all of us. Getting across this issue was not easy—it is quite technical; some of the medical material is quite difficult—but he was always available and always patient. I know he helped all of us, so I would like to acknowledge him and some of the members of his gynaecological oncology team.
The issue of education in this particular area, of both women and the broader community, was a recurring theme during the inquiry, with many submissions and witnesses telling the committee that a targeted approach was needed to deliver information. I also welcome the announcement that, as we recommended, the government will provide a million dollars in seed funding to support the establishment and initial operation of the centre. That is in addition to the nearly $13.6 million over the six years to 2009 that the government has invested in programs for women’s cancers, over half of which has been used to deliver breast and ovarian cancer programs through the National Breast Cancer Centre, through Helen Zorbas and her talented team.
The NBCC has a vital and highly regarded role that is being played in the absence of anything else that is available for us in the gynaecological cancer area. But increasingly we were consistently told in evidence that when women are looking for information on ovarian cancer or any of the other gynaecological cancers they do not automatically understand that they need to go to the NBCC. Now we will have a dedicated area and for the first time we will actually be able to direct them to a specific site. I know, from all the work that they have been doing, that Helen and her people will work closely with the new gynaecological cancer centre and Cancer Australia to make sure that we deliver the fantastic service that they already deliver on breast cancer.
I would also like to thank Tony Abbott. He can relax now; I will stop pestering him. I must say that, right from the start, Tony was receptive to our position. He was patient in understanding where we were coming from. I think that one of the issues that really swung it for us was the fact that every single gynaecological oncologist in Australia argued together as a body to implement this national centre. Not only were the women together; the gynaecological oncologists were together. I congratulate Tony and his department for the way in which they have been receptive to these recommendations.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,19,1
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2007-02-27,"—I also wish to make some comments on the government response. I welcome the government’s response to our inquiry into gynaecological cancer, and I also note that the government response came in a very timely fashion—within a six-month period. In my short time here, I think that is unprecedented. Also unprecedented is a government response which has been so largely positive to the 34 recommendations the committee put forward. Some of that must be brought home to the amazing efforts of Senator Jeannie Ferris. She said in her contribution that she was going to cease bothering the minister. I think the senator could be misleading the Senate with that particular statement. I hope she is, because I think that her passionate support of the women who are working through this process, their families and the extraordinarily talented and dedicated professionals who work in this area, and her particular method of bothering the minister have been instrumental in making sure that the government response has come forward.
We had no recommendation rejected by the government, amazingly enough. We referred several recommendations back to the states and territories—quite rightly, I think, because so much of the health and education process and the involvement of people in their health journeys must be a cooperative response between the patients, families, medical practitioners and governments at both state and federal levels. In many ways, that was the message of this particular inquiry: people must work together, because the only way that we will achieve what we hope to achieve in this area is for governments to work together and for us to be genuinely woman-focused—because this particular form of cancer is a woman’s cancer.
In many ways the response today is a testament to the extraordinary women who gave of their time and experience and came forward with their evidence to our committee. They also came forward with their expectations, because they told us that they expected their governments to respond. Now we have a level of response at the first round from the government and I say, ‘Come forward, Cancer Australia.’ More than half of the recommendations refer to the actions we must now take with the effective implementation of Cancer Australia. We know that can occur, but we will be watching. Indeed, there must be a focus on hearing people’s voices on their treatment and on ensuring that there are effective research dollars given. We now must work together so that the horror of gynaecological cancer is faced, identified, researched and cured. That outcome can be achieved.
I think that as a parliament we must now ensure that the work that has been put forward is fulfilled. I know that there is goodwill. There were a number of recommendations on combining services and putting forward effective research. It came out consistently that the research dollars available in this area had not reflected the need. We will now have a focus for our efforts: there will be a centre whose major activity will be around issues to do with gynaecological cancer—those issues will no longer be lost or dismissed amidst all the other arguments that come forward when we talk about cancer in our community—and it will work within the auspices of Cancer Australia. We have the expectation that this will succeed. We will work together to ensure it will be done and we will be able to look to the women who came forward and say, ‘We’ve heard you. Your voices have been heard and there will be a move forward.’
I will be talking later tonight about National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Week, which is this week, and Senator Ferris mentioned the importance of awareness and education. I want to place on the record, because I promised them that I would, my support for the women from the Lymphedema Network. I think there is much more work to be done in that area. I believe that the government response, which looks at a limited number of treatments being covered by Medicare, does not go far enough. But we will be able to continue the pressure to ensure that we can go forward. As Senator Ferris quite rightly said, this is a start. We have the process to move forward.
I want to congratulate again the women who made sure that this inquiry occurred, because it was not something that was rushed out in the agenda. It took pressure and also the work of Senator Lyn Allison—
—Hear, hear!
—with her roundtable of women from Victoria. Those women need to be acknowledged. I think the voices of Margaret Heffernan and her supporters need to be acknowledged. Once again, this is not the end. We have had the government response. There were 34 recommendations and not one was rejected. I would like to have that on record over and over again. There is money—$1 million in seed funding. I have to admit that, when the committee was meeting on this issue, we wondered whether in fact we would be able to achieve that, but it has been achieved. We have it in black and white: the government accepts this recommendation of $1 million of seed funding money. Through the processes of this place we will be making sure that the money is spent well, that Cancer Australia maintains the activity that it began quite recently and that the women of Australia will be feeling more confident when they have this issue brought before them.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,19,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2007-02-27,"—I am also very pleased having seen this response to our report. I cannot recall seeing a government response which has been so accepting of recommendations. I congratulate the government on its response and, again, say how pleased I am. It was a great honour for me to be a part of this process. A great deal has already been said about the women who were involved both in the parliament and beyond. This response sends an important message to people that signing a petition can make a difference. It has often bothered me, in fact, that so many petitions do not go on to be investigated and looked at in detail, but this one did and I thank the Senate for its indulgence in doing that and the committee itself for accepting that petition and for taking action on it.
This is a huge step forward for women’s health. As I said, it is a great credit to the many women who have been involved in the process. This is a hidden and very life-threatening set of cancers. It is a very important step forward. Of course, the first recommendation—the most important, in my view—was to set up a centre for gynaecological cancers within the auspices of Cancer Australia. That centre will give a national focus to these diseases; it will improve the coordination of existing health, medical and support services, and community projects. What we are really asking is for this very serious condition to have a national focus, to have attention paid to it, in much the same way as breast cancer does. Throughout this inquiry we were constantly made aware of the great success in the testing and treatment of breast cancer and the terrific work that has been done in the past on that. This will hopefully save lives. This will make the lives of many women much better and allow them to cope with their disease more adequately. As I said, the most important thing is that it will save lives. We can be proud of that. Of course, we cannot know how many lives will be saved—we will never know that, but that is what we are here for.
I also pay great respect to Senator Jeannie Ferris, whose role in this inquiry was inspiring for us all. We were touched by what she was going through at the time. Her role in the inquiry process was a brave and difficult one—we all understood that at various times—but, nonetheless, I do not think we could have done it without Senator Ferris. I thank her for those efforts.
The government should be on notice that we will not put this away and forget about it. We will be following up all of the recommendations and will ask the questions. Has it happened? When are we going to see some results from this? So our work is not yet done. Senator Moore, Senator Ferris and others, we need to press on. As has been said, there are some areas where recommendations have perhaps been shifted to the states, and we might need to add some pressure to the states and the federal government to coordinate those efforts. One of those areas concerns women who travel great distances to have cancer treatments and often have very long periods of time when lymphedema very significantly affects their lives. That is a bit of unfinished business, and I make a commitment here and now that we will still be on that case. I thank the government for their response. We really look forward to watching how Cancer Australia handles this and, hopefully, we will have a vibrant and effective centre of excellence for gynaecological cancers as a result. I seek leave to continue my remarks.
Leave granted; debate adjourned.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,19,1
"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2007-02-27,"—I present the government’s response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs on its inquiry into gynaecological cancers in Australia, and I seek leave to have the document incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.

Inquiry into Gynaecological Cancer in Australia


Commonwealth Government Response to the Committee’s Report:


Breaking the silence: a national voice for gynaecological cancers


February 2007


Introduction


Australia has one of the best systems of cancer care in the world. In comparison to other developed countries, Australia has relatively high cancer incidence rates but comparatively low cancer mortality rates, indicating that cancer survival in Australia is relatively good. The health system in Australia is performing well in lengthening survival through early detection and in the treatment of cancer.


The Commonwealth Government provides significant resources in relation to the prevention and treatment of gynaecological cancers. Advances continue to be made in gynaecological cancer research; during 2000-06 the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) provided more than $44 million for research into gynaecological cancers.


The Government has invested heavily in screening for female cancers, notably breast and cervical cancer. The National Cervical Screening Program (NCSP) has been so successful in detecting and following up pre-cancerous abnormalities that the incidence of cervical cancer has fallen by 57% and mortality by 58% in the past ten years.


The Government also funds a national ovarian cancer program through the National Breast Cancer Centre (NBCC). The NBCC has developed evidenced based guidelines, endorsed by the NHMRC, for the management of women with epithelial ovarian cancer. It is now focussing on assisting with enhancing treatment through the development of a guide for health professionals on multidisciplinary cancer care meetings.


Burden of Gynaecological Cancer in Australia


Each year in Australia an estimated 462,000 people are diagnosed with cancer. Approximately 374,000 of these cases are less threatening types of skin cancer – namely non-melanocytic skin cancer. Over 88,000 people will be diagnosed with other types of cancer and approximately 36,000 people will die per year from cancer. Cancer accounts for 31% of male deaths and 26% of female deaths in Australia per annum. As a group of cancers, gynaecological cancers are the third most common form of cancer for Australian women, and the fourth most common form of cancer mortality in Australian women.

Mortality


Mortality rates for cervical cancer have declined by an average of 5.2% per annum since 1991. These gains are due in part to the success of the National Cervical Screening Program.


Mortality rates for cancer of the ovary and endometrial declined on average by 0.7% and 1.6% per annum respectively between 1991 and 2001.


Survival


The incidence of ovarian cancer has risen over the past two decades. However, the risk of women under the age of 75 years dying from this disease has declined from 1 in 142 (in 1983) to 1 in 176 (in 2004). (Source: Ovarian Cancer in Australia: An Overview 2006, AIHW & NBCC, 2006)


Cancer Australia


Cancer Australia is a new Commonwealth Government agency established to help reduce the impact of cancer in the community. It will provide national leadership to increase coordination of cancer control initiatives and improve outcomes for people affected by cancer.


Cancer Australia will collaborate with consumers, government, health professionals, researchers, cancer organisations and other stakeholders to:

enhance support, information and participation in decision-making for people affected by cancer;
improve the quality of cancer care, and support for health professionals; and
increase coordination and funding of cancer research, and actively support cancer clinical trials.

National Breast Cancer Centre


The NBCC was established in 1995 by the Commonwealth Government in response to community concerns about the human cost of breast cancer. In 2001 the role of the NBCC was expanded to incorporate the Ovarian Cancer Program, which aims to improve the health outcomes for women with ovarian cancer.


The National Health and Medical Research Council


The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), the main health and medical research funding body, provides research support through a variety of mechanisms, including support for individual research projects, broad programs of research, training awards for scholars and postdoctoral fellows, career research fellowships and special strategic research programs.


During 2000-06 the NHMRC provided more than $44 million for research into gynaecological cancers. In 2006, the NHMRC awarded more than $98.5 million for new cancer-related research for over 190 new grants, awarded for periods of up to 5 years. This included research on the causes and treatment of cancers and research that focuses specifically on cancers of particular concern or common in the Australian population: ovarian cancer ($5.7 million) and breast cancer ($12.9 million). Not all of the cancer-related research funding target a particular type of cancer. Some of the research looks at the common mechanisms in cancer, thus having relevance to all forms of cancer. Guidelines, which have either been approved or endorsed by the NHMRC, have been developed for all eight priority cancers, and for the psychosocial care of adults with cancer.


Recommendations and Commonwealth Government Responses


Recommendation 1


2.54 The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government establish a Centre for Gynaecological Cancers within the auspices of Cancer Australia. The Centre will have responsibility for giving national focus to gynaecological cancer issues and improving coordination of existing health, medical and support services and community projects.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government agrees to establish a Centre for Gynaecological Cancers within the auspices of Cancer Australia. Once the Centre has been established, the Government will ask it to undertake an early assessment of existing gynaecological cancer services and to provide a national focus to gynaecological cancer issues.


Recommendation 2


2.55 The Committee recommends, as a matter of priority, that the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers develops a website that is a ‘one-stop shop’ for reliable information on all issues relating to gynaecological cancers, including education, research and availability of services. The website of the National Institutes of Health in the United States is an example of a successful website upon which to base an Australian equivalent.


2.56 In all aspects of its work, the Centre should make optimal use of communications and information technology, including the Internet, to bring people together to discuss issues.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government agrees with this recommendation.


The Government will ask the new Centre for Gynaecological Cancers to develop a strategic plan to guide its work which includes the development of a website and mechanisms to make optimal use of communications and information technologies to support information sharing on gynaecological cancer issues.


Recommendation 3


2.57 The Committee recommends that a working group be formed, with the support of Cancer Australia, consisting of individuals with experience and expertise in gynaecological cancers to best develop the roles, responsibilities and priorities of the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government agrees with this recommendation and will seek advice from Cancer Australia and the relevant professional organisations (see recommendation 2.60) on the composition and terms of reference of the working group.


Recommendation 4


2.58 The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government provide the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers with seed-funding of $1 million for establishment and operational costs.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government agrees to provide $1 million in seed funding to support the establishment and initial operation of the Centre.


Recommendation 5


2.59 The Committee recommends that a national secretariat be formed within Cancer Australia to define the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers' ongoing objectives and to evaluate the success of the Centre after two years.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government supports this recommendation.


The Government will ask Cancer Australia to implement this recommendation.


2.60 The Committee further recommends that the Centre and its national secretariat work closely with Cancer Australia and its advisory groups, particularly the Gynaecological Cancer Advisory Group, and the National Breast Cancer Centre to ensure a cohesive approach to improving gynaecological cancer care in Australia.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government supports this recommendation and notes the benefits of developing a coordinated approach to improving gynaecological cancer care.


Recommendation 6


3.108 The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government commit further recurrent funding for:

basic research and clinical trials on topics relating to gynaecological cancers; and
academic research positions in areas relating to gynaecological cancers.

Commonwealth Government Response


Through the NHMRC, the Commonwealth Government has provided $44 million dollars from 2000-2006 to gynaecological cancer research.


The Government will ask Cancer Australia and the NHMRC to work together to ascertain the current level and adequacy of funding into gynaecological cancer research in Australia.


Recommendation 7


3.109 The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government in collaboration with Cancer Australia:

review the current level of funding allocated to bodies and individuals undertaking gynaecological cancer research in Australia; and
provide leadership in relation to the allocation of research funding for gynaecological cancers; and
improve awareness within the research community about the work being undertaken in order to minimise duplication.

Commonwealth Government Response


Cancer Australia was established by the Commonwealth Government to provide national leadership in cancer control, guide improvements to cancer prevention and care, ensure treatment is scientifically based, and oversee a dedicated budget for research into cancer.


In December 2006, Cancer Australia convened a National Research Advisory Group and a Research Roundtable meeting. The Cancer Research Roundtable brought together key government, non-government and community groups who fund cancer research in Australia. The Cancer Research Roundtable allows funders of cancer research to collaborate and coordinate funding and offers an opportunity to foster research collaboration, reduce duplication and build research capacity.


In 2007 the National Research Advisory Group will oversee an audit of cancer research in Australia. This audit will identify current cancer research activity and inform the development of a cancer research plan.


Cancer Australia and the NHMRC will work together with other funders to minimise any duplication of effort, to keep a watching brief on the ongoing investment of research in gynaecological cancers and will report back to the Government.


Recommendation 8


4.183 The Committee recommends that Cancer Australia work with the gynaecological cancer sector on an ongoing basis to develop national strategies improving the visibility of, and access to, screening, treatment and support services for women with gynaecological cancers.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government agrees that Cancer Australia should work with existing relevant organisations and notes that this is consistent with its role to provide national leadership in cancer control.


Recommendation 9


4.184 The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government's funding and leadership of the National Cervical Screening Program continue and that strategies be implemented to improve screening participation rates for Australian women, particularly for Indigenous women.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government will continue its funding and leadership of the National Cervical Screening Program and has initiatives in place which aim to improve screening rates for Australian women.


The National Cervical Screening Program (NCSP) is funded under the Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements (PHOFAs). Under the PHOFAs state and territory governments are required to implement a range of strategies to improve participation in the NCSP, including participation rates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women.


In the 2006-07 Budget funding was continued to encourage general practitioners to increase rates of participation in the NCSP, particularly in women who were lapsed or had never been screened, including Indigenous women. Since the initiative commenced, almost 190,000 previously under screened women have been screened by their GPs.


The NCSP, at the state and territory level, employs Indigenous staff to advise on communication and cultural matters, and uses Aboriginal Health Workers wherever possible to either provide services or communicate the importance of screening to Indigenous women.


A principles and practices document 
Principles, standards and guidelines for providers of cervical screening services for Indigenous women
 was developed in 2003, in consultation with Indigenous women, to assist in addressing barriers faced by Indigenous women when attending health services for cervical screening, and to maximise their access to cervical screening.


4.185 The Committee further recommends that the Commonwealth work collaboratively with State and Territory Governments to promote the National Cervical Screening Program for all Australian women.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government will continue to work collaboratively with state and territory governments to promote the National Cervical Cancer Screening Program.


4.186 The Committee further recommends that the Commonwealth Government explore the extension of Medicare rebates for Pap tests performed by nurse practitioners, regional nurses and Indigenous health workers who are suitably trained.


Commonwealth Government Response


Medicare rebates for Pap smears provided by a practice nurse on behalf of a general practitioner in rural and remote areas have been available since January 2005. This was extended from 1 November 2006 to provide Medicare rebates for practice nurses to undertake Pap smears and other preventive checks related to women's sexual and reproductive health on behalf of a general practitioner in all areas of Australia.


Recommendation 10


4.187 The Committee recommends that, as a priority, State and Territory Governments provide further funding so that all women being treated for gynaecological cancers have access, based on need, to clinical psychologists or psychosexual counsellors.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government supports this recommendation, noting it is a state and territory government responsibility.


Recommendation 11


4.188 The Committee recommends that Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments work collaboratively to ensure adequate funding for health and support programs in rural and remote areas, such as increased funding for specialist outreach clinics and for the use of modern telecommunications technologies.


Commonwealth Government Response


While the provision of health and support services in rural and remote areas is predominantly a state/territory responsibility, the Commonwealth Government provides additional assistance to rural areas through a range of workforce and health care access programs including: the Medical Specialist Outreach Assistance Program, the Advanced Specialist Training Posts in Rural Areas Program, the Rural Advanced Specialist Trainee Support Program and e-Health initiatives.


Recommendation 12


4.189 The Committee recommends that the Council of Australian Governments, as a matter of urgency, improve the current patient travel assistance arrangements in order to:

establish equity and standardisation of benefits;
ensure portability of benefits across jurisdictions; and
increase the level of benefits to better reflect the real costs of travel and accommodation.

Commonwealth Government Response


Implementation of this recommendation is the responsibility of the state and territory governments. On 1 January 1987, responsibility for the provision of the Isolated Patient Travel and Accommodation Assistance Scheme (IPTAAS) - with funding - was transferred from the Commonwealth Government to the states and territories.


States and territories are best placed to develop and administer flexible and effective measures for those in need, having regard to their own distribution of specialist services and the specific needs of their rural population.


Recommendation 13


4.190 The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government consider a Medicare Item Number for lymphoedema treatment by accredited physiotherapists and the provision of subsidised lymphoedema compression garments, based on need, for women as a result of cancer treatment.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government supports people with chronic conditions and complex care needs to access physiotherapy services through MBS item 10960 which allows up to five allied health services per patient each calendar year.


People with private health insurance may also be eligible for assistance through their insurance.


The provision of medical aids, such as compression garments, is generally the responsibility of the States and Territories.


Recommendation 14


4.191 The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government through the Medical Services Advisory Council (MSAC), review the MSAC's decisions on the use of liquid-based cytology (LBC) and high risk human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA testing in cervical screening processes.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) has completed assessments for liquid based cytology for cervical screening and human papilloma virus testing in women with cytological prediction of low-grade abnormality and found in both cases that there was insufficient evidence to support public funding at the time of the assessment.


In the event that further evidence is made available regarding liquid based cytology for cervical screening, the MSAC will reconsider this technology. MSAC is currently reviewing the use of human papilloma virus DNA testing for triage of pap smears.


Recommendation 15


4.192 The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing, as a priority, develop national strategies surrounding HPV vaccines and testing. Specifically, targeted and customised strategies to:

highlight the benefits of HPV vaccines;
provide easy access to the vaccines and appropriate educational resources, particularly for Indigenous Australians and people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds; and
develop and encourage the use of self-testing for high risk HPV.

Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government agrees that national strategies should be developed on HPV vaccines and testing.


On 29 November 2006, the Commonwealth Government announced funding for a national HPV vaccination program to commence in 2007 under the National Immunisation Program. The program will provide vaccines for females between 12 and 26 years of age. As part of implementation of this program, a comprehensive communication strategy will be developed.


As HPV vaccine does not protect against all cancer-causing HPV strains, nor is it effective in women already exposed to the virus, vaccinated women must continue to have regular Pap smears.


The Commonwealth Government working with the Screening Subcommittee of the Australian Population Health Development Principal Committee have developed a 
National policy for screening women vaccinated against HPV
 for the National Cervical Screening Program to provide information to health professionals and to provide a basis for the development of communication materials for women.


There is currently insufficient evidence to support the development of self-testing for high risk HPV.


Recommendation 16


4.193 The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government, in collaboration with Cancer Australia and the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers, develop strategies and targets to improve referral rates from general practitioners to gynaecological oncologists for women with ovarian cancer.


Commonwealth Government Response


Clinical practice guidelines for the management of women with epithelial ovarian cancer were developed by the Australian Cancer Network and the National Breast Cancer Centre and have been approved by the NHMRC. The guidelines recommend if an ovarian malignancy is suspected that direct referral to a gynaecological oncology unit is the preferred option. These guidelines have been widely distributed. The Government will ask relevant organisations to continue to promote these guidelines to the medical profession.


Recommendation 17


4.194 The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government, as a priority, assume responsibility for the funding, development and implementation of a national data collection and management system to ensure the appropriate and accurate collection of gynaecological cancer data.


Commonwealth Government Response


National data collections of gynaecological cancer cover incidence (from state and territory cancer registries where both the demographic and cancer data items are collected consistently to national and international data standards), mortality, and hospital inpatient admissions for all hospitals in Australia.


Cancer Australia will work with the Australasian Association of Cancer Registries and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare to consider options for improving data collection and management.


Recommendation 18


4.195 The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government in conjunction with the State and Territory Governments to expand the roles and responsibilities of specialist breast cancer nurses to include gynaecological cancers through cooperation with multidisciplinary gynaecological cancer centres.


Commonwealth Government Response


Definition of the roles and responsibilities of health professions is the responsibility of the state and territory governments and professional organisations. The Commonwealth Government currently provides assistance in addition to that of the jurisdictions through the 
Supporting Women in Rural Areas Diagnosed with Breast Cancer
 (SWRDBC) initiative. This initiative currently provides $4 million over four years up to 30 June 2007. On 2 January 2007, the Government announced a further four years of funding to target women in rural and remote areas who have been diagnosed with breast cancer.


Recommendation 19


4.196 The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government explore the need for Medicare rebates for MRI scans of pelvic, abdominal and breast areas.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government provides Medicare rebates for MRI scans of the pelvis (and abdomen) for staging cervical cancer at FIGO stages 1B or greater. The Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) is currently considering MRI for women at a high risk of developing breast cancer. The Commonwealth Government will support further reviews by MSAC where the evidence supports it.


Recommendation 20


4.197 The Committee recommends that Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments commit urgently needed funding and increased specialist resources to reduce current waiting times for women seeking the services of gynaecological oncologists and their multidisciplinary teams.


4.198 The Committee further recommends that maximum surgery waiting times are defined by key performance indicators agreed by treating physicians as not putting patients at risk.


Commonwealth Government Response


The funding and supply of specialist services is a responsibility of the state and territory governments.


Recommendation 21


5.103 The Committee recommends that an urgent review of the adequacy and provision of information to medical and allied health professionals about gynaecological cancers be undertaken by the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers.


5.104 The Committee further recommends that the gynaecological oncology medical and allied health communities, through the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers, have greater input into decisions about education strategies for professionals, women and adolescents.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government agrees with this recommendation and will seek advice from the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers on implementing this recommendation as part of developing its work plan.


Recommendation 22


5.105 The Committee recommends that the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers, with assistance from the gynaecological cancer community, develop culturally appropriate educational material focusing on the risk factors and symptoms of gynaecological cancers. Any such material should specifically meet the needs of general practitioners, nurses (including remote area nurses), Aboriginal health workers, gynaecologists and allied health professionals.


5.106 The Committee further recommends that educational materials be provided to general practitioners to inform them about the sub-specialty of gynaecological oncology and the circumstances in which it is appropriate to refer women to gynaecological oncologists.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government agrees with this recommendation and will seek advice from the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers on implementing this recommendation.


Recommendation 23


5.107 The Committee recommends that Cancer Australia formally investigate the referral patterns of general practitioners at a national level and devise appropriate strategies to address any concerning trends.


5.108 The Committee further recommends that accurate and accessible service directories should be developed in all jurisdictions to support knowledge-based appropriate referrals.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government agrees that information needs to be available to medical practitioners to inform their professional decisions, taken in collaboration with patients, regarding the most appropriate referral and treatment approaches. The Commonwealth Government has supported the development and dissemination of practice guidelines in this regard and will ask the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers to liaise with relevant professional bodies to ensure these are widely disseminated and useful.


Recommendation 24


5.109 The Committee recommends the development and distribution of clinical practice guidelines for all gynaecological cancers (or similar consistent and authoritative information) to ensure standard practice across the healthcare system.


Commonwealth Government Response


The NHMRC has developed clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and management of gynaecological cancers. (Refer to response to recommendation 23).


5.110 The Committee further recommends that the Australian Divisions of General Practice include gynaecological cancer issues in at least one professional development seminar per year.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government will draw this recommendation to the attention of the Australian General Practice Network (formerly Australian Divisions of General Practice).


Recommendation 25


5.111 The Committee recommends that all gynaecologists involved in treating gynaecological cancers associate themselves with a recognised multidisciplinary specialist gynaecological cancer unit.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government will draw this recommendation to the attention of the relevant professional organisations.


Recommendation 26


5.112 The Committee recommends that appropriate educational opportunities be offered to medical and allied health professionals from all settings to increase skills in gynaecological oncology. Appropriate financial incentives or assistance packages should be offered, and given where required.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government will draw this recommendation to the attention of the relevant professional organisations.


Recommendation 27


5.113 The Committee recommends that doctors who are training to be general practitioners be exposed to the concept of multidisciplinary care and the sub-specialty of gynaecological oncology in their training.


5.114 The Committee further recommends that medical professionals receive instruction and experience, where relevant, in diagnosing malignant gynaecological cancers through educational programs.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government will draw this recommendation to the attention of the relevant professional organisations.


Recommendation 28


6.105 The Committee recommends that Cancer Australia, in conjunction with the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers, be given wide-ranging responsibility for the management of coordinated national education strategies targeting women and their families, friends, carers and the broader community about gynaecological cancers.


6.106 The Committee further recommends that a review of all existing gynaecological cancer educational material targeting women and the broader community be undertaken by Cancer Australia, in conjunction with a Centre for Gynaecological Cancers, to review the currency of the content and the appropriateness for the audience.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government agrees with this recommendation and will ask Cancer Australia to consider this in the context of its initial strategic planning regarding gynaecological cancer issues.


Recommendation 29


6.107 The Committee recommends that Cancer Australia and the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers work together to develop a resource pack be developed and disseminated to give women and the broader community consolidated and consistent information about gynaecological cancers, treatment options, support groups and other services.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government will ask Cancer Australia to consider this in the context of its early assessment of gynaecological cancer issues and to report to the Government on this issue.


Recommendation 30


6.108 The Committee recommends that Cancer Australia and the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers work together to ensure that medical facilities and support organisations have visible and current information on-site in the form of posters and pamphlets about gynaecological cancers and related services.


Commonwealth Government Response

The Commonwealth Government will ask Cancer Australia to consider this in the context of its early assessment of gynaecological cancer issues and to report to the Government on these issues.

Recommendation 31


6.109 The Committee recommends that Cancer Australia analyse and assess the approach taken in the United States in the following areas:

public education (for example, the strategies of the Centres for Disease Control in relation to ovarian cancer);
advocacy by gynaecological cancer groups; and
service provision by support groups.

Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Government will ask Cancer Australia to consider and compare activities in cancer control in a number of different countries including the United States of America.


Recommendation 32


7.88 The Committee recommends that Cancer Australia collaborate with individuals and groups to identify the best ways to ensure that expertise and experience in gynaecological cancer is represented on national health agencies, particularly Cancer Australia.


Commonwealth Government Response


Cancer Australia has a strong collaborative agenda with all cancer organisations and is establishing national reference groups for a range of tumour groups, which will include gynaecological cancers. These groups will include wide ranging expertise including consumer expertise to advise Cancer Australia on issues that impact on cancer control.


7.89 The Committee further recommends that consumer and community representatives have greater involvement in the decision-making of national health agencies.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Department of Health and Ageing already works with consumers and stakeholders in managing its programs. Cancer Australia’s Advisory Council includes several consumers of cancer services.


7.90 The Committee further recommends that when membership of Cancer Australia's Advisory Council is due for review, one or more consumer representatives from the reproductive cancer sector be appointed to maintain the confidence of groups within those areas.


Commonwealth Government Response


The members of the Advisory Council for Cancer Australia have been appointed by the Minister for their particular expertise and not as representatives of any particular group. The Council's membership includes several consumers of cancer services.


Recommendation 33


7.91 The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing, Cancer Australia and the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers communicate with each other about the content of future work plans in order to avoid confusion over responsibility for the development of initiatives and program delivery.


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing has primary carriage for advising the Government on cancer policy issues. This is done in collaboration with Cancer Australia.


Cancer Australia has an important role in providing strategic national leadership in bringing together key cancer organisations, guiding improvements to cancer prevention and care, ensuring treatment is scientifically based; and coordinating and liaising between the wide range of groups and providers with an interest in cancer. Both Agencies report to the Minister for Health and Ageing and work closely together on cancer issues.


Recommendation 34


7.92 The Committee recommends that the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers put arrangements in place to ensure continuity between the work of the now defunct National Cancer Control Initiative and Cancer Australia, particularly in relation to gynaecological cancers.


Commonwealth Government Response


Cancer Australia will continue to build on the excellent work of the National Cancer Control Initiative.
",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,19,2
"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2007-02-27,"—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the document.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I want to say how much I welcome the government’s response to this report and its careful consideration of our 34 recommendations. Right at the start I would like to say that this is a very clear example of Senate women coming together to work on an issue. All of us saw this issue as being above party politics, an issue important to all women in Australia and their families, including their husbands, their brothers, their fathers and their children. For the first time that I can remember, committee members, under the careful chairmanship of Senator Gary Humphries, were able to come together and, with the aid of some expert advice from some of our very highly trained gynaecological oncologists, put together a report which identified, perhaps for the very first time, some of the gaps in the opportunities for information to be given to the women suffering from breast cancer who have not had their own organisation to cope with the difficulties of gynaecological cancers.
I would also like to say at the outset that the work that Helen Zorbas and the National Breast Cancer Centre have done in taking care of this issue since the year 2000 has been absolutely fundamental to and instrumental in making sure that the work done in Australia has been done to the best effect possible. However, I was disturbed to see this week, Natural Ovarian Cancer Awareness Week, that in fact large numbers of women still do not understand that Pap smears will not identify ovarian cancer. There are many tests available for various forms of cancer but, unfortunately, research teams, both here and overseas, have still not found an early warning test for ovarian cancer and, as a result of that, more than a thousand women are diagnosed every year with it.
I think that more than anything this report is an indication that when there was a serious women’s health issue and all of us realised that all of our women—never mind what they might do every three years at the ballot box—wanted it dealt with and wanted expert advice and wanted to have a voice, we all got together. That is why we called our report Breaking the silence, because we believed that it was time to break the silence on this issue.
I would like to acknowledge the government’s commitment to establishing a national centre for gynaecological cancers under the governance of Cancer Australia. This is of course what the committee strongly recommended. We wanted to provide a national focus for gynaecological issues and, importantly, to increase the education and awareness of medical and allied health professionals. I think I also speak for other members of the committee when I say that we could not have done this work without people of the eminence of Professor Neville Hacker, the Director of the Gynaecological Cancer Centre at the Royal Hospital for Women in Sydney, who gave freely of his time and acted as a mentor to all of us. Getting across this issue was not easy—it is quite technical; some of the medical material is quite difficult—but he was always available and always patient. I know he helped all of us, so I would like to acknowledge him and some of the members of his gynaecological oncology team.
The issue of education in this particular area, of both women and the broader community, was a recurring theme during the inquiry, with many submissions and witnesses telling the committee that a targeted approach was needed to deliver information. I also welcome the announcement that, as we recommended, the government will provide a million dollars in seed funding to support the establishment and initial operation of the centre. That is in addition to the nearly $13.6 million over the six years to 2009 that the government has invested in programs for women’s cancers, over half of which has been used to deliver breast and ovarian cancer programs through the National Breast Cancer Centre, through Helen Zorbas and her talented team.
The NBCC has a vital and highly regarded role that is being played in the absence of anything else that is available for us in the gynaecological cancer area. But increasingly we were consistently told in evidence that when women are looking for information on ovarian cancer or any of the other gynaecological cancers they do not automatically understand that they need to go to the NBCC. Now we will have a dedicated area and for the first time we will actually be able to direct them to a specific site. I know, from all the work that they have been doing, that Helen and her people will work closely with the new gynaecological cancer centre and Cancer Australia to make sure that we deliver the fantastic service that they already deliver on breast cancer.
I would also like to thank Tony Abbott. He can relax now; I will stop pestering him. I must say that, right from the start, Tony was receptive to our position. He was patient in understanding where we were coming from. I think that one of the issues that really swung it for us was the fact that every single gynaecological oncologist in Australia argued together as a body to implement this national centre. Not only were the women together; the gynaecological oncologists were together. I congratulate Tony and his department for the way in which they have been receptive to these recommendations.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,19,2
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2007-02-27,"—I also wish to make some comments on the government response. I welcome the government’s response to our inquiry into gynaecological cancer, and I also note that the government response came in a very timely fashion—within a six-month period. In my short time here, I think that is unprecedented. Also unprecedented is a government response which has been so largely positive to the 34 recommendations the committee put forward. Some of that must be brought home to the amazing efforts of Senator Jeannie Ferris. She said in her contribution that she was going to cease bothering the minister. I think the senator could be misleading the Senate with that particular statement. I hope she is, because I think that her passionate support of the women who are working through this process, their families and the extraordinarily talented and dedicated professionals who work in this area, and her particular method of bothering the minister have been instrumental in making sure that the government response has come forward.
We had no recommendation rejected by the government, amazingly enough. We referred several recommendations back to the states and territories—quite rightly, I think, because so much of the health and education process and the involvement of people in their health journeys must be a cooperative response between the patients, families, medical practitioners and governments at both state and federal levels. In many ways, that was the message of this particular inquiry: people must work together, because the only way that we will achieve what we hope to achieve in this area is for governments to work together and for us to be genuinely woman-focused—because this particular form of cancer is a woman’s cancer.
In many ways the response today is a testament to the extraordinary women who gave of their time and experience and came forward with their evidence to our committee. They also came forward with their expectations, because they told us that they expected their governments to respond. Now we have a level of response at the first round from the government and I say, ‘Come forward, Cancer Australia.’ More than half of the recommendations refer to the actions we must now take with the effective implementation of Cancer Australia. We know that can occur, but we will be watching. Indeed, there must be a focus on hearing people’s voices on their treatment and on ensuring that there are effective research dollars given. We now must work together so that the horror of gynaecological cancer is faced, identified, researched and cured. That outcome can be achieved.
I think that as a parliament we must now ensure that the work that has been put forward is fulfilled. I know that there is goodwill. There were a number of recommendations on combining services and putting forward effective research. It came out consistently that the research dollars available in this area had not reflected the need. We will now have a focus for our efforts: there will be a centre whose major activity will be around issues to do with gynaecological cancer—those issues will no longer be lost or dismissed amidst all the other arguments that come forward when we talk about cancer in our community—and it will work within the auspices of Cancer Australia. We have the expectation that this will succeed. We will work together to ensure it will be done and we will be able to look to the women who came forward and say, ‘We’ve heard you. Your voices have been heard and there will be a move forward.’
I will be talking later tonight about National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Week, which is this week, and Senator Ferris mentioned the importance of awareness and education. I want to place on the record, because I promised them that I would, my support for the women from the Lymphedema Network. I think there is much more work to be done in that area. I believe that the government response, which looks at a limited number of treatments being covered by Medicare, does not go far enough. But we will be able to continue the pressure to ensure that we can go forward. As Senator Ferris quite rightly said, this is a start. We have the process to move forward.
I want to congratulate again the women who made sure that this inquiry occurred, because it was not something that was rushed out in the agenda. It took pressure and also the work of Senator Lyn Allison—
—Hear, hear!
—with her roundtable of women from Victoria. Those women need to be acknowledged. I think the voices of Margaret Heffernan and her supporters need to be acknowledged. Once again, this is not the end. We have had the government response. There were 34 recommendations and not one was rejected. I would like to have that on record over and over again. There is money—$1 million in seed funding. I have to admit that, when the committee was meeting on this issue, we wondered whether in fact we would be able to achieve that, but it has been achieved. We have it in black and white: the government accepts this recommendation of $1 million of seed funding money. Through the processes of this place we will be making sure that the money is spent well, that Cancer Australia maintains the activity that it began quite recently and that the women of Australia will be feeling more confident when they have this issue brought before them.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,19,2
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2007-02-27,"—I am also very pleased having seen this response to our report. I cannot recall seeing a government response which has been so accepting of recommendations. I congratulate the government on its response and, again, say how pleased I am. It was a great honour for me to be a part of this process. A great deal has already been said about the women who were involved both in the parliament and beyond. This response sends an important message to people that signing a petition can make a difference. It has often bothered me, in fact, that so many petitions do not go on to be investigated and looked at in detail, but this one did and I thank the Senate for its indulgence in doing that and the committee itself for accepting that petition and for taking action on it.
This is a huge step forward for women’s health. As I said, it is a great credit to the many women who have been involved in the process. This is a hidden and very life-threatening set of cancers. It is a very important step forward. Of course, the first recommendation—the most important, in my view—was to set up a centre for gynaecological cancers within the auspices of Cancer Australia. That centre will give a national focus to these diseases; it will improve the coordination of existing health, medical and support services, and community projects. What we are really asking is for this very serious condition to have a national focus, to have attention paid to it, in much the same way as breast cancer does. Throughout this inquiry we were constantly made aware of the great success in the testing and treatment of breast cancer and the terrific work that has been done in the past on that. This will hopefully save lives. This will make the lives of many women much better and allow them to cope with their disease more adequately. As I said, the most important thing is that it will save lives. We can be proud of that. Of course, we cannot know how many lives will be saved—we will never know that, but that is what we are here for.
I also pay great respect to Senator Jeannie Ferris, whose role in this inquiry was inspiring for us all. We were touched by what she was going through at the time. Her role in the inquiry process was a brave and difficult one—we all understood that at various times—but, nonetheless, I do not think we could have done it without Senator Ferris. I thank her for those efforts.
The government should be on notice that we will not put this away and forget about it. We will be following up all of the recommendations and will ask the questions. Has it happened? When are we going to see some results from this? So our work is not yet done. Senator Moore, Senator Ferris and others, we need to press on. As has been said, there are some areas where recommendations have perhaps been shifted to the states, and we might need to add some pressure to the states and the federal government to coordinate those efforts. One of those areas concerns women who travel great distances to have cancer treatments and often have very long periods of time when lymphedema very significantly affects their lives. That is a bit of unfinished business, and I make a commitment here and now that we will still be on that case. I thank the government for their response. We really look forward to watching how Cancer Australia handles this and, hopefully, we will have a vibrant and effective centre of excellence for gynaecological cancers as a result.

"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2007-02-27,"—I move:
That the following matter be referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee for inquiry and report by the first sitting day in June 2007:
An examination of the effect on regional and rural Australia of the Government’s February 2007 decision to phase-out Non-Forestry Managed Investment Schemes, including:
the effect on jobs and investment in rural and regional Australia;
the identity of agricultural industries which will be most affected;
the regional and rural communities which will be most affected;
the effect on exports; and
the merits of maintaining Non-Forestry Managed Investment Schemes and alternatives to the Government’s decision.
This motion proposes that the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee conduct an inquiry into the effect on rural and regional Australia of the government’s recent decision to abolish non-forestry managed investment schemes. The government may try to dress that decision up as a decision of another body, but I will demonstrate that it was in fact the government’s decision to allow that to occur.
The effect of the government’s decision is that non-forestry managed investment schemes will no longer have access to product rulings from the Australian Taxation Office after 30 June this year. This will remove their capacity to raise capital to make investments in rural and regional communities. The motion proposes a Senate inquiry which will examine all the aspects of the decision, including the effect on jobs and investment in rural Australia, the impact on rural exports and the effect on rural and regional communities. The motion also proposes that the inquiry examine the merits of non-forestry managed investment schemes and any alternatives to the government’s decision.
Before I discuss the detail of the motion, I want to explore the government’s handling of this affair in more detail and expose the true intentions of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr McGauran, who has been the government’s and the National Party’s champion for the destruction of this scheme. I want to spend some time exposing the government’s ducking and weaving on this issue—everything from blaming investors for the political fallout to its pathetic attempt to pass the buck to the ATO.
First, let us look at the government’s sneaky attempt to bury the story earlier this month. The Assistant Treasurer, Mr Dutton, issued a press release announcing the government’s decision at eight minutes to seven on the evening of Tuesday, 6 February 2007. If the government was comfortable with this decision on this matter, why would it attempt to hide it by sneakily issuing the announcement at eight minutes to seven on a Tuesday night? Maybe the government was hoping that no-one would notice and that it could sneak this one through without any fuss. Maybe the government just did not fully appreciate the impact of its decision.
Since announcing the decision earlier in February, rural communities and the investment community have expressed widespread concern over both the substance and the process of the government’s handling of this issue. The government, frankly, even ambushed its own backbench. It is well known that the coalition is in disarray over this matter. Government backbenchers are aware of the concerns raised by their own constituents about how deeply this decision will impact on jobs and investment in their own communities. After several weeks of passing the buck onto the ATO, this week the cat was let out of the bag. Yesterday in question time, Senator Abetz admitted that the government had:
... determined that it was—and I think the language I am about to use is correct—‘not disposed to intervene’.
So the question is: why then did the government have no problem intervening on exactly the same issue when it came to forestry managed investment schemes? In forestry managed investment schemes the government handled the matter quite differently. For example, in that case the government held in-depth consultations with industry. The government developed a plan that increased accountability on how money would be invested. That plan provides long-term certainty to the forestry industry.
Compare that decision with the government’s handling of the non-forestry managed investment schemes. First, the government made the decision without warning. It gave the industry less than five months before it would effectively be out of business. Secondly, it took no consultation with industry, and in fact discouraged those who sought consultation, saying ‘it was not time’. It undertook no consultation with affected communities. Thirdly, in Senate estimates two weeks ago it was revealed that the minister’s own department, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, has undertaken no research on the issue and has provided no advice to the minister.
In response to questions I asked on the research undertaken by his department on agricultural MISs, the department’s corporate policy chief, Mr Allen Grant, said:
I am not aware that we have done any specific research on that.
…     …         …
Partly because ... up until recent times that has not been seen to be a high priority issue.
So not even the department knew this decision was coming. I am sure the department, if they appreciated the foolishness of the government’s decision-making process, would have forewarned the minister of the impact. They did not because they were given no notice that this was likely to happen.
So it is abundantly clear that the minister sought no advice on the impact of his government’s decision on jobs or investments in rural and regional communities, the very communities that this government and this minister claim to have concerns about. He did nothing. He did not consult them. He did nothing to alert them to a matter which would have a drastic effect on their communities. He slipped the decision through late on a business day, to avoid news coverage that day, no doubt. But, frankly, it has caused great consternation.
What do we also know? The minister does not know how many jobs will be affected. He has no idea. He does not know how many businesses will be shut down. The minister does not know the impact of his decision on Australia’s rural exports. The truth is that the minister for agriculture and this government have no idea what will occur as a result of this decision. It has been motivated not by a concern for the prosperity of rural Australian towns and communities but by a desperate need to respond to pressure from within the minister’s own party.
Minister McGauran has been campaigning on behalf of the National Party to close down non-forestry managed investment schemes. He has had, I must say, the single purpose of shutting down these investments in rural and regional Australia without any knowledge as to the impact his actions would have. At best, I would have to say, the minister’s actions have been grossly irresponsible and self-interested and the government’s handling of this affair has been arbitrary and condescending. It is little wonder that the coalition is in utter disarray over the minister’s handling of this matter, and the government’s handling of it, for that matter.
I want to have a closer look now at the managed investment schemes and outline some of these specific examples of businesses and communities that will be impacted by the government’s decision. Managed investment schemes require several years—in some cases fewer—to be prepared and established. This lead time involves the employment of many subcontractors who prepare the necessary plant and equipment in anticipation of the managed investment scheme coming into effect. As well, there are all the legal preparations for the investment, in the prospectus and the like.
Labor is aware that there were dozens of managed investment schemes due to start in the upcoming years. These schemes would have employed hundreds of contractors and employees in various projects right around regional Australia. Labor would like to know—and I am sure that these people and their communities would like to know—where the government’s decision leaves the projects. What is the impact of the government’s decision on the companies involved in these planned managed investment schemes and on their employees and contractors? Frankly, the government has ignored these companies and individuals.
But worse than that, the uncertainty created by the government has already caused job losses even before 1 July 2007. Take the case of the olive producer Boundary Bend in Victoria. It has already laid off 30 permanent staff from its operation in the community of Lara.
—It was the lack of water!
—Frankly, the suggestion that Senator Heffernan makes that it was the lack of water does not accord with what is stated by the company. Boundary Bend has already laid off 30 permanent staff on the basis that it cannot guarantee the continuation of projects which involve the preparation of olive trees and land for planting. This is a direct result of the government’s decision, and you would think that the government members would get their lines right. Minister McGauran is suggesting that it is some scheme by the investors to cause pain in rural communities where they are withdrawing their funds. Senator Heffernan says that it is a lack of water. Perhaps when the government can get its lines right it might have a little bit more credibility on this matter.
Labor is aware of numerous project proposals due to be started in the coming financial year that are now under threat of being halted. These include: organic olives in Brookton, Western Australia; truffles in Manjimup, Western Australia; almonds in Robinvale, Victoria; abalone in Elliston, South Australia; mangoes in Mataranka, Northern Territory; as well as walnut, olive, avocado, wine grape and almond projects in the states of Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland and Tasmania. How many real jobs would have been created by these projects? How many of these real jobs have now been axed as a result of the government’s decision? Do not ask the minister because we know that he does not know. He has not sought advice. He just does not want to know.
In the Weekly Times last week the minister even had the gall to blame investors for the uncertainty and job losses arising from his government’s own inept decision. In truth, the blame for all this uncertainty and the job losses rests with Minister McGauran, his National Party colleagues and the Howard government. Agricultural industries and communities across Australia have been left in a state of limbo as they await the next move by the government. This whole process has been a shambles from start to finish, and the government backbench knows it too.
In moving this motion to propose that the Senate committee undertake an inquiry into managed investment schemes, I am offering the minister and the government a chance to give rural and regional Australians a say—to give them a voice. They have not had one to date in this matter. Labor’s proposed inquiry is the right thing to do by rural and regional Australia and the thousands of people who stand to be impacted by the government’s decision. Frankly, it is a ‘get out of jail’ option for the government. A Senate inquiry would allow the government to have a full investigation of the benefits of non-forestry managed investment schemes in rural Australia and the potential impacts which may arise if the government decides to proceed with its decision. It would allow affected industries and communities to put their views to the parliament. A Senate inquiry would allow the parliament to hear from the shopkeepers, the contractors, the business owners, the rural industry and the mums and dads who may be affected by this decision. It would allow investors to share their views with the parliament. It would allow the parliament to deal with the claim that these schemes are just tax rorts and a drain on the budget. It would allow the parliament to assess the alternative claim that, whilst there is an up-front tax deduction, there is also a substantial gain to the budget out of these initiatives, a substantial saving to the budget as a result of jobs being created and a reduction of unemployment and social welfare payments. There would also be an increase in tax collections from the employees and contractors involved. All of these matters would offset the initial tax cost to the budget of the schemes.
Most importantly, Labor’s Senate inquiry would restore the principles of good governance and allow the government to properly assess the impacts arising from the decision on MISs on the Australian economy and rural communities. But, frankly, there is only one reason the government will not support Labor’s proposed Senate inquiry, and that is that the government, the minister and those who proposed this action do not want the truth revealed—that they are afraid an inquiry will show that the proposition they have been carrying forward in their party room and the community is baloney. That is the only reason that senators in this place will not be prepared to stand behind and defend their proposition and allow it to go to a Senate inquiry. It is quite cowardly, in my submission. It means that they have no courage of conviction in the proposition that they put forward.
I am calling on the government not to allow the prejudices of the minister and his government colleagues to stand in the way of well-informed, fair decision making. I call on the government to restore the principles of good governance and support Labor’s motion for a Senate inquiry into these managed investment schemes. If this inquiry does not go ahead, something might happen or it might not. If nothing changes in relation to the non-forestry managed investment schemes and they are closed down, not only will there be an impact in the communities affected but moneys that might have gone into those schemes will go into the forestry managed investment schemes. The savings to the budget will not be realised—indeed, they cannot be realised because the decision, in all likelihood, will be the subject of legal challenge. So ultimate savings to the budget are hypothetical.
We will see an immediate impact on schemes. We will see jobs disappearing in rural and regional Australia. Senator Heffernan clearly does not care about that. We will see a lot of businesses broken. We will see bankruptcy on a significant scale. We will see missed opportunity. I was speaking to someone from an abalone operation who was talking about a very significant opportunity with significant returns which can only get up with managed investment schemes but which ultimately will pay back manyfold, in returns over a period of time, the amount of money that it would cost the government. This is quite an exciting proposition, one that does not use water, does not buy land, uses Australian technology and will add to Australian exports of seafood products—seafood products that, frankly, we need to produce and we are not producing sustainably at the moment. That is just one example of the many examples of disaster that this decision is causing. I urge government senators to reconsider the government’s position, not to support the minister’s proposition on this matter and to vote for Labor’s inquiry.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee</title>,Committees,22,1
"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2007-02-27,"—This is the greatest display of hypocrisy that I have ever seen, I think. The guys over there do not have the guts to have a position on whether Australia ought to enter into the complete alteration of Australia’s farming culture to one of lurk farming. I will come to what they propose in a minute. Their Mr Bowen has been going around saying what they propose. They do not need an inquiry to work that out. The proposition is that in the same capital market you can have people farming with what I call tax minimisation farming methods—lurk farmers. On Landline on Sunday a developer owned up and said: ‘Yeah, we can make a profit without any production. We can make a profit from our management fees, with no regard at all to the market and supply and demand.’ Why the hell would you want people putting in more grapes now, when the grape market is glutted? Tell me that.
So you have people competing in the same capital market that can make a profit without any production. I will give almonds as an example. The almond guys are charging $40,000 a hectare for something that costs $10. So they are competing in the same capital market as farmers who have to make a profit from production with full regard to the market and supply and demand. It totally corrupts both the water market and the land market.
Senator O’Brien, you want to have an inquiry into all this because you do not have the guts to have a position. Your leader does not have a position and you do not have a position, because you want to go to the election saying: ‘We’ll have an inquiry. We’ll look into it.’ You will not take a position because either way you might have a political downside. Guess what: Mr Bowen, your shadow Assistant Treasurer, has been going around to the promoters of MISs—and I hope everyone is listening to this—saying, ‘If we get into government, we’ll reverse this and open the market again to the lurk farmers unfettered.’ That is what he is saying. You probably do not even know that, but that is what he is saying.
—Is that right?
—That is exactly right.
—You’re not verballing him, are you?
—No, I certainly am not. Obviously the promoters have been telling me, because they have been trying to pressure me. If you want a capital market that is dependent for its viability on the generosity of Australia’s taxpayers—and the graph on the take-up of these things is vertical—it is a $1.3 billion drain on the budget.

Senator O’Brien interjecting—

—If it is all about 20/20 vision and forestry, then why are all the foresters getting into everything else? They are getting into everything else because it is a great lurk. This is lurk farming. Great Southern Plantations are still about 70 per cent forest and 30 per cent out in the other lurk world. They will go back to forestry, as you said. Timbercorp are about 70-30 the other way. But, if you want to compete, it is buyer beware. If you want to go into tax minimisation, driven by profit from a tax loss, and farm on that, then it is buyer beware.
The test—and there is no need to have a Senate inquiry about this—is whether these people are passive investors or not. That is something that the Commissioner of Taxation will have to sort out. We do not need a Senate inquiry; we need a test case. The idea that somehow the Labor Party can weasel its way through by not having a position on this, by having an inquiry, when the shadow minister is running around saying, ‘She’ll be right, brother; just vote for us and in the meantime publicly we’ll say we’ll have an inquiry,’ is garbage. It is gutless and garbage.
You cannot have a proposition that the rest of the world—the United States, Europe and England—has rejected; that is, the viability of a farming industry based on a tax subsidy. It is complete hogwash. There is absolutely no need for a Senate inquiry. There will be a tax office ruling and a test case. You ought to have the guts to say how you are going to pay for pensions and health care if you are going to have a drain on finance of these proportions. This will build to become bigger as a tax lurk than the bottom of the harbour scheme. This is a deadset tax lurk.
The government recognises that some transitional arrangements will need to be sorted out in the aftermath, but the proposition that you can build an agricultural industry that relies for its viability on a tax lurk is garbage. What about the subsidy rate that will eventually come out of this, if it is allowed to build? While we are arguing in the World Trade Organisation about the devil of the European Union and the US farm subsidy program, per head of population and per dollar of production this will make their schemes look like paltry schemes.
It is an absolute fraud to propose an inquiry into this matter. You blokes are going around saying, ‘Vote for us and we’ll put you back where you were.’ All of these lurk agents are being told: ‘We’ll put you back in business. In the meantime we’ll cover ourselves politically.’ You might ask your leader, Mr Rudd, what his position is. Maybe the media could ask, ‘Are you for or against?’ But you don’t have a position and instead you say, ‘We’ll have an inquiry.’ You are trying to have two bob each way, and your Mr Bowen has put his cards on the table. It is an absolute fraud of a proposition to want to hold an inquiry into the matter.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee</title>,Committees,22,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-02-27,"—I support the rationalising and reduction of managed investment scheme tax concessions, and I do not oppose their being phased out altogether. With that position, you would have to ask: why would I support this reference to a committee? I want to explain those reasons.
As a member of the Senate economics committee, I had the unfortunate experience of spending several years examining the issue of all those people who had been affected and hurt by the tax-effective managed investment schemes that had to be closed down because they were essentially tax lurks, to use the language of Senator Heffernan; they were being promoted by dodgy promoters, spiv lawyers and spiv accountants and they were making victims of innocent and unsophisticated Australians.
I have never forgotten going to Kalgoorlie to hear from these people and holding the hands of weeping men and women—working men and women; ordinary folk who had, by the sweat of their brow, made a few bob—who had lost their savings in these schemes which had been perverted for purely tax benefit reasons and were not productive enterprises in the sense of commercial enterprises. Of course, that was not true of every managed investment scheme but it was true of the abuse of those schemes.
If we fast-forward to now, my own belief has long been that the tax office and the government need to be far stricter and stronger about the rules as to when a tax concession should be allowed, and should be based on the commercial operation that is in play. I am concerned that what has happened in the latest exercise is that the tax office has acted properly and the government has acted improperly, because I see a false distinction between the forestry managed investment schemes and the non-forestry managed investment schemes. There is not a distinction between trees. I fail to see, from a greenhouse and environmental point of view, why a gum tree is any different from a walnut tree, but I am not a biologist; maybe some scientist can explain it to me. I am a tax man and I cannot explain it. It sounds very odd.
The reason I welcome the proposal for an inquiry is that it could sort out these issues. It could try to develop a policy which would show some consistency and which would attack this issue on the basis of policy principles rather than political principles. I think, as a person who deals with tax and finance all the time, that we have to continue to strive to make sure that policy principles are rational and transparent. For instance, if the community, the parliament and the government decide that trees are good—and I use ‘good’ in the sense of an economic good—environmentally and economically then all trees, not just some trees, should be supported with tax concessions.
To my mind—and I might have designed these terms of reference a little differently but I still think these issues would flow—the principles surrounding such tax concessions need to be explored and examined. I think, in terms of my own tax philosophy, that tax concessions are indeed appropriate for infant industries but should be time limited and phased out on a set timetable, unless an industry is of national strategic significance or of national economic or national environmental significance. For instance, if we want to ensure a better water supply in this country, we might decide to subsidise water pipelines by way of a tax concession. That is perfectly reasonable; it is an environmental argument, not an economic argument.
But any industry that is not viable, profitable or sustainable without tax concessions should not be given tax concessions in the first place. It is as simple as that. You have to have a good, sound, consistent policy reason for giving tax concessions. I think the proposed committee would need to examine the history, nature, extent and cost of managed investment schemes; the arguments for and against them; the economic, social and environmental consequences of managed investment scheme tax concessions; the dangers for the current government; ATO decisions; the fact that there is no transition period; and proposed remedies and policies.
The matter of a transition period is quite important. If you go back full circle to my opening remarks, when I described to the chamber what was going on with the tax-effective managed investment schemes that the Senate Standing Committee on Economics examined, you will recall that I said they were pushed by dodgy promoters and so on. The point behind that is that many investors would have entered those schemes in good faith, trusting the tax advice and the legal advice that they got. The fact that they might have been conned or gulled or taken advantage of to get them into these schemes needs to be recognised, and that is why you need a transition period—to ensure that such persons can get out with some of their financial skin intact.
In conclusion, I will say again that I support the rationalisation and reduction of these tax concessions and do not oppose them being phased out altogether. That is my policy position. But I support the Labor Party’s initiative in wishing to have this matter properly and forensically examined so that a better policy picture can emerge. It is for that reason that I would suggest that the chamber support Senator O’Brien’s motion.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee</title>,Committees,22,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-02-27,"—The Greens also support a reference of this type to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport but not for the reasons that Senator O’Brien outlined. We have concerns similar to Senator Murray’s in that we fail to see why the government has taken action on non-forestry activities but not forestry activities. We would like to examine that for a start. We would also like to look at the impact that managed investment schemes have had on the agricultural economy and on decision making in agricultural areas, and how MISs at present are in fact affecting and distorting prices for water and land—and I will come back to the issue of water in a minute.
We have concerns about the impact MISs have had on family farms and the way agriculture is practised in Australia. It has become apparent that the people who develop these schemes and those who invest in them do so for the up-front tax deductions. These people do not seem to be interested in the longer term profitability of some of these schemes, which is why we have concerns about the schemes’ impact on agriculture. If you are investing in these schemes for their up-front tax deductibility, you may not be that interested in the sustainability of the scheme or of the particular agricultural enterprise. And I am deeply concerned that some of the crops being invested in are in fact unsustainable in particular areas. Growing olives, for example, where irrigation is needed, using large amounts of water, may be unsustainable in the longer term in certain areas.
Then you add in the fact that these large investment schemes are buying up water entitlements, water licences—many schemes, in fact. It was reported just yesterday that Macquarie Bank has acquired a great many of these licences with a view to planting higher security crops, thereby not only transferring water out of a good many of the districts but also transferring water entitlements to higher value crops. Now, that raises two questions for me. First, do they expect to be bought out through the $3 billion national water plan? Second, does that mean that they will try to secure that entitlement because it has now gone to higher security water applications? And they will secure that, whereas people running smaller family farms will not.
There is also the issue of the impact that these schemes are having on the price of water licences and the fact that they can aggressively enter the market. I am told, for example, that some large investors are actually going straight to brokerages before licences can even make it onto the market, thereby again, I believe, potentially distorting the water market. So, while we are looking at a process to reform and get better management of our water market, as we have already seen large investors could be buying up these allocations and distorting the market.
What I would like to know is how those water licences are going to be handled now that the changes have been made to the non-forestry managed investment schemes. How are we going to deal with those water licences? I believe that area needs reviewing. What are the implications now for rural communities, for better investments? How should we really be investing for the long term in agriculture in Australia? I do not for one minute believe that those organisations and people responsible for MISs are concerned about the long-term security and sustainability of the agricultural industry in Australia. I think they are largely focused on achieving tax deductibility for up-front initial investments. I believe an inquiry would enable us to determine how best to focus on the long-term sustainability of our agricultural industry. There is no doubt investment is required, but I do not believe that MISs, as they were, were the appropriate tool.
I would also like any inquiry to look at how many people were employed through these MISs in our regional centres and just what impact phasing the schemes out of regional communities would have. You have to balance that against the number of family farms that have been bought out, both for plantations and alternative crops in areas where—I will say it once again—we have deep concerns about their sustainability.
I was looking at a media release from the Australian Dairy Farmers. They actually supported the government’s change in the MIS process because they were concerned about the impact it is having on issues such as water—and land prices, in particular, where smaller landowners cannot afford to compete with the MIS and the impact that has. I think we should also be investigating what impact it is having on the commodities market. I definitely agree with my colleagues on looking at the transition process for moving from this investment scheme to supporting sustainable agriculture and rural communities. I think that is tremendously important. Therefore, the Greens would support this sort of inquiry but, as I said, not necessarily on the terms Senator O’Brien has articulated.
I think how we manage investment into an agricultural system undergoing change through dramatically reduced water security and climate change is the sort of issue that very strongly needs further investigation. And it needs to be looked at holistically. That is another reason for an inquiry of this sort. We should not necessarily be looking at how we go back to the present system. From everything I have seen, I do not believe this is for the good of the long-term sustainability of agriculture in Australia—and certainly not for family farms and a good deal of regional communities.
I think some of the managed investment schemes have favoured some regional communities and not others. I suspect that the negative impacts have far outweighed any positive impacts, and I would dearly like to see the figures for employment under the current schemes versus how many people have been lost to regional communities. I could reel off a number of communities in my home state of Western Australia which have suffered from tremendously reduced numbers in the community due to the impact of areas being bought up, taken out of traditional farm practices and moved into plantations, in particular, but also various other schemes under the MIS system.
So we would support this referral but we would seek to investigate a far broader set of issues, including the impacts the managed investment schemes have had by distorting our agricultural systems, land practices and land and water prices in Australia. We also need to look at how this is damaging our water market, particularly because big players have now bought up large numbers of water entitlements in the water market. I believe they are distorting those markets and will continue to. I would dearly love to know whether they will now expect government to buy out those allocations. They have driven up the price of water, so it will cost us even more to fix the overallocation, particularly in the Murray-Darling system. It is going to be vastly more expensive due to the impacts of the MIS process. I would like to know what these companies now intend to do with the entitlements that they have bought up if they are not intending to sell them. Where do they intend to invest? I believe all of these issues need very thorough investigation.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee</title>,Committees,22,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2007-02-27,"—I am happy to respond, if the government’s only defence is that put by Senator Heffernan. Frankly, we are seeing a disgraceful attitude to the scrutiny process of this parliament. Let us be absolutely clear on this. This is a decision the government took effectively in the dead of night without consultation. This is a decision which will have a substantial effect on the rural communities this government claims to champion. This is a decision which has been the subject of criticism by governments and coalition or Liberal Party oppositions in other states and territories around this country. This is a decision which will put people out of work and businesses out of business, subject to any transitional arrangements which are as yet unannounced.
This is a decision which will take millions of dollars out of country towns. It has been suggested to me that the olive industry puts $10 million a year into the town of Boort in Victoria. Although they were not non-forestry MISs, we saw on the Landline program that the forestry MISs caused a substantial change to the prosperity of the town of Bombala in southern New South Wales, not too far from here. These schemes have their benefits and indeed they may have their costs.
So what is the problem with having an inquiry to look at that? It cannot order the government to do anything. It cannot make the government change its position. But what it can do is get us the facts. When you boil down the government’s opposition, it comes down to this: the government does not want the facts known. The government does not want people to know the impact of its decision. It will come out. There will be people who will tell us over time what the effect will be. They just will not get the benefit senators get of saying what they think under parliamentary privilege.
It will come out. Eventually the numbers that lie behind the government’s decision will come out. Frankly, it would have been good to have them on the record by now, rather than the unauditable commentary from Senator Heffernan about the cost. Those sorts of matters will remain a bit of a mystery. No doubt we will tease them out over time. If Labor wins the next election then all will become clear. But, frankly, it is a bit hypocritical of the government to talk about what these schemes cost the budget. Senator Heffernan described them as rorts—tax rorts, he said. But why is this different to some of the government’s funding programs that have been otherwise described as rorts? The difference is that the government claims political patronage when it makes grants to regional communities. We do not oppose them all, but some of them have been absolute rubbish, utter rorts, an abuse of process and a waste of money.
The government has been guilty of rorting the public purse for electoral advantage, by its own direct decision. It is not frightened to do that. No doubt it is going to do it again this year. It has a lot of programs stored up. We are waiting to see the flood of announcements, the cheques being signed and the allocations. And that is all right, according to the government.
But what about initiatives that can create businesses in communities, can create real jobs in communities and can get the wealth flowing through the community? This is not just me talking; there are members of the coalition parties in state parliaments around this country pointing to this decision and saying it is an outrage. This includes Senator Parry’s state colleagues. You would not see a more dismissive release than that from his colleague the agriculture spokesman in the Tasmanian parliament, a member of the Liberal Party, castigating the federal government for the decision. So it is not just the Labor Party saying that this is an outrageous decision. If you read the papers, you know it is also members of the government’s own backbench, whether it is the outspoken member for O’Connor or others.
There are a number of people on the government’s backbench who are openly critical and some who are privately critical. It will be interesting to see how many of those have the courage of their conviction to take that short walk across and vote for the inquiry and pursue a better outcome, pursue their belief. But we will see what happens; we will see whether the government is able to get all of its members voting for it. We will see whether the courage of their conviction comes out in the vote.
Labor does not require any member to support any particular proposition. I am not surprised the Greens would prefer that this was an inquiry into all managed investment schemes, because they would want to attack the forestry managed investment schemes, which have been allowed to continue. We did not oppose that decision. What we do oppose is the hypocrisy of the approach that this government has taken to this. We would like the facts on the table. We are presenting the Senate with an opportunity to try and get those facts on the table and give people a say. The government may well scuttle across to this side of the chamber and vote no and prevent the inquiry and to silence the communities they claim to represent, but in the end they should not expect that those communities will forgive them for it.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator O’Brien’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee</title>,Committees,22,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2007-02-27,"—I move:
That the following matter be referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee for inquiry and report by the first sitting day in June 2007:
An examination of the effect on regional and rural Australia of the Government’s February 2007 decision to phase-out Non-Forestry Managed Investment Schemes, including:
the effect on jobs and investment in rural and regional Australia;
the identity of agricultural industries which will be most affected;
the regional and rural communities which will be most affected;
the effect on exports; and
the merits of maintaining Non-Forestry Managed Investment Schemes and alternatives to the Government’s decision.
This motion proposes that the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee conduct an inquiry into the effect on rural and regional Australia of the government’s recent decision to abolish non-forestry managed investment schemes. The government may try to dress that decision up as a decision of another body, but I will demonstrate that it was in fact the government’s decision to allow that to occur.
The effect of the government’s decision is that non-forestry managed investment schemes will no longer have access to product rulings from the Australian Taxation Office after 30 June this year. This will remove their capacity to raise capital to make investments in rural and regional communities. The motion proposes a Senate inquiry which will examine all the aspects of the decision, including the effect on jobs and investment in rural Australia, the impact on rural exports and the effect on rural and regional communities. The motion also proposes that the inquiry examine the merits of non-forestry managed investment schemes and any alternatives to the government’s decision.
Before I discuss the detail of the motion, I want to explore the government’s handling of this affair in more detail and expose the true intentions of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr McGauran, who has been the government’s and the National Party’s champion for the destruction of this scheme. I want to spend some time exposing the government’s ducking and weaving on this issue—everything from blaming investors for the political fallout to its pathetic attempt to pass the buck to the ATO.
First, let us look at the government’s sneaky attempt to bury the story earlier this month. The Assistant Treasurer, Mr Dutton, issued a press release announcing the government’s decision at eight minutes to seven on the evening of Tuesday, 6 February 2007. If the government was comfortable with this decision on this matter, why would it attempt to hide it by sneakily issuing the announcement at eight minutes to seven on a Tuesday night? Maybe the government was hoping that no-one would notice and that it could sneak this one through without any fuss. Maybe the government just did not fully appreciate the impact of its decision.
Since announcing the decision earlier in February, rural communities and the investment community have expressed widespread concern over both the substance and the process of the government’s handling of this issue. The government, frankly, even ambushed its own backbench. It is well known that the coalition is in disarray over this matter. Government backbenchers are aware of the concerns raised by their own constituents about how deeply this decision will impact on jobs and investment in their own communities. After several weeks of passing the buck onto the ATO, this week the cat was let out of the bag. Yesterday in question time, Senator Abetz admitted that the government had:
... determined that it was—and I think the language I am about to use is correct—‘not disposed to intervene’.
So the question is: why then did the government have no problem intervening on exactly the same issue when it came to forestry managed investment schemes? In forestry managed investment schemes the government handled the matter quite differently. For example, in that case the government held in-depth consultations with industry. The government developed a plan that increased accountability on how money would be invested. That plan provides long-term certainty to the forestry industry.
Compare that decision with the government’s handling of the non-forestry managed investment schemes. First, the government made the decision without warning. It gave the industry less than five months before it would effectively be out of business. Secondly, it took no consultation with industry, and in fact discouraged those who sought consultation, saying ‘it was not time’. It undertook no consultation with affected communities. Thirdly, in Senate estimates two weeks ago it was revealed that the minister’s own department, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, has undertaken no research on the issue and has provided no advice to the minister.
In response to questions I asked on the research undertaken by his department on agricultural MISs, the department’s corporate policy chief, Mr Allen Grant, said:
I am not aware that we have done any specific research on that.
…     …         …
Partly because ... up until recent times that has not been seen to be a high priority issue.
So not even the department knew this decision was coming. I am sure the department, if they appreciated the foolishness of the government’s decision-making process, would have forewarned the minister of the impact. They did not because they were given no notice that this was likely to happen.
So it is abundantly clear that the minister sought no advice on the impact of his government’s decision on jobs or investments in rural and regional communities, the very communities that this government and this minister claim to have concerns about. He did nothing. He did not consult them. He did nothing to alert them to a matter which would have a drastic effect on their communities. He slipped the decision through late on a business day, to avoid news coverage that day, no doubt. But, frankly, it has caused great consternation.
What do we also know? The minister does not know how many jobs will be affected. He has no idea. He does not know how many businesses will be shut down. The minister does not know the impact of his decision on Australia’s rural exports. The truth is that the minister for agriculture and this government have no idea what will occur as a result of this decision. It has been motivated not by a concern for the prosperity of rural Australian towns and communities but by a desperate need to respond to pressure from within the minister’s own party.
Minister McGauran has been campaigning on behalf of the National Party to close down non-forestry managed investment schemes. He has had, I must say, the single purpose of shutting down these investments in rural and regional Australia without any knowledge as to the impact his actions would have. At best, I would have to say, the minister’s actions have been grossly irresponsible and self-interested and the government’s handling of this affair has been arbitrary and condescending. It is little wonder that the coalition is in utter disarray over the minister’s handling of this matter, and the government’s handling of it, for that matter.
I want to have a closer look now at the managed investment schemes and outline some of these specific examples of businesses and communities that will be impacted by the government’s decision. Managed investment schemes require several years—in some cases fewer—to be prepared and established. This lead time involves the employment of many subcontractors who prepare the necessary plant and equipment in anticipation of the managed investment scheme coming into effect. As well, there are all the legal preparations for the investment, in the prospectus and the like.
Labor is aware that there were dozens of managed investment schemes due to start in the upcoming years. These schemes would have employed hundreds of contractors and employees in various projects right around regional Australia. Labor would like to know—and I am sure that these people and their communities would like to know—where the government’s decision leaves the projects. What is the impact of the government’s decision on the companies involved in these planned managed investment schemes and on their employees and contractors? Frankly, the government has ignored these companies and individuals.
But worse than that, the uncertainty created by the government has already caused job losses even before 1 July 2007. Take the case of the olive producer Boundary Bend in Victoria. It has already laid off 30 permanent staff from its operation in the community of Lara.
—It was the lack of water!
—Frankly, the suggestion that Senator Heffernan makes that it was the lack of water does not accord with what is stated by the company. Boundary Bend has already laid off 30 permanent staff on the basis that it cannot guarantee the continuation of projects which involve the preparation of olive trees and land for planting. This is a direct result of the government’s decision, and you would think that the government members would get their lines right. Minister McGauran is suggesting that it is some scheme by the investors to cause pain in rural communities where they are withdrawing their funds. Senator Heffernan says that it is a lack of water. Perhaps when the government can get its lines right it might have a little bit more credibility on this matter.
Labor is aware of numerous project proposals due to be started in the coming financial year that are now under threat of being halted. These include: organic olives in Brookton, Western Australia; truffles in Manjimup, Western Australia; almonds in Robinvale, Victoria; abalone in Elliston, South Australia; mangoes in Mataranka, Northern Territory; as well as walnut, olive, avocado, wine grape and almond projects in the states of Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland and Tasmania. How many real jobs would have been created by these projects? How many of these real jobs have now been axed as a result of the government’s decision? Do not ask the minister because we know that he does not know. He has not sought advice. He just does not want to know.
In the Weekly Times last week the minister even had the gall to blame investors for the uncertainty and job losses arising from his government’s own inept decision. In truth, the blame for all this uncertainty and the job losses rests with Minister McGauran, his National Party colleagues and the Howard government. Agricultural industries and communities across Australia have been left in a state of limbo as they await the next move by the government. This whole process has been a shambles from start to finish, and the government backbench knows it too.
In moving this motion to propose that the Senate committee undertake an inquiry into managed investment schemes, I am offering the minister and the government a chance to give rural and regional Australians a say—to give them a voice. They have not had one to date in this matter. Labor’s proposed inquiry is the right thing to do by rural and regional Australia and the thousands of people who stand to be impacted by the government’s decision. Frankly, it is a ‘get out of jail’ option for the government. A Senate inquiry would allow the government to have a full investigation of the benefits of non-forestry managed investment schemes in rural Australia and the potential impacts which may arise if the government decides to proceed with its decision. It would allow affected industries and communities to put their views to the parliament. A Senate inquiry would allow the parliament to hear from the shopkeepers, the contractors, the business owners, the rural industry and the mums and dads who may be affected by this decision. It would allow investors to share their views with the parliament. It would allow the parliament to deal with the claim that these schemes are just tax rorts and a drain on the budget. It would allow the parliament to assess the alternative claim that, whilst there is an up-front tax deduction, there is also a substantial gain to the budget out of these initiatives, a substantial saving to the budget as a result of jobs being created and a reduction of unemployment and social welfare payments. There would also be an increase in tax collections from the employees and contractors involved. All of these matters would offset the initial tax cost to the budget of the schemes.
Most importantly, Labor’s Senate inquiry would restore the principles of good governance and allow the government to properly assess the impacts arising from the decision on MISs on the Australian economy and rural communities. But, frankly, there is only one reason the government will not support Labor’s proposed Senate inquiry, and that is that the government, the minister and those who proposed this action do not want the truth revealed—that they are afraid an inquiry will show that the proposition they have been carrying forward in their party room and the community is baloney. That is the only reason that senators in this place will not be prepared to stand behind and defend their proposition and allow it to go to a Senate inquiry. It is quite cowardly, in my submission. It means that they have no courage of conviction in the proposition that they put forward.
I am calling on the government not to allow the prejudices of the minister and his government colleagues to stand in the way of well-informed, fair decision making. I call on the government to restore the principles of good governance and support Labor’s motion for a Senate inquiry into these managed investment schemes. If this inquiry does not go ahead, something might happen or it might not. If nothing changes in relation to the non-forestry managed investment schemes and they are closed down, not only will there be an impact in the communities affected but moneys that might have gone into those schemes will go into the forestry managed investment schemes. The savings to the budget will not be realised—indeed, they cannot be realised because the decision, in all likelihood, will be the subject of legal challenge. So ultimate savings to the budget are hypothetical.
We will see an immediate impact on schemes. We will see jobs disappearing in rural and regional Australia. Senator Heffernan clearly does not care about that. We will see a lot of businesses broken. We will see bankruptcy on a significant scale. We will see missed opportunity. I was speaking to someone from an abalone operation who was talking about a very significant opportunity with significant returns which can only get up with managed investment schemes but which ultimately will pay back manyfold, in returns over a period of time, the amount of money that it would cost the government. This is quite an exciting proposition, one that does not use water, does not buy land, uses Australian technology and will add to Australian exports of seafood products—seafood products that, frankly, we need to produce and we are not producing sustainably at the moment. That is just one example of the many examples of disaster that this decision is causing. I urge government senators to reconsider the government’s position, not to support the minister’s proposition on this matter and to vote for Labor’s inquiry.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,22,2
"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2007-02-27,"—This is the greatest display of hypocrisy that I have ever seen, I think. The guys over there do not have the guts to have a position on whether Australia ought to enter into the complete alteration of Australia’s farming culture to one of lurk farming. I will come to what they propose in a minute. Their Mr Bowen has been going around saying what they propose. They do not need an inquiry to work that out. The proposition is that in the same capital market you can have people farming with what I call tax minimisation farming methods—lurk farmers. On Landline on Sunday a developer owned up and said: ‘Yeah, we can make a profit without any production. We can make a profit from our management fees, with no regard at all to the market and supply and demand.’ Why the hell would you want people putting in more grapes now, when the grape market is glutted? Tell me that.
So you have people competing in the same capital market that can make a profit without any production. I will give almonds as an example. The almond guys are charging $40,000 a hectare for something that costs $10. So they are competing in the same capital market as farmers who have to make a profit from production with full regard to the market and supply and demand. It totally corrupts both the water market and the land market.
Senator O’Brien, you want to have an inquiry into all this because you do not have the guts to have a position. Your leader does not have a position and you do not have a position, because you want to go to the election saying: ‘We’ll have an inquiry. We’ll look into it.’ You will not take a position because either way you might have a political downside. Guess what: Mr Bowen, your shadow Assistant Treasurer, has been going around to the promoters of MISs—and I hope everyone is listening to this—saying, ‘If we get into government, we’ll reverse this and open the market again to the lurk farmers unfettered.’ That is what he is saying. You probably do not even know that, but that is what he is saying.
—Is that right?
—That is exactly right.
—You’re not verballing him, are you?
—No, I certainly am not. Obviously the promoters have been telling me, because they have been trying to pressure me. If you want a capital market that is dependent for its viability on the generosity of Australia’s taxpayers—and the graph on the take-up of these things is vertical—it is a $1.3 billion drain on the budget.

Senator O’Brien interjecting—

—If it is all about 20/20 vision and forestry, then why are all the foresters getting into everything else? They are getting into everything else because it is a great lurk. This is lurk farming. Great Southern Plantations are still about 70 per cent forest and 30 per cent out in the other lurk world. They will go back to forestry, as you said. Timbercorp are about 70-30 the other way. But, if you want to compete, it is buyer beware. If you want to go into tax minimisation, driven by profit from a tax loss, and farm on that, then it is buyer beware.
The test—and there is no need to have a Senate inquiry about this—is whether these people are passive investors or not. That is something that the Commissioner of Taxation will have to sort out. We do not need a Senate inquiry; we need a test case. The idea that somehow the Labor Party can weasel its way through by not having a position on this, by having an inquiry, when the shadow minister is running around saying, ‘She’ll be right, brother; just vote for us and in the meantime publicly we’ll say we’ll have an inquiry,’ is garbage. It is gutless and garbage.
You cannot have a proposition that the rest of the world—the United States, Europe and England—has rejected; that is, the viability of a farming industry based on a tax subsidy. It is complete hogwash. There is absolutely no need for a Senate inquiry. There will be a tax office ruling and a test case. You ought to have the guts to say how you are going to pay for pensions and health care if you are going to have a drain on finance of these proportions. This will build to become bigger as a tax lurk than the bottom of the harbour scheme. This is a deadset tax lurk.
The government recognises that some transitional arrangements will need to be sorted out in the aftermath, but the proposition that you can build an agricultural industry that relies for its viability on a tax lurk is garbage. What about the subsidy rate that will eventually come out of this, if it is allowed to build? While we are arguing in the World Trade Organisation about the devil of the European Union and the US farm subsidy program, per head of population and per dollar of production this will make their schemes look like paltry schemes.
It is an absolute fraud to propose an inquiry into this matter. You blokes are going around saying, ‘Vote for us and we’ll put you back where you were.’ All of these lurk agents are being told: ‘We’ll put you back in business. In the meantime we’ll cover ourselves politically.’ You might ask your leader, Mr Rudd, what his position is. Maybe the media could ask, ‘Are you for or against?’ But you don’t have a position and instead you say, ‘We’ll have an inquiry.’ You are trying to have two bob each way, and your Mr Bowen has put his cards on the table. It is an absolute fraud of a proposition to want to hold an inquiry into the matter.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,22,2
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-02-27,"—I support the rationalising and reduction of managed investment scheme tax concessions, and I do not oppose their being phased out altogether. With that position, you would have to ask: why would I support this reference to a committee? I want to explain those reasons.
As a member of the Senate economics committee, I had the unfortunate experience of spending several years examining the issue of all those people who had been affected and hurt by the tax-effective managed investment schemes that had to be closed down because they were essentially tax lurks, to use the language of Senator Heffernan; they were being promoted by dodgy promoters, spiv lawyers and spiv accountants and they were making victims of innocent and unsophisticated Australians.
I have never forgotten going to Kalgoorlie to hear from these people and holding the hands of weeping men and women—working men and women; ordinary folk who had, by the sweat of their brow, made a few bob—who had lost their savings in these schemes which had been perverted for purely tax benefit reasons and were not productive enterprises in the sense of commercial enterprises. Of course, that was not true of every managed investment scheme but it was true of the abuse of those schemes.
If we fast-forward to now, my own belief has long been that the tax office and the government need to be far stricter and stronger about the rules as to when a tax concession should be allowed, and should be based on the commercial operation that is in play. I am concerned that what has happened in the latest exercise is that the tax office has acted properly and the government has acted improperly, because I see a false distinction between the forestry managed investment schemes and the non-forestry managed investment schemes. There is not a distinction between trees. I fail to see, from a greenhouse and environmental point of view, why a gum tree is any different from a walnut tree, but I am not a biologist; maybe some scientist can explain it to me. I am a tax man and I cannot explain it. It sounds very odd.
The reason I welcome the proposal for an inquiry is that it could sort out these issues. It could try to develop a policy which would show some consistency and which would attack this issue on the basis of policy principles rather than political principles. I think, as a person who deals with tax and finance all the time, that we have to continue to strive to make sure that policy principles are rational and transparent. For instance, if the community, the parliament and the government decide that trees are good—and I use ‘good’ in the sense of an economic good—environmentally and economically then all trees, not just some trees, should be supported with tax concessions.
To my mind—and I might have designed these terms of reference a little differently but I still think these issues would flow—the principles surrounding such tax concessions need to be explored and examined. I think, in terms of my own tax philosophy, that tax concessions are indeed appropriate for infant industries but should be time limited and phased out on a set timetable, unless an industry is of national strategic significance or of national economic or national environmental significance. For instance, if we want to ensure a better water supply in this country, we might decide to subsidise water pipelines by way of a tax concession. That is perfectly reasonable; it is an environmental argument, not an economic argument.
But any industry that is not viable, profitable or sustainable without tax concessions should not be given tax concessions in the first place. It is as simple as that. You have to have a good, sound, consistent policy reason for giving tax concessions. I think the proposed committee would need to examine the history, nature, extent and cost of managed investment schemes; the arguments for and against them; the economic, social and environmental consequences of managed investment scheme tax concessions; the dangers for the current government; ATO decisions; the fact that there is no transition period; and proposed remedies and policies.
The matter of a transition period is quite important. If you go back full circle to my opening remarks, when I described to the chamber what was going on with the tax-effective managed investment schemes that the Senate Standing Committee on Economics examined, you will recall that I said they were pushed by dodgy promoters and so on. The point behind that is that many investors would have entered those schemes in good faith, trusting the tax advice and the legal advice that they got. The fact that they might have been conned or gulled or taken advantage of to get them into these schemes needs to be recognised, and that is why you need a transition period—to ensure that such persons can get out with some of their financial skin intact.
In conclusion, I will say again that I support the rationalisation and reduction of these tax concessions and do not oppose them being phased out altogether. That is my policy position. But I support the Labor Party’s initiative in wishing to have this matter properly and forensically examined so that a better policy picture can emerge. It is for that reason that I would suggest that the chamber support Senator O’Brien’s motion.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,22,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-02-27,"—The Greens also support a reference of this type to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport but not for the reasons that Senator O’Brien outlined. We have concerns similar to Senator Murray’s in that we fail to see why the government has taken action on non-forestry activities but not forestry activities. We would like to examine that for a start. We would also like to look at the impact that managed investment schemes have had on the agricultural economy and on decision making in agricultural areas, and how MISs at present are in fact affecting and distorting prices for water and land—and I will come back to the issue of water in a minute.
We have concerns about the impact MISs have had on family farms and the way agriculture is practised in Australia. It has become apparent that the people who develop these schemes and those who invest in them do so for the up-front tax deductions. These people do not seem to be interested in the longer term profitability of some of these schemes, which is why we have concerns about the schemes’ impact on agriculture. If you are investing in these schemes for their up-front tax deductibility, you may not be that interested in the sustainability of the scheme or of the particular agricultural enterprise. And I am deeply concerned that some of the crops being invested in are in fact unsustainable in particular areas. Growing olives, for example, where irrigation is needed, using large amounts of water, may be unsustainable in the longer term in certain areas.
Then you add in the fact that these large investment schemes are buying up water entitlements, water licences—many schemes, in fact. It was reported just yesterday that Macquarie Bank has acquired a great many of these licences with a view to planting higher security crops, thereby not only transferring water out of a good many of the districts but also transferring water entitlements to higher value crops. Now, that raises two questions for me. First, do they expect to be bought out through the $3 billion national water plan? Second, does that mean that they will try to secure that entitlement because it has now gone to higher security water applications? And they will secure that, whereas people running smaller family farms will not.
There is also the issue of the impact that these schemes are having on the price of water licences and the fact that they can aggressively enter the market. I am told, for example, that some large investors are actually going straight to brokerages before licences can even make it onto the market, thereby again, I believe, potentially distorting the water market. So, while we are looking at a process to reform and get better management of our water market, as we have already seen large investors could be buying up these allocations and distorting the market.
What I would like to know is how those water licences are going to be handled now that the changes have been made to the non-forestry managed investment schemes. How are we going to deal with those water licences? I believe that area needs reviewing. What are the implications now for rural communities, for better investments? How should we really be investing for the long term in agriculture in Australia? I do not for one minute believe that those organisations and people responsible for MISs are concerned about the long-term security and sustainability of the agricultural industry in Australia. I think they are largely focused on achieving tax deductibility for up-front initial investments. I believe an inquiry would enable us to determine how best to focus on the long-term sustainability of our agricultural industry. There is no doubt investment is required, but I do not believe that MISs, as they were, were the appropriate tool.
I would also like any inquiry to look at how many people were employed through these MISs in our regional centres and just what impact phasing the schemes out of regional communities would have. You have to balance that against the number of family farms that have been bought out, both for plantations and alternative crops in areas where—I will say it once again—we have deep concerns about their sustainability.
I was looking at a media release from the Australian Dairy Farmers. They actually supported the government’s change in the MIS process because they were concerned about the impact it is having on issues such as water—and land prices, in particular, where smaller landowners cannot afford to compete with the MIS and the impact that has. I think we should also be investigating what impact it is having on the commodities market. I definitely agree with my colleagues on looking at the transition process for moving from this investment scheme to supporting sustainable agriculture and rural communities. I think that is tremendously important. Therefore, the Greens would support this sort of inquiry but, as I said, not necessarily on the terms Senator O’Brien has articulated.
I think how we manage investment into an agricultural system undergoing change through dramatically reduced water security and climate change is the sort of issue that very strongly needs further investigation. And it needs to be looked at holistically. That is another reason for an inquiry of this sort. We should not necessarily be looking at how we go back to the present system. From everything I have seen, I do not believe this is for the good of the long-term sustainability of agriculture in Australia—and certainly not for family farms and a good deal of regional communities.
I think some of the managed investment schemes have favoured some regional communities and not others. I suspect that the negative impacts have far outweighed any positive impacts, and I would dearly like to see the figures for employment under the current schemes versus how many people have been lost to regional communities. I could reel off a number of communities in my home state of Western Australia which have suffered from tremendously reduced numbers in the community due to the impact of areas being bought up, taken out of traditional farm practices and moved into plantations, in particular, but also various other schemes under the MIS system.
So we would support this referral but we would seek to investigate a far broader set of issues, including the impacts the managed investment schemes have had by distorting our agricultural systems, land practices and land and water prices in Australia. We also need to look at how this is damaging our water market, particularly because big players have now bought up large numbers of water entitlements in the water market. I believe they are distorting those markets and will continue to. I would dearly love to know whether they will now expect government to buy out those allocations. They have driven up the price of water, so it will cost us even more to fix the overallocation, particularly in the Murray-Darling system. It is going to be vastly more expensive due to the impacts of the MIS process. I would like to know what these companies now intend to do with the entitlements that they have bought up if they are not intending to sell them. Where do they intend to invest? I believe all of these issues need very thorough investigation.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,22,2
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2007-02-27,"—I am happy to respond, if the government’s only defence is that put by Senator Heffernan. Frankly, we are seeing a disgraceful attitude to the scrutiny process of this parliament. Let us be absolutely clear on this. This is a decision the government took effectively in the dead of night without consultation. This is a decision which will have a substantial effect on the rural communities this government claims to champion. This is a decision which has been the subject of criticism by governments and coalition or Liberal Party oppositions in other states and territories around this country. This is a decision which will put people out of work and businesses out of business, subject to any transitional arrangements which are as yet unannounced.
This is a decision which will take millions of dollars out of country towns. It has been suggested to me that the olive industry puts $10 million a year into the town of Boort in Victoria. Although they were not non-forestry MISs, we saw on the Landline program that the forestry MISs caused a substantial change to the prosperity of the town of Bombala in southern New South Wales, not too far from here. These schemes have their benefits and indeed they may have their costs.
So what is the problem with having an inquiry to look at that? It cannot order the government to do anything. It cannot make the government change its position. But what it can do is get us the facts. When you boil down the government’s opposition, it comes down to this: the government does not want the facts known. The government does not want people to know the impact of its decision. It will come out. There will be people who will tell us over time what the effect will be. They just will not get the benefit senators get of saying what they think under parliamentary privilege.
It will come out. Eventually the numbers that lie behind the government’s decision will come out. Frankly, it would have been good to have them on the record by now, rather than the unauditable commentary from Senator Heffernan about the cost. Those sorts of matters will remain a bit of a mystery. No doubt we will tease them out over time. If Labor wins the next election then all will become clear. But, frankly, it is a bit hypocritical of the government to talk about what these schemes cost the budget. Senator Heffernan described them as rorts—tax rorts, he said. But why is this different to some of the government’s funding programs that have been otherwise described as rorts? The difference is that the government claims political patronage when it makes grants to regional communities. We do not oppose them all, but some of them have been absolute rubbish, utter rorts, an abuse of process and a waste of money.
The government has been guilty of rorting the public purse for electoral advantage, by its own direct decision. It is not frightened to do that. No doubt it is going to do it again this year. It has a lot of programs stored up. We are waiting to see the flood of announcements, the cheques being signed and the allocations. And that is all right, according to the government.
But what about initiatives that can create businesses in communities, can create real jobs in communities and can get the wealth flowing through the community? This is not just me talking; there are members of the coalition parties in state parliaments around this country pointing to this decision and saying it is an outrage. This includes Senator Parry’s state colleagues. You would not see a more dismissive release than that from his colleague the agriculture spokesman in the Tasmanian parliament, a member of the Liberal Party, castigating the federal government for the decision. So it is not just the Labor Party saying that this is an outrageous decision. If you read the papers, you know it is also members of the government’s own backbench, whether it is the outspoken member for O’Connor or others.
There are a number of people on the government’s backbench who are openly critical and some who are privately critical. It will be interesting to see how many of those have the courage of their conviction to take that short walk across and vote for the inquiry and pursue a better outcome, pursue their belief. But we will see what happens; we will see whether the government is able to get all of its members voting for it. We will see whether the courage of their conviction comes out in the vote.
Labor does not require any member to support any particular proposition. I am not surprised the Greens would prefer that this was an inquiry into all managed investment schemes, because they would want to attack the forestry managed investment schemes, which have been allowed to continue. We did not oppose that decision. What we do oppose is the hypocrisy of the approach that this government has taken to this. We would like the facts on the table. We are presenting the Senate with an opportunity to try and get those facts on the table and give people a say. The government may well scuttle across to this side of the chamber and vote no and prevent the inquiry and to silence the communities they claim to represent, but in the end they should not expect that those communities will forgive them for it.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator O’Brien’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,22,2
"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2007-02-27,"—When the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Simplified Superannuation) bill and related bills was interrupted for question time, I had outlined the major reforms that the Howard government has introduced with regard to superannuation which are reflected in this legislation. I was then outlining particularly the benefit that has been delivered to small business as part of decisions made in the finetuning process of those major superannuation reforms. I was referring to the provision in the legislation for an amount of up to $1 million gained over the lifetime of a small business person or farm owner to be put into a superannuation fund as an after-tax contribution, provided that money is derived from the sale of the small business or farm assets for the purpose of retirement.
This is a very important part of the legislation, a part that I strongly advocated with my colleague Senator Bernardi after meeting intending retiring farmers and their accountant in Adelaide in the latter part of last year. We listened to the concerns expressed about their inability, under the arrangements as they had been announced in the budget, to put the proceeds of their farm business, once sold for retirement, into superannuation. When this additional measure was announced it was decried by some, and I think by some in the Labor Party, as a benefit for the rich. It is nothing of the sort, because anyone who knows anything about small business or farmers knows that during their working lifetime they have very little opportunity to put money into superannuation because any surplus money from farms, on the rare occasions that a surplus is generated from a farm or from small business, is put back into the farm or small business to pay off the farm or pay off the small business. So, during their working lives, those people have very little opportunity to put money into superannuation, unlike people on salaries, particularly those on high salaries, who have that opportunity.
Traditionally, under previous arrangements, when those people came to retiring age they regarded their small business or their farm as their retirement nest egg and often sold the small business or farm and deposited the proceeds into a superannuation fund to provide adequate income during their retirement years. Under the initial announcement, with the $150,000 untaxed contribution limit that applied, or the $450,000 limit over a three-year cycle, this particular group were excluded from putting the proceeds of their business into superannuation. In effect, the $1 million only equates to what another person who could put in the $150,000 year by year for 20 or 30 years would have in their superannuation fund. So there was no particular concession being made to the rich, as the critics of this decision would have you believe. It in fact introduces an element of fairness for people who during their working lives simply do not have the capacity to put money into superannuation. It allows those people at the end of their working lives, when they sell their small business or farm, to make that contribution to superannuation.
This is a very important initiative, which, as I said, came out of discussions that Senator Bernardi and I had with constituents and their accountant. As a result of those discussions, I took the matter to the government members’ Treasury committee. Despite some initial reticence, I have to say, on the part of the Treasurer, he eventually saw the wisdom of extending this provision to allow farm owners and small business people to make this up to $1 million over a lifetime after-tax contribution. So this initiative does put small business people and farmers on an even footing with those who can make regular contributions during their working lives.
Unlike the other concession provided, whereby people currently planning to put money into superannuation from the sale of a home or other assets would have until 30 June this year to put up to $1 million into a superannuation fund, this is an ongoing provision well into the future. Provided that the small business or farm owner meets the same requirements in place to get the capital gains tax concession, these people will be able to make that contribution to their super fund to provide for their retirement. So, as I said, this is a very important provision. It is very good news for small business people and farm owners, who, as I said, regard the value of their business as their retirement nest egg and who in the past have always been able to put that nest egg into superannuation funds.
Of course, if the opposition, and Mr Rudd in particular, have their way, this may be the last good news that small business owners receive. As we know, a Labor government intends, in its workplace relations policy, to abolish Work Choices and instead reinstate the unfair dismissal laws for small business employees. It has been another very important initiative of the Howard government to get rid of those draconian unfair dismissal laws which hung around the necks of small businesses and in fact prevented them from providing employment opportunities for people in the community, notwithstanding that often they needed those extra employees. The draconian nature of the old unfair dismissal laws was a substantial disincentive to small businesses to employ people.
So it is important that small business owners remain free to make their own workplace agreements with their employees under the Work Choices legislation that this government has initiated and do not have that opportunity diminished by the return of the unfair dismissal laws which Work Choices gets rid of. As I say, we must not allow the return of the Labor Party to government because that would not only undo the Work Choices legislation and the good work that that does for small business but might well undo these particularly important superannuation changes for small business.
I want to refer to the way in which these changes also have the capacity to address the challenge of encouraging younger Australians to save for their retirement through superannuation. The raft of benefits that I highlighted earlier make salary sacrificing into superannuation the most profitable and tax effective of a range of popular investment strategies. Superannuation is now far superior to negatively geared investments, whether property or shares—indeed, it is even superior to accelerating repayments on the home mortgage.
However, I think it is true to say that, despite these incentives, for those under the age of 40, whose retirement is 20 or more years away and who have immediate family and mortgage pressures straining their finances, the thought of saving for retirement is well down their list of priorities. It is a fact that most Australians save for their superannuation after they reach the age of 50. Getting young people to invest in superannuation is a tough problem because it is hard for them to envisage how much their savings will stack up over the years. The upshot of that is that younger Australians, especially in the lower to middle-income groups, almost certainly will need more help to follow through with any good intentions they have to contribute to superannuation. We need to find the right carrots to attract extra savings that will help younger Australians into a comfortable and enjoyable retirement.
The Howard government’s co-contribution scheme—another very positive initiative of this government—saw lower income Australians collect more than $33 billion into their superannuation funds from the government co-contribution over the last three years. The contribution rates and dramatic yearly fluctuations, however, show that this is not enough. We need to examine a number of possibilities to address this challenge. Introducing age based criteria combined with current income criteria for eligibility for the government co-contribution is something that I believe the government might consider. For example, for lower income and younger Australians we could increase the current annual $1,000 cap and/or increase the government co-contribution from the current $1.50 to $2 for every dollar that an individual contributes. We could combine those measures with relaxing the taper rate at which the government co-contribution is reduced for those earning more than $28,000. I believe these are initiatives worthy of consideration.
To support these options we also need better education and to initiate ongoing awareness strategies. For instance, many people in the superannuation industry are convinced that the government could achieve greater voluntary contributions if the regulators eased their rules which have made most commercial groups steer away from using calculators which enable people to model their own situation and see firsthand what they need to do to achieve their retirement financial goals.
Similarly, the Howard government’s recently introduced choice environment allows people to choose their superannuation fund. Despite the widespread benefits that this brings, there is, of course, additional administration for all businesses through an increased paperchase—sorting out separate super payments to scores of different funds, depending on the individual employee’s particular choices. Hence, establishing a super choice centre within the Australian Taxation Office would be a significant cost-saving solution, offering businesses one standardised payment process per employee without the maddening and costly paperchase.
New Zealand will be introducing this solution later this year, along with a world-first default super option that will see employees who do nothing having an additional four per cent of their wages deducted and paid into superannuation unless they tick a box opting out or specify another deduction amount. This initiative takes a common employee response to superannuation—that of doing nothing—and uses it as a tool to secure a comfortable retirement income for lower income and younger people.
Alternatively, in Australia, an opt-in box could be considered, applying to either salary sacrificing or co-contribution deductions. On the ATO tax file number declaration form, a new superannuation section could be linked to attached information, showing the employee what their level of contribution may net them at retirement, based on current projections, compared with not making voluntary contributions additional to the legislated nine per cent employer contribution.
Along these lines, the current choice authorising tax file number disclosure to an employee’s superannuation fund could also be changed so that disclosure is automatically authorised unless the box is ticked to deny disclosure. This could be accompanied by an attached explanatory note that nondisclosure could result in money which should be going to their superannuation fund being taken out in tax.
So there are a number of initiatives, I believe, which could create opportunities for young people—and, indeed, further incentives for young people and lower income people—to make worthwhile contributions to their superannuation funds to ensure that in retirement they will have an adequate retirement income.
With world-leading superannuation reforms being locked in by this legislation, we must continue to pursue and promote the Howard government’s reform agenda. There is no room for complacency in securing opportunity and building prosperity for all Australians over the long term. This legislation takes a major step along the road to those goals. It is yet another major reform of the Howard government, and I commend this legislation to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (SIMPLIFIED SUPERANNUATION) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2007-02-27,"—I am pleased to follow Senator Chapman in endorsing the very good policy contained in the Tax Laws Amendment (Simplified Superannuation) Bill 2006, because it is policy that is in the interests of all Australians. It is in the long-term interests of Australia and it has been quickly recognised as such by the men and women of Australia, the financial professionals and even the union dominated industry superannuation funds. The only people who have had to be dragged kicking and screaming to support this legislation are the economic spendthrifts on the other side of the chamber: the Labor Party. It took them months to decide whether they could support a fairer and simpler superannuation system for all Australians. Just as with the tax cuts announced in last year’s budget, it took them months to make a decision about whether or not they were going to support it. They have been dragged kicking and screaming from their 1950s central planning economic theory into the modern economic age that has delivered prosperity and success for so many Australians.
Listening to the previous speeches, I was surprised how far senators opposite have had to be dragged into the future. They are still backslapping about the victories of yesteryear. Their speeches were not about how good this policy is and how positive it is for Australians going forward; they were all about how Labor introduced superannuation. We have acknowledged that, but they are still backslapping and crowing about these things. As much as they crow and congratulate each other, we need to be reminded of the real achievements of Labor when they were in office. The facts are that unemployment averaged 8.5 per cent under the Labor Party, youth unemployment peaked at 34 per cent in this country, mortgage interest rates were nearly 17 per cent, and the average interest rate was 12.75 per cent throughout Labor’s period of administration. Industrial disputation under a Labor government averaged 193 working days per 1,000 employees.
Contrast that with the performance of this government. Unemployment is at 4.8 per cent, the lowest level in 30 years. Productivity is higher. Interest rates have averaged 7.15 per cent. Industrial disputes, I read the other day, are at the lowest level they have ever been. Real wages growth has peaked in excess of 16 per cent. Yet, despite the evidence that the coalition’s economic policies have delivered the best economic environment this country has had in 60 years, the Labor Party are still slapping each other on the back for the only sensible decision they made more than a decade ago. The Labor Party are living in the past. They are yesterday’s party. They have no vision for the future of this country save for a resurrected union movement seeking to take control of the freedom this government has given the workers.
This government, on the other hand, does have a vision for the future of Australia. With so many achievements on behalf of the good citizens, we could probably be excused for resting on our laurels. As comfortable as that might be, we are not prepared to do it. We are still producing policies and legislation that will deliver jobs, prosperity and continuing hope for all Australians. The Labor Party have had 11 years to come up with a coherent policy on anything, and we are still waiting. Instead, they decide to promote the architect of their Medicare Gold package to the leadership. I wonder if that policy gem is going to resurrect itself at the next election.
It is with confidence that on behalf of the people of Australia I speak in support of this bill. As a former financial adviser, I know about the complexities previously associated with superannuation. Making savings for retirement simpler and more tax efficient is a huge step towards the future prosperity of this country. Removing age based concessional contribution limits and installing an annual cap of $50,000 will make it easier for Australians to plan for their retirement.
Of course, any changes introduced in this environment, however positive over the long term, do have an immediate impact on a minority of Australians. This government has recognised the impact this has on those people who are planning for their retirement in the more immediate future. In an attempt to alleviate this, we have introduced a five-year transitional cap. This cap will help those people aged 50 or more to make a $100,000 annual contribution to superannuation for five years, covering financial years 2007-08 through to 2011-12. There are also opportunities for people to contribute a further $150,000 per annum in non-concessional contributions with transitional arrangements applied to offset any inconvenience or disadvantage to those already approaching retirement age. I have had first-hand input, as Senator Chapman alluded to in his speech, in meeting people and effecting change so that people who have gone down an extensive path of preparing for their retirement are not disadvantaged. I am pleased to say that this has been very well received.
These provisions alone are enough to warrant support of this bill; but, as the ads say, wait, there’s more! This bill provides greater incentives to invest in superannuation by simplifying the arrangements for the taxation of benefits. Most significant amongst these is the removal of tax on superannuation benefits paid to people aged 60 and over when paid from what is declared a taxed superannuation fund. This initiative has a positive and direct impact on around 90 per cent of Australian employees—further proof that this government is the best friend the workers of Australia have ever had.
This also provides an incentive for people to remain in the workforce, which helps our economy in a number of ways. Principal amongst them is that we are going to be retaining a lot of skills and experience to build a stronger and more prosperous Australia going forward. Part of a stronger and more prosperous Australia is of course a strong economy. To maintain a strong economy and to ensure that people cannot rort the system, we need to ensure there is accountability and efficient administration. This bill does exactly that, because it requires the provision of a tax file number before a person can contribute to a superannuation fund. This protects the integrity of the generous taxation concessions contained within the bill.
Not only is this government the best friend that the workers of Australia have ever had; it is also a very good friend of the self-employed. The self-employed—those entrepreneurs and free spirits who have clearly rejected the tired old Labor dogma—can now claim a full tax deduction for superannuation contributions, within the predetermined limits, until the age of 75. If ever there was a positive step forward to enable people to become self-reliant, to pursue their own business and to provide employment for others in this country to ensure sustained economic growth then this is a policy that will do exactly that. I commend this bill to the Senate. It defines a very clear path. It defines a path of future prosperity, a path that will build a stronger Australia, a stronger economy and an economy that only a coalition government is fit and equipped to manage.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (SIMPLIFIED SUPERANNUATION) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2007-02-27,"—It is a great honour and a privilege to support the remarks of my colleagues Senators Bernardi and Chapman, who have spoken in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (Simplified Superannuation) Bill 2006 before the Senate. In essence, the bill contains the most significant reforms to the taxation of superannuation in Australia’s history. That is the short of it and the long of it. It will remove the complexity that is currently in the system. It will sweep away the current raft of complex tax arrangements that apply to superannuation. It will support a number of the government’s key principles and messages. It will improve the incentives to save—and this government believes that is important. It will increase retirement incomes. We have an ageing population in this country, in every state and territory. Increased retirement incomes can only be good for those over 65. Nearly 13 per cent of the population is in that category and that percentage is growing by the day. The principles of improving incentives to save and increasing retirement incomes will be of tremendous benefit for that category of Australians.
This legislation will also strengthen incentives for older Australians to actually stay in the workforce, and I think that is a very good thing, particularly in light of the ageing population and the scarcity of workers for the jobs that need to be done in the years and decades ahead. It is a substantial investment by this government in the standard of living of Australians in retirement and, indeed, in the country’s future economic prosperity.
The legislation supports the thrust of good economic management, which has been the key hallmark of the Howard and Costello government over the last 10 years. We now have record low unemployment. We have record low interest rates. We have an increased number of jobs over the last 10 years, specifically since the tough decision to bring on the Work Choices reforms in March last year. Over 240,000 new jobs have been created in Australia. Not only has there been an increased number of jobs; there has been an increase in real wages of over 16 per cent, including in my home state of Tasmania. That is a tremendous result, particularly when you compare that to the 13-odd years of Labor government when there was actually a decrease of 1.2 per cent in real wages. How sad for the working men and women of Australia to have been subjected to that type of mismanagement of the economy.
Under the John Howard and Peter Costello government this is what has happened: there has been a real increase in wages, there has been an increased number of jobs, specifically since Work Choices, and there has been the lowest unemployment recorded for 30-odd years. This is part of the tapestry of good economic management that has been undertaken by the Howard government and will continue to be undertaken as we pursue this policy of continual improvement at every level. In terms of the taxation of superannuation, yes, this is a first in our history. I commend these bills to the Senate.
The Simplified Superannuation reforms are a broad-ranging suite of reforms to superannuation taxation, the age pension assets test, superannuation contribution rules and superannuation payment rules. The centrepiece of the reforms is making superannuation benefits tax free, if paid from a taxed fund, to Australians aged 60 or over. I want to outline some of the other key aspects of the reforms. There will be significantly lower tax paid on superannuation from an untaxed fund for people aged 60 and over. Age based limits will be replaced with streamlined contribution rules. Contribution incentives will be improved for the self-employed—and this is a very important category of the Australian community. Obviously, these are the small-business and microbusiness operators. The self-employed is a very large category of operators across this country. Livelihoods are on the line for the self-employed. They probably have mortgages on their homes and they have to make ends meet everyday. I commend the self-employed and thank them for their courageous approach to dealing with everyday life and looking after their families and their children.
To improve the contribution incentives for those people, we will be extending to the self-employed the government’s highly successful co-contribution scheme. Also, the reforms will halve the assets test taper rate and rewrite the superannuation taxation law to present a clearer picture of superannuation taxation and reduce the compliance costs and regulatory burden faced by business and other taxpayers. I am talking about small businesses in particular. Yes, it is important for large and medium-sized businesses, but we have 1.2 million small businesses in this country and about 600,000 of them are family based businesses. Wherever possible, we should use every ounce of our energy and every fibre of our bodies to reduce the red tape, the paperwork burden and the complexity so that those people can get on and do what they do best—that is, run their businesses. This is why I am so disappointed with Labor’s response to the government’s initiatives that are before us.
—We’re actually supporting them.
—I acknowledge that you are supporting the bill that is before us—
—All 11 of them.
—Yes—but your responses over the years to a range of tough government reforms—including the Work Choices reforms, which I referred to earlier in my speech—have been very disappointing. I acknowledge the work of the Senate Standing Committee on Economics and its report of February 2007, and I acknowledge the chair of that committee, Senator Brandis, who is now a minister. I notice that the deputy chair of that committee, Senator Ursula Stephens, has signed off on the report, and I commend her and her Senate colleagues on the report. I notice that the introduction of the report says:
The proposals, which are due to take effect from 1 July 2007, represent the most significant reform to the superannuation system in decades. They will potentially affect over 10 million individuals, 1.3 million employers and more than 310,000 superannuation funds. The cost of the reforms, including additional costs associated with the transitional and administrative arrangements announced by the government in September 2006, is estimated at $7.2 billion over four years, which is less than one per cent of Commonwealth government revenue.
That indicates the extent and breadth of the reforms that the Senate is considering today.
In conclusion, I acknowledge and thank the Treasurer, Peter Costello, and the Minister for Revenue, Peter Dutton, for their leadership on this matter. They have put a great deal of time and effort into pulling all of this together. This emanated from some of the budget announcements last year. Those initiatives have been followed through and they have been very successful indeed. I acknowledge that and thank the Treasurer and the Minister for Revenue for their contribution to the good of Australia and the working men and women of Australia, who will benefit under this particular policy.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (SIMPLIFIED SUPERANNUATION) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2007-02-27,"—I rise to speak on the suite of bills that includes the Tax Laws Amendment (Simplified Superannuation) Bill 2006 and related bills. I begin by acknowledging the work of the Senate Economics Committee and the secretariat in dealing with this group of complicated bills. Given the challenges that were presented to the committee, that was done in a very professional way. It was only possible to schedule one hearing and, on the day of that hearing, the chair of the committee was sworn in as a minister. I would not say that we were a rudderless ship, but it was certainly a challenging experience to chair the inquiry and manage the evidence provided by the witnesses and the evidence that was not provided by the witnesses—and I will come back to that point in a moment.
I have listened with interest to the contributions made to this debate by government members of the Senate. I chuckled to myself as I heard some of the remarks that have been made. It was an obvious strategy to add extra speakers on the bill today. It was about trying to revisit and recast the history of the superannuation industry and how it has come to be such a thriving industry today. We know that it was because of the foresight of the Keating government and the superannuation regime that was put in place in the eighties that we now have such a thriving superannuation and financial services industry—and over $1 trillion of national savings—which is the envy of the world. Many countries have tried, without much success, to emulate what we have in Australia.
I would briefly like to go to the issues that were raised in the committee’s inquiry. One of the most frustrating things that we found in questioning Treasury and ATO officials about the superannuation bills was the lack of detail and the lack of information that was available to the committee prior to the hearing and during the hearing itself. We asked lots of questions about examples. We believe that the explanatory memorandum and the information provided to the committee would have been much stronger if we had had some case studies and vignettes to describe for us the implications of the changes. It would certainly have helped to illuminate some of the difficulties that we experienced in understanding some of the submissions that were presented to us. That lack of detail, which has come to be a bit of a hallmark of the material that the Economics Committee has had to consider over the last 12 months or so, is starting to be a very frustrating issue for us to deal with. Information was not forthcoming during the hearing. Even this week we have had the same experience in another hearing at which information that would have made an important contribution to the committee’s considerations was not made available.
We did hear some very important evidence, which was touched upon by Senator Webber earlier today and by Senator Bartlett, from the retired Defence Force personnel on the circumstances around their superannuation pension arrangements. I can only concur with Senator Webber that this is a group of people that need special consideration. The personal circumstances that were described to us by the witnesses of almost abject poverty in which some people are living because of the way in which their retirement benefits have been structured was something that I found very moving and quite distressing. Great courage was demonstrated by the witnesses, who came and explained the circumstances in which they were living and the way in which they felt that their whole contribution to and service in the Defence Force was so devalued by Australians, by the government and by us. It was an appeal across the board to us to recognise the significance of that and the fact that they should have some kind of indexation of their pensions. It is an issue that we raised in the report and it is an issue that I intend to pursue both because those who represented their circumstances to us in the committee have given service in the past and also because it is very likely that we are going to be dealing with this issue again before too long in the future. It is something we will have to come back to.
The second issue that was raised with us by a very vibrant financial services industry was the impact on financial planners and the retirement industry. It is perhaps an unintended consequence that, when you are trying to reduce red tape, you might actually shrink an industry quite dramatically. But I still think at the end of the day anyone over 50 who is trying to work out their superannuation does need the services of a financial planner. Retirement advice is very complex and this is going to have a significant impact for them.
If I can just reflect on this suite of bills and what the real impact is going to be, first of all, from 1 July, as we have heard, the superannuation benefits paid from a taxed fund, either as a lump sum or as an income stream such as a pension, will be tax free for people aged 60 and over. The benefits paid from an untaxed scheme, which mainly affects public servants, will still be taxed although at a lower rate than they are now for people who are aged 60 or over.
An interesting part of the discussion during the committee inquiry was the impact of the abolition of the reasonable benefits limits. I can understand now why that is such an important feature of the bills. Individuals will have greater flexibility as to how and when to draw down their superannuation in retirement, and superannuation funds will no longer be forced to pay benefits. The issue of the concessional tax treatment of superannuation contributions and earnings was also raised with us. Replacing the age based restrictions that limited tax deductible superannuation contributions by a more streamlined set of rules also seemed to be a very valuable change.
Senator Barnett talked about the self-employed and how they are going to be able to claim a full deduction for their superannuation contribution as well as being eligible for the government co-contribution for their after-tax contributions. The tax exemption for invalidity payments will also be extended to the self-employed. I think that is a very important leveller in this process.
Also important, given that we have a much healthier ageing workforce, is that the ability to make deductible superannuation contributions is being extended to age 75. The introduction of the compulsory tax file number will now make it much easier for people to find and transfer their superannuation between funds. We received evidence at the committee inquiry about concerns that people had about tax file numbers and how that would all pan out. But in the end I can see that there is a lot of logic to that process. It certainly will help to recover some of the unclaimed millions of dollars of superannuation that currently exists.
To increase further the incentives to save for retirement—also a very important issue—from 20 September this year the pensions asset test taper rate will be halved to $1.50 per fortnight for every $1,000 of assets above the asset test free area. It is helpful to know that the superannuation preservation age will not change. The preservation age is already legislated to increase from 55 to 60 between the years 2015 and 2025. People will still be able to access their superannuation benefits before the age of 60, although they will be taxed on their benefits under the new simplified rules.
We are all in furious agreement that the best way to save for retirement is through superannuation. For some people it will make even more sense to pay interest on their home loans while salary sacrificing into super. I was listening to a talkback program on ABC radio just the other day. Someone was giving advice that the sensible thing to do would be to borrow money and throw it into your super before 1 July this year, simply to get that benefit. So people are doing some interesting things, although I do not know that it is going to help too many people who are trying to achieve homeownership if they do what was suggested in that case.
Labor are supporting the bills, although from Senator Barnett’s comments you could perhaps think that we are not supporting them, and we have a second reading amendment that has been moved by Senator Sherry. The importance of the committee hearings—and the importance of this legislation—is to bring the superannuation regime into line with the taxation system, which enables a much simplified system that reduces red tape and allows ordinary folk to actually understand what is happening with their superannuation. I said before that the Keating government had a vision for well-funded retirement through comprehensive superannuation. We on this side acknowledge that superannuation is contributing to the economic health of our nation and that its impact is compounding just like the retirement balances of almost all employees. In fact, Labor’s superannuation guarantee has been one of the greatest equalisers in the distribution of wealth that the country has seen in a very long time, although I know that government members would choke if they were asked to acknowledge that fact. If Labor had not made superannuation comprehensive then at least half of the workforce today would have no superannuation. It would have remained the preserve of the public sector rather than having the national system that we now enjoy.
We recognise too the important role that Australia’s fund management industries now play in our economy. The committee received very strong evidence about that and the contribution for funds management that this simplification package will actually bring into play. They are high-value industries paying high salaries that are enmeshing Australia with the world’s leading economy and they help to underline our prosperity. So while the package of changes will improve the retirement incomes of many Australians, there still are some proposals and some fundamental superannuation reform challenges. I was very interested to hear Senator Chapman raise some propositions for additional reform and change. We will pursue those.
We need to increase the retirement incomes and improve the living standards of everyone in retirement. We need to take some of the pressure of our ageing population off our future budgets. As the Australian population ages, we are now seeing a superannuation system that is starting to provide adequate incomes in retirement and is easing financial pressures so that we can continue to deliver budget surpluses and underpin our economic prosperity. You would have heard from Senator Sherry that this is the argument that Labor has about keeping the budget in surplus on average over the course of the economic cycle. In the long run, as Australia’s superannuation assets continue to grow, we are going to continue to export our capital—and we heard a lot of evidence about Australian superannuation funds investing both directly in overseas markets and through foreign debt and equity markets. In some ways it is a shame that we are seeing superannuation funds being invested offshore. I remember saying in my first speech in this place that one of the things that we could do is start to encourage the investment of superannuation funds in regional infrastructure, something that perhaps still has a way to go.
Superannuation funds, as we discovered through the committee process, today hold assets equivalent to 95 per cent of GDP. That is an extraordinary amount, a mind-boggling amount of money, something that we need to be able to draw on in terms of our economic management. As I said before, it was frustrating that the committee did not have detailed costings of the policies. We asked for an estimate of the numbers of people that would be affected by different parts of the bills but we did not actually get that. So what a surprise it was when an almost half a billion dollar costing was upgraded between when the Treasurer first announced this package and when we finally started to see some of the detail.
The primary change in the package is that from 1 July the superannuation benefits paid from a tax fund, either as a lump sum or as an income stream, will be tax free for people aged 60 and over. For those people that I talk to that is probably the most significant change. Individuals will have greater flexibility as to how and when they draw down their superannuation entitlements. The concessional tax treatment of superannuation contributions and earnings will remain, and the tax exemption for invalidity payments will be extended to the self-employed.
We were also keen to look at the costs and impacts of the package—$7.2 billion over the next four financial years. The beneficiaries of the tax-free treatment will be those Australians who have or will have $136,000 indexed or more in superannuation. For Australians with substantial retirement savings, this package will provide welcome additional retirement income.
The measures in the package which expand and rationalise incentives for small business, by applying the same rules and including them in voluntary co-contribution schemes, are also welcome. They will help people in that growing sector of our economy. It should be noted that the loss to revenue from the new tax treatment of co-contributions will amount to $4.2 billion of the estimated $7.2 billion cost of the package, which means that the government is putting just over $1 billion extra each year into superannuation. Combined with a further $1 billion each year from existing voluntary co-contributions, a total injection of some $2 billion extra a year into superannuation has been provided by the government. That incentive approach is likely to see ongoing, additional voluntary contributions of $2 billion to $3 billion a year, which is very important for setting up Australians with decent retirement incomes. But the new flows to superannuation are put starkly in the shade when they are compared with Labor’s original compulsory nine per cent superannuation guarantee, which delivers some $65 billion every year. Credit for that achievement goes back to the far-sighted Hawke and Keating governments, which introduced Australia’s superannuation system.
We have a very strong superannuation system in this country. We have some suggestions that have been raised by the committee and here in the chamber, certainly by Senator Sherry, who is our superannuation spokesperson and is certainly our expert in this area. He has foreshadowed his amendment and also the fact that there are some reforms that need to be put into place. One proposal that strongly took our attention was about tax deductibility for and indexation of the disability pension. It was raised with us by the defence services organisation, and we believe it still needs to be pursued. I thank everyone who participated in the inquiry. I appreciate it was a quite challenging thing to do.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (SIMPLIFIED SUPERANNUATION) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2007-02-27,"—On behalf of the government I thank all senators who contributed to the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Simplified Superannuation) Bill 2006 and related bills. This simplified superannuation package comprises a suite of reforms to superannuation taxation, the age pension assets test, superannuation contribution rules and superannuation payment rules. Collectively, I think it is fair to say that the reforms contained in this historic package will boost retirement incomes and greatly improve incentives to work and save. The changes will abolish the myriad complex rules that currently apply to superannuation benefits and give Australians greater flexibility as to how and when they draw down their super.
The centrepiece of the reforms, as has been noted, is to make superannuation benefits tax free for someone aged 60 or over if paid from a taxed superannuation fund. Lower rates of tax and simplified arrangements will also apply to benefits paid from untaxed funds to someone aged 60 or over. Improved incentives to contribute to super will be achieved by abolishing age based deduction limits and replacing these with streamlined contribution rules. Contribution incentives for the self-employed will be strengthened by allowing them full deductions for contributions and by providing access to the highly successful government co-contribution scheme. Overall, simplification of the superannuation system will encourage people to take a much greater interest in their superannuation and give them the confidence to make additional savings. The earlier people contribute, the greater the benefits they will receive.
Further improvements in incentives to save will be achieved by halving the pension assets test taper rate to $1.50 per fortnight for every $1,000 of assets above the assets test free area. This change will boost the retirement incomes of assets tested pensioners and increase the number of people who are eligible for a part pension and the associated concessions. The government is also enhancing the arrangements in respect of lost and unclaimed superannuation. Significant increases in resources for the ATO will be provided to reduce the amount held in lost superannuation accounts. The government will now be taking full responsibility for the management of unclaimed superannuation, which will provide a single access point for individuals searching for lost or unclaimed superannuation and a simpler, nationalised claims process going forward. It is, as I said, a historic, far-reaching and comprehensive package.
I will very briefly address and put on record the government’s responses to some specific issues raised during the debate. Firstly, I will turn to the release of long-term costs. These reforms are fiscally sustainable. The government has released costings in its press releases and in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. The next intergenerational report, due later this year, will provide a long-term assessment of Australia’s fiscal position, taking into account the reform package. The cost of the reforms over the remaining years of the forward estimates represents around 0.5 per cent of government revenue. Even allowing for significant growth in the future, the cost of the reforms will remain a small component of government revenue.
The second issue is the higher threshold at which tax file numbers will need to be provided. Concerns have also been raised about the quotation of tax file numbers. Without tax file numbers there would be scope for significant abuse of the superannuation caps and for people to access superannuation concessions without limit. A high level of TFN quotation is crucial to the integrity of the new simplified super system. The $1,000 threshold seeks to strike a balance between the need to protect people who have very small contributions and, on the other hand, the need to protect the integrity of the new system by ensuring people cannot easily spread contributions across a number of funds in order to avoid tax liabilities and contribution caps. Greater TFN quotation will also assist in reducing the number of lost superannuation accounts, which will be of particular importance to low- and middle-income earners. The liability resulting from a person’s failure to quote a TFN is entirely avoidable and the government strongly encourages all individuals to provide their TFNs to their superannuation fund. In the lead-up to 1 July 2007, the government will be putting in place significant measures to encourage individuals to quote their TFN, including an extensive marketing and education campaign by the ATO. To further maximise TFN quotation, the Australian Taxation Office will use its own systems to match a tax file number to a member where nonquotation has occurred and contact the member to organise for the TFN to be quoted to the fund.
The third issue I want to address is low superannuation balances. Questions have been asked about the benefits of the reforms for those with low balances. The complexity of the current superannuation system impacts on all retirees regardless of how much money they have accumulated in superannuation. Removing the superannuation benefits tax simplifies the superannuation system for the overwhelming majority of the 10 million Australians who have superannuation accounts. It should lead people to take a greater interest in their superannuation savings and reduce the need for them to seek expensive financial advice.
The report of the task force on reducing regulatory burdens on business, Rethinking regulation, notes that:
While much of the complexity in the superannuation system was introduced to achieve equity objectives, complexity itself contributes to inequity—particularly for unsophisticated taxpayers and those who may not be able to afford financial advice.
A major initiative of the government’s reforms then is the halving of the assets test taper rate. Currently, a person with only modest superannuation savings or assets may be affected by the age pension assets test. As the superannuation system continues to mature, the full benefits of the reforms will be realised. For example, an average worker earning $1,000 per week and receiving only employer contributions will, after 40 years, increase their after-tax retirement income by 17 per cent.
The fourth issue is untaxed schemes. I know that has been the subject of contributions made in the debate. In respect of arrangements for untaxed schemes, Simplified Superannuation does achieve broad equity for the overwhelming majority of members of untaxed superannuation schemes. Members of untaxed schemes who are currently paying tax on the benefits will pay less tax as a result of the reforms. Retirees aged 60 and above receiving pensions from these schemes will now receive a 10 per cent tax offset, and the tax rate that applies to lump sum benefits paid from these schemes will be halved to 15 per cent for amounts up to $1 million.
Australian Defence Force personnel, as members of untaxed schemes, will also receive access to these tax reductions. The government recognises the important role that the ADF plays in serving and protecting the community and the country. Compensation provided to the ADF for their service extends beyond superannuation to include, for example, tax exemptions and offsets for certain overseas service and incapacity payments in the event of serious injury or illness. I note that the government has today announced an independent review of military superannuation arrangements to ensure that superannuation benefits are being provided in the most effective and sustainable manner for ADF members and their families.
In conclusion, these bills implement the most significant reforms to the taxation of superannuation in our country’s history. They will sweep away the current raft of complex tax arrangements that apply to superannuation, improve incentives to save, increase retirement incomes and strengthen incentives for older Australians to stay in the workforce. As a package they represent a substantial investment by the government in the standard of living of Australians in retirement and the country’s future economic prosperity. I commend these bills to the Senate.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-02-27,"—I had foreshadowed my own second reading amendment and wish to move that in a moment. Before sitting down, I just want to advise the chamber that I had an amendment for the committee stage. I propose to withdraw that amendment. I understand that, as that was the only amendment for the committee stage, there will therefore be no committee stage. I move my second reading amendment:
At the end of the motion, add “whilst the Senate acknowledges the Australian Democrats’ view that the ‘Simple Super’ package of 11 bills makes a genuine and systematic effort to simplify superannuation rules and taxation, and to encourage older Australians to work and save more, the Senate accepts the Australian Democrats’ view that the bills are inadequate because they only address part of a much larger problem—problems remaining in the superannuation system and the broader income taxation system include the need to significantly improve the disposable income of low-income Australians both in work and retirement, to address the markedly lower super funds accumulated by women overall, and the continuation of super discrimination against same sex couples”.
Question negatived.

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2007-02-27,"—I rise to speak on the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia’s Skills Needs) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2006. This amendment is necessary given the overwhelming success of the program, with 20 of the 25 colleges signing funding agreements with the Australian government. Twenty-one colleges are scheduled to operate in 2007, servicing the needs of 2,000 students and beginning to tackle areas of skill shortages in our economy. The Australian government is increasing its commitment by $112.6 million to $456.3 million to ensure that industry will have access to a supply of highly qualified workers. In fact, by 2009 these colleges will be home to 7,500 students. Some of the colleges will operate for multiple campuses. The scale of what is being achieved is beyond what was originally envisaged.
This package is another example of the government stepping up where the Labor states have failed. We should never forget that it was a succession of state Labor governments around Australia that abolished tech schools in the 1980s. The view then was that everyone should go to year 12 and university. The result was a bland, undifferentiated, one-size-fits-all education. Labor failed to recognise that a technical education, whether in plumbing, carpentry or any other trade, was and remains an important option for many students.
In my home state of Victoria, the Cain Labor government phased out tech schools in the 1980s, depriving many children of opportunities to pursue a technical trade. The then education minister, Joan Kirner, has since argued: ‘We didn’t end technical colleges; we broadened the curriculum to give young people a greater choice.’ It is funny how you broaden choice by limiting it! The president of the Victorian branch of the Australian Education Union, Mary Bluett, parrots this view, arguing that the answer is to broaden students’ experiences in secondary schools.
The federal government wants to return to a situation where a high-quality technical education is as prized as a good uni degree. This country made an enormous mistake when it abandoned the development of technical skills in colleges. The ability to study a trade and to complete a year 12 qualification concurrently is something that has been welcomed by students across Australia. I would have thought that broadening the range of options for a student was in their interests. How you broaden a student’s educational opportunities by closing down one particular option for education is beyond me.
Last night in this chamber we had the amazing spectacle of Senator Carr trying to mount an attack on the Australian technical colleges. What was Senator Carr’s knockout punch? What was his killer line? What was Senator Carr’s absolutely devastating line? His killer line was that the government did not consult with the states on the establishment of technical colleges. Senator Carr was arguing that it was our job to consult about the establishment of technical colleges with the governments that actually closed the tech schools—that is was our job to discuss with the states, which had totally abrogated their responsibilities in this area, how we were going to do their job for them. It is a perverse sort of logic. The truth is that successive Labor state and federal governments turned their backs on technical and further education. They sent young people the message that if you did not complete year 12 and you did not complete university then you were a failure. They stigmatised the traditional trades systematically and deliberately. We say that that is wrong. We want to turn that back. We want to reinstate the pride in a good technical education.
The establishment of these technical colleges has been a remarkable success, and I pay tribute to the former minister, the member for Moreton, and the new minister, the member for Goldstein. These colleges are being delivered ahead of schedule. Again, we see Labor walking both sides of the street on this issue. On one hand we have the member for Melbourne saying in a speech to the Sydney Institute on 21 November 2006, and he is right:
... we’ve managed to alienate countless young people from learning through an excessive focus on university entrance in schools.
The member for Melbourne, Mr Tanner, is basically saying what we have been saying—that this country has placed far too much emphasis on university degrees as the only worthy pathway for further education. That is why the government has established these technical colleges—to show students who are inclined towards a trade that their choice will be supported and valued, and to herald an end to the days when a trade qualification was seen as second class.
Even the former Victorian minister for education, Lynne Kosky, has admitted that tech colleges were an important element in Australia’s education system. She admitted on 10 August last year:
It’s probably true to say that we lost something when technical schools were closed previously ... We lost something that was important for young people.
Another Labor frontbencher has a different view. In an interview on Adelaide’s 5AA radio station on 4 January 2007, the member for Rankin, Dr Emerson, played down the importance of the trades. This is what he had to say: ‘I think we can easily overstate the importance of trades.’ What an extraordinary statement. On one hand we have Mr Tanner and Ms Kosky talking up the government’s approach of improving opportunities for trade qualifications, but on the other hand we have Dr Emerson saying that the importance of trades is overstated.
But what does Dr Emerson really think? If he thinks that the importance of trades is overstated, does he think Australian technical colleges are not needed? He was asked this question in the same interview and responded: ‘Of course we need technical education, vocational education and training.’ The truth is that Dr Emerson is echoing the sentiments of most of his colleagues. They have no plan for vocational and further education. Whilst they mouth rhetoric, the government is getting on with the job of addressing the skills shortage evident in our economy.
Labor do not like these tech colleges one little bit. This is typical of Labor’s approach. They say they want to support the trades; it is just that they oppose every single measure designed to support the trades. They say they support surplus budgets; it is just that they run deficits. They oppose every single measure designed to put the budget back into balance.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2007-02-27,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The Report on state revenue sharing relativities: 2007 update was tabled today. It is a very interesting document that I commend to all senators to have a look at. The commission is required to base the recommendations on relativities on the five years from 2001-02 to 2005-06. Over those years, relative fiscal circumstances of the states have changed quite substantially.
This year Western Australia joins New South Wales, the state with the strongest fiscal capacity, and Victoria in warranting less than an average per capita amount from the pool of GST revenue and healthcare grants for 2007-08. Queensland, my own home state, will also need less than in the past, requiring only slightly more than average. Compared to last year a smaller part of the pool is needed to equalise the fiscal capacities of these states. Perhaps I should have started with this—the Commonwealth pays money to the states under financial assistance grants and GST grants and this report looks at the relativities on which the Commonwealth Grants Commission actually divides up the total Commonwealth moneys between all of the states.
Over the five years, the commission’s calculations have tracked a larger change in relative fiscal capacities of the states than that observed in last year’s update. Those changes were due to changes in state revenues, and most notable of these has been the unprecedented strengthening of the fiscal capacity of Western Australia and, to a lesser extent, my home state of Queensland. It is interesting to read from this report that the features of this particular update include the conveyancing revenue base of Western Australia, which grew rapidly in 2005-06, greatly increasing its relative fiscal capacity in that year.
In my home state of Queensland, coal royalties increased markedly in 2005-06, strengthening Queensland’s revenue capacity. This was supplemented by an ongoing strong conveyancing base in Queensland. However, changing social and demographic conditions moderate that revenue effect by increasing the cost of delivering the average level of services in those states. If you get above one in the relativities in the tables in this report, that means that you are a contributor state. If you are below one, you get a greater share of the average payments. Relativities use the average of all states as the benchmark. States with relativities above one, as I have mentioned, require more than the Australian average per capita amount from the pool to deliver services at average levels. Those below one require less than the Australian average per capita amount.
All states but New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia will receive more than the Australian average per capita amount in 2007-08. The commission observed that rapid growth in Queensland and Western Australia’s revenue raising capacities had increased their relative fiscal capacities. This is a very interesting book. It does warrant very close attention by all senators. I want to mention that, on several pages throughout this report, reference is made to the coal revenues from Queensland. Because coal is such a substantial part of the revenue of Queensland, it is quite amazing to me that the Labor Party are trying to knock off the coal industry. Certainly, the Greens want to get rid of it completely, which would be disastrous for my state of Queensland. The Labor Party are messing around with all sorts of strange ideas when it comes to the coal industry. They are now looking at clean coal techniques and suggesting that moneys should be paid, just catching up on what the coalition government has already been promising. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2007-02-27,"—This evening I rise to pay tribute to the late Tom Leggett, who died suddenly a few weeks ago. I would like to acknowledge the presence in the gallery this evening of Tom’s widow, Doreen, and his son, Brendan.
It was my honour to speak at Tom’s funeral at All Saints Anglican Church in Parramatta on 29 January where many had gathered to remember and celebrate the life of a man whom so many held in the highest regard. Indeed, as a testimony to the respect in which Tom was held, I read a message on behalf of the Prime Minister, the Hon. John Howard MP, in which he paid tribute to the loyalty and contribution that Tom Leggett had given to the Liberal Party.
Thomas William Leggett was born on 31 December 1939 at Barnsley in New South Wales. Tom had a very interesting childhood growing up in the Newcastle area—an area dominated by Labor-union politics from the nearby steelworks and surrounding coalmines within the area. Having myself grown up in the industrial heartland of the Illawarra, I understand well the environment of past union domination of areas such as Newcastle and Wollongong.
Following his parents’ separation, Tom and his brother moved to Goulburn where they lived at the then Goulburn Boys Home, now Gill Memorial Hostel and nursing home. Tom regularly took part in the local Salvation Army band, marching down the main street of Goulburn every Sunday. It must account for his musical interest.
Tom started his working life at the age of 15, having the choice of becoming a mechanic or working for the Commonwealth Bank. Tom chose the Commonwealth Bank, where he worked for almost 40 years, giving dedicated service. During that time, Tom undertook various activities, including running a variety of branches and also moving into lending and repossessions.
Tom’s early life had not been easy. He learnt valuable lessons. He well understood the ethic of hard work, dedication and commitment. It was the very essence of the man.
Tom was called up in 1959 to undertake national service. He was sent to Wacol in Queensland and then served in the Citizen Military Forces, now the Reserve. Tom was a traditionalist who respected the institutions that are important to our country: our flag, our constitutional monarchy and our military traditions. It was pleasing to see Tom’s national service recognised at his funeral service through the participation of the Parramatta RSL Sub-Branch, of which he had been a member.
Tom also enjoyed travelling. During his younger years his travels included working on a kibbutz near the Golan Heights in the late 1960s. I understand he also was one of the first foreign tourists to travel on the Trans-Siberian Railway into the then Soviet Union.
It was during the early 1990s that Tom, through his work involving repossessions, saw firsthand the impact of the Keating years. Tom vividly understood the pressures and mess that Labor’s recession placed on Australian families and small businesses. He saw daily the impact that high interest rates of up to 17 per cent for homeowners and 22 per cent for businesses, coupled with record high unemployment, had on a cross-section of Australians. These daily experiences moved Tom’s support towards the Liberal Party. He always reminded people of the high interest rates Australians had to face under ‘the recession we had to have’. Brendan has told me that Tom also enjoyed helping our youth gain their first jobs. One of the things that ended Tom’s support for Labor was when Paul Keating said to a young Australian, ‘Go and get a job.’ The high youth unemployment at the time meant that there were few jobs for young people.
Tom joined and began his support for the Liberal Party during the 1996 election campaign. He continued his support until his passing. Indeed, Tom was a true Liberal stalwart. He was a dedicated Liberal who served the party with loyalty. His first commitment was to the Liberal Party. But it was in the seat of Parramatta that Tom made his greatest contribution. Elected as the Parramatta Federal Electorate Conference President in 1998, he faced the challenge of a redistribution which saw the federal seat of Parramatta become notionally 3.5 per cent to Labor. Tom took up the challenge. He knew that the Liberals could win. He was a great role model for his team. Tom related the story that on election night 2001 the first call made by the Prime Minister was to Ross Cameron. I am told that Tom was very proudly standing by when that call came in. Prior to his death, Tom was getting ready for the next battle, the 2007 election. He and I spoke recently of this and of his confidence that the Liberals could win back the seat of Parramatta at the next election. Tom’s optimism was constant.
Tom was a good leader in the good times and in the bad times. At the last election, he and the Parramatta conference faced great challenges. Tom led his team under great difficulties and pressures. His commitment was always to do the best possible for the Liberal Party. His concern was not only his own area. He was always there to lend a hand to the surrounding hard luck state and federal Labor areas. Liberal candidates and supporters in these areas did it tough and were grateful for the support that Tom and his team were willing to give. With an office in Wollongong, I well understand the gruelling nature of political life in hard luck seats, but this is changing and people like Tom, who are prepared to lend a hand, help foster that change.
Tom was always there when hard work needed to be done. He led his team by example. Tom, however, could not have done what he did without the support of Doreen and Brendan. The Leggetts were always there as a family. Tom was a strong believer in family values. They were so very generous in so many ways. They opened up their home so often for Christmas functions and fundraising activities, and did so as a family. I am sure that Tom’s memory will live on in future gatherings. Indeed, the Parramatta Federal Electorate Conference was the Leggetts’ extended family, and many in the Liberal Party will remember fondly the great times that were had at the Leggett home.
Tom was a great talker. He always had a story to tell. He loved to have a chat. Having been a bank manager for so many years, he knew many people. He knew so many stories about many interesting people. It made for interesting listening.
Tom understood the diversity of Parramatta. He knew his area well. He understood its aspiration. When I first met Tom, he and I spoke of my family’s migrant history. Tom understood what many migrants to this country faced. He was able to relate to my family story. Through the bank, he had helped many migrants get a start for their families. He understood their aspiration and their commitment to Australian values and building a better life for themselves and their children. Tom embraced this diversity because he understood its underlying commitment. The diversity of the Parramatta conference is a testimony to this understanding.
He was especially proud of his son, Brendan. Tom would often tell us what Brendan had been up to: his success at university, his great work at SWR FM 99.9, a community radio broadcasting station in the Blacktown area, as well as his achievements in the party and in the Young Liberals. I would like to pay tribute to the courage that Doreen and Brendan have shown at the sudden loss of Tom—it was a shock to everyone who knew him. I pay particular tribute to his wife, Doreen, who faced the difficulties of actually being there. Doreen, your professional training as a nurse and experience in that field demonstrates your strength of character.
Tom enjoyed respect across the party. He gave respect and he received respect. He was well liked and will be missed by many. Tom was always active in community service, including community activities on the Parramatta Traffic Committee and serving on the Baulkham Hills Shire Council’s Orange Blossom Festival. He was always willing to lend a hand.
Tom, those of us in the Liberal Party who share your mainstream Liberal values will especially miss you. We will miss your warmth, understanding, willingness to help, dedication to the cause, guidance and great stories. I am sure I speak for many in the Liberal Party in paying tribute to a good man and a good Liberal. Tom, may you rest in peace.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Mr Thomas William Leggett</title>,Adjournment,26,1
