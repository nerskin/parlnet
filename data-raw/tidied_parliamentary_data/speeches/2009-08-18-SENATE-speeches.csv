"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2009-08-18,"—I move Greens amendment (4) that was circulated in the chamber yesterday:
(4)    Schedule 1, item 5, page 5 (after line 28), at the end of section 19‑38, add:
Report on consultations
         (9)    Each higher education provider must, as soon as practicable after 31 December each year, prepare and publish a report detailing the consultation which occurred during that year between the provider, its students and its student organisations in relation to the level of the fee, collection of the fee and expenditure of amounts paid.
       (10)    Each higher education provider must provide to the department a copy of each report prepared under subsection (9).
       (11)    The department must publish on its website a copy of each report received under subsection (10) in a form which allows ready comparison between the reports of different higher education providers.
This amendment seeks, as the previous one did, to ensure that we have accountability in how the money is being spent and that the $250 that will be collected from each student, if this legislation were to pass, is accounted for and spent in consultation with student organisations, student representatives and students. This will ensure that there is some element of transparency and accountability by requiring universities to show how they have involved students in deciding how the universities will spend their money.
We know that already the government’s legislation does not give the money that students are handing over directly to their student organisations. We know that the universities will have the discretion to spend the money on the services that they see fit but we believe that there needs to be a built-in mechanism which allows universities to discuss and decide collectively with their student populous how this money is spent. This amendment goes to the issue of compliance—and ensuring that universities comply and show that they comply. We need to make sure we have transparency and accountability.
I spoke last night about how I was surprised that the coalition did not support my previous amendment, which called for building a solid accountability measure within this legislation. This is the next step: to ensure that universities are required to speak with their students about how they are going to spend their students’ money. $250 is a lot of money if you are a university student. It is a lot of money if you are not. We need to ensure that students have an element of say in how this money is going to be spent and this amendment ensures that universities have to report on how they have included students in decisions about how their money is spent.
It is not good enough just to leave it to good will and assume that it will happen. We need to ensure we have accountability and transparency just as there is in the approach that the government is taking on a variety of other different educational transformations and policy directions of late—whether we are talking about schools or other elements of the Higher Education Support Act. This amendment is building in an accountability and transparency mechanism to ensure that universities show how they have involved students and consulted with students before they go and spend their money and throughout the process.",SENATE,"<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STUDENT SERVICES AND AMENITIES, AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>",<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2009-08-18,"—Can I again thank Senator Hanson-Young for her amendment. I think it is sensible and she should be congratulated for putting forward accountability mechanisms in any legislation. Senator, perhaps in future we might better coordinate our efforts. While I do not see any serious objections to this amendment, it does not overcome the serious deficiencies that opposition senators have outlined so the opposition will be opposing this amendment.",SENATE,"<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STUDENT SERVICES AND AMENITIES, AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>",<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2009-08-18,"—The government is providing the Greens senators with a letter similar to that that has been provided to Senator Xenophon outlining the measures that will be covered in the guidelines in terms of the accountability mechanisms. I understand that is on its way and I trust it will satisfy the requests that have been made of the government in regard to assurances on the accountability mechanisms. As a consequence, in the view of the government this amendment is not necessary, and we will not be supporting it.
Question negatived.
—The question now is that the bill, as amended, be agreed to.",SENATE,"<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STUDENT SERVICES AND AMENITIES, AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>",<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2009-08-18,"—I have several questions for the minister. Can I first of all thank you, Minister, and in particular Ms Ellis, Minister for Early Childhood Education, Childcare and Youth and Minister for Sport, for her letter to Senator Xenophon. That does address many of the issues I was going to raise, so I want to thank the government for that. I appreciate getting a copy of that letter, but I have some other questions.
With respect to the student services and amenities fee guidelines, part (m) talks about student media. I wanted to know whether it is prohibited by the guidelines for a student newspaper to endorse a political candidate or a political party within the student media.",SENATE,"<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STUDENT SERVICES AND AMENITIES, AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>",<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2009-08-18,—So in fact student money that has been compulsorily acquired from other students can be used for political purposes?,SENATE,"<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STUDENT SERVICES AND AMENITIES, AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>",<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2009-08-18,"—Senator, given the extraordinarily narrow view of politics that has been expressed by coalition senators, I would have thought that you would regard just about any matter as non-political; therefore, it could be said that there is no question that student newspapers would cover political questions in that manner. The fact remains that students are entitled to publish newspapers and they are entitled to express views; it is, in fact, an important part of the education process to debate matters. I really think whether you regard them as politically acceptable or not is a question for your party to resolve amongst yourselves. As far as the government is concerned, we are not in the business of censoring student newspapers when it comes to the expression of student opinions which are expressed lawfully and which obviously meet the normal requirements that one would expect in terms of publishing.",SENATE,"<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STUDENT SERVICES AND AMENITIES, AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>",<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2009-08-18,"—Minister, thank you for that, but perhaps I did not make myself clear. I was not talking about political causes. Both the legislation and the guidelines themselves explicitly prohibit student money being used for a political candidate or a political party. Let us forget political causes for a second. The explicit prohibitions in the act and the guidelines are for political candidates or political parties. Is it prohibited under the guidelines for student newspapers, funded by compulsory levies on students, to explicitly endorse a political candidate or a political party?",SENATE,"<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STUDENT SERVICES AND AMENITIES, AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>",<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2009-08-18,"—Clause 19-38 of the act, sorry, of the bill—I trust it will be an act, but we may be about to discover that that is a forlorn hope—says:
(1) A higher education provider must not spend an amount paid to the provider as a *student services and amenities fee to support:
(a) a political party; or
(b) the election of a person as a member of:
(i) the legislature of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; or
(ii) a local government body.",SENATE,"<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STUDENT SERVICES AND AMENITIES, AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>",<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2009-08-18,"—I take it from that that in fact student newspapers cannot be used to specifically endorse a political candidate or a political party. I am not talking about political causes here; I am talking about political parties or political candidates explicitly.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2009-08-18,"—Senator, I must say to you I find it hard to believe that you would expect the parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia to pass legislation prohibiting the expression of opinions in student newspapers.

Surely it is not the purpose of this parliament to ban people expressing their opinions.",SENATE,"<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STUDENT SERVICES AND AMENITIES, AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>",<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2009-08-18,"—I take it from that, Minister, if that is your answer, that money compulsorily acquired from students and used by student newspapers can in fact be used to endorse a political party or a political candidate—yes or no, Minister, please.",SENATE,"<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STUDENT SERVICES AND AMENITIES, AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>",<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2009-08-18,"—The world is a bit more complicated a place than Senator Mason obviously appears to acknowledge. All I can do is draw his attention to 19-38. I have read out clause (1); let me go to clause (2):
If a higher education provider pays a person or organisation an amount paid to the provider as a *student services and amenities fee, the provider must make the payment on the condition that none of the payment is to be spent by the person or organisation to support:
a political party; or
the election of a person as a member of:
the legislature of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; or
a local government body.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2009-08-18,"—I know I am not a very good lawyer, Minister, but I still cannot follow your answer. But perhaps for the sake of my and the Senate’s sanity I might ask a different question. Let us say that money is given to a student guild from a university to run a coffee shop. If the coffee shop makes money can the student union use those profits in any way they want? In other words are the profits of that coffee shop subject to the bill and the guidelines?",SENATE,"<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STUDENT SERVICES AND AMENITIES, AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>",<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2009-08-18,"—Senator Mason, it is my expectation that the private income of entities that function on university campuses, be they businesses or individuals for that matter, would not be the subject of this legislation. It is not our intention to ban people who are members of the Labor Party, the Liberal Party or any other party from buying a cup of coffee at a university, nor in any way seek to undermine a legitimate process for a business or an individual to function at a university. The proposition that you are putting to me, as I understand it, is that, if there are receipts from a legitimate business, we are to regulate those receipts and the purpose for which those receipts are to be spent. I think that is far beyond any possible interpretation of this bill.",SENATE,"<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STUDENT SERVICES AND AMENITIES, AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>",<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2009-08-18,"—Thank you for that, and I take that to mean that, if a coffee shop that has been provided with funds compulsorily acquired from students makes a profit of $20,000 in a year, that $20,000 can be used for any purposes, whether they are political purposes, political candidates or whatever. That is what I understand your answer to mean, and is that correct?",SENATE,"<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STUDENT SERVICES AND AMENITIES, AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>",<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2009-08-18,"—Senator, I cannot add anything to what I have already put to you. It is a nonsensical proposition that you are now seeking for the Commonwealth parliament to control the legitimate incomes of businesses or individuals at universities. Senator, I would not have thought that the taxation act distinguished between students and other citizens in this country in terms of income in that way. Why should this particular legislation do the same, or do as I think you are suggesting?",SENATE,"<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STUDENT SERVICES AND AMENITIES, AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>",<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2009-08-18,"—I would like to speak on a separate matter. I have a letter from the Minister for Early Childhood Education, Childcare and Youth, Kate Ellis, in relation to the arrangements and agreements that we have been able to come to, and I seek leave to table that document.
Leave granted.
—I indicate that, based on these arrangements and some amendments to the guidelines, the Greens would be happy to support the legislation. The minister and the government have taken on board the issues in relation to the need for compliance, accountability and transparency. While we would have liked to have seen something specific, the minister has outlined that there will be the need for higher education providers to sign-off on a compliance certificate at the end of each financial year, outlining exactly where student money has been spent and providing a balance sheet. This will ensure that students can see where their money is being spent and then advocate whether they have any concerns about that to their institution.
We were obviously very concerned that higher education providers would simply decide where and when they believed advocacy and representation was important, and that they could pick and choose certain groups. We were very concerned that there was no explicit mention of the three broad groups of students who all have various different needs, that there was a need to ensure that any welfare and support services covered them and that this money gets spent in ways that support them. They are, of course, undergraduate, postgraduate and international students. The minister has taken those issues on board and has amended the guidelines to reflect that, including ensuring that we have the election of student representatives from those three separate groups, which is very, very important to ensure that international students and postgraduate students have elected representative voices, as do undergraduate students. It was very important for us to ensure that none of these groups, who are all going to be paying the money, were left out. They have different needs and we need to ensure that they have the opportunity to voice their concerns and advocate for their different needs and issues. I thank the minister and the government, and I hope that that letter has now been circulated.",SENATE,"<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STUDENT SERVICES AND AMENITIES, AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>",<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2009-08-18,"—I thank Senator Hanson-Young for her contribution because accountability in this context is important and I would like to thank the government for providing the note from Ms Ellis, Minister for Early Childhood Education, Childcare and Youth. In the second paragraph it says that section 22-15 of the act empowers the minister to revoke a body’s approval as a higher education provider. If the minister is satisfied that the body has breached a quality and accountability requirement then it is appropriate to revoke the approval. I thank the government for providing that. That accountability goes from the minister to the university and that is the relationship that is being discussed there. Minister, my concern is: has the government any proposals about overseeing the relationship between the university and the student? By that I mean: is the government going to set any guidelines or templates for an appeals process for students who are concerned about higher education providers not doing the right thing with their compulsorily acquired money?",SENATE,"<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STUDENT SERVICES AND AMENITIES, AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>",<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2009-08-18,"—Senator Mason, the arrangements as outlined by the government are essentially a relationship between the Commonwealth and the university as an institution. The university is required to certify that it has met its obligations under legislation enacted which authorises the payment of moneys. Those principles apply whether it is in a research area, a teaching area or any other areas in which the grants are made by the Commonwealth to the university as an institution.
The regulation of individual student behaviour is a matter for the university—they have to sign off that there has been compliance. It is not the Commonwealth’s role to establish the behaviour of individual students. Nearly a million people are enrolled in universities in any given year across the country, and that has been increasing for some time. The Commonwealth does not seek and has never sought, in my long involvement in this industry, to identify a personal relationship with each of those students other than through the HECS arrangements that are made and any other contractual arrangements between the Commonwealth and those students, through the taxation system. It would be inappropriate for that pattern to be changed in this legislation. The relationship is between the Commonwealth and the institution.",SENATE,"<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STUDENT SERVICES AND AMENITIES, AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>",<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2009-08-18,"—Thanks, Minister. If the Commonwealth, then, is not mandating any process for student engagement with universities, how can we be certain that students will be looked after and that there will be some appeals process, such that they can be assured their concerns about the expenditure of their money will be looked after?",SENATE,"<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STUDENT SERVICES AND AMENITIES, AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>",<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2009-08-18,"—Senator, I am sure you are aware that the constitutional relationship between the Commonwealth and universities is a quite complex matter. They are technically state institutions, they are regulated by state parliaments, but the expenditure of Commonwealth money is covered by measures that are regulated by Commonwealth legislation. The Commonwealth does not seek to establish a relationship between the university and individual students other than for those purposes for which the Commonwealth has appropriated money. That is effectively the basis upon which that discussion is held. The Commonwealth is now moving, through the reform measures, to broaden the level of engagement with the university system, consistent with the fact that these are state institutions enacted by state legislature. We have no intention to change that particular matter.
The fact remains that, with regard to all of those verification processes, the arrangement is between the Commonwealth and the institution—the vice-chancellor or whoever it happens to be. The authorised officer signs off, verifies, that Commonwealth moneys that have been expended in that university are in accordance with the arrangements made with the Commonwealth. If there are students who have complaints about the expenditure—for instance, regarding my area, people have written to me about the award of an Australian postgraduate award, as to whether they have been properly treated—that is effectively a matter for the university. The relationship is with the university in terms of the actual administrative arrangements for those awards. If there are broader complaints, and we are looking at these issues, in terms of accreditation arrangements—this is part of the Bradley reforms that have been proposed; in my case there are questions that we are exploring with the universities about research misconduct—a series of measures are changing that relationship, but those relationships are governed by the legislative framework passed by the parliament to this point.",SENATE,"<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STUDENT SERVICES AND AMENITIES, AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>",<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2009-08-18,"—Minister, again I thank you for your answer. In a sense you have outlined the problem. If the relationship is between the Commonwealth government and the universities, and if a university is doing the wrong thing—spending money inappropriately, giving it to political causes—what does the student do? What process does he or she undertake if no processes have been designed by their particular university? What do they do? Write to the minister?",SENATE,"<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STUDENT SERVICES AND AMENITIES, AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>",<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2009-08-18,"—Invariably they will. Even some members of the Liberal Party might do that. May I even be so bold as to suggest they might engage in a political process to complain about what is happening with the expenditure of public money. I know that is a shocking revelation to you.
—Not with someone else’s money.
—I have heard that members of the Liberal Party do engage in a political process at universities. I have heard that has been going on for some time. So maybe you should go back to the Liberal Party branches that are obviously giving you such difficulty on this issue and draw their attention to the way things actually work at universities. We are seeking to provide a framework to support student services, amenities, representation and advocacy for students at universities. That is essentially what this bill seeks to do. I know you have a view that we as a parliament should regulate the behaviour of students at universities. While in government, you sought to establish a series of protocols about the behaviours of university administrators and university academics—
—You supported it for a time.
—No, no. Previous ministers sought to engage in direct interventions with regard to which research projects were undertaken, the behaviour undertaken by students and what universities spent their money on. You did this under the guise of Work Choices; you did this under the guise of a number of other moral crusades that you sought to perpetuate and for your narrow, base political motives. We are not going to be a party to it. We are about ensuring that institutions are able to be run properly and that we understand the importance of universities. As Minister Gillard pointed out, we take the foot off the throats of universities. What you are seeking to do is to reimpose that Commonwealth boot onto the throats of universities.",SENATE,"<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STUDENT SERVICES AND AMENITIES, AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>",<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2009-08-18,"—Minister, what I am trying to do is ensure that a student who is aggrieved, who has had their money compulsorily acquired, has some process by which they can ensure universities do the right thing. Your response here this afternoon is that no student can be certain that that is going to happen, and that is a great disappointment and a failing of the bill.
Moving on to another question, let us assume, Minister, that student money is given to the Wilderness Society. It could happen in one of three ways: either directly from the university, from the student guild or it could come via a student club funded by the guild or university. Would this be prohibited by the guidelines?",SENATE,"<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STUDENT SERVICES AND AMENITIES, AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>",<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1

Allowable uses of the fee in relation to services and amenities may include the categories listed below. In all cases the purpose would include but not be limited to,—
in other words, that list is not exhaustive—
the direct provision of the service or amenity, the provision of infrastructure (including new construction) and subsidies that would reduce the price that students may have to pay.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2009-08-18,"—Yesterday, when I moved a motion in the Senate that the renewable energy target legislation be given precedence over other legislation when it came from the House of Representatives, it was defeated by both major parties. However, the government gave me to understand that they voted against it not because it would not be given precedence but because they would not have the Senate determine what the Senate’s order of business would be; they were determined to have that carriage themselves and they intended to bring on the renewable energy target.
Now I find that, with this rearrangement of business, we will not be dealing with the renewable energy target legislation, even though it has been through the House of Representatives. I would like to know from the government why they continue to play politics with renewable energy when they know there is a whole industry out there waiting for this legislation.

If the rearrangement of business is because the messages are coming through from the House later, that is a matter, I submit, for the government. I have been in here long enough to know that messages from the House can come through very quickly or they can come through very slowly. I know that some very important amendments to the renewable energy legislation are going to be proposed which are going to require studious debate by the Senate, and the government is now putting the debate off till later to force the debate to be truncated.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2009-08-18,"—Today we are debating the second significant attack by the Rudd government on our health system through the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2009 and related bills. It is an attack on our health system that will hurt millions of Australians who are privately insured, but it will also hurt those Australians who will have to compete with more people seeking access to our already overburdened public hospital system. It is another broken promise of the Rudd government. Despite the most emphatic pre-election commitments, despite the most solemn pledge by the Prime Minister and by the Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, before the last election, here we are debating a proposal to reduce or scrap altogether private health insurance rebates.
It is the government’s second strike in two budgets against the important private health component of our mixed public and private health system. We are quite concerned, as I am sure the 11 million privately insured Australians are concerned, about what we will be debating this time next year—if the Rudd Labor government is courageous enough to take us to a third Rudd government budget, that is.
Before the last election we were promised the world on health. Labor were going to fix public hospitals and, if there had not been enough progress made by the middle of 2009, a proposal would go to the Australian people that the Commonwealth take over the running of public hospitals. We were promised the world. The buck was going to stop with the Prime Minister. All we have had is a bad, old-fashioned Labor crusade against privately insured Australians—against Australians who do the right thing by our health system by putting additional, private resources into it. All we have had is a bad, old-fashioned Labor crusade against private health. All we have had on public hospitals is a review, a 20-month review into public hospitals—and now there is going to be a review of the review—and we have had a tax. That is all we have had on health from this government.
This government has been a failure on health; I have said it before. This minister has been a failure as health minister. There has been no progress made in terms of the running of our public hospitals since this government was elected. In fact, the situation is now worse. Measures like those contained in these bills, rather than putting less pressure on public hospitals, will put more pressure on public hospitals. I think that everybody understands that.
The overarching health policy objective ought to be that as policymakers we ensure that all Australians have affordable and timely access to quality hospital care. The best way to achieve that is through a well-balanced health system—one with a strong and well-funded public system and a strong and well-supported private system. Those on the other side know well that, after 13 years of Labor the last time they were in government, our health system was seriously out of balance. Private health insurance membership was plummeting. There were significant public hospital waiting times. There were significant pressures on public hospitals, but private hospitals were underutilised. There were serious issues in our health system when we came into government in 1996. Health insurance membership continued to plummet for a further two years after we got into government because of the flow-on consequences of bad health policy throughout 13 years of Labor.
It took two years before we were able to turn things around through very sensible health policy measures like the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate, the Medicare levy surcharge and Lifetime Health Cover. Since private health insurance bottomed out at 5.7 million in December 1998, it has increased by a staggering four million Australians, who are putting additional resources into our health system, taking it up to 9.7 million Australians.
We have had some discussion today about what is happening with private health insurance membership now. We have a government that is very good at spin but not so good at substance. We have a Minister for Health and Ageing who is very good at being a propaganda minister for Treasury but not quite as good at assessing the flow-on consequences of her actions and those of her government. So let us just have a look beyond the headlines and assess what is actually happening in terms of private health insurance membership across Australia today.
The first point to make is that, irrespective of the figures that are being quoted today and that the minister is waving around, the growth in private health insurance membership has already slowed down. If you look at membership trends in the last few years of the Howard government, we had increases of 400,000 additional privately insured Australians in the lead-up to June 2008, for example. This year it has gone down to 200,000. But, furthermore, the population has actually increased over that same period. If you look at the real target, the meaningful target, the proportion of the population who are privately insured, it has started to stagnate under this government at 44.6 per cent. It has already started to stagnate and of course we know that the Rudd government expects private health insurance membership to go down over the first term of its government. If you look at the budget papers, there is a figure there now indicating that 9.7 million Australians are expected to be privately insured throughout the term of this government, but of course in the context of population increases that means that the Rudd government themselves expect the proportion of the population with private health insurance to go down. It is something that they have hidden in the fine print of the budget papers by removing the reference that has been there for many, many years to the percentage rather than the absolute numbers of Australians with private health insurance.
This is a bad public policy because it will put more pressure on public hospitals. It will result in an immediate increase in the cost of private health insurance for those in those income brackets that are being targeted by the government and it will result in fewer people with private health insurance. There is no argument between the opposition and the government that that will be the outcome. The government agrees that this will lead to more pressure on public hospitals. The government agrees that this will result in an immediate increase in the cost of private health insurance and the government agrees that it will result in fewer people with private health insurance. The argument between the government and the opposition, and indeed between the government and stakeholders, is about how much more pressure, how much additional cost, and how many people will end up leaving private health insurance.
Just talking again, very quickly, about the number of people expected to leave the private health system, this is of course the second strike against private health under this government. Last year we had the Medicare levy surcharge change, which the government said would result in 492,000 fewer Australians in private health insurance as a result of that measure. I put it to you that Treasury got it right: 492,000 fewer Australians will have private health insurance as a result of that measure. That does not mean a drop of 492,000 compared to the number of privately insured at that time; it means that 492,000 fewer Australians have private health insurance than would otherwise have been the case. When we were investigating and inquiring into this measure during Senate estimates and the inquiry, both the health department and the Treasury confirmed that they stand by those figures. The government’s budget savings are based on nearly half a million fewer Australians being in private health insurance than would otherwise be the case. And that is of course very relevant when we assess the flow-on implications. The reality is that the more people who take out private health insurance over the long term, the more affordable it is for everyone and the more private resources are of course channelled into our health system.
Labor has form on this, of course. We saw during the Hawke-Keating years that private health insurance membership plummeted from 63 per cent down to about 30 per cent before the Howard government was able to turn things around. But before the last election Labor said: ‘We have learned. We are not going to make that mistake again. We have learned our lesson. We now support private health insurance and we will not make any changes to the private health insurance framework.’ As Senator Cory Bernardi said, the Australian people have been deceived by this government. In fact the Prime Minister, as the then Leader of the Opposition, wrote to the Australian Health Insurance Association on 20 November, a couple of days before the election—and no doubt because he thought that it was politically important for him to do so—and said:
Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per rebates for older Australians.
Et cetera, et cetera. Now, after the election—and this just shows how dishonest this government is with the Australian people—on 24 February this year the health minister was confronted with some media inquiries by the Age, asking: ‘What are you doing? Are there some plans afoot within government about changing the private health insurance rebate?’ And this is what the Minister for Health and Ageing said on 24 February:
The government is firmly committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates.
So everybody out there was reassured.
What do we find out in estimates a couple of months later? That on 12 January 2009 the Minister for Health and Ageing was getting advice from her department on how to reduce or scrap the rebates and she was out there a month and a half later telling the Australian people that all was fine, that the government remained committed, that there was not going to be any change. This is how this government treats the Australian people. They are pursuing bad policy. They are doing it behind closed doors. They were making commitments before the election and they were reaffirming them after the election, while all the while they were making disastrous policy changes to our health system behind closed doors. Mr President, I might continue after question time.
—It’s all right. Senator Cormann, you can keep going.
—I can see that people on the other side are really interested in my contribution to this debate so I will keep on going.
—We want more!
—Senator Evans may like to hear that as a direct result of this broken promise, the cost of private health insurance will go up by up to 66.7 per cent immediately. Why is that good public policy on health—that is the question I would ask. The government says that about 40,000 people will leave private health insurance as a result of this measure. There is debate on this, but let us just take their word for it. Let us say that it is 40,000 people that will leave private health insurance as a result of this measure. What does this mean for our public hospitals? It means that there are more people who will present at public hospitals that are already under pressure.
And of course we still have the flow-on consequences of last year’s measure. I asked some questions during the inquiry about how this figure was arrived at, which the minister has mentioned, of 8,000 additional public hospital episodes. I was told that 35 per cent of the 25,000 people will drop private hospital insurance—that is 8,750 additional admissions, presumably. The minister is not very good at her maths. She will not ever make it to be the Treasurer. She might be propaganda minister for Treasury but she will never make it to be the Treasurer.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2009-08-18,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Climate Change and Water (Senator Wong) to a question without notice asked by Senator Fierravanti-Wells today relating to the proposed emissions trading scheme and the steel industry.
I particularly refer to the steel industry and Labor’s flawed CPRS. As I have spoken about in this chamber earlier this week, my concern is about the impact of the CPRS on jobs, the economy and in particular the regions. As an Illawarra based senator, I can say that the steel industry is crucial not only to the Illawarra but to the exports of our country as a whole. I am particularly concerned that the steel industry in the Illawarra and in other places supports thousands of jobs. Therefore, areas like the Illawarra will bear the brunt of Labor’s flawed CPRS. In my speech in this place on 12 August I highlighted the real concerns that Illawarra residents in particular have had, which have been articulated by BlueScope Steel. They identified that the Rudd government’s scheme threatened to erode tens of millions of dollars from their books within the first year and had the potential to threaten the viability of the 12,000 jobs that its operations support.
Might I remind senators, particularly those senators opposite, that this region has traditionally been their heartland. At a time when these jobs are very much at stake, many in the area are crying foul that the one-time party of the workers appears to have lost touch. But I will come back in a moment to some comments about that. Today’s headlines in the Illawarra Mercury compound the worst fears of those residents. Under the banner ‘BlueScope steeling for success’, Mr O’Malley is quoted. The article reads:
He also fired a salvo at the Rudd government, saying it needed to amend its contentious Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme or put at risk the 12,000 jobs in the Illawarra underpinned by BlueScope.
It is important to note that BlueScope is a very important company as far as our exports are concerned. I really have to acknowledge the efforts of the Illawarra Mercury in highlighting consistently the concerns of its residents, and in particular as far as the steel industry is concerned, about this scheme. A headline reads ‘O’Malley demands changes to carbon pollution scheme’. The article says:
BlueScope Steel yesterday called on the federal government to consider amendments to its proposed carbon scheme because of concerns over the future impact it would have on the Port Kembla steelworks. In the Illawarra 12,000 workers and their families rely on the steelworks.
I quoted portions of a press release in my questions to Senator Wong. BlueScope Steel has a proven track record as an environmentally responsible company. In a press release yesterday BlueScope cites investing $50 million on environmental improvements globally over the 15 years. Mr O’Malley says:
… the Directors have grave concerns about the current design of the Federal Government’s proposed CPRS and the negative impact it would have on the world competitive Australian steel industry.
The Company strongly believes that the cumulative net cost impact of the current design of the proposed CPRS would be highly significant and material, and that it would severely damage our competitiveness, putting domestic investment, Australian jobs and the Australian steel industry at … risk.
Mr O’Malley goes on:
This is not a one-off tax.
It is very clear. As one person—and I would like to requote this—recently commented in response to an article in the Illawarra Mercury this year:
Champagne socialists, the lot of them. They’re not the working person’s party anymore.
One only has to look at the comments of Jennie George in the House of Representatives on 3 June to know that the government berates us but that there are people on their side who are very concerned about jobs and the regional economies. (Time expired)

"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2009-08-18,"—I welcome the opportunity to respond on the issue of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in taking note of answers today. Those opposite spoke briefly last week about their Frontier Economics report—the plan you put forward when you do not have a plan; the plan that does not have agreement in their own party room. In fact, there appears to be very little that those opposite are agreed upon. They are divided on the issue of climate change, they are splintered on the issue of how to deal with it and they are shattered when it comes to credibility in addressing the challenges confronting the environment. It is fair to say that a report card for them would have recorded ‘Failed’ next to each one. But that does not deter them from standing up in this chamber and making a noise on environmental issues. For over a decade they were in government, and what did they do to address the crisis in the Murray-Darling Basin? What did they do to address the issue of carbon pollution? What was their response to signing Kyoto? What was their contribution to addressing the environmental issues, the damages compounded day by day? These questions could be answered by silence. But silence is difficult to record in Hansard, so in its place I will respond with one word: nothing. That is what those opposite did. They are naysayers—advocates of doing nothing, of waiting and seeing. What did they do last week in this chamber? Still divided on the existence of climate change, they voted down the government’s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.
These environmental problems—droughts, lack of water, carbon pollution—did not happen overnight. Damage to our rivers, the Great Barrier Reef, ecosystems—the list goes on—has been developing over time. Those opposite had 12 long years to address them, yet they have the nerve to come into this chamber and put questions to this government about the way that we are addressing these issues. The Rudd government was elected in November 2007. We went to the election with a commitment to the people of Australia—a commitment to address the issue of climate change. We were not going to be like those opposite and bury our heads in the eroding sand. Last week in this chamber, we put forward a piece of legislation that would go some way towards addressing this issue. But those opposite, after 12 years, are still divided and still undecided. So they voted the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme down.
The government’s primary objective in designing the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme has been to get the balance right—to set in place a scheme that reduces carbon pollution and supports economic growth. The government has listened to the views of all stakeholders very closely, including the views of the iron and steel industry, in developing and finalising the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Activities in iron and steel manufacturing have been identified as potentially eligible for emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries assistance under the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. They are currently undergoing a formal assessment to determine their eligibility.
The government understands that Australian businesses are currently dealing with the worst global recession since the Great Depression. In this environment, the government has acted further to support jobs and assist businesses by providing a global recession buffer as part of the assistance package for emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries for the first five years of the CPRS. This buffer will provide an additional five per cent of free permits for emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries activities eligible for 90 per cent assistance and an additional 10 per cent of free permits for the EITE activities eligible for 60 per cent assistance. Other measures, such as the delay in the start of the CPRS by one year and a one-year fixed price phase, will further help Australian companies manage the impact of the global recession.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Emissions Trading Scheme</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,9,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2009-08-18,"—Sometimes I think the Greens must have done a recruitment campaign and recruited a lot of the ALP. You would expect a speech like that from Senator Brown or any of the other Greens, but where is the Labor Party when it comes to defending the blue-collar worker? Where is it? We have never seen it. They have given up on it. It is not only the National and Liberal parties that are saying that. Jennie George, the member for Throsby—which is in a particularly relevant area—has said that this is not going to work. Chris Trevor, the member for Flynn, has written to say that the coal industry needs more support. The Treasurer of New South Wales has written to say that the CPRS will not work. The Premier of Queensland, Anna Bligh, has expressed her dissatisfaction with the CPRS. So not only is it the coalition but there is a break-out amongst the ALP hierarchy. Why wouldn’t they break out? They can see their blue-collar vote being eroded. They can see it going down the chute.
This is a wake-up call to every blue-collar worker: you have been deserted by your so-called political allies. They were your political allies but have now ceased to be your political allies. They have neglected you and walked away from you as they put your job on the line. Your job is under threat. Do not be under any illusion. Your job is under threat, and it is only the Liberal and National parties that are standing up for you. You have to realise that you have been sold out by the ALP.
We see it time and again. Here we have BlueScope fighting for survival with a $66 million loss. So what do we do? We put a tax on them—no, two taxes! The government put on an ETS tax and then they double it up with a tax under the renewable energy target. So BlueScope have two taxes put on them by the ALP. But it gets worse: because the ALP will not decouple the ETS from the RET, we find that the steel industry are left out when it comes to any benefits under an ETS that should have flowed across to the RET. They miss out on that too.
This is a disaster beyond all disasters. But it is not only a disaster for the steel industry; it is a disaster for all Australian manufacturing. We do not have a lot of Australian manufacturing left—a lot of it has gone offshore. But what we do have depends on low energy costs. That is why we have all our workers; otherwise, a lot more manufacturing would go overseas. But we are penalising our niche advantage, which is low energy costs. We are putting a charge on energy that is going to put the price up by 40 per cent, between the RET and an ETS. And then we expect people like BlueScope to be able to compete, when none of their competitors overseas have to meet these costs. They are not miracle men. They cannot create something out of nothing. In the papers today BlueScope are saying they have lost $66 million and they are going to lose more if an ETS comes in.
It is not only our manufacturing base that is affected; it is our mining industry, our aluminium industry, our primary industries—all of them are threatened under the CPRS. What are the Labor Party doing about it? Lecturing us on what our obligations are. Well, why don’t you let us start lecturing you on what your obligations are to your base? They are the blue-collar workers who put their hard-earned money towards supporting the Labor Party. They are paying $600 and $800 a year to support you, the ALP, and what are you doing? You are turning your backs on them and not giving them any support at all. You are going to destroy the steel industry, you are going to destroy the cement industry, you are going to destroy the coal industry—all these industries that have hundreds of thousands of jobs for blue-collar workers. But you do not care. You are going to support doctors’ wives. You are going to support those people but neglect your blue-collar base. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Emissions Trading Scheme</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,9,1
"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2009-08-18,"—I too would like to contribute to this debate today and take note of answers given by Senator Wong to questions from the opposition about the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. I cannot help but start by acknowledging Senator Boswell’s comments. I have to say, I think I have heard Senator Boswell’s speech before. Once again, I would like to point out that, despite his claim that the Labor Party has deserted blue-collar workers, it was his party that deserted blue-collar workers when they introduced the Work Choices legislation—and those workers of Australia handsomely repaid the now opposition for introducing Work Choices by in fact voting them out at the last federal election.
This is the second day this week that the opposition have asked Minister Wong questions about the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. That of course is the scheme that they voted down last Thursday when they voted against the legislation that would have set Australia on the path to reducing our carbon emissions. The legislation that we put before the parliament last week was for a CPRS that was responsible, including economically responsible, and measured, and that compensated emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries such as the steel industry, as indeed it contemplated compensating lower middle income households. Those two factors of the legislation they defeated never seemed to figure in the discussions the opposition had here in the chamber.
The CPRS was to have been but one of a range of measures introduced by the government to address climate change. As has been pointed out by previous speakers, one of the first things that the government did on coming to office was ratify the Kyoto protocol. We have also introduced a number of other measures to deal with climate change, which most of the opposition apparently still do not believe in. The evidence of that—that they do not believe in climate change—is apparent every day that they ask the minister questions about the CPRS.
Instead of assisting the nation to move to being a low-carbon-emission nation, which most of the rest of the developed world is attempting to do, this opposition simply comes up with a range of furphies and a fear campaign to try and justify its complete lack of a position on how to deal with the very real problem of climate change and carbon emissions. The range of furphies that they have come up with this week includes, once again, including agriculture in the ETS when of course, as has been pointed out, agriculture was not included in the legislation that they defeated last week. Yesterday, I think, we had questions about CPI increases arising from the implementation of an ETS. The government has already acknowledged that such bold and courageous legislation does not come without a cost; however, the government has a number of initiatives in place, as I previously discussed, to deal with that.
And today we had the steel industry and then border taxes as the latest furphies that the opposition have put on the table to try and cover up their complete lack of policy and their complete lack of direction on the single most important issue facing the Australian nation. I suppose that tomorrow they will ask some more questions, because they will probably still not have a position on it. It will be curious to see how it pans out with the renewable energy target legislation that the government wants to introduce as the next important phase of assisting the nation to address the problems of climate change and global warming.
Despite professing to be the party that represents business, the coalition have again demonstrated today in their questions during question time that they are not committed to supporting business, because they will not commit to the certainty that is needed in this country to address climate change for the future.

",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Emissions Trading Scheme</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,9,1
"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2009-08-18,"—Senator McEwen talks about furphies. She says that the coalition do not have a policy on emissions trading. We rejected the bill last week.
—Where is your policy?
—Is that policy enough for you? A no vote from the majority of the Senate, by the way—that is a policy if ever I saw one! And Senator Boswell, I should add: what a wonderful address he gave the chamber. He still has the passion. After 25 years in this chamber, he still has the passion, and this issue is one that raises the passion more than most. This is definitely an issue that goes to the top level. It ranks with native title and other very emotional issues.
But Senator McEwen and other previous speakers call our questions ‘furphies’. Yesterday she called our question on agriculture a ‘furphy’. That just shows that she has no concept and that the Labor Party has no concept at all of the knock-on effects of the emissions trading scheme on the rural sector. It is all there for them to see. The bells are ringing, the alarm bells are ringing: ‘Hello from earth, Senator Carr!’ The alarm bells are ringing with regard to the rural sector if the scheme goes through as it stands without an international agreement—is that policy enough for you? If the scheme goes through, dairy farmers will pay up to an extra $10,000 at the farm gate and that will break an already ailing dairy sector.
It is the same with the beef sector. Is it not enough today that BlueScope’s CEO rang the alarm bells? Isn’t it enough for you today that he said jobs will be lost? Where is your defence of the blue-collar workers? Senator Boswell was right: where is the defence of the blue-collar workers? To the credit of Jennie George, she has tried to alert those on the other side, but those on the other side are not interested in the blue-collar workers. They are not interested in the knock-on effects that the ETS scheme will have. They have got two interests in this. One is definitely the politics of it. They believe that maybe they can win an election on this. What they have missed, and you hear it from Penny Wong’s language—
—Order! You will refer to people by their correct title.
—Minister Wong, the ‘high priestess of climate change’, I once heard her called. You hear it in her language. It is the language of old. It is the language of some 12 months or so ago when extremism was the politics of the day. If science, or if anyone, dared question climate change, they were in fact burnt at the stake.
But what they have missed is that in the last 12 months the politics of this has changed dramatically. The public has started to wake up and they want a far more moderate approach to this. They want to know how this will affect their jobs and how this will affect the economy. You talk about science—hello, to earth, Senator Carr—and what is to be believed in science. Did you know, Senator Carr, that the Antarctic in fact is not shrinking at all, and that is a scientific fact which no-one denies? But Peter Garrett still gets out there and tells us—doom and gloom—that the Antarctic is shrinking and polar bears are falling off the edge. That sort of extremism is not happening and Minister Wong is still getting up in this chamber and using the old language of extremism. She has missed the political shift in all of this.
Government senators interjecting—
—We have a policy, do not worry about that, and, as I said before, our policy is that we voted it down. How much more of a policy could you get than that?
But I want to return to the issue of the day that we have raised, which you have just brushed aside—forget about the jobs in the steel industry. BlueScope has just reported a severe decline in its profit for the coming year, a 30 per cent reduction in the price of steel for future contracts. So they are facing hard times. You can talk about recovery but it will not be coming to BlueScope Steel for some time. The CEO alerts you, and it has been read out today, that one of the greatest risks to their viability—not profitability, viability and competitiveness internationally—is the ETS, and you just brush it aside because politics is No. 1 and the second one is the tax grab.
I know that Senator Forshaw and Senator Hutchins and a lot of those New South Wales politicians do not believe in the scheme that you are putting forward, but they do believe in the tax grab that is coming, and I believe that the Prime Minister has his eyes on it more than anything else. If you want to take this to an election, we are happy to fight on it.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2009-08-18,"—I have further information to add to an answer I gave to a question Senator Parry asked me during question time today, concerning the School Chaplaincy Program. Minister Gillard’s office advises that there is no review either underway or planned for the School Chaplaincy Program. Under the National School Chaplaincy Program, up to $165 billion over three years was made available to Australian school communities to assist in the provision of chaplaincy services. School communities were eligible to apply for up to $20,000 per annum to establish school chaplaincy services or to expand existing chaplaincy services.
The Australian government has confirmed that it will honour all funding commitments previously made under this program. Around 2,700 schools were granted funding under the two funding rounds of the program conducted in 2007. The previous government made it clear that no further rounds were planned beyond the two conducted in 2007.

—I move the motion as amended:
That the Senate:
notes that:
the government announced during Senate question time on 12 August 2009 that it remains committed to its $100 million budget cut to chemotherapy treatment,
the government repeated its assertion that it only wants to fund the ‘actual quantity’ of chemotherapy medicines that are delivered to cancer patients,
chemotherapy drugs are delivered in standard vial sizes, while different cancer patients, with different body weights and different physiological requirements will need different dosages of a particular life saving chemotherapy drug,
at times a portion of an opened vial will be left unused,
consistent with Therapeutic Goods Administration requirements any unused portion of an opened vial containing those dangerous chemotherapy drugs has to be discarded and will not be able to be used for any other patient,
unless there is a change in vial sizes, no change in government funding arrangements will be able to remove that inefficiency and somebody will have to pay for the $100 million budget cut,
this chemotherapy budget cut was part of both the 2008/09 and 2009/10 budgets with an original implementation date of 1 July 2009, deferred to 1 September 2009, and
the government still has not been able to come up with a sensible way to implement this ill-considered budget cut;
is concerned about the potential impact of this budget cut on cancer patients and considers that the ongoing uncertainty surrounding this measure has led to unnecessary concerns for cancer patients, their families and health care professionals involved in the preparation and use of chemotherapy drugs;
calls on the government to end the ongoing uncertainty as soon as possible; and

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-08-18,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the statement on Afghanistan.
This is a statement from the government, and in particular the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Stephen Smith, on Afghanistan and Pakistan. I want to take this opportunity to express the deep dismay that the Greens have with the recent promulgation of laws to do with women’s rights by Afghan President Hamid Karzai. We have our defence forces, good and true, in Afghanistan to bring a measure of democracy and human rights to the people of that country, who have been through decades—indeed, centuries—of turmoil. When one reads of President Karzai’s recent proclamation on the rights of women, one has to question the cause in which we put at risk the lives and wellbeing of our defence forces.
Having been internationally criticised for a move to invoke repressive laws on women in Afghanistan earlier this year, it turns out that just a couple of weeks ago President Karzai used a constitutional loophole, according to the Guardian newspaper from the United Kingdom, to enact a law that allows minority Shiite Muslim husbands to refuse food and money to their wives if they deny them sex. The law also prohibits a woman leaving a house without her husband’s permission and it also automatically gives guardianship, or control, of children to the husband and/or to the grandfather in any dispute between a husband and wife. Let me read from the Guardian:
The legislation, which governs many aspects of family life for Afghanistan’s Shiites, has been sparking controversy since Karzai signed an earlier version in March. Critics said the original legislation essentially legalized marital rape and Karzai quickly suspended enforcement after governments around the world condemned it as oppressive and a return to Taliban-era repression of women.
                         …                   …                   …
But the revised version, made public in July, riled activists all over again because many restrictive articles remained, including one that appears to give a husband the right to starve his wife if she refuses to have sex with him.
That is, she will be denied food and sustenance. Female parliamentarians said they thought they would get a chance to fight the revisions only to discover in recent days that Karzai had taken advantage of a legislative recess to approve the law by decree. Parliament has the right to examine and change the law when they reconvene, but the laws stay effective in the meantime.
What indeed is this parliament to make of this law? Are we to stay silent about this sort of barbaric legislation from the elected president of Afghanistan in what I can only take to be an affront to decency to a world that is putting a lot of people at risk of life and limb to come to the so-called assistance of Afghanistan?
The Greens position here is that Australian troops should be withdrawn from Afghanistan. That has been our position all along. At the outset, when Afghanistan was taken over by the US defence forces in the wake of the bombing of the buildings and the huge loss of life in America, we thought that after getting rid of the Taliban there would be the establishment there of a more enlightened society. However, President Bush, the chamber will remember, then withdrew the bulk of troops from Afghanistan to invade Iraq, and that allowed the Taliban to become re-established. Now with the Taliban growing in influence in Afghanistan we have President Karzai beating them to the punch with barbaric laws that have no place in civilised society.
I call upon the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister of this country, Kevin Rudd, to issue the greatest objection to President Karzai in Afghanistan and a demand for the withdrawal of this legislation. It will be said that we should not be intervening in the domestic law of another country. We have our troops in that country, and they are there fighting for liberty, democracy and decency. This legislation is an affront to all three of those things. I ask our government to take up this issue. I do not accept that silence is necessarily consent, but I want to know what the government is doing to have this law rescinded in Afghanistan. The polls indicate that President Karzai may well be re-elected. Indeed, commentators are pointing out that his action in passing this law was to placate some extremist and hateful clerics who wanted these laws brought in—in other words, to get their support.
But is that the Afghanistan we are fighting for? Are we asking Australians to put at risk life and limb—and are we asking their families see their loved ones going off to a very dangerous situation in Afghanistan—to uphold laws like this? I think not. It is a matter that we have to confront and debate. If Afghanistan is going to—whatever government is there—resort to these religious based laws which include extreme repression of women then so be it. If that is what the people of Afghanistan want—and I know there are many who do not want that, but if that is what the majority are voting for—then let us collectively debate the propriety of us putting our defence forces into a theatre of war to defend those laws and that particular regime, elected or otherwise, in Afghanistan. I pose that question to the coalition as well as to the opposition and to other crossbenchers. We cannot ignore this issue. We cannot just go quietly and say, ‘Oh, well, that’s a cultural difference between us and them.’
We are putting our troops into mortal danger in Afghanistan and all the reports are that that danger is increasing. Our soldiers are in some of the most dangerous circumstances. They are circumstances that other European countries—NATO countries, for example—will not allow their soldiers to enter into in Afghanistan. We have lost double figures in numbers of our soldiers already. How far is this to go, and in defence of what? I am motivated to get up and speak about this today because I find President Karzai’s behaviour totally unacceptable.
I put this question through this chamber to Prime Minister Rudd: what have you to say about this circumstance in Afghanistan? We need to know about the government’s thinking on this issue, and we need to know about what messages have been conveyed to President Karzai, not just after an election but in the run-up to this election, because he is thumbing his nose at the democracies which are putting so much into defending his position—let us be direct about this—as the elected President in Afghanistan. It is not good enough for us to be silent about it.

"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2009-08-18,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, I present the report of the committee Immigration detention in Australia: facilities, services and transparency. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I will at the outset indicate that I think Senators Hanson-Young and Bilyk were also wishing to speak on this report. It gives me great pleasure to stand here today on behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration to table the third and final report from the inquiry into immigration detention in Australia. Following the first report tabled in December last year, which was entitled Immigration detention in Australia: a new beginning—criteria for release from detention, and a second report tabled in early May this year entitled Immigration detention in Australia: community-based alternatives to detention, this final report focuses on the facilities, services and transparency of immigration detention in Australia. The report concludes the 15-month long inquiry into the criteria for immigration detention in our country and the alternative options available. During these 15 months the joint committee on migration has reviewed some 142 submissions, visited detention centres across the country and spoken with witnesses from all walks of life in order to gain a wide-ranging insight into Australia’s immigration detention policies. It was the aim of the committee to offer suggestions to the government to help shape the future of Australia’s immigration detention policy in a fairer, more efficient and humane way.
The first report of the committee made 18 recommendations which the committee believed would aid in improving accountability and ensuring a timely release from detention centres for detainees following health, security and identity checks. The second report had an additional 12 recommendations, which focused on upholding the safety and security of Australia’s borders while taking a humane approach to those people seeking protection in Australia. This final report comes with a further 11 recommendations. These address the preferred infrastructure options for contemporary immigration detention; the options for the provision of detention services and detention health services across the range of current detention facilities; and the options to expand the transparency and visibility of immigration detention centres.
One of the key recommendations from this report is recommendation 4, which recommends that detention in immigration residential housing should be used in lieu of detention centres should it be deemed feasible. After reviewing submissions and public hearings, the committee believes that, while secure detention will continue to play an important role in our immigration system, evidence suggests it is not necessary to keep those people who meet the criteria for release in secure detention while they await resolution of their immigration status. Placing detainees in immigration residential housing and immigration transit accommodation for the shortest time possible would complement the government’s intention to address the prompt resolution of an individual’s immigration status. This is in line with recommendations from the second report of the committee.
Additionally, the committee has serious concerns about the appearance of a number of detention centres. In fact, recommendations 1 to 3 and 5 of this report revolve around the infrastructure and aesthetics, or lack of aesthetics, of some of the detention centres. The committee had a number of concerns about some detention centres which look more like prisons: high security levels; a lack of access to fresh, clean air; limited access to outdoor exercise areas; little privacy; and, in some circumstances, very poor levels of cleanliness. The people who are seeking refuge in our country are not criminals and the majority have fled hardships and risked their lives in search of a better future. They should not be kept in prison-like environments.
Recommendation 1 of the report that the reconstruction of stage 1 at Villawood Detention Centre remains urgent and a priority of the committee would help in eradicating the prison-like appearance. The committee noted that the government has provided $186.7 million over the next five years to redevelop that detention centre. However, the committee noted that that time frame may need to be revised due to the current concerns regarding the state of the infrastructure and facilities. Similarly, the committee suggests in recommendation 2 that the proposed upgrades of the Perth detention facility commence immediately. Although the facilities in Perth are under limited lease arrangements, they are in dire need of urgent attention. The committee has agreed that the government should examine the long-term options with the intent to establish a purpose-built, long-term facility.
The intentions of most senators on this committee were to restore justice, dignity and certainty to the treatment of those people held in immigration detention in Australia. As at 17 July this year, there were 744 men and women still detained in immigration detention centres across the country and on Christmas Island. In line with restoring justice and dignity to these people, recommendations 3 and 5 are about reducing the extreme security measures currently in place. The use of razor wire or barbed wire, electrified fencing, caged walkways and perspex barriers are seen as excessive by the committee and are a disproportionate security measure. I note that the Christmas Island detention facility was built by the previous government as a high security establishment at a cost of some $400 million. The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has already taken measures to remove razor wire from all of Australia’s detention facilities except stage 1 at Villawood, which is a very welcome move.
The committee recommends in its report that it is in the best interests of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, as well as the general public, to increase the transparency of the immigration detention centres. Many media outlets are using old file footage of the immigration detention centres or using file footage of now closed detention centres for their images. Therefore, the committee has recommended that the provision of greater access to detention facilities is made available for the media. Furthermore, the committee has recommended that regularly updated information on the facilities, including statistics and detainee population, should appear on the department’s website.
Additionally, to aid in the greater transparency of our immigration detention centres, the committee has recommended that the Australian Human Rights Commission be granted a statutory right of access to all places of, and persons in, immigration detention in Australia. This will ensure that all facilities and the treatment of detainees is always as dignified and as humane as possible. That being said, the committee has suggested with recommendation 9 that the government maintain appropriate physical and mental health facilities at the Christmas Island detention centre, commensurate with the services provided at other immigration detention centres. Many of the submissions received by the committee raised concerns over the services available on Christmas Island, partially due to the geographical remoteness of the island. Some medical needs, as we know, cannot be met on the island whatsoever. Therefore, the committee has recommended the access to appropriate facilities to assist in the transparency of immigration detention in Australia.
Lastly, the remaining recommendations made by the committee are with regard to the department’s provision of services to detention centres. The committee makes several recommendations to encourage a full review of the current immigration detention service providers, to introduce mandatory and ongoing training programs for staff of the detention service providers and to make public the service standards of the immigration detention centres on the department’s website. It is hoped that with those measures the Department of Immigration and Citizenship will be able to increase the quality and effectiveness of the services that it provides to all immigrant detainees and achieve a high service standard across the board.
I conclude by thanking all of the witnesses to this inquiry, particularly the detainees themselves, their advocates and the departmental officials. I thank the committee secretariat and all of the senators and members of the joint committee who contributed to this inquiry in a very positive and meaningful way.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Migration Committee</title>,Committees,19,1
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2009-08-18,"—I rise to speak today on the motion to take note of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration’s third report into immigration detention, Immigration detention in Australia: facilities, services and transparency
. Can I say that the Greens are extremely disappointed that the majority report of the committee does not appropriately address, in our view, the major concerns outlined throughout the inquiry process; nor does it put forward adequate recommendations for change. I have in fact put in a dissenting report because of my major concerns with the committee’s majority report.
First and foremost, the issues of transparency and the provision of suitable and sufficient services cannot effectively be dealt with without questioning the appropriateness of the privatisation of detention services. A lot of the issues and concerns that were raised throughout the inquiry process come back to the ultimate issue of our detention facilities being run by private companies. Given that the majority of individuals and organisations that provided evidence to the committee highlighted concerns about the privatisation of detention services, the fact that the committee’s report fails to reflect on this with an actual recommendation is disappointing and clearly contravenes moves towards a more transparent and accountable immigration detention system.
The Rudd government’s recent announcement that it has signed new five-year contracts for immigration detention services with GSL and Serco is disappointing and strikingly at odds with its pre-election promises. The fact that there will be two different operators for detention centres, residential housing and transit accommodation also raises concern over how the private operators will communicate with one another and the department to ensure that transparency and quality of care are maintained. It is going to be very difficult, I believe, to have a successful transition between the immigration detention centres, the residential housing facilities and the transit accommodation. It is hard to believe that this, as well as the need to coordinate with the department, will result in good-quality care, when we know already that just dealing with one private operator and the department causes problems from time to time.
In the course of the inquiry we heard numerous concerns about using external, for-profit contractors to provide immigration detention services, particularly given that there have been many instances, according to A Just Australia, one of the witnesses, where arguments regarding responsibility for service delivery between the department and service delivery contractors have resulted in unacceptable living conditions for detained people. If the arguments already happen between one private operator and the department, I hate to think what will happen when negotiations are held between two separate private operators and the department. The fact is that both GSL and Serco have backgrounds in providing prison services. The Greens do not believe that this is an appropriate way to provide a service to those vulnerable refugees and asylum seekers who are currently found in detention centres. Outsourcing is not an appropriate way of handling their claims and providing care for those vulnerable people who seek our assistance and protection, particularly when some of the detention facilities are so far removed and remote from mainland Australia.
It is for this reason that the Greens have put forward two main recommendations on how we believe the immigration detention system can be made more transparent and accountable. Firstly, we have argued in our dissenting report that the government should return all immigration detention services to public control. Let me remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that that was a promise of the Labor Party before the election. Obviously, with the signing of the two new five-year contracts, that election promise has been broken. We believe that detention services need to be returned to public control, opening up a direct line of responsibility between the department, the minister and the immigration processes and services that occur in these detention facilities. Secondly, acknowledging that that election promise has been broken and that the government has just negotiated new five-year contracts, we believe that, at a minimum, the contracts must emphasise the need to put welfare outcomes ahead of security and compliance. We must ensure that the welfare concerns of vulnerable people, those people seeking asylum and our protection, are put ahead of security and compliance. We must ensure that no private operator with only a prison services background is awarded the contract in the future.
The Greens are also concerned that the report fails to include appropriate and detailed recommendations regarding infrastructure, the security features of immigration residential housing and immigration transit accommodation, and healthcare services. Concerns were continually raised throughout the 12-month inquiry relating specifically to the inappropriateness of housing children in residential housing facilities and the overuse of immigration transit accommodation. Various other concerns were raised, which Senator McEwen alluded to in her response to the report, about healthcare services. These have not, in the view of the Greens, been dealt with in the majority report.
With regard to Christmas Island, most notably, the committee heard evidence from many witnesses criticising the current excision policy, particularly due to the remoteness of the location, which undoubtedly limits access to sufficient healthcare facilities and resources for both island residents and detainees, and access to torture and trauma counselling. These are basic services that should be available at any facility that is housing asylum seekers and refugees, and yet there is no access to them at the remote location of Christmas Island. The committee heard overwhelming evidence from refugee advocates, lawyers and individuals calling for the need for drastic upgrading of the facilities on Christmas Island to at least bring them up to a standard comparable with that required of detention centres on the mainland. I acknowledge the recommendations relating to those issues in the majority report.
Concerns were also raised around the lack of community oversight that is available when dealing with excised territories. The directors of A Just Australia argued that with no community oversight or media scrutiny ‘there is the opportunity for extremely inhumane treatment of people’ when there is a lack of transparency in the operation of these services.
Despite our recognition for infrastructure change on Christmas Island the Greens believe that, due to the extraordinary level of security at the North West Point detention centre and the inappropriateness of detaining people there, the facility should be closed immediately. That is a long-held view of the Greens and one that we continue to hold. The white elephant, as it has been described by the chair of the committee, is not an appropriate place to hold vulnerable people seeking asylum protection and refuge.
As with our previous two reports to this inquiry we continue to remain concerned about holding children in secure forms of detention. Even under the definition of ‘immigration detention’ within the Migration Act it is clear that children theoretically should not be detained in any form of secure detention. We are committed to the principle that no minor be detained in any detention centre, or facility with similar conditions to detention centres, under any circumstances. This concern was raised time and time again in relation to the residential housing facilities where, just because it was not technically named a detention centre, the idea of monitored movement, guards, security, not being able to leave the front door and being surrounded by fences means it is not an appropriate place to be housing children. Concerns were also raised about housing children in those spaces with adults who are perhaps suffering from mental health conditions because of their long-term detention. There are many reasons why we should not be housing children in any form of detention, and that includes transit detention centres as well as residential housing facilities. To ensure that the welfare of children is paramount in any immigration detention policy we have recommended that a Commonwealth Commissioner for Children be established to, among other things, specifically oversee the treatment of children in immigration detention. In establishing such a commissioner the rights of the child would be appropriately protected and the treatment of children adequately scrutinised.
While I acknowledge, as I did in the previous two reports, the work the immigration minister, Senator Evans, is doing to work towards a more humane and compassionate system of immigration, the Greens believe we still have a long way to go. We must not be detaining people in remote locations such as Christmas Island where they do not have access to facilities and where it is out of sight, out of mind. It is not a place to be holding vulnerable people. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Migration Committee</title>,Committees,19,1
"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2009-08-18,"—I rise today also to speak on the third report of the inquiry into immigration detention in Australia by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, of which I am a member. This is the last of three reports against the inquiry’s terms of reference. We have seen the two previous reports: Immigration detention in Australia: a new beginning,released in December 2008; and Immigration detention in Australia: community-based alternatives to detention, released in May 2009.
The first report made 18 recommendations aimed at improving accountability and ensuring a timely release from detention centres—and of course I, and the members of the committee, are pleased that this government has already acted on some of the recommendations from the first report.
In the second report, tabled in May 2009, the committee looked into options available for community based alternatives to detention centres and focused on the support, both physical and emotional, required for a successful release of detainees into the community. The key recommendation here was that the government reform the bridging visa framework to fully support people released into the community, with the appropriate reporting or surety requirements.
I will not go over old ground on those two reports in the short time I have today. It should be noted, however, that the third report, Immigration detention in Australia: Facilities, services and transparency, brings this particular inquiry to completion. The third part of the report addresses the issues of options to expand the transparency and visibility of immigration detention centres, the preferred infrastructure options for contemporary immigration detention and options for the provision of detention services and detention health services across the range of current facilities. This includes immigration detention centres, immigration transit accommodation and community detention. I am pleased that the government has taken positive steps to introduce more humane and appropriate accommodation facilities through immigration transit accommodation and residential housing, but the standard of many facilities remains of concern to the committee, particularly at Perth and stage 1 of Villawood.
There are 11 recommendations overall in the third-stage report of the inquiry, which received over 144 written submissions. These submissions supported the many public hearings and visits by the committee to various forms of detention. The committee members reiterate that reconstruction of stage 1 at Villawood remains a priority of the committee. And here I would just like to point out the Rudd government has announced that it will provide $186.7 million over the next five years to help Villawood redevelopment. We also recommend that the upgrade of the Perth centre goes ahead but that the government look at developing a purpose built facility over the long term, as the lease agreement on this site will be renewable in a few years.
The committee notes that some facilities are more like the traditional concept of a prison, with razor wire, and/or barbed wire, and the committee recommends replacing this with more appropriate fencing. Immigration detention is not meant to be punitive, so it would be more appropriate if the facilities did not look, as I said, like the traditional concept of what people imagine a prison to look like. North West Point, one of the facilities on Christmas Island, has caged walkways and electrified fencing. Once again, it is recommended that this be replaced with more appropriate security infrastructure.
The geographical remoteness of Christmas Island provides a challenge to the detention service provider, organisations that provide support and other services to detainees and the local community. Some medical needs cannot be met on the island. It is difficult for the local community to provide adequate health support to a significant number of immigration detainees. Recommendation 9 is that the Australian government provide and maintain appropriate physical and mental health facilities on Christmas Island.
It is imperative also that staff dealing with detainees are aware of and trained in cultural sensitivities and appropriateness, that they have basic counselling skills, can manage conflict through negotiations and provide the appropriate security measures. To ensure that all detainees, whether onshore or offshore, receive the same level of appropriate service the committee’s recommendation 7 is that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship include mandatory staff training programs at the various facilities and that all staff dealing with detainees are assessed as competent in the areas I have just mentioned.
Recommendation 8 relates to the need for DIAC to publish the detention service standards or the current equivalent on its website, with all current and future detainees to receive a copy which has been translated into appropriate languages. It is also recommended that the Australian National Audit Office undertake an independent review of the current detention service providers and facilities within the next three years.
The committee also recommends that the Australian Human Rights Commission be granted a statutory right of access to all places of and persons in immigration detention in Australia. If Australia ratifies the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment, which it recently signed, an agency with functional independence will need to be developed to conduct visits based inspection of all places of detention in all parts of Australia as well as relevant offshore locations such as immigration detention facilities. It was considered by the committee that access by Australian Human Right Commission be the minimum access.
In the past few years the government has moved towards using a more humane process of immigration residential housing and immigration transit accommodation where possible, as I have already mentioned. But it is unfortunate that some parts of the media still use old file footage of facilities that are now closed, such as the  Baxter and Woomera. Providing access to the media, with due process undertaken to protect the privacy of detainees, would increase the level of transparency and allow greater visibility of day-to-day life in the facilities. Therefore, the committee recommends that DIAC develop a set of public media protocols to be applied consistently across all immigration detention facilities and also provide the media greater access to all immigration detention facilities, but, as I said, with due care to maintaining the privacy of people in these facilities
A fair and effective immigration detention policy and strong border security measures at the same time need not be mutually exclusive. We must ensure that we are committed to the fair and equal treatment of all people, and this commitment extends to people who enter Australia illegally and are placed in detention. To this end I would like to acknowledge the work already undertaken in this area by my colleague Senator Evans, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. I would also like to thank all those people who gave evidence to this committee, either in writing or verbally, the chair Mr Michael Danby, and fellow committee members, from both this place and the other. Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff of the secretariat who worked with the committee on this report. Their professionalism and integrity at all times are to be applauded, and I thank them for their hard work.

"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2009-08-18,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, I present the report of the committee Immigration detention in Australia: facilities, services and transparency. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I will at the outset indicate that I think Senators Hanson-Young and Bilyk were also wishing to speak on this report. It gives me great pleasure to stand here today on behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration to table the third and final report from the inquiry into immigration detention in Australia. Following the first report tabled in December last year, which was entitled Immigration detention in Australia: a new beginning—criteria for release from detention, and a second report tabled in early May this year entitled Immigration detention in Australia: community-based alternatives to detention, this final report focuses on the facilities, services and transparency of immigration detention in Australia. The report concludes the 15-month long inquiry into the criteria for immigration detention in our country and the alternative options available. During these 15 months the joint committee on migration has reviewed some 142 submissions, visited detention centres across the country and spoken with witnesses from all walks of life in order to gain a wide-ranging insight into Australia’s immigration detention policies. It was the aim of the committee to offer suggestions to the government to help shape the future of Australia’s immigration detention policy in a fairer, more efficient and humane way.

The second report had an additional 12 recommendations, which focused on upholding the safety and security of Australia’s borders while taking a humane approach to those people seeking protection in Australia. This final report comes with a further 11 recommendations. These address the preferred infrastructure options for contemporary immigration detention; the options for the provision of detention services and detention health services across the range of current detention facilities; and the options to expand the transparency and visibility of immigration detention centres.
One of the key recommendations from this report is recommendation 4, which recommends that detention in immigration residential housing should be used in lieu of detention centres should it be deemed feasible. After reviewing submissions and public hearings, the committee believes that, while secure detention will continue to play an important role in our immigration system, evidence suggests it is not necessary to keep those people who meet the criteria for release in secure detention while they await resolution of their immigration status. Placing detainees in immigration residential housing and immigration transit accommodation for the shortest time possible would complement the government’s intention to address the prompt resolution of an individual’s immigration status. This is in line with recommendations from the second report of the committee.
Additionally, the committee has serious concerns about the appearance of a number of detention centres. In fact, recommendations 1 to 3 and 5 of this report revolve around the infrastructure and aesthetics, or lack of aesthetics, of some of the detention centres. The committee had a number of concerns about some detention centres which look more like prisons: high security levels; a lack of access to fresh, clean air; limited access to outdoor exercise areas; little privacy; and, in some circumstances, very poor levels of cleanliness. The people who are seeking refuge in our country are not criminals and the majority have fled hardships and risked their lives in search of a better future. They should not be kept in prison-like environments.
Recommendation 1 of the report that the reconstruction of stage 1 at Villawood Detention Centre remains urgent and a priority of the committee would help in eradicating the prison-like appearance. The committee noted that the government has provided $186.7 million over the next five years to redevelop that detention centre. However, the committee noted that that time frame may need to be revised due to the current concerns regarding the state of the infrastructure and facilities. Similarly, the committee suggests in recommendation 2 that the proposed upgrades of the Perth detention facility commence immediately. Although the facilities in Perth are under limited lease arrangements, they are in dire need of urgent attention. The committee has agreed that the government should examine the long-term options with the intent to establish a purpose-built, long-term facility.
The intentions of most senators on this committee were to restore justice, dignity and certainty to the treatment of those people held in immigration detention in Australia. As at 17 July this year, there were 744 men and women still detained in immigration detention centres across the country and on Christmas Island. In line with restoring justice and dignity to these people, recommendations 3 and 5 are about reducing the extreme security measures currently in place. The use of razor wire or barbed wire, electrified fencing, caged walkways and perspex barriers are seen as excessive by the committee and are a disproportionate security measure. I note that the Christmas Island detention facility was built by the previous government as a high security establishment at a cost of some $400 million. The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has already taken measures to remove razor wire from all of Australia’s detention facilities except stage 1 at Villawood, which is a very welcome move.
The committee recommends in its report that it is in the best interests of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, as well as the general public, to increase the transparency of the immigration detention centres. Many media outlets are using old file footage of the immigration detention centres or using file footage of now closed detention centres for their images. Therefore, the committee has recommended that the provision of greater access to detention facilities is made available for the media. Furthermore, the committee has recommended that regularly updated information on the facilities, including statistics and detainee population, should appear on the department’s website.
Additionally, to aid in the greater transparency of our immigration detention centres, the committee has recommended that the Australian Human Rights Commission be granted a statutory right of access to all places of, and persons in, immigration detention in Australia. This will ensure that all facilities and the treatment of detainees is always as dignified and as humane as possible. That being said, the committee has suggested with recommendation 9 that the government maintain appropriate physical and mental health facilities at the Christmas Island detention centre, commensurate with the services provided at other immigration detention centres. Many of the submissions received by the committee raised concerns over the services available on Christmas Island, partially due to the geographical remoteness of the island. Some medical needs, as we know, cannot be met on the island whatsoever. Therefore, the committee has recommended the access to appropriate facilities to assist in the transparency of immigration detention in Australia.
Lastly, the remaining recommendations made by the committee are with regard to the department’s provision of services to detention centres. The committee makes several recommendations to encourage a full review of the current immigration detention service providers, to introduce mandatory and ongoing training programs for staff of the detention service providers and to make public the service standards of the immigration detention centres on the department’s website. It is hoped that with those measures the Department of Immigration and Citizenship will be able to increase the quality and effectiveness of the services that it provides to all immigrant detainees and achieve a high service standard across the board.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2009-08-18,"—I rise to speak today on the motion to take note of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration’s third report into immigration detention, Immigration detention in Australia: facilities, services and transparency
. Can I say that the Greens are extremely disappointed that the majority report of the committee does not appropriately address, in our view, the major concerns outlined throughout the inquiry process; nor does it put forward adequate recommendations for change. I have in fact put in a dissenting report because of my major concerns with the committee’s majority report.
First and foremost, the issues of transparency and the provision of suitable and sufficient services cannot effectively be dealt with without questioning the appropriateness of the privatisation of detention services. A lot of the issues and concerns that were raised throughout the inquiry process come back to the ultimate issue of our detention facilities being run by private companies. Given that the majority of individuals and organisations that provided evidence to the committee highlighted concerns about the privatisation of detention services, the fact that the committee’s report fails to reflect on this with an actual recommendation is disappointing and clearly contravenes moves towards a more transparent and accountable immigration detention system.
The Rudd government’s recent announcement that it has signed new five-year contracts for immigration detention services with GSL and Serco is disappointing and strikingly at odds with its pre-election promises. The fact that there will be two different operators for detention centres, residential housing and transit accommodation also raises concern over how the private operators will communicate with one another and the department to ensure that transparency and quality of care are maintained. It is going to be very difficult, I believe, to have a successful transition between the immigration detention centres, the residential housing facilities and the transit accommodation. It is hard to believe that this, as well as the need to coordinate with the department, will result in good-quality care, when we know already that just dealing with one private operator and the department causes problems from time to time.
In the course of the inquiry we heard numerous concerns about using external, for-profit contractors to provide immigration detention services, particularly given that there have been many instances, according to A Just Australia, one of the witnesses, where arguments regarding responsibility for service delivery between the department and service delivery contractors have resulted in unacceptable living conditions for detained people. If the arguments already happen between one private operator and the department, I hate to think what will happen when negotiations are held between two separate private operators and the department. The fact is that both GSL and Serco have backgrounds in providing prison services. The Greens do not believe that this is an appropriate way to provide a service to those vulnerable refugees and asylum seekers who are currently found in detention centres. Outsourcing is not an appropriate way of handling their claims and providing care for those vulnerable people who seek our assistance and protection, particularly when some of the detention facilities are so far removed and remote from mainland Australia.
It is for this reason that the Greens have put forward two main recommendations on how we believe the immigration detention system can be made more transparent and accountable. Firstly, we have argued in our dissenting report that the government should return all immigration detention services to public control. Let me remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that that was a promise of the Labor Party before the election. Obviously, with the signing of the two new five-year contracts, that election promise has been broken. We believe that detention services need to be returned to public control, opening up a direct line of responsibility between the department, the minister and the immigration processes and services that occur in these detention facilities. Secondly, acknowledging that that election promise has been broken and that the government has just negotiated new five-year contracts, we believe that, at a minimum, the contracts must emphasise the need to put welfare outcomes ahead of security and compliance. We must ensure that the welfare concerns of vulnerable people, those people seeking asylum and our protection, are put ahead of security and compliance. We must ensure that no private operator with only a prison services background is awarded the contract in the future.
The Greens are also concerned that the report fails to include appropriate and detailed recommendations regarding infrastructure, the security features of immigration residential housing and immigration transit accommodation, and healthcare services. Concerns were continually raised throughout the 12-month inquiry relating specifically to the inappropriateness of housing children in residential housing facilities and the overuse of immigration transit accommodation. Various other concerns were raised, which Senator McEwen alluded to in her response to the report, about healthcare services. These have not, in the view of the Greens, been dealt with in the majority report.
With regard to Christmas Island, most notably, the committee heard evidence from many witnesses criticising the current excision policy, particularly due to the remoteness of the location, which undoubtedly limits access to sufficient healthcare facilities and resources for both island residents and detainees, and access to torture and trauma counselling. These are basic services that should be available at any facility that is housing asylum seekers and refugees, and yet there is no access to them at the remote location of Christmas Island. The committee heard overwhelming evidence from refugee advocates, lawyers and individuals calling for the need for drastic upgrading of the facilities on Christmas Island to at least bring them up to a standard comparable with that required of detention centres on the mainland. I acknowledge the recommendations relating to those issues in the majority report.
Concerns were also raised around the lack of community oversight that is available when dealing with excised territories. The directors of A Just Australia argued that with no community oversight or media scrutiny ‘there is the opportunity for extremely inhumane treatment of people’ when there is a lack of transparency in the operation of these services.
Despite our recognition for infrastructure change on Christmas Island the Greens believe that, due to the extraordinary level of security at the North West Point detention centre and the inappropriateness of detaining people there, the facility should be closed immediately. That is a long-held view of the Greens and one that we continue to hold. The white elephant, as it has been described by the chair of the committee, is not an appropriate place to hold vulnerable people seeking asylum protection and refuge.
As with our previous two reports to this inquiry we continue to remain concerned about holding children in secure forms of detention. Even under the definition of ‘immigration detention’ within the Migration Act it is clear that children theoretically should not be detained in any form of secure detention. We are committed to the principle that no minor be detained in any detention centre, or facility with similar conditions to detention centres, under any circumstances. This concern was raised time and time again in relation to the residential housing facilities where, just because it was not technically named a detention centre, the idea of monitored movement, guards, security, not being able to leave the front door and being surrounded by fences means it is not an appropriate place to be housing children. Concerns were also raised about housing children in those spaces with adults who are perhaps suffering from mental health conditions because of their long-term detention. There are many reasons why we should not be housing children in any form of detention, and that includes transit detention centres as well as residential housing facilities. To ensure that the welfare of children is paramount in any immigration detention policy we have recommended that a Commonwealth Commissioner for Children be established to, among other things, specifically oversee the treatment of children in immigration detention. In establishing such a commissioner the rights of the child would be appropriately protected and the treatment of children adequately scrutinised.
While I acknowledge, as I did in the previous two reports, the work the immigration minister, Senator Evans, is doing to work towards a more humane and compassionate system of immigration, the Greens believe we still have a long way to go. We must not be detaining people in remote locations such as Christmas Island where they do not have access to facilities and where it is out of sight, out of mind. It is not a place to be holding vulnerable people. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,19,2
"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2009-08-18,"—I rise today also to speak on the third report of the inquiry into immigration detention in Australia by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, of which I am a member. This is the last of three reports against the inquiry’s terms of reference. We have seen the two previous reports: Immigration detention in Australia: a new beginning,released in December 2008; and Immigration detention in Australia: community-based alternatives to detention, released in May 2009.
The first report made 18 recommendations aimed at improving accountability and ensuring a timely release from detention centres—and of course I, and the members of the committee, are pleased that this government has already acted on some of the recommendations from the first report.
In the second report, tabled in May 2009, the committee looked into options available for community based alternatives to detention centres and focused on the support, both physical and emotional, required for a successful release of detainees into the community. The key recommendation here was that the government reform the bridging visa framework to fully support people released into the community, with the appropriate reporting or surety requirements.
I will not go over old ground on those two reports in the short time I have today. It should be noted, however, that the third report, Immigration detention in Australia: Facilities, services and transparency, brings this particular inquiry to completion. The third part of the report addresses the issues of options to expand the transparency and visibility of immigration detention centres, the preferred infrastructure options for contemporary immigration detention and options for the provision of detention services and detention health services across the range of current facilities. This includes immigration detention centres, immigration transit accommodation and community detention. I am pleased that the government has taken positive steps to introduce more humane and appropriate accommodation facilities through immigration transit accommodation and residential housing, but the standard of many facilities remains of concern to the committee, particularly at Perth and stage 1 of Villawood.
There are 11 recommendations overall in the third-stage report of the inquiry, which received over 144 written submissions. These submissions supported the many public hearings and visits by the committee to various forms of detention. The committee members reiterate that reconstruction of stage 1 at Villawood remains a priority of the committee. And here I would just like to point out the Rudd government has announced that it will provide $186.7 million over the next five years to help Villawood redevelopment. We also recommend that the upgrade of the Perth centre goes ahead but that the government look at developing a purpose built facility over the long term, as the lease agreement on this site will be renewable in a few years.
The committee notes that some facilities are more like the traditional concept of a prison, with razor wire, and/or barbed wire, and the committee recommends replacing this with more appropriate fencing. Immigration detention is not meant to be punitive, so it would be more appropriate if the facilities did not look, as I said, like the traditional concept of what people imagine a prison to look like. North West Point, one of the facilities on Christmas Island, has caged walkways and electrified fencing. Once again, it is recommended that this be replaced with more appropriate security infrastructure.
The geographical remoteness of Christmas Island provides a challenge to the detention service provider, organisations that provide support and other services to detainees and the local community. Some medical needs cannot be met on the island. It is difficult for the local community to provide adequate health support to a significant number of immigration detainees. Recommendation 9 is that the Australian government provide and maintain appropriate physical and mental health facilities on Christmas Island.
It is imperative also that staff dealing with detainees are aware of and trained in cultural sensitivities and appropriateness, that they have basic counselling skills, can manage conflict through negotiations and provide the appropriate security measures. To ensure that all detainees, whether onshore or offshore, receive the same level of appropriate service the committee’s recommendation 7 is that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship include mandatory staff training programs at the various facilities and that all staff dealing with detainees are assessed as competent in the areas I have just mentioned.
Recommendation 8 relates to the need for DIAC to publish the detention service standards or the current equivalent on its website, with all current and future detainees to receive a copy which has been translated into appropriate languages. It is also recommended that the Australian National Audit Office undertake an independent review of the current detention service providers and facilities within the next three years.
The committee also recommends that the Australian Human Rights Commission be granted a statutory right of access to all places of and persons in immigration detention in Australia. If Australia ratifies the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment, which it recently signed, an agency with functional independence will need to be developed to conduct visits based inspection of all places of detention in all parts of Australia as well as relevant offshore locations such as immigration detention facilities. It was considered by the committee that access by Australian Human Right Commission be the minimum access.
In the past few years the government has moved towards using a more humane process of immigration residential housing and immigration transit accommodation where possible, as I have already mentioned. But it is unfortunate that some parts of the media still use old file footage of facilities that are now closed, such as the  Baxter and Woomera. Providing access to the media, with due process undertaken to protect the privacy of detainees, would increase the level of transparency and allow greater visibility of day-to-day life in the facilities. Therefore, the committee recommends that DIAC develop a set of public media protocols to be applied consistently across all immigration detention facilities and also provide the media greater access to all immigration detention facilities, but, as I said, with due care to maintaining the privacy of people in these facilities
A fair and effective immigration detention policy and strong border security measures at the same time need not be mutually exclusive. We must ensure that we are committed to the fair and equal treatment of all people, and this commitment extends to people who enter Australia illegally and are placed in detention. To this end I would like to acknowledge the work already undertaken in this area by my colleague Senator Evans, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. I would also like to thank all those people who gave evidence to this committee, either in writing or verbally, the chair Mr Michael Danby, and fellow committee members, from both this place and the other. Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff of the secretariat who worked with the committee on this report. Their professionalism and integrity at all times are to be applauded, and I thank them for their hard work.

"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2009-08-18,"—Today is Vietnam Veterans Remembrance Day and therefore it is an appropriate day to reflect on how we as a nation remember and honour our veterans of all conflicts and to also reflect on how fortunate we are to have a serving Defence Force of extraordinarily skilled, loyal and courageous personnel. As members of parliament we are in a unique position to observe what is happening in veterans affairs and in our defence forces. More importantly, we are in a position to influence government policy and legislation in these areas of public administration, and it is a responsibility that I know all of us take seriously.
I have not always been as mindful as I should have been about the welfare of our veterans and of our defence forces. I was a teenager during the Vietnam War and I supported the campaigns to end that war and bring our troops home. I was, I admit, at that time fairly insensitive to the plight of Vietnam veterans and serving defence personnel, despite the fact that my own father was a veteran of World War II.
Today, as was acknowledged by the Prime Minister during his address at the Vietnam Veterans Remembrance Day service, we should all take time to remember the 60,000 Australians who served in Vietnam, especially the 521 defence personnel who died and the 2,400 who were wounded in that conflict.
As a nation we failed on many accounts to adequately support the veterans of that war, and their families. I am sure most MPs and senators would have constituents who are Vietnam veterans and who still need our assistance to access the support and services they need. I acknowledge the work of the numerous ex-service organisations who do an excellent job supporting their members and I would also like to commend the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, Mr Alan Griffin, whose genuine care and concern for our veterans has led to many important policy initiatives, including the Vietnam veterans family study currently underway.
Many Australians are paying more attention to Australia’s military history and are actively choosing to honour our veterans and ADF personnel. I am sure all senators would have acknowledged the ever-increasing number of people, including large numbers of young people, who now attend Anzac Day dawn services in our electorates. Visiting Gallipoli as part of the grand tour and walking the Kokoda Track are other ways that Australians are choosing to honour their veterans.
The nine Australians who died last Tuesday in the tragic plane crash near Kokoda were doing just that, and I would like to express my sincerest sympathy to the family and friends of all those who died in that terrible crash. Like quite a number of MPs and senators, including Senator Barnett, I have been to Kokoda and I have flown that flight path through the Owen Stanley Ranges on the way to Kokoda, and I feel deeply for those who were undoubtedly feeling very excited and also apprehensive about the adventure to come but who were robbed of that opportunity. It is a privilege to walk the Kokoda Track and last week’s incident brought home just how much of a privilege it is. The pilgrimage that many Australians make to the Kokoda Track—and I sincerely hope that Australians continue to do that—is a fitting way to remember the service of our veterans and our current serving defence personnel.
I was very pleased to note that the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs has also recently announced some very welcome initiatives to assist us to remember the sacrifice many have made, and continue to make, to keep Australia safe and to recognise those who have supported our defence personnel. On 23 July 2009, which is Papua New Guinea’s Remembrance Day, at the beautiful Bomana War Cemetery near Port Moresby, the minister issued the first commemorative medallion honouring the so-called ‘fuzzy wuzzy angels’ who cared for Australian soldiers on the Kokoda Track during that terrible campaign that saw nearly 600 Australians killed and another 1,000 injured. In June this year, the government announced a grant of $12,000 to upgrade and refurbish the southern entrance to the Kokoda Track at Owers Corner. This has become a special place for Australians and Papua New Guinean locals alike and the upgrade will make sure this important place is improved and maintained.
Just yesterday, in recognition of the infamous Sandakan prisoner of war camp in Sabah, Borneo, and subsequent death marches in August 1945 from Sandakan to Ranau that saw 2,400 British and Australian soldiers die in terrible circumstances, Minister Griffin announced the opening of an Australian government funded memorial hall at the privately operated memorial gardens in Kundasang in Borneo. Those people who have been to that memorial garden would know what a special memorial that is and it is so worthy of the $155,000 that the Australian government has provided. It is good to know that the government is determined to honour our service personnel with support for these memorials and acknowledgements of service.
As I said at the beginning, senators and members are in a very fortunate position to know about and to influence veterans and defence policy. One of the ways that interested senators and members can become better educated about our defence matters is by participating in the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program. This program has been in place since 2001 and I have, since I came here in 2005, listened with much interest to the speeches of other senators who have been able to participate in one or more of the activities provided under the program. The aim of the program is to provide members and senators with practical experience of the ADF so that we can take a more informed and constructive part in the debate about defence. The objectives of the program are: to provide an understanding of a unit’s role and missions; to provide an opportunity to experience the life of a service person; and to provide an awareness and understanding of defence capabilities, personnel and management issues.
In July this year—in fact in the week immediately following my return from walking the Kokoda Track—I was very fortunate to join the ADF Parliamentary Program and was placed with the SAS, the Special Air Services Regiment, for five days during part of the regiment’s selection course. It is without doubt one of the best things I have ever done. The regiment, with its famous motto ‘Who dares wins’ was formed on 4 September 1964, although its predecessor, the 1st Special Air Service Company, which was part of the Royal Australian Infantry, had been in existence since 1957.
The SAS Regiment has a long history of operations in Borneo, Vietnam, Rwanda, Somalia, Cambodia, East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan and probably other places. The members of the regiment are extraordinary men who undertake extraordinary operations and do so with little regard for the accolades and recognition they deserve and occasionally get, but certainly never seek. It was hard finding much material for this speech about the regiment because, as is entirely appropriate, not a lot of official material is written about their operations or about their citations and achievements. Suffice to say, it is not easy to become a member of the regiment and those who make the grade certainly deserve to be there.
I have to say that the willingness of the officers and soldiers of the SAS to take on board two members of parliament to participate in and observe part of the challenging selection course was very much appreciated. It was an honour to be there. Being there did give me the opportunity to learn a lot more about life in the forces, about the issues ‘from the ground’ in Defence, as opposed to from the across the table during Senate estimates, and about the importance of supporting our defence personnel and our defence capability. I was very pleased to note the announcement today by the Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science, Mr Greg Combet, that the ADF is currently experiencing its lowest separation rate for the last decade, which is extremely welcome news indeed.
While there are many differences between the wars and warfare that I have mentioned in this speech—World War II, Vietnam and Afghanistan, and of course also World War I—regardless of what capacity our veterans and defence personnel have served in, or are serving in, we should always honour their service, as the Prime Minister did today, and we should also use our privileged positions as members of the parliament to do what we can to support our former and current servicemen and women.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Vietnam Veterans Remembrance Day</title>,Adjournment,23,1
