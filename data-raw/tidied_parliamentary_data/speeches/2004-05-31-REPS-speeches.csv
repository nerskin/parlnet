"Jull, David, MP",LP,2004-05-31,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the committee's report entitled Near neighbours—good neighbours: an inquiry into Australia's relationship with Indonesia, together with evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—In the 10 years since the committee last examined Australia's relationship with Indonesia, much has happened in the international arena that has affected both countries and, at times, the relationship itself. Although there have been periods of strain, it has been for the most part a positive relationship of considerable value to both countries, with the potential to be significantly more so. It is in the interests of both nations for the relationship to be strong in all its dimensions—strategic, political, economic and cultural.
Within weeks of the commencement of this inquiry, the Bali bombings would bring home to us all how closely the interests of both countries lie. A number of submissions describe the high degree of cooperation that took place immediately after the bombings in dealing with the disaster and the ongoing cooperation since. The Bali bombings have had an impact on many aspects of our engagement. They have also affected the relationship at its deepest level. Of the 202 lives lost, 89 were Australians and 38 were Indonesians. This shared loss has brought together our two histories in a new and indelible way, and no account of measures taken by either government can adequately portray the nature of its impact.
While the Bali bombings have formed a backdrop to much of this inquiry, we have kept a broad focus that appropriately reflects our wide-ranging engagement. The breadth of this engagement was made very clear in the number of submissions from government departments and agencies. These submissions described in detail a wide range of activities in an extraordinarily diverse range of areas. Our recommendations in this area build on the excellent work that is already being done.
The committee was extremely impressed by Australia's relationship with Indonesia at the bureaucratic level. We consider, however, that the relationship needs considerable strengthening at both the political and the people-to-people levels. At both levels there is a pressing need for much better communication and much deeper understanding. The committee considers that parliamentarians have a role to play in strengthening the relationship at the political level. Towards the end of this inquiry, we spent some days in Jakarta meeting with political leaders, senior officials and a wide range of other government and non-government organisations. Our discussions were substantial, informative and robust. There were many highlights in the visit—including, of course, our meeting with Her Excellency President Megawati Sukarnoputri.
We also valued the opportunity to establish a connection with our counterpart committee, Commission 1. We consider that regular meetings would provide the opportunity to develop this relationship and achieve, over time, communication that is characterised by open dialogue and mutual respect. The committee has recommended that the Minister for Foreign Affairs establish a program of exchange visits between the foreign affairs, defence and trade committees of the Australian parliament and the equivalent committees of the Indonesian parliament. 
At the heart of Australia's relationship with Indonesia is the relationship between the people of Indonesia and the people of Australia. Australia and Indonesia have vastly different backgrounds and cultures. Such differences promise potential for rich exchanges. They can also lead to poor communication, misunderstanding and mistrust. Better mutual understanding is in the interests of both countries.
One of the principal means of enhancing understanding is through education. We consider that maintaining Australia's expertise on Indonesia and expanding the level of understanding about Indonesia through research and education is crucial if we are to continue building this relationship over the long term. Australia's commitment to this should be demonstrated by continuing support for Indonesian studies in universities and expanding research opportunities, restoring NALSAS or establishing a program with similar aims and increasing opportunities for Australian students to study in Indonesia. Education is not only a key strategy for building understanding; with approximately 18,000 Indonesian students coming to Australia each year, education is also significant in terms of trade. There is great potential for future growth in this area. My time is just about up, but I am sure that other members speaking in this debate will further expand on the recommendations that we have made so that we can build this positive, healthy and productive relationship between the two countries.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee</title>",Committees,0,1,speech
"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,2004-05-31,"—I would like to support the remarks of the honourable member for Fadden, the Chair of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee. It is disappointing that this report, which deals with one of the two most important relationships we have, will receive five minutes from him and five minutes from me. Some might say there is something wrong in the state of Denmark. Be that as it may, I stand by the report and its 28 recommendations. I think it is a very good report. The inquiry received 124 submissions, with representatives from over 60 organisations appearing in 40 hours of public hearings.
The government kindly agreed to allow the subcommittee to visit Indonesia as part of its inquiry. I particularly want to thank the Indonesian Embassy here and our Department of Foreign Affairs in Indonesia for what was a very useful visit. As the chairman has commented, President Megawati Sukarnoputri was most generous in the 45 minutes that she gave us, as was Vice-President Hamzah Haz. We met a whole range of different officials, including the Secretary-General of the Department of Foreign Affairs Mr Sudjadnan Parnohadiningrat, who was the previous ambassador, and General Sutarto.
There is no doubt that since East Timor our relationship has improved. We are getting very good cooperation in antiterrorist activities and in policing matters. It came as a bit of a surprise to me that General Cosgrove is yet to receive an invitation to travel to Indonesia and General Sutarto is not permitted to travel to Australia. We should not judge the whole relationship by the relationship between these two key defence officials, but it does say that we have a way to go to improve that relationship.
Of the people we met there—and they were many and varied—I was particularly interested to meet leading figures from three different Muslim organisations. There is no doubt that Indonesia, the largest Muslim country in the world, is a country where Islam has come to terms with modernity. I think they have much to teach the rest of the Islamic world, but there is much for us to understand and appreciate from them. 
I also want to say that education is a really important aspect of our relationship. It is one that we have focused on, particularly in two aspects. The first is what Australia can do in working with Indonesia, not only in the public schools but in the Islamic schools as well. I am pleased that that currently is, and will continue to be, an important aspect of our program. The other matter was touched on by the chairman, the honourable member for Fadden, and that is that we are at grave risk of shedding a lot of Indonesian expertise that we have built up over many years, particularly in the universities. That would be a real tragedy for us. The committee has made a number of recommendations, which were referred to by the chairman.
Last but not least, I really concur with the chairman about building up people-to-people links, but the parliament itself has a special responsibility. Having been one who travelled in the mid-nineties to meet commissions in Indonesia, with a view to trying to create some closer links, I am very passionate about the recommendation that says that the joint committee has a special role in developing relationships with our reciprocal commissions over in Indonesia. A bilateral visit program, I think, would stand both countries in good stead. I understand that a commission is shortly to visit Australia. I am looking forward, as I know the committee is, to welcoming them and having a good dialogue with them. A relationship with Indonesia is always going to be robust, but we should at all times work hard to minimise the differences that exist between two good neighbours. (Time expired)

"Wilkie, Kim, MP",ALP,2004-05-31,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	recognises the importance of the parliamentary education program for Australian school students which encourages young people to come to Canberra and participate in and learn about our federal democracy and culture;
(2)	supports and encourages utilisation of the educational resources available that complement parliamentary and democracy education;
(3)	provides for the provision of realistic and flexible financial assistance to schools and students planning parliamentary educational programs; and
(4)	calls on the Parliament to make rebate schemes more reflective and considerate of travel distances to the National Capital in order to allow equality of access to the parliamentary education program for all students and that such rebates reflect market pricing for those reliant on air travel.
One of the most important roles of parliament is to encourage all Australians, especially young Australians, to learn more about how parliament works and their role as citizens of Australia. Greater awareness of the federal parliament and its processes can only be of significant benefit as young Australians prepare to become voters and participate in our democracy.
The purpose of this motion before the House today is to draw attention to the fact that the rates of rebate currently stipulated in the parliamentary education program—which is based here at the Serjeant-at-Arms' office and is titled the Citizenship Visits Program—need to be changed to enable Australian students who live the longest distances from Canberra equality of access to their parliament and the nation's capital. It is often not feasible for these students to be able to travel to Canberra by bus or train—it simply takes too long to make such a trip a viable part of a school's curriculum. Air travel is therefore the only sensible option, but unfortunately the current rebate does not cover enough of the air ticket to enable many students to participate in the program. 
Participating in the program offers significant benefits in two important ways: firstly, a greater understanding of federal parliament; and, secondly, a greater awareness of other national institutions. In fact, in my electorate only one school comes to Canberra on a regular basis and that is Penrhos College, and I compliment them on that yearly commitment. The challenges for young Australians are greater today than they have ever been. Politics and policy making are more complex and the issues which this parliament debates are more diverse. Increasing the awareness among young Australians of parliament, its processes and the issues we debate in this House is a vital part of equipping them for their responsibilities as citizens.
As a federal member of parliament I am frequently surprised at the poor information many people have on the respective roles of federal, state and local governments. Often there is confusion about the differences between jurisdictions and the issues they manage. This lack of awareness demonstrates the need to ensure that as many Australians as possible have the opportunity to visit Parliament House and enhance their knowledge of the role of federal parliament.
This underlines the importance of the parliamentary education program for young Australians. When students visit Canberra they also have the opportunity to explore and learn about other national institutions, such as the Australian War Memorial, the National Gallery of Australia, the National Museum of Australia and the High Court. These institutions are integral to our national heritage and our culture. We are all proud of these icons. They emphasise our history and the ties that bind us together as Australians. These two key components of an education visit to Canberra make such a visit a worthwhile complement to the curriculum based studies in civics, citizenship, culture and history.
As a Western Australian MP I am concerned that many Western Australian students are denied the opportunity to improve their education in these important subject areas because for them the cost of coming to Canberra is simply prohibitive. In 2003 almost 130,000 students travelled to Canberra and participated in parliamentary education programs, but only 2,000 came from Western Australia. Unfortunately many students in WA are missing out on these important educational programs because travel costs are clearly related to distance, and the 3,773 kilometres from Perth to Canberra is a costly proposition.
My colleague from WA, the honourable Member for Kalgoorlie, will speak on behalf of those who live in more remote areas of the state, such as the Pilbara and the Kimberley, from where the costs are even higher than from Perth. For students from WA the current rebate available is $230 per student. That falls well short of even the cheapest possible return airfare from Perth to Canberra. I welcome the efforts of Qantas to keep student fares as low as possible and appreciate their recent introduction of a new direct flight between Canberra and Perth. This will obviously assist schools by providing comparable travelling times to their eastern state counterparts, but the fact remains that to ensure that students from more distant areas of Australia have equitable access to our federal parliament and our national institutions we need to adjust the rebate.
I am pleased that my motion is supported by my colleagues, in the form of the indefatigable members for Lingiari and Capricornia, as well as the members for Kalgoorlie, Canning and Casey. Surely such bipartisan support confirms the validity of our case. It has been said that if we increase the rebate we may have to increase the resources made available to the Parliamentary Education Office. I say: let it be so. The future of our country lies with our youth and any additional cost would be miniscule compared to the advantages gained. The motion set before the House is essentially that all young Australians have the opportunity to access the parliamentary education program and that it be made affordable. I commend the motion to the House. ",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Parliamentary Education Program</title>,Private Members' Business,1,1,speech
"Haase, Barry, MP",LP,2004-05-31,"—I second the motion. It is with a great deal of pleasure and satisfaction that I rise today to support this motion. The member for Swan raises a vital issue. I have the opportunity to represent 91 per cent of Western Australia. There are far-flung reaches in the Kalgoorlie electorate. For instance, Kununurra is some 2,000 kilometres from the capital city of Perth. When I look at the bureaucratic arrangements for the Citizenship Visits Program and I see that there is a scale that allows for the subsidy of students to visit Canberra, as long as they participate in a Parliamentary Education Office program—for distances from 1,000 to 2,000 kilometres $40 is allowed, from 2,000 to 3,000 kilometres $110 is allowed and for more than 3,000 kilometres $230 is allowed—I realise how ill-informed about the vastness of the nation people in high places are.
It is some 3,700-odd kilometres from Canberra to Perth and it is another 2,000 kilometres from Perth to Kununurra. Why on earth do we have a scale that cuts out at 3,000 kilometres? It is a nonsense. Sadly, I have so few visits from my schools to Canberra. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to work out why. It is simply because the costs are prohibitive. We do not have the luxury of many in Victoria and New South Wales, and certainly those in Canberra, of simply making a day trip to Canberra and the seat of federal parliament. Generally speaking, the opportunity for my students to visit Canberra is as a result of a mammoth undertaking—almost a military exercise of logistics—to get them here. It takes, on average, about six months of fundraising to get an individual from regional Western Australia to Canberra.
A case in point is the experience of Tom Price Senior High School. They decided that they had to avail themselves of the opportunities given by the Parliamentary Education Office here in Canberra and visit the nation's capital to see how democracy worked and understand something of the varying levels of government and their responsibilities. Their trip cost them $27,000 for 14 students and three supervising staff. They were subsidised about $3,000 from this system. That means that they had to raise $24,000—in a small town like Tom Price. It becomes an incredible task. You may say, `This is just a wonderful opportunity for Australians who live wherever they might choose to,' but we would like all Australians, especially young Australians, to understand democracy and to have a crack at leadership of this country. If they cannot afford to come to see what happens in the nation's capital, they are going to be a lot less inclined to take up the cudgel to represent the people, because they realise just how damned hard it is.
So my urging today is that we have a serious and long look at these rates of reimbursement or subsidy available to Australian school students. We should be serious enough to look at how they might be improved so as to make the basics and the understanding of democracy available to all school students, wherever they might be in Australia, and we should do something with this bureaucratically ignorant scale that simply says: `Anything over 3,000 kilometres from Canberra is unimaginable, for goodness sake. We don't need to do anything particularly unique about those distances.' 
We need to overhaul the CVP—the Citizenship Visits Program—rates in a major way. We have to look, therefore, at the funding for the Parliamentary Education Office and make sure that they are realistically funded to address the number of students who want to visit this nation's capital. Until such time as we have done that, we are not administering something that can be purely accepted as democratic. If we stand for anything in this place, we pride ourselves on representing democracy. But in reality, until it reaches out to all of the far-flung points of Australia and gives equal opportunity to those citizens living in those far-flung areas, it is not true democracy.

"Livermore, Kirsten, MP",ALP,2004-05-31,"—I am very happy to have this opportunity to participate in this important debate and to support the member for Swan and other colleagues here in our call for increased financial assistance for school students making the trip to Canberra to experience first-hand Australia's system of government and the principles and institutions that underpin our democracy.
I am sure that, like me, all members take every opportunity they can to speak to school groups in their electorate about the workings of the parliament and our system of government and to encourage young people to become active citizens. For each of us participating in this debate, those sessions invariably do happen back in the electorate because it is so rare to host a school group from the outlying states like Queensland and Western Australia here in Parliament House. The cost of travelling to Canberra to take part in the educational opportunities around the national capital is simply out of the question for most schools and parents in my electorate, however much they might want their children to have that experience. For example, in the last three years' figures that I had a look at, an average of four schools per year came from my electorate down to Parliament House.
Trips to Canberra to complement the students' SOSE curriculum are in there competing with sporting equipment, airconditioned classrooms, more computers and additional teaching resources as the No. 1 priority for the precious dollars raised by the dedicated members of the P and C of each school. When faced with such tough choices, schools are also aware of the subsidies and assistance available for various types of projects, and no doubt that helps to make the decision for them. Schools in my electorate of Capricornia receive a subsidy through the Citizenship Visits Program of $40 per student. That is not much for a trip of between 1,500 and 2,000 kilometres and lasting usually over a week.
If we believe, as is evidenced by this debate today, that civic engagement and a better understanding of our national institutions are important priorities for improving our society then we need to send that message to schools and parents, not through cliched propaganda but through meaningful support for students to come to Canberra to see democracy and government in action and—even more importantly—to feel connected to it through their own hands-on experience.
As parliamentarians, we regularly lament the lack of interest in the work of the parliament and the poor level of understanding about key aspects of our system of government that we detect in the community. We understand the warning issued by the Civics Expert Group in its 1994 report:
Our system of government relies for its efficacy and legitimacy on an informed citizenry; without active, knowledgeable citizens the forms of democratic representation remain empty; without vigilant, informed citizens there is no check on potential tyranny. 
It goes on to say:
... our democratic values require that every citizen has equal opportunity to participate in the exercise of rights and responsibilities. Without civic education that democratic ideal is not maintained.
As MPs, we have also seen for ourselves the opportunity that exists to turn around that lack of interest before it turns into cynicism and even alienation in our country's young people.
On any given day of the week I could bump into one of my colleagues taking a group of his or her local students on a tour of Parliament House. When that happens, I do not see too many signs of lack of interest. The students are generally looking around in admiration at this magnificent building, absorbing all of its history and drama and either listening to the stories about life in parliament or taking their turn to ask a question about what they have seen. The message that those students receive all day—whether it is from the wonderful activities undertaken with the Parliamentary Education Office staff, sitting in question time or talking to their local member of parliament—is that this is their house, their parliament and their democracy.
We know how powerful the experience is for those young students and we need to get behind the call in this private member's motion to increase the subsidies available to students so that it is possible for many more schools to embark on the journey to Canberra and to make their students aware that our national government is just as much for them, whether they are from Muttaburra, Longreach or Rockhampton, as it is for people in the large capital cities, which seem so often to be the centre of our nation's life. For those reasons, I commend the motion to the House and I urge the government to take seriously assistance for students from places like my electorate in coming to Canberra to learn about these important institutions of our democracy.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Parliamentary Education Program</title>,Private Members' Business,1,1,speech
"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2004-05-31,"—I too am pleased to speak on this private member's motion on the parliamentary education program, and I commend the member for Swan on bringing this matter to the House. It is no accident that three of the speakers on the list are from Western Australia, a far-flung state. It is pretty obvious that the members for Capricornia and for Lingiari experience the same problems with students in their electorates as we do. The member for Casey will be speaking shortly, and I am sure he will also have a good case to put about students from his electorate facing challenges in participating in the national education program of this parliament. The parliamentary education program is a very important part of the national civics program. Far too often, people have very little understanding of what actually happens in this great parliament of Australia. I find it amazing—when I am doorknocking, for example—that half the time so many people do not know which parliament I belong to.
People can go down to their local city, sit in the chamber there get and get an impression of the size of the city of Mandurah or, in the case of the member for Swan, the city of Belmont, or whatever. Then they can go to the state parliament, and they think that is awesome. But if they think that is awesome, when they come to Canberra they are absolutely blown out of the water. The dimensions of the parliament in Canberra totally outrival anything that any other chamber in this country has, and it puts the parliament in perspective in terms of relevance on a national scale.
When this building was finished in 1988, it cost a billion dollars—imagine what it would cost if it were being built today. This is probably the greatest building in Australia—not just because of its outlook and its ambience but also because it is the home of democracy in Australia. For students to come and actually see what happens here is far better than any textbook or lecture that they could receive from the teacher in their classroom. They say that a picture is worth a thousand words. For students from my electorate of Canning in Western Australia, actual hands-on experience in Canberra—seeing this building and seeing it operating—is something they can only dream about. 
It is true that only a handful of schools from my electorate come to this House. One of the schools that comes quite regularly is the Armadale Christian College. Of course, it is far more efficient to fly to Canberra, but airfares from Western Australia—even on a school and student basis—are still very dear. The member for Kalgoorlie did not have time to mention this, but for a direct flight—walking in off the street from his electorate, for example—it costs over $2,000 to get here. That is dearer than flying to London return. That is the challenge we have. It is dearer to fly to Canberra than it is to fly economy to London. This is why this subsidy of $230 is inadequate. Jetstar, an economy air service, has just started in Australia; but even with economy airlines such as Virgin, unless you book well in advance or get a cheap Internet fare, it is still a great amount of money. As has been said before, a lot of fundraising goes into these trips, and the parents—particularly parents from low socioeconomic backgrounds—have a great challenge in contributing to their students' travel to Canberra. It is all about priorities.
Mr Albert Cooper, the Principal of Armadale Christian College, has made coming here a part of the annual school program. He comes by bus with the Ellenbrook and Mundaring Christian colleges. They come with 35 students per bus. They make the $230 work for them as much as possible, because they then go on to Sydney to look at convict heritage in parts of Sydney and then they go via Sovereign Hill and Ballarat and look at the display on the Eureka Stockade in that region. It is a great education program for students from my state. Maybe the cost should be looked at as a percentage of the cost from our states rather than one ambit figure of $230. A percentage of the whole fare would be more desirable than one set figure.
I commend this motion to the House. It does need further review for the students from outlying states such as ours. We are not getting equality on this matter, and I urge the House to act seriously on this matter.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Parliamentary Education Program</title>,Private Members' Business,1,1,speech
"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2004-05-31,"—I would like to commend the private member's motion which is before the House today, and I thank the member for Swan for his initiative in putting it forward. I would also like to recognise the contributions and arguments that have been put by the member for Swan, the member for Capricornia and the member for Kalgoorlie—someone with whom I am not often in agreement, but with whom I do agree on this occasion.
At the beginning of this month, my office here in Canberra was visited by a group of year 11 legal studies students from Kalkaringi. For those of you who do not know—and I am sure most of you do know—Kalkaringi is in the Victoria River district on the Western Australia-Northern Territory border. It was the home of Vincent Lingiari who was, in many senses, the father of land rights. He was acknowledged on Friday at Reconciliation Place. As others have said, these students made their way to Canberra because of the importance of the visit to their education, to understand how a parliament works, how a democracy works, how the other institutions of government work, and how the High Court works. When they came here, we were able to show them around the parliament, as we have done with other students. Last year we had three school groups come here from the Northern Territory; this year there will be seven.  
I know Kalkaringi very well. I have been there over many years on many occasions, but I think it is worthwhile understanding that, for people who live in these very small and remote communities, a visit to Canberra and the parliament is a hands-on experience like no other. In my view, it is something which we need to be promoting far more than we currently do. An impediment to these schools coming from the Northern Territory and other remote parts of Australia is clearly the cost and the difficulty in getting here. I will use the Kalkaringi students as an example. So that these young Australians could take part in the parliamentary education program, they had to drive from Kalkaringi to Darwin, a distance of about 600 kilometres, about half of which is on the unsealed Buntine Highway and is often quite dangerous—that is if the weather is propitious and allows you to drive on those roads, because at some times of the year you cannot travel on them.
After arriving in Darwin they then had to fly to Adelaide, which is a flying time of about four hours, and then from Adelaide to Canberra, which takes another hour and a half or so. The rebate these students got for their travel expenses was $230 per student. The cost, of course, was far in excess of that. Whilst it may be convenient for students from parts of the eastern states closer to Canberra to travel by road, it is not a practical way for students from my electorate to get here. Some do, but the time and inconvenience involved is extreme. To travel from Kalkaringi to Canberra and return, for example, would be in most cases at least a six- or seven-day round trip. Travel by air is in reality the only practical way to get reasonably sized groups of students to Canberra.
If you live close to Canberra—for example, in Sydney or somewhere up or down the coast, like Bateman's Bay or Melbourne—you could pool the rebates that you get, whether it is $15 or $40, hire a bus and be here overnight. That is simply not the case for people who live in remote parts of Australia. It highlights the inadequacy of this educational provision. In my view, you would at least need to double if not triple it to provide the incentives required and, along with the fundraising that needs to be done in school communities, provide the opportunity for many more students to come to Canberra. That, I think, ought to be our objective: to give students the opportunity, wherever they come from, whatever their socioeconomic background and however remote their homes might be, an opportunity to visit this place, see parliament in action, see Super Sid sitting at the table—
—and make a contribution to our parliament and our democracy. It is, after all, a fundamental piece of civics education. We should be proud to be here as parliamentarians and I am sure that we all are. We should be equally proud to show young Australians what this place means, how it works and how laws are made. We should show them what it means to them as citizens to be able to vote, why they vote, when they vote and what it means eventually in terms of a democratic outcome.

"Smith, Anthony, MP",LP,2004-05-31,"—I thank the members who have spoken before me and I associate myself with the motion of the member for Swan. I indicate my support for not just the intent but also the substance of all of the parts of the motion. I would like to start by saying what a great job the Parliamentary Education Office does. Those of us who have school groups that come through—and, as someone from an outer suburban and partly rural electorate on the outskirts of Melbourne, I have a number of schools that are able to make the trip—they do a wonderful job. The staff are very hardworking and the programs they run really enrich the kids. I agree with all of the previous speakers on the importance of school kids, particularly kids of primary school age, seeing first-hand the operation of our parliament. 
From my electorate I have had 14 school visits so far, with another four planned this year. It is a testament to the Parliamentary Education Office that most of those school visits are repeat visits. Once they make the trip to Canberra—and, no matter where they come from in any of our electorates, that involves a great deal of sacrifice on the part of the schools—they find it very worth while and it becomes the regular feature of their year. Obviously, from Melbourne there is the capacity to fly at a much cheaper rate. Also, there is the capacity to use buses and make that trip within a day or so. Not every school is able to do that. What I would like to see is increasing resources, if we can, for all schools. I agree that the visits program is a vital component of nourishing and enriching our democracy, as the earlier speakers said.
It is particularly critical, I think, for kids of primary school age, who find parliament reasonably remote and who are learning at that early age about our democracy and how it all works. It is the case that many people, particularly school students, feel remote from their parliament and from parliamentary democracy. There are many reasons for that. This motion goes to one of those reasons—that is, lack of familiarity, not having been to Canberra and seen Parliament House and how it operates. As one of the earlier speakers said, there is nothing like seeing first-hand the operation of parliament—coming to the national capital; seeing the House of Representatives operating as it is right now, not just in question time but in debate; seeing the operation of committees; seeing members of parliament from all political persuasions; seeing officers such as the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker and the Usher of the Black Rod; and gaining a real comprehension of how parliament works. That is absolutely vital.
Before school kids come to Canberra—and I know this from the number of visits I have had—most of them see parliament only very fleetingly, perhaps on a sitting day through the nightly news, where they might see a bit of argy-bargy in question time. I do not say that as a criticism of the media, which is duty-bound to cover what is interesting and lively. Nevertheless, the outtake of that is that the coverage is quite narrow for school students and, in fact, for everybody in the community. It is only when they actually come here and see the parliament operating that they see the full range of aspects of parliamentary life and the broader legislative work that goes on here. It is only by coming here that that is conveyed.
There would not be a school group or school student who comes here who does not go away enriched and with a greater understanding of our parliamentary system and parliamentary democracy. That is why we need to do all that we can to extend that to as many school students as we can, right across our electorates and right across the country, to make sure that as many students as possible have that opportunity. Last year more than 100,000 students came through and I think more than 2,000 schools were able to participate in one form or another. The Parliamentary Education Office do this on a very small budget. The budget for their activities in this building is about half a million dollars. (Time expired)

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2004-05-31,"—I inform the House that I have written to the ACCC asking them to help Australian families to get a fair deal at the petrol pump. I have asked the ACCC to investigate the abuse of market power by the big oil companies and major retailers that prevents independent petrol suppliers in this country from operating on a level playing field. Many smaller independent petrol suppliers are forced to purchase petrol at higher prices than their counterparts—that is, the big oil companies and organisations such as Woolworths and Coles. As some of you present today may be aware, I spoke on this issue in the House just a few weeks ago and days before the announcement by Labor leader, Mark Latham, that Labor would enforce stricter competition in the industry to keep petrol prices down. 
Since then, I am pleased to announce that Labor has sought to tackle this issue head on. Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition outlined Labor's six-point plan aimed at reducing the financial pressure that high petrol prices have on the average Australian family. Labor's plan includes: (1) amending the Trade Practices Act; (2) allowing independent wholesalers and retailers to bargain collectively; (3) outlawing predatory pricing; (4) giving the ACCC the power to issue cease and desist orders; (5) granting courts a new power; and (6) establishing a yellow card system so the ACCC can keep a register of bona fide complaints of misuse of market power. I commend this move, and I call on the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to play its part in helping Australians get a fairer go and in driving down the cost of petrol.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Petrol Prices</title>,Statements by Members,2,1,speech
"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2004-05-31,"—My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of reports that the government is intending to reduce the size of the planned graphic warnings on cigarette packs from 50 per cent of the front of the pack to 30 per cent? Is the Prime Minister aware that 50 per cent graphic warnings on the front of cigarette packs have led to a three per cent reduction in smoking in Canada, which if replicated here would save lives and, according to an economic study commissioned by the government, would save the Commonwealth $2 billion? On this, World No Tobacco Day, will the Prime Minister now guarantee that 50 per cent graphic warnings on cigarette packs will be introduced as soon as possible?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health: Tobacco</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2004-05-31,"—My recollection of this is that there are two proposals which have gone out for public consultation. One is for 50 per cent of the front and 50 per cent of the back to be a graphic health warning. The other is for 90 per cent of the back and 30 per cent of the front to be a graphic health warning. So, one way or another, more than 50 per cent of the packet will be a graphic health warning. I make the point that this government has a very good record on discouraging smoking, which is of course the largest preventable cause of death in Australia. Since 1996, the percentage of the adult population smoking has dropped considerably to under 20 per cent, which is amongst the lowest smoking rates in the world.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health: Tobacco</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,answer
"Mr HOWARD,MP",LP,2004-05-31,"—Mr Speaker, I seek the indulgence of the chair to add to an answer.
—The Prime Minister may proceed.
—In relation to a question I was asked by the Leader of the Opposition about smoking, I wish to inform the House that, according to the most recent figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, daily smoking rates for smokers aged over 14 years have fallen from 21.8 per cent in 1998 to 19.5 per cent in 2001. That makes our rate amongst the lowest of any country in the world. Also, in the interests of accuracy—which is always important—the Leader of the Opposition, in asking me a question, quoted a figure of $21.1 billion as being the figure for the health costs of smoking. Could I point out to him that the Collins and Lapsley estimate in 1998-99 referred to this figure of $21.1 billion, which is obviously the figure that the Leader of the Opposition referred to This figure includes lost production costs arising from mortality and morbidity, reflecting the loss of otherwise productive members of society—health care costs being only one of the items—the value of life lost to the deceased and a deduction for the consumption benefits of tobacco use to smokers. In other words, it was not just health costs. Some may think that is a small point, but the Leader of the Opposition is very good at skimming over the detail. His $21.1 billion figure was not all health costs; it included all of those other calculations. He should have known that or, better still, if he did know it, he should have correctly asked the question.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Health: Tobacco</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,speech

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2004-05-31,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	acknowledges that brain tumours can cause immense distress to those who are diagnosed with them, their carers, family and loved ones;
(2)	notes that:
(a)	1400 Australians annually are diagnosed with a primary brain tumour;
(b)	United States' data suggests that statistically there will be almost as many Australians diagnosed with benign brain tumours, many of which can be life threatening; and
(c)	an even greater number are diagnosed with a metastatic brain tumour;
(3)	notes that brain tumours, unlike some other malignant neoplasms, affect both males and females in all age groups from birth to old age and are now responsible for the cancer deaths of more children under 14 years of age than all types of leukaemia;
(4)	notes that while the incidence of brain tumours is ranked 13th in a list of all cancers in Australia, they rank 4th in a table of the total number of person years of life lost (PYLL) as a result of deaths attributed to cancer;
(5)	notes that, as yet, there does not appear to be any identifiable single cause of primary brain tumours, nor is there an efficient, safe, and cost effective method of screening for them, nor are they necessarily preventable by changes in diet or lifestyle, although these may be useful in alleviating distress and symptoms; and
(6)	calls on the Federal Government to recognise:
(a)	the need for a specialised response to the challenge caused by brain tumours, particularly in the areas of patient and carer support; and
(b)	the need for increased support for research, including the collection of more detailed clinical and statistical data, particularly by way of data sets and a brain tumour registry, with a view to developing better treatment protocols leading to longer survival and a better quality of life.
Tumours of any kind are serious and in many cases life threatening, but brain tumours have different dimensions from other tumours. The brain has a very different function from other parts of the body. We are barely aware that it controls bodily functions such as breathing, blood circulation, maintaining body temperature, motion, the production of hormones and the digestion of food. It also interprets information from our senses and controls our thoughts. Brain tumours can take two forms, either benign or malignant. There are 40 major types of brain tumour. Fourteen thousand people a year are diagnosed with brain tumours in Australia. They can be children or adults. The symptoms are very wide and varied. They can include speech and memory problems, headaches, and hearing, visual and taste problems. Many other symptoms can indicate that a person has some form of brain tumour. 
The treatments undergone by people who suffer from brain tumours have a number of side effects. Not only do brain tumours affect the physical functioning of a person but they also affect their cognitive function, their memory—both short and long term—and their emotional behaviour. Also, people who have had brain tumours can become very different people. Some of them become quite violent, some suffer from depression and some experience side effects such as epilepsy.
I am the patron of the Hunter branch of the Australian Brain Tumour Network. As such, I have come into contact with a number of people, and their families, who have suffered from brain tumours. Only this morning I was speaking to Jacqui, who lost her husband, Michael. One of the things that she identified as being very important was support for carers. People who suffer from brain tumours look okay. Their symptoms are masked. She says that when she went to network meetings she sometimes felt like it was a single mothers' club. Two weeks before her husband died he went to the doctor and the doctor said he was okay. So the symptoms of brain tumours are masked and it is understandable that people do not recognise them. People do not realise just how seriously ill a person with a brain tumour is. Lorraine's partner, Chris, died about 12 months ago. They had problems dealing with bureaucracy because, once again, he looked fine. He had been working as a coalminer. He had problems dealing with the Child Support Agency and he had problems being deemed eligible by Centrelink for the disability support pension.
A very close friend of mine had a neuroma. The only symptom he had was a total loss of hearing. Subsequently, he had an operation and he now operates fairly normally. Another friend of mine suffers from von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, which is a genetic disorder that leads to tumours of the brain, and he is fighting an ongoing battle with brain tumours. A young person within my electorate, Matthew Heaney, was diagnosed with a brain tumour when he was quite young. He had operations and treatment but after a period of time he died and his family has since worked to raise funds and awareness to fight the disease. These losses affect not only the people with the tumours but their families. Brain tumours change the lives of every person involved—not only the person who has the tumour but anyone who has contact or is associated with that person.
Today I call on all levels of government to recognise the enormous cost of brain tumours to our society, the enormous cost to the individuals who suffer from them and to their families. I call on governments to invest in the future of Australia by committing to more research into, and more education on, the cause and treatment of brain tumours. Brain tumours attack the centre, the core of a person. They are pervasive and invasive and they leave a lasting impact on that person. We need action right now to attack this serious, debilitating illness. I commend this motion to the House and ask all members to join with me in supporting it.
 (Mr Jenkins)—Is the motion seconded?",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Brain Tumours</title>,Private Members' Business,9,1,speech
"Nairn, Gary, MP",LP,2004-05-31,"—I second the motion. I strongly support the terms of the motion. Brain tumours are not the most common types of cancer, but nonetheless they are very debilitating and serious. They affect young people and old people; they affect males and females. There is a real difference between brain tumours and other cancers. Other cancers are usually more easily removed than a brain tumour. The protective structures of the brain make it very difficult to tackle brain tumours medically. 
Greater community understanding of the special challenges faced by brain tumour patients and their carers is needed so that we can avoid misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis. Also, recognition is needed that sometimes it is necessary to use expensive image-scanning facilities and expensive chemotherapy regimes to monitor and fight the disease. There needs to be strong, supportive care and access to current information on treatment options, not only for the patient but for family members who are also struggling to come to terms with the enormity of the situation they suddenly find themselves in. The impact of diagnosis is felt not only physically but emotionally, psychologically and financially by all involved.
Brain tumours can affect many of the normal functions of the brain, such as speech, movement, balance or memory. Patients often require help from allied health professionals, such as speech, physio and occupational therapists. However, such health professionals are often not readily available or accessible for rural patients. Many patients, while able to be cared for at home, lose their independence in the process, which has a significant impact on their life and the lives of their family members. They require strong support from carers, be they family, friends or formal home-care services.
Research is being done in Australia and overseas but, obviously, more is needed to gain a greater understanding of this type of cancer and to assist in developing new treatment protocols. I was pleased to see that, in last year's budget for 2003-04, there was an allocation of $2 million for the Brain Research Institute for a computer upgrade to enhance research and diagnostic ability, but more in that area needs to be done.
Whilst the disease affects people indiscriminately, regardless of where they live, rural patients face some additional difficulties in coping. Travel and accommodation costs when accessing medical services in the city areas for lengthy periods is certainly a challenge. Some states require patients to live more than 200 kilometres from their treatment centre in order to claim travel and accommodation costs, which are then paid retrospectively. I have been talking with the state member for Bega in my electorate, Andrew Constance, about what he might do to get that distance reduced in New South Wales. In Victoria, for instance, the distance is only 80 kilometres before people become eligible.
The disruption to family life and the need for care arrangements for children when accessing treatment services is also an issue. Often there is no access to adequate in-home care services. Many juggle care responsibilities while trying to maintain a business and a family life, so more needs to be done, particularly in those rural areas. It can really be a great challenge to those patients when they are away from home for periods of time and then back again.
Whilst the number of those in the Eden-Monaro region suffering from a primary brain tumour is not numerically large, the disease can have an overwhelming effect on the patient, their family and carers. I was contacted by Paul, aged 33, and his wife, Natasha, aged 31, from Merimbula. They have two girls aged two and four and they own and run an electrical business in Merimbula. Paul was suffering from frequent migraines midway through last year. They initially thought the cause was mainly stress from work but decided to have a check-up with his local GP. He was diagnosed, after an MRI scan, with an inoperable brain tumour. They have had to spend many weeks in Sydney, which has been very difficult as they are still trying to keep their business going. They are getting their travel expenses back but often many months later. It is certainly a big challenge and they have large out-of-pocket expenses. They found approaching Centrelink and going through the volume of paperwork quite challenging. People like that need additional support, and that is what this motion is about. Brain Tumour Australia Inc. do an excellent job, and I thank them and the chair, Denis Strangman, for the information that they have provided to me.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2004-05-31,"—I rise to support the motion. I thank the member for Shortland for bringing such an important matter to the attention of this House. Clearly, there are many Australians that suffer from brain tumours and the consequential effects of such an illness. I think it is very important that there are motions such as these—that is, motions that go to particular illnesses, including those that do not always receive a lot of public attention. The great role that I hope we as members of parliament can play is to not only inform ourselves about some of these things that we may not have come across directly or personally but also, using the information we receive, hopefully impart knowledge through the parliament and public forums to educate many of the public who are not aware of some of the devastating effects that brain tumours have upon certain individuals, their families and the community at large.
I also thank Dr Strangman, the Chair of Brain Tumour Australia, for providing me—and I am sure other contributors to this debate—with a whole range of information on brain tumours, which I have had the opportunity to read. I know that some of the material comes from Brain Tumour Australia and some of the material that was enclosed was developed by the New South Wales Cancer Council, and I thank them also. I am also in receipt of some emails from a number of people who it would appear have been very much affected by brain tumours one way or the other. I thank Jane Cruickshank, Marg Henley and Clare Vivian, whose husband passed away as a result of a brain tumour, for their kind words and support. They have thanked us for our role in supporting brain tumour sufferers.
Being given an opportunity to speak on this matter has compelled me to read more on the topic. I have managed to become acquainted with Brain Tumour Australia's publication, Brainstorm News. I found it very interesting reading. There is no better way to touch another person than by personalising a matter—in this case, personalising the effects of brain tumours. In this publication, I read a personal story by Malcolm Sandstrom, who talked about his illness. He was diagnosed with a brain tumour and it took him some time to realise that the symptoms he experienced were, indeed, a result of a brain tumour. He managed to get help and successfully have an operation. However, he does emphasise the lack of support, especially from specialists, after the operation and talks about the need for greater care of, and advice and support to, sufferers post operation. I think that those reflections by a sufferer really do get to the nub of the problem in relation to this issue. I think it is important.
I therefore join the member for Shortland and say that we could do more. We should be focusing upon the sufferers and their families and realising that this is not just a mental disease but a physical and emotional problem and that the sufferers and their families should therefore be cared for in a holistic manner. By bringing this motion to the attention of this place, I hope that we can ensure that there will be proper regard for the breadth of the concerns that affect sufferers of this disease.

"Washer, Dr Mal, MP",LP,2004-05-31,"—I certainly support this motion and thank the member for Shortland for bringing this to the attention of the House. Neoplasms of the brain and spinal cord are divided into two groups: primary nervous system tumours and metastatic or secondary nervous system tumours. Today we have spoken about primary tumours, and that is what I intend to discuss further. Primary tumours develop from glial cell precursors, meninges and associated structures, such as pituitary and pineal glands. Annually, 1,400 Australians are diagnosed with primary brain tumours, and a greater number with metastatic tumours. Although the incidence of brain tumours increases with age and is more common in the elderly, brain tumours are the most common solid tumour of childhood.
Tumours are classified by their cellular origin. The majority of brain and spinal cord tumours are of neuroepithelial origin—that is, glial cells or their precursors. They are classified as either high- or low-grade, according to poor or good prognosis. We do not describe them as benign or malignant as we would with other tumours, because benign tumours infiltrate normal tissue and therefore prevent total surgical resection. Rarely do these tumours truly act as malignant and metastasise. The environmental risk factors include ionising radiation, so there is an increase in meningiomas and glial tumours with radiation for intra- or extra-cranial tumours and prophylactic irradiation for leukaemia.
HIV infection and other immunosuppressive disorders constitute risk factors for primary CNS lymphomas. Exposure to electromagnetic radiation, like mobile phones, has never been proven to cause brain tumours. Inherited factors are a minor cause of brain tumours. However, acquired genetic abnormalities are associated with CNS tumours. These include the loss or mutation of a tumour suppressor gene—for example, p53 or the retinoblastoma gene—and the amplification or rearrangement of oncogenes, or cancer genes, many of which code for growth factors or growth factor receptors that can self-stimulate tumour cells. CNS tumours, even when relatively small, often cause symptoms. First, they may damage vital pathways of the brain and spinal cord, causing severe dysfunction; second, they are encased in unyielding dura and bone, and compression of normal tissue occurs easily; third, the new tumour vessels leak proteins and potentially noxious substances, causing surrounding tissue oedema and aggregating compression of normal structures—oedema removal is slow, as the brain lacks lymphatics; and, fourth, tumours in the third and fourth ventricle obstruct cerebrospinal fluid pathways, causing hydrocephalus.
We would suspect brain tumours in adults with new onset seizures, papilledema or new focal, motor or sensory symptoms. These people warrant an MRI, with an injection of contrast material. Although MRI may suggest the histological diagnosis, only biopsy is definitive. Positron emission tomography, PET, with positron emitting radionuclides, or single photon emission computed tomography, SPECT, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, MRS, may be useful for non-invasive methods of determining histological type and grade of tumour.
Treatments include: (1) corticosteroids, which reduce intracranial pressure and reduce oedema; (2) surgery followed by corticosteroids for intracranial tumours that arise outside the brain, such as meningiomas, schwannomas and pituitary adenomas—surgery for tumours arising within the brain establishes the diagnosis, relieves intracranial pressure, and improves symptoms and seizure control; (3) radiation therapy, particularly post-operative, improves survival and quality of life, particularly in high-grade tumours; (4) chemotherapy, with the exception of oligodendrogliomas, germ cell tumours and medulloblastomas, generally has a very limited response. I certainly support the carers of people with brain tumours—they have a terribly difficult job—and I strongly advocate, along with my colleagues in this House, the need for greater research. That is where the breakthrough is going to be in the future. ",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Brain Tumours</title>,Private Members' Business,9,1,speech
"Hatton, Michael, MP",ALP,2004-05-31,"—My Uncle Lenny was 38 years of age. He was running 20 kilometres a day, preparing to run a marathon. At the end of a run he would go off to the pub in Surfers Paradise, where he was well known. He had been there for 20 years or so and had had a series of jobs. He would have a beer, and after his beer he would get a funny sort of feeling, because his foot would start to flop and flap around a bit, so he went to see a GP. The general practitioner told him it was just stupid; there was nothing to it at all. Six months later he went back to the GP because, every time he went for a run and had a beer afterwards, the same thing was happening but a bit more. That was when he was 38. When he was 47 he died in St Joseph's Hospital in Auburn as a result of a brain tumour that was extremely slow growing. They could not cut out Lenny's brain tumour—it was in the very central part of his brain. They could not even do a biopsy on it, until one very smart surgeon realised that if you encased the needle in a bit of plastic then the danger of causing significant damage to the person was cut to about five to 10 per cent.
When they did the biopsy, they were simply able to tell Lenny that, yes, it was a brain tumour, it would be years, probably, until it grew enough to kill him, but there was nothing that they could do to ameliorate it. They could not cut it out, they could not use chemotherapy, they could not use radiotherapy—he would just have to live with the fact that, inexorably, this is what would take him out. After a great deal of suffering, having fought it for nine years and having had the rest of my family, by and large, encourage him to keep fighting what was utterly inevitable, he had got to the point where, if you sat on the edge of his bed in the hospice or even touched the bed, the pain was so intense that it was like pins and needles throughout his whole body. I had to be the one to tell him just to give it up, to leave it alone, to accept the fact that he was dying and that he could not keep going and trying to push forward to beat this thing, because it was harder than he was. It was a very long, slow, difficult death.
My wife's son died from a glioblastoma more than 10 years ago. It was a very quick death. He had an original operation which took out the blastoma. He then expected that it was successful and that he would be able to live. He and his wife had a child, who is now a teenager. But just after the birth of their child the blastoma returned and, because it was so aggressive, Robert was dead about nine months from when they first diagnosed its return.
These are two of the counterbalances in the experience of people: either the rapidity of a glioblastoma or the slow, long, inexorable death from a slow-growing cancer. In either case, it is the carers, the family members, who are impacted upon, because the very first thing that people do is rush to try and find out as much as they can and see if there is a ready cure off the shelf. And part of the great trauma when it comes to brain tumours is that there is no ready cure that can be brought in off the shelf. Glioblastomas are so rapid, so high-grade, that the probability of getting over them is very small. 
Things are getting better; the chances of recovery are increasing. Ten years ago, work was being done in Japan utilising new techniques—nuclear medicine, I think, and so on—to try to get a better result for people who suffer this insidiously quick and ravaging death. But it is not easy and it is not simple. The hardest problem I think people face is the lack of simple knowledge, simply given to people. There is a great deal that is arcane in this area. The latter part of this motion is extremely important—not just the support for carers and extra research but the fact that, if people can have a relationship with their doctors and health professionals where the nature of what is facing them is better explained, they can then deal with those realities on a surer footing. It is the great unknowns, the great dangers, that actually increase the suffering. I support this absolutely.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Brain Tumours</title>,Private Members' Business,9,1,speech
"Johnson, Michael, MP",LP,2004-05-31,"—I am pleased to speak in the parliament today on this motion moved by the member for Shortland. I compliment her on it and also thank my colleagues on both sides of the House for their support of the motion. In particular, I am pleased to follow the distinguished member for Moore, who is himself a medical practitioner. I acknowledge his dedication in the field of medicine before coming to this place.
The brain is of course a unique part of our body. I think it is probably reasonable to say that it separates us, as human beings, from other forms of life. It provides us with our personality and our intelligence, and there is still very little that we understand about the brain. It is such a complicated and fragile organ that I am not sure if humanity will ever fully understand it.
I am particularly pleased to speak on this motion about brain tumours being something that this parliament—this country—needs to turn its attention to. One reason is that my brother is a neurosurgeon and has a very strong professional interest in this. He is a very dedicated young Australian who has turned his professional life to work in the field of neurosurgery. In fact, he has also inspired our sister Catherine, who is studying at the University of Sydney, to take an interest in this and to play a part in addressing brain tumours when she graduates from university as a doctor. I might also say that I know that the wife of the member for Flinders—whom I have the privilege of sitting next to in the parliament—is a neurosurgical nurse herself and just another example of the Australians throughout this country who dedicate their professional lives to good work for our fellow Australians.
Brain tumours, of course, are something that very few of us would wish upon our worst enemy. They are crippling to families and relatives. The previous speaker, the member for Blaxland, put a story to statistics. I want to talk about some of the statistics and to raise, in the parliament, greater awareness amongst not only members of the parliament but also the community. I do not have the opportunity of recounting, as the member for Blaxland did, a very personal story—and I pass on my sympathies to him and his wife—but I want to talk about the 1,400 new cases of Australians every year who are diagnosed with malignant brain tumours and the hundreds more who are diagnosed with benign brain tumours. These are deadly if the tumour is in a vital area. More than 1,200 people die each year from malignant and benign brain tumours. The number of cases of malignant brain tumours in Australia has increased by more than 20 per cent over the last 10 years. I think that is a very striking figure that we in this country must turn the very best of our medical researchers and specialists to addressing. 
As I said, my brother is a neurosurgeon, and I conveyed to him that I would be speaking on this motion in the parliament today. I asked him if he would give me, as a layman, a sentence that I could use. The statement he gave me really struck me, and I want to quote him. Dr David Johnson, from the Gold Coast Hospital, said that brain tumours:
... are a very small percentage of the overall tumour burden in humans (approx 2%) but by the nature of location they strike the very soul of the person and incapacitate not only physically but emotionally and cognitively.
I think that is one of the things about a brain tumour: it actually strikes not only at the very heart and soul of the person who is suffering from it, it also strikes the wider family. I want to say to the parliament and to members of the community that we must turn our focus to this. We must dedicate resources, research and the very best of Australia's minds to treating neurosurgical issues. I want to thank Denis Strangman, the Chair of Brain Tumour Australia, for being in the parliament and helping speakers today.

"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2004-05-31,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	recognises the invaluable contribution that carers make to our community;
(2)	acknowledges that carers need and deserve practical support from the community to meet the significant challenges that they face on a daily basis, whether those challenges be financial, emotional or physical;
(3)	realises that it is not always desirable, possible or practical for carers and the people they care for to live in the same house and therefore they should be entitled to choose the living arrangements that best suit their individual circumstances;
(4)	praises the Howard Government for providing carers and the people they care for with a choice as to the living arrangements that best suit their circumstances as part of the 2004 Budget;
(5)	commends the Howard Government for providing carers receiving the Carers Payment with a one-off payment of $1000 and $600 for Carer Allowance recipients for each eligible care receiver they provide care for as part of the 2004 Budget in recognition of their contribution to the community;
(6)	supports the Howard Government's provision of an in-home respite service of up to 5 hours per school week for young carers at risk of leaving secondary school or equivalent vocational education as part of the 2004 Budget;
(7)	commends the Howard Government for providing young at-risk carers one fortnight of respite care each year to undertake activities such as study for exams, training or recreation as part of the 2004 Budget;
(8)	strongly supports the Howard Government for guaranteeing, when matched by States and Territories, up to four weeks a year respite for parents over 70 years of age who are caring for a son or daughter with a disability and, for parents aged 65 to 69 years of age who need to spend time in hospital, two weeks respite as part of the 2004 Budget, and calls on the States and Territories to demonstrate their support for carers by matching this commitment; and
(9)	commends the Howard Government for initiating a strategy to work with the States and Territories and the carer and disability sectors to develop options to help ageing carers plan for the future when they can no longer provide care for their disabled children. 
In every electorate, in every town in every corner of Australia, there are people who are carers. During the course of my time in this House representing people from the Mornington Peninsula, from Westernport and throughout that area of Victoria, I have come into contact with people such as Bill Skinner. Bill Skinner lives in Nyora and, with other members of his family, he takes care of somebody. It is an arduous, difficult task to be a full-time carer—to take care of somebody who is reliant upon you for many of their physical, emotional and social needs. It is an extraordinary burden. 
Only two weeks ago, I met with Milton and Margaret Omond. Milton Omond was a fine, hardworking man who suffered a terrible accident over a decade ago. In the time since then, his wife, Margaret, has had the responsibility of caring for him. They come from Hastings and they live under difficult circumstances. Things are not easy for them. They have a close relationship and she has sacrificed much in order to care and provide for Milton and, above all else, to provide a loving home base for him. This couple represent the very essence of what carers are. In moving this motion, I sought to say `thank you'—as I believe all members of this House would like to say—to those people who are carers. They may be people such as the Gippsland Carers Association or people in any of our towns—whether it be Hastings, Nyora, Somerville, Rosebud or any one of the towns throughout Australia where there are carers.
There are more than 81,000 people nationwide who are effectively full-time carers and are recipients of carer payments. There are another 290,000 people—with some overlap—who receive carers allowance. That means that they give significant care and attention to those in need of it. In addition to those, there are many who may not be recognised through formal government payments but who contribute and assist. Their role is a deeply important one at a human level. In each situation their role is critical. That is why I believe that the recent announcements during the federal budget were critical. They were an extremely important step forward. First and most importantly, there is a total budget payment of $461 million for assistance to carers. In practice, that means a recognition that there are significant hardships and significant social benefits associated with caring.
Immediately, before 1 July 2004, there will be a total payout of $255 million to carers. Under the carer payment, recipients will receive a one-off payment of $1,000; and, under the carer allowance, recipients will receive a one-off payment of $600. In some cases, carers who work hard and work full-time will receive $1,600 in immediate benefits. I know, from having talked to one family recently, that this payment may well make the difference to their ability to keep their head above water. You cannot legislate for financial success in every case, but what you can do is to help and assist, and these payments make a real and profound difference to families in need. In addition to that, the eligibility criteria for the carer allowance will be expanded. That is an important step forward which means that people who are not necessarily living with the patient will be able to receive assistance. Furthermore, there will be support in terms of two weeks respite and five hours per week of assistance for young carers, and there will be up to four weeks respite for people who are older carers.
There is more to be done; make no mistake about it. In discussions I have had with the member for McPherson, she has talked about the very great need to ensure that young people with disabilities and disadvantages have a safe and secure environment when they leave school and when their parents are also facing death. The great questions for the parents are: `What will happen to my son or daughter after I die? Who will take care of them?' That is the next great step forward in the treatment of those who need care. Above all else, I say thank you to those who are carers, and I put my respect on the record. (Time expired)

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2004-05-31,"—I join with the member for Flinders in thanking those who are carers and acknowledging the role that they play in our community. Carers make an invaluable contribution to our community—one that cannot be measured in terms of their financial contribution. Their contribution is much greater than that. Carers are part of the backbone of our nation. Through their care, love and understanding, they make life worth living for the person they care for. Through their contribution they save government millions and millions of dollars. But, unfortunately, their contributions are not always recognised by government, nor are the hardships and difficulties that they experience.
This motion does acknowledge the role of carers, but, unfortunately, it has a rather self-congratulatory tone to it. It is congratulating the government on giving a one-off payment of $1,000 or $600 or a combination of those to carers, depending on whatever payment they receive. I would argue very strongly that carers deserve more than this. Carers deserve ongoing support and commitment from government of all types and not only at a time when there is an election. They deserve that support from their parliament, their government and their representatives in this House every single day. It leaves a very bad taste in my mouth that we are debating a motion that, on the one hand, acknowledges the fine role and great work that carers do in our community but, on the other hand, congratulates the government.
The motion also mentions respite and the increase in respite care. The availability of respite care, I find, is the greatest problem for people living in my area. I represent the 10th oldest electorate in Australia. I know just how hard it is to find a respite bed. You can increase the amount of respite that a person is entitled to but that respite has to be available in the first place. That needs to be looked at very seriously by government.
I have talked to one of the largest dementia specific services within the Hunter. It is funded by both the federal and state governments. In talking to this organisation I was told that the average age of carers is 80 years. These are frail aged people themselves and they are caring for demented spouses or members of their family. It seems to me that these people need a lot more support than they are being given at the moment. They need more than $600 or $1,000; they need ongoing support from their government, support on a daily basis and the ability to access the services that the government talks about but that they are unable to access in the local area. There is an increasing need for dementia specific community aged care packages in my area. These packages will make the lives of carers much better.
In the previous motion that was before this House, I spoke about brain tumours. When speaking on that motion I mentioned a constituent within my electorate. The one thing that she emphasised to me was that, when her husband was sick, there was a lack of support. There is a lack of support for carers who are caring for their loved ones with critical illnesses or spouses or family members suffering from dementia. We have ageing carers. We have a deterioration in Medicare within Australia, which is putting more pressure on our carers. I call on the government not just to give one-off payments of $600 or $1,000 but to make a real commitment to carers in our society.

"May, Margaret, MP",LP,2004-05-31,"—I am delighted to support this private member's motion today. I commend the member for Flinders for bringing to the House's attention the very valuable contribution that carers make within our communities and the strong commitment that the Howard government has towards these very special people.
Since its election in 1996, the government has recognised the significant contribution that individual carers make to the lives of older Australians in particular, including many who would not otherwise be able to remain at home. There have been many studies that indicate that older Australians benefit significantly in the areas of health and mental wellbeing if they are able to stay at home and be cared for by a loved one—a carer who is prepared to meet the challenges faced on a daily basis in caring for someone within their own home. This caring role is a selfless one. There are many people in my own electorate who give up careers to care for someone they love. They face many challenges to undertake this role. The challenges they face on a daily basis can be financial, emotional or physical.
In fact, these people—the carers—also need support for the role they undertake. The government recognises the need for this support, primarily in the area of respite. In fact, the carers budget package provides $461 million for this assistance to carers. I think the House would agree that this package certainly demonstrates the very strong commitment of the Howard government. Within the package the government recognises the wide diversity of carers, their various care situations, the range of care needs and the long-term commitment of carers. In many cases, it is not always desirable or practical for carers and the people they care for to live in the same house. The government recognises this and is happy to support living arrangements that best suit individual circumstances.
Through the provision of support to carers and the recognition of individual living arrangements, the elderly in our communities who need this type of at-home care have more certainty. It gives them the choice of staying in their own homes and being cared for by a loved one. That loved one who is providing the care does not have to live in the same home. I commend the government for providing this flexibility in this year's budget. This means that, from 1 April 2005, carers who do not live with the care receiver but provide substantial levels of personal care will be able to access the carer allowance. This expansion of carer allowance eligibility is for those carers who provide substantial support on a daily basis to someone with a disability or a severe medical condition, or to someone who is frail aged.
This year's budget will also provide a one-off carer bonus to eligible carers who receive the carer payment and/or carer allowance on 11 May 2004. That will cost $255 million. Carer payment recipients will receive a one-off payment of $1,000. A carer payment provides income support to people who, because of the demands of their caring role, are unable to support themselves through substantial work force participation. Carers must provide constant care and care receivers must be assessed as needing that level of care to qualify for a carer payment.
Carer allowance recipients will receive a one-off payment of up to $600 for each eligible care receiver they provide care for. In some cases, this may be a single payment of $600, if they care for one care receiver, or multiple payments of $600, where the carer cares for more than one eligible care receiver. Most important in this year's budget is the provision of $26.6 million over four years from 1 January 2005 to provide young carers at risk of leaving school or the vocational equivalent with additional respite to ensure that they are able to both fulfil their caring responsibilities and complete their education. This measure provides additional in-home respite of up to five hours per week during school terms and up to one fortnight each year that can be taken as a block or as separate days. This is particularly important during exam periods when the young carer may need to study without the added concerns of caring. 
Of real concern to many of my constituents is the future of children with disabilities. I am approached regularly by parents who have older children with disabilities who are concerned about when they are no longer able to care for these children. Where will these children go and who will look after them? I commend the government for initiating a strategy to work with the states and territories and the disability sectors to develop options and choices for ageing parents with disabled children to give them some certainty and peace of mind about their children's future. This will be done, in the first instance, through a proposed community and disability services ministerial council. Caring for a disabled child is never easy, but without certainty for the future these selfless parents live with a cloud hanging over their heads. In my view, this proposed council must move swiftly to develop those options as soon as possible. In the short time today, there is not enough opportunity to canvass all the programs, but I indeed commend the carers in our community.

"Hoare, Kelly, MP",ALP,2004-05-31,"—Speaking on this motion of the member for Flinders, I join with my colleagues in thanking all carers who provide invaluable support to our communities. The personal sacrifices of carers are immense. Many carers care for their loved one at the expense of their own needs, health and living. The task of caring for another person who is dependent on the care provided takes its toll. This is especially true for younger carers. Personal relationships are often strained, if not lost, and social activities are rare because of the needs of the person being cared for. This may be alleviated, or at least reduced, if greater recognition of the personal costs of caring for others was recognised in Centrelink payments and respite services.
Caring is, for many, an around-the-clock activity. Some carers are forced to leave their employment to focus on the needs of loved ones. In the case of caring for a parent, some carers have experienced a break-up with their partner. The physical and emotional stress of caring cannot be understated. There are reports of carers murdering their loved ones and committing suicide because they can no longer cope. The strength and determination of carers must be admired but not taken for granted. Carers need support from the community. However, these needs are often left wanting. Whenever I have spoken with carers, the issue of respite services is always raised. Respite services need to be made available on a ready basis. Ideally, there should be a reasonably short period of time between when a booking for a respite bed is made and when the respite is provided. This is to provide the carer an important psychological boost to know that, in so many days or weeks, they will have time away from their caring responsibilities. Secondly, it allows carers much needed time to look after themselves.
Some respite services for specific conditions, such as dementia, are in high demand. Highly regarded respite providers can have waiting lists of up to two years, which is absolutely ridiculous. An unfortunate reality is that some people die before they can access these respite services, and the time frame provides the carer with nothing to look forward to. Whilst respite services are welcomed by carers, the service is not without cost. For those carers dependent on Centrelink benefits, the costs of respite are usually paid for out of their allowance. When respite is available, many carers are restricted in what they are able to access because of the severe financial constraints placed on them. The member for Flinders commended the government for providing carers receiving the carers payment with a one-off payment of $1,000 and $600 for carer allowance recipients. I welcome the much needed assistance to carers in our community who remain unsung heroes. Carers, however, deserve more long-term recognition of their invaluable contributions and not one-off election payments. They are carers for life, not for just one election.  
People with challenging behaviours also require specific respite services. Many respite services are inappropriate for people with challenging behaviours. Such arrangements can be to the detriment of others requiring care, staff and to the person with the difficult behaviour. In the situation where the cared for is violent, there is a real need for emergency respite services for the safety of both the carer and the cared for. When difficult behaviours are not obvious at all times, it can be difficult to persuade medical professionals that the need exists. The absence of adequate or appropriate respite services contributes to higher admissions of people into residential aged care facilities. At a forum I hosted to hear the views of local carers, it was clear that many more people would continue caring for their loved ones in their own homes if adequate respite services were available in a timely manner. It is important to recognise that flexibility is required in the support of carers. While many carers have universal concerns, no two situations are completely alike. Greater support in the form of financial assistance for carers and in-home services is essential.
Government must appreciate the great personal sacrifices carers make for their loved one. A great generosity of spirit on the part of policy makers is required. Carers essentially save the Commonwealth a large amount of money by reducing the need for residential aged care. In-home supported accommodation packages that can be transferred easily to residential aged care packages or the like when appropriate should be considered by government. As a community, we all have a responsibility to assist where possible in the care of those with a range of disabilities. The extraordinary people who make enormous personal sacrifice in the provision of care for a loved one who is dependent must not be treated as second-class citizens but with respect. The community's appreciation should be reflected in greater assistance for carers.

"Hull, Kay, MP",NATS,2004-05-31,"—Today it is a great pleasure to stand here and pay tribute to carers. This tribute should be paid every day, because carers deserve that much at least. We ask ourselves this question at times: what is a carer's lot in life? Many people do not understand that. When you are emotionally and physically exhausted and you just cannot get five minutes to shower, go to the toilet, eat or sleep, how do you feel as a carer? You may feel happy or contented, strange as that may seem, but the fact that your charge is alive and clean and having a better day is all that matters. You may feel despair, agony, pain and bewilderment because nothing that you do makes any difference to the reality for the person for whom you care. You may feel guilty and damn yourself because you wish that this was not happening in your life, that it was somebody else's problem or that it was all over, knowing that you have to suffer these feelings in silence because you could not possibly tell anyone how you feel—they might think you abhorrent or think of you as not caring for that person. So you suffer that in silence knowing that you can never release those feelings. 
There is no peace of mind for a carer. From the day that they take on that role of caring it is the end of peace of mind forever, because each day is filled with questions. Have you done your best? Who is going to care for your loved one if something happens to you? How do you financially future-proof your disabled child so that there are assets to care for them when you are too old or have departed from this world, when the rules state that maybe you cannot do that because you lose what little financial assistance you might get now? For those people who care for a terminally ill person, even when the inevitable happens, peace of mind is never there. Peace of mind is muddied with thoughts of, `Did I do it well enough? Did I care well enough?' It seems so strange that we as carers only remember the things that we did not do rather than all of the things that we did do. Why is it that carers accept guilt that does not belong with them? I guess that is the lot of a carer.
What of our young carers? Can anyone possibly imagine their lives? How hopeless things must seem at times when the burdens of everyday life fall entirely on their shoulders, with the inability to gain a proper education or employment, to meet with friends or to enjoy just a day of carefree existence. Many of our young carers have done this for the majority of their lives, and they see nothing else in their lives but a future caring for somebody that they love so much, although they certainly know that they would like to have a life for themselves as well. Again, guilt creeps into their lives.
Can anyone honestly know what it is like to be a carer if they have not walked in those shoes? No, I think not, because even if you have volunteered during Carers Week or you help out a friend or a family member occasionally you really do not know, because you are able to leave the responsibility behind when you walk out that door. Carers do not have a health plan for themselves, as their health takes second place. They do not have a leisure plan, they do not have a family plan, they do not have a work plan—in fact, they do not have a plan other than to care to the best of their ability, regardless of their feelings for themselves, because that is their only plan in life.
A carer can never leave behind the responsibility; it is theirs for life. Carers should get rewards here on earth; they should not have to wait till they meet their maker. I urge everyone to try and walk in the shoes of a carer, because they deserve every possible assistance on earth. Carers are the backbone of our community. They continue to provide to Australian people what no Australian government or community can provide. Governments can assist greatly. However, communities must also embrace their carers by giving them easier access to services and perhaps by providing a little well-earned relief at times so that a carer can go and do something for themselves.

"George, Jennie, MP",ALP,2004-05-31,"—I am pleased to have the opportunity this afternoon to speak in support of the sentiments expressed in the motion before the House, which goes to the heart of recognition of the invaluable contribution that carers make to our community in so many ways. All the speakers preceding me have agreed with the general thrust of the sentiments proposed by the member for Flinders, and I certainly commend the member for Riverina for the comments she just made—comments which express so well the collective views that all of us in this House share about the very valuable but often undervalued role performed by carers in the community. 
We are talking here about an estimated 2.3 million carers across the nation. We all know that the physical and emotional support provided by our caring community is priceless. It is beyond any kind of economic recognition, though in economic terms alone the work of our carers saves the Australian economy an estimated $20 billion annually. We know that their loving care comes at a very high cost to carers in terms of their own wellbeing, their quality of life, their financial security, and their opportunity to be in paid employment. As the figures show, almost 80 per cent of primary carers are of work force age.
 Primary carers, of whom there are around 450,000, ensure that many of our citizens are cared for outside an institutional setting and framework. Sixty-eight per cent of our primary carers have been providing such loving care for more than five years, and many—about 40 per cent—have been doing so for a decade or more. That is why we can all confidently say that the work that they do is priceless and their contribution often undervalued—they rate among the unsung heroes of our nation. There has been a belated recognition of their contribution in this year's budget, and that is to be welcomed. But one might ask why it has taken an impending federal election to get this government moving on so many of the longstanding grievances that have been brought to the attention of all members of parliament by those involved in caring activities.
Every MP knows the range of issues and difficulties confronting our carers, including the lack of respite places; the lack of high-care aged places and places for dementia sufferers; the lack of specialised accommodation for people with disabilities; the difficulties of placing children with disabilities in child care, due to the freeze by this government of the Special Needs Subsidy Scheme; the previously tight residency requirements for the granting of the allowance; and the problems facing our ageing carers, who wonder with a great deal of anxiety who will be left to look after their children with disabilities once they pass on.

"Edwards, Graham, MP",ALP,2004-05-31,"—I want to use this grievance debate today to raise an important issue relating to one of my constituents, Mrs Rachelle Garrison of Ballajura. Mrs Garrison has contacted me seeking an intervention on behalf of her parents because of the plight they are in. Her parents, Mr and Mrs Soma, are currently residing in Zimbabwe. They have applied to migrate to Australia under the parent migration subclass 103. They have been accepted, and their queue date is August 2001. On current trends it will take them another four years at least before they can be granted a permanent residence visa. In the interim, Mrs Garrison has written numerous letters to the PM, to the previous and the current ministers for immigration and to other members of parliament, pointing out the dire circumstances of her parents. 
Mrs Garrison has explained to me that her parents are now facing a crisis in Zimbabwe. They are struggling to meet their day-to-day living expenses in an environment where inflation is running at some 500 per cent. They are experiencing food shortages and shortages of other necessities of life for older people. Mrs Garrison has received responses from the former minister for immigration and feels that he was more interested in making political points than helping her parents—and others in Zimbabwe caught up in the dreadful regime there.
In one of his letters, former Minister Ruddock pointed out that there were 5,430 applicants ahead of Mr and Mrs Soma in the queue. He suggested that they may care to reapply under the contributory parent visa category. Indeed, he wrote to them in 2003 and said:
I am delighted to be able to advise you that the legislation I introduced for additional places under the existing parent visa category and a new contributory category will come into effect in the new financial year. These additional places will substantially increase the number of parents who are able to be reunited with their families and lessen the time that they are waiting in the queue.
Applicants for the contributory parent visa category should receive a visa more quickly than applicants for the existing category who applied at the same time.
... applicants for the new visa will pay a health charge of $25,000 per adult to apply directly for a permanent visa or they can take up an option to spread this payment by applying for a temporary two-year visa, with a first instalment of $15,000.
Of course, the problem for Mrs Garrison and her parents is that they do not have access to these large amounts of money—$50,000 in their case. Also, as Mrs Garrison points out, why should someone already in the queue have to reapply under a new category when they cannot afford to—and why should they be jumped over by those who can afford to pay?
It is also interesting to note that when this issue was raised in Senate estimates last week it was revealed that, of the new contributory category, it was anticipated that 4,500 places would be taken up. That forecast was wrong, and it is now anticipated that only 3,000 places will be taken up by the end of the financial year. That leaves a surplus of 1,500 places not used, or available, under the contributory category. The government now needs to be asked why they have not transferred those remaining places to the original non-contributory scheme and allowed those existing original applicants to fill those places—applicants, I might say, who could be assessed on the basis of need rather than on the ability to pay. I think another question that needs to be asked is: why have these contributory places not been taken up? Surely the answer is that those who languish in the original scheme simply do not have the cash capacity to switch over to the new scheme. Surely this is a question that the minister and the government should be addressing, given the dire circumstances of people who are living in Zimbabwe and who are desperate for family reunification.
Mr and Mrs Soma already have their whole family living in Perth. These family members have committed themselves to taking full responsibility for the couple when they arrive. In Mrs Garrison's case, she has no dependants and has been in secure employment for many years, so she is able to make good that commitment. I do not seek to have my constituents' parents given any special treatment. All I ask for is a fair go for this family and for other families caught up in these circumstances. 
I understand that other countries, like the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand, take a far more compassionate and humanitarian approach to these issues. These countries have not turned their backs on fellow members of the Commonwealth. Zimbabwe may be out of the Commonwealth, but its citizens remain our Commonwealth brothers and sisters and we should not desert them. Sooner or later Australia will have to face up to its responsibilities in this matter, as nothing is more certain than the fact that it is only a matter of time before Zimbabwe becomes a complete basket case. It is inevitable.
The Prime Minister has condemned the Mugabe regime, but appears to have no commitment to the situation, other than simple rhetoric. There is certainly no commitment and no compassion for those people suffering under this appalling regime. We are all aware of the dangers, the acts of continuing and escalating violence that occur in Zimbabwe, and the dire concerns and worries that loved ones living in Australia have for aged parents caught under that appalling Mugabe regime. Surely, as a growing nation in need of positive migration, we can take more of these people under this parent program. Surely, as a compassionate nation, we can understand the trauma of families caught up in these circumstances. Surely, as a nation that claims to care about terror and those caught up in such violence, we should do something more positive to ensure family reunion in these circumstances.
I appeal to the Prime Minister, the government and the minister to re-examine their policies in this area. They should show some compassion, rather than just spouting empty rhetoric or simply saying that we will take only those who can afford to pay the miserable bounty on which the current government continues to insist. I urge the government to re-examine this whole question and to re-examine their policy in this area, particularly in light of the fact that there are 1,500 places surplus: that is, 1,500 places that have not been taken up under this contributory scheme. As I said, that in itself should indicate to the government, who are aware of the desperate need of some of these people—who have loved ones in Australia—that, suffering under that dire regime, they simply cannot afford to put together the necessary cash to pay under that contributory scheme. It is unfair and it should be reviewed.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Immigration: Visa Approvals</title>,Grievance Debate,11,1,speech
"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,2004-05-31,"—I rise today to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005 and cognate bills. I want to discuss a number of issues which I believe are central to our economic performance as a nation and relate to the real situation facing families throughout the country. I want to speak in particular about our banks and, firstly, on the issue of banking fees. I would like to start off by enlightening the House about some figure work over the last few years over which this government and this Treasurer have presided. I want to talk about total domestic banking fee income, and I am quoting from Reserve Bank of Australia statistics going back to 1997. In 1997 the total bank fee income was some $4,042 million. In 1998 it went up to $4,802 million. In 1999 it went up to $5,425 million. In 2000 it went up to $6,281 million. In 2001 it went up to $7,071 million. In 2002 it went up to $7,764 million. The latest figures just released the other day for the year 2003 show that it went up to $8,674 million. That is $8.6-plus billion. 
When you subset that and go to the question of how much businesses and Australian households have been paying, you are looking at a similar sort of trend. Again, we are talking millions here. For businesses in 1997 the figure was $2,880 million. In 1998 it was $3,277 million. In 1999 it was $3,701 million. In 2000 it was $4,186 million. In 2001 it was $4,810 million. In 2002 it was $5,126 million, and in 2003 it was $5,634 million. Household fees were as follows: in 1997, $1,162 million; in 1998, $1,524 million; in 1999, $1,724 million; in 2000, $2,095 million; in 2001, $2,262 million; in 2002, $2,637 million; and in 2003 bank fees for Australian households cracked the $3 billion mark and went up to $3,039 million.
Australians are paying almost three times as much in bank fees as they did back in 1996, as best we can estimate from the figures on the trend line. Total bank fees paid by households rose by 15 per cent last year alone. The proportion of the take from households is also growing. In 2003 households contributed 35 per cent of the revenue banks net through fees and charges. In 1997 households accounted for 29 per cent. So the figure has gone up overall and the percentage take has gone up overall. Households in fact paid an average of almost $400 in bank fees last year. Again, we go back to the figures. In 1997 the average paid in bank fees was about $175 per household per year. Then it went up to $230, $254, $296, $313, $359 and, last year, $398. Almost certainly, this year it will be more.
One of the biggest areas of growth has been in credit card fees. In 2003 credit card charges totalled $604 million, up 38 per cent on the previous year and up 344 per cent since 1997. Back in 1997 the figure was $136 million, in 1998 it was $168 million, in 1999 it was $225 million, in 2000 it was $299 million, in 2001 it was $345 million, in 2002 it was $438 million and in 2003 it was $604 million. The fee per card in 2003 was $55, up from $41 per card in 2002.
I am going through these figures in a lot of detail to give you a clear idea about the trend over the last few years—the definite increases we are seeing right across the board in bank fees and charges for the Australian community. Let us have a look at some of the averages—the average banking fees of the four major banks, by type of transaction, back in June 1995 and then in June 2003. In June 1995, the average fee for counter withdrawals—that is, going into a branch and making a withdrawal over the counter—was $1. In June 2003, that was up to $2.50 on average. That is an increase of 150 per cent. To issue a cheque in 1995 cost 70c. In June 2003, it was $1.35, up some 93 per cent. Using your own bank's automatic teller machine cost 40c in 1995. It was up to 60c in 2003—again, a 50 per cent increase. Using ATMs from other banks cost 40c back in 1995. In June 2003, we are talking about fees of $1.45, which is an increase of some 262 per cent. EFTPOS transactions cost 40c back then. They were 45c in 2003, which is only a 12.5 per cent increase. I do not know what they were doing there! Back in June 1995, telephone banking was not an issue and nor was Internet banking but, even though these services were meant to be a major saving for the bank in infrastructure costs et cetera, we are still in a situation where customers are paying for them. In June 2003, telephone banking cost 45c and Internet banking cost 25c. 
When we consider the sorts of increases announced by the major banks in 2003 alone, we see that there was a litany of them. The Commonwealth Bank raised annual fees for no awards credit cards from $24 to $30, which is a 25 per cent increase. Late payment fees also rose 25 per cent, from $20 to $25, and a brand-new fee of $15 was charged for each additional cardholder. The ANZ raised late payment and over-limit fees from $25 to $35, which is a massive 40 per cent increase. Conversion rates for foreign currency tripled, going from 0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent for the ANZ First Visa card and the ANZ Gold Visa card. Annual fees for the ANZ's First Free Days Visa card rose from $26 to $30, up 15 per cent. Westpac's annual fees on Altitude credit cards went up by 53 per cent to $75. Overdrawn account fees went up by 20 per cent to $30. Fees for periodical payments not being made went up by 60 per cent to $40. Non-Westpac ATM fees went up by 20 per cent to $1.50. Regarding the National Australia Bank's small business fees, there was a 50 per cent increase in fees for business cheque accounts, rising from $10 to $15; a $10 impost on the previously fee-free GST business offset accounts; and a 20 per cent increase in over-the-counter fees, rising from 70c to 90c.
Looking at that, you would say, `Obviously, the banks must have been in a fair bit of trouble over that period and that is why they have needed to increase fees,' or `They certainly have issues that they have to deal with and they have taken a business decision to make that money out of the Australian consumer.' Then I think you have to look at the profits of the big banks over that same period because we have seen a very successful sector of the Australian economy becoming even more successful. If you go back to 1997 figures, you will find that the National Australia Bank made a profit of $2,223 million, ANZ made a profit of $1,024 million, Westpac made a profit of $1,291 million and the Commonwealth Bank made a profit of $1,078 million. So the total across the four major banks was $5,616 million—some $5.6 billion. Collectively, the four banks made a profit of $5.482 billion in 1998; $7.179 billion in 1999; $9.401 billion in 2000; $8.254 billion in 2001—there was drop; I do not know how they managed that—$10.542 in 2002, recovering from that drop; and, according to these figures, $10.498 billion in 2003. Last year, the National Australia Bank made $3.955 billion, ANZ made $2.348 billion, Westpac made $2.183 billion and the Commonwealth Bank made $2.012 billion. This is not a sector that has been struggling; it is a sector that has been doing extremely well. Yet what we have seen right through that period is that part of that growth and part of that profit has come directly out of our pockets. The fact is that this has gone on for much too long now.
Just the other day, in response to these figures, the editorial of the Herald Sun, under the heading `Bank fees soaring', made some valuable points on this issue. The editorial said:
The revelation that Australian families and businesses paid more than $8.6 billion in bank fees last year should come as no surprise.
We have sadly become used to the grossly bloated profits of our major banks and their insatiable desire to squeeze customers for their last cent.
Fees overall have more than doubled in just six years but for domestic customers the hike is worse—from $1.1 billion in 1997 to more than $3 billion last year. 
Families are now being slugged an average $398 every year in bank fees alone.
Clearly the banks are embarrassed and have used a variety of mealy-mouthed excuses to try to justify their greed.
But the fact remains that while fees have soared the level of bank service is at its lowest ever.
Many customers no longer have a local branch, are forced to do their banking electronically and if they have a query that needs to be answered by a human being they are often shunted off to a call centre on the Indian sub-continent.
We cannot expect the banks to curb their greed but it is time the Federal Government did more to save the community from this blatant rip-off.
Numerous articles to that effect came out at that time under headlines like, from the Courier-Mail, `Banks get fatter on card fees'; from the Age, `Revenue from bank fees soars'; and from the Daily Telegraph, `Bank fee blitzkrieg. In your pocket for $400 a year.' I could quote ad nauseam from those articles but I will spare you that today, other than to say there is a very clear pattern there and a very clear need for action.
One of the things that Labor has suggested is that this matter should be formally referred to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to ensure that we have proper monitoring of what the banks are up to. The experience of that in the past, even under this Treasurer, has been that banks will listen when they are brought to account and they do not like having light shone on the detail of what they are doing to this sort of area. Some time ago the National Australia Bank made some change to the value of its awards points system that was, in effect, retrospective. The Treasurer, to his credit, at the time said he would refer that to the ACCC for consideration. Within 24 hours of that referral the National Australia Bank backed off and realised that it could not get away with it.
So referring it to the ACCC is in fact a useful thing to do. It is also something the Treasurer has thought was a useful thing to do in the past. Back in 1996 the Treasurer responded as follows to a question from the member for Petrie on bank fees and charges:
If there is any suggestion of anti-competitive activity or collusion in fees and charges, the government does have the option of referring the matter to the relevant body, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. And we will take that action if necessary, or if any information arises of inadequate competition in that area of products as well.
I do not know what other evidence the Treasurer requires to actively understand that that is what we have seen happen: the increases that I mentioned earlier, with fees in total going up from $4 billion to over $8.6 billion, the increased fees on households alone, the massive percentage increases in particular types of fees, and the range of new fees that banks are finding every other week to put on the accounts of yours and mine. It would seem to me that there is ample evidence for the Treasurer to actually take another look at this issue and do something about it.
I raised this matter with the Treasurer just the other day. In fact, I have raised it with him previously in the House. The problem I have had is that he just does not seem to get it; he does not seem to realise. The other day I asked the Prime Minister a question, but the Treasurer answered it. The question read:
Is the Prime Minister aware of Reserve Bank of Australia statistics showing personal bank fees soared to more than $3 billion last year and have increased by 161 per cent since 1997? Isn't it the case that the government's hands-off approach to regulating the banks has failed to restrain bank fees? Given that Australian households are under record financial stress, why won't the Prime Minister adopt Labor's plan to direct the ACCC to monitor bank fees and charges, to impose some discipline on the banks and to provide some relief for Australian families? 
I will pick the key points from the Treasurer's response:
I indicate at the outset that the government's policy in relation to bank fees is the same policy the Labor government had from 1983 until 1996. At no time in those 13 years did the Australian Labor Party ever have control over or monitoring of bank fees.
That is true, and in fact it was mentioned on several occasions in the last year or two of the Labor government that we should be looking at that very issue. The point is that the figure back then was well under $4 billion. It is now up over $8.6 billion. The percentage increases we are seeing right across the board show that this is a much greater problem now than it ever was under a Labor government. In fact, for a large period of that Labor government we were not in a situation where this was actually occurring. In 1991 they were not charging any account keeping fees for a standard transaction account. It is only in the last years of Labor in government that fees started to become an issue. The fact of the matter is: just because action was not taken over the last 12 months of those 13 years, in a situation where it was not an issue over those 13 years, that is absolutely no excuse for this government to do nothing over its term, which goes back to 1996.
Interestingly, the Treasurer then sought to justify his position in the following terms:
In fact, from time to time you will hear other members of the Australian Labor Party boasting that the Australian Labor Party deregulated the financial markets. The Labor Party ought to decide which position they want to take: either they had the great achievement of deregulating the financial markets or they believe in re-regulating the financial markets. But they cannot hold both positions at the one time ...
The point I would make about that is that we are not trying to hold both positions at the one time. In this case we are not talking about re-regulating in a manner that he might suggest. We are saying that proper monitoring in this area, at this time, by the ACCC will have a positive effect on the actions of the banks. That is what we are talking about here. We stand proudly behind the changes we have made in the financial markets in the past and we believe they have had a positive effect. But what has not had a positive effect is this government not taking its responsibility seriously with respect to monitoring in these areas and ensuring that there is a proper review of what has been done. The banks are clearly taking advantage of that opportunity to do their own thing, incrementally ramping up fees and charges on a regular basis and hoping no-one takes account and no-one takes any notice.
The Treasurer also raised some issues, which I will not have time to go into today, regarding the interchange fee reforms. I will pick up one of his points:
The RBA's credit card interchange fee standard is expected to reduce credit card interchange fees by around $400 million a year—a reform which the RBA put in place and which was endorsed by this government.
The Treasurer may not be awake to what has been happening, but large parts of those changes have occurred in relation to credit cards and it is part of a process that we have supported. But we said at the time, and we warned the Treasurer at the time, that if there is not proper monitoring of what occurs we will see the banks taking those fees back by gouging other fees out of the Australian public.
What we can see in those Reserve Bank figures is exactly that. A 38 per cent increase in the last 12-month period shows that the banks are all consciously working to recover that fee loss on interchange by pulling it straight out of your pockets and my pockets. It shows a fundamental failure of this government in not being prepared to actually watch what is happening within the industries that they have some responsibility for monitoring. Instead they have the hands-off approach, and the result of that hands-off approach is that Australian families and the Australian community are paying more and more every single day. It is not good enough. There is more that can be done. It is a simple matter for the Treasurer to do it. He has done it in relation to particular individual issues in this area; he could do it in a more general sense. He would have a positive impact on the market and it is something that needs to be done urgently. (Time expired)
 (Mr Lindsay)—Before I call the member for Leichhardt, I advise the House that it is the honourable member's birthday today and I am sure that all members would want me to wish the member for Leichhardt many happy returns.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,2004-05-31,"—Thank you very much indeed, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay. I rise this evening to put my very strong endorsement to the recent budget, through this Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005 and its cognate bills. I would like to begin my contribution by, firstly, congratulating the government on once again delivering a budget that is tailored to all Australians in one way or another, whether it be in tax cuts, increased family assistance, more aged care places, child-care places et cetera. This year's federal budget certainly proves and confirms the coalition's outstanding record in economic management.
In 2004-05 we are certainly able to reach some very significant milestones in relation to our economy, and this is despite economic troubles that have hit our South-East Asian neighbours, the US and Europe. Despite all of this, Australia has certainly managed to continue to prosper, maintaining low unemployment, record low interest rates and reduced government debt, and—in spite of living through one of the worst droughts in recorded history—our country remains the best performing nation in the OECD.
Good economic management, as I am sure you are well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, does not come about by accident, but it has meant that the government has continued to deliver a budget surplus yet again. Like many of my coalition colleagues, I was also very pleased to see the budget in surplus for the seventh time—$2.4 billion, in fact, which demonstrates that this government is ensuring that the Australian public's finances are in a very sound position. This budget demonstrates that the Australian government is determined to keep our economy strong. It includes a growth forecast of 3½ per cent, unemployment still at 5.34 per cent—it is the lowest, in fact, in 23 years and has been steady now for the last 12 months—and inflation forecast to be a low two per cent.
After funding our current spending, we are still able to make repayments for that debt of $96 billion that we inherited back in 1996, currently around $26 billion and decreasing. I think that certainly puts sound proof to the commitment we made when we came in that we would cut up the credit card. We have certainly done that, and over the last seven or eight years we have never borrowed a cent to pay for any of those programs that we have been required to fund; it has been done purely by good, sound economic management. Our net GDP ratio for debt is the lowest in the OECD, about three per cent, showing that Australian government debt is now about the lowest in the world. I think in Japan, just by comparison, it is about 60 or 70 per cent.
We have been able to implement a significant benefit in relation to tax cuts. In 2000, you would recall that the income tax for all Australians was cut by the largest amount ever, about $12 billion per year, following the introduction of the new tax system. Last year, thresholds were changed yet again to reduce income tax for low-income earners, and of course we have had the low-income earners enjoying the benefits of those cuts now since 2000. Unfortunately, we have not been able to get the tax cuts that we had intended right across the board back in 2000. We have been able to introduce them again this year in the budget, so we are looking at another $14.7 billion over four years, with about 80 per cent of all the taxpayers in this country facing a top marginal tax bracket of no more than 30 per cent for the next four years. Tax cuts are certainly a good reward for good economic management. In those cuts, you are looking at the 42 per cent rate going to $58,001 in 2004-05, then to $63,001 in 2005-06. The 47 per cent rate will go to $70,100 in 2004-05 and then on to $80,001 in 2005-06. 
One of the other major focuses in this budget has been on delivering the largest package of assistance to families ever put in place by an Australian government. It is going to cost about $19.2 billion over five years. It will include an immediate payment of some $600 to all families eligible for family tax benefit A before 30 June this year and a further $600 lump sum for those families after 30 June 2004, meaning that nearly all families will be eligible for an additional $1,200 per child over the next 12 months. Add to that the $3,000 maternity payment for every mother giving birth to a child, which will increase to $4,000 in July 2006 and then to $5,000 in July 2008.
It was also great to see the increase in the number of child-care places. We see an extra 30,000 outside school hours places and 1,500 family day care places to be provided. This is in addition to the announcements that were made in December last year and will bring a total of some 40,000 outside school hours places and 4,000 new family day care places from 1 July 2004. It certainly puts paid to any of the nonsense that was peddled by the opposition that this government was intending to axe family day care—a campaign that was run some months ago. I think that people need to take notice of some of the nonsense that is being peddled when they then look at the reality of what is being delivered by this government.
I know that the additional places that have been announced are welcomed by a number of providers. I remember talking with P and J Murray's Daycare Services at Mt Sheridan, St Andrews at Redlynch and the Mother of Good Counsel in Cairns—just to name a few who received more after school places in December, and they were very happy with those allocations.
As our population ages, it becomes clearer that we are going to need more and more aged care services, and this is why the government has announced an investment of some $2.2 billion over the next five years to enable the aged care sector to provide affordable and quality aged care. Included is a new conditional adjustment package for providers, meaning that the average care subsidy will increase from $30,500 per year for each resident to $35,000 in 2007-08. Another area where we have had a chronic shortage over a period of time has been in trained nurses. There is $101 million being provided for more trained nurses. Included in that are 15,750 vocational education and training places and 400 new undergraduate nurses' places by 2005.
There is also an additional $58 million in 2006-07 and 2007-08 for an additional 108 aged care places for every 1,000 Australians aged over 70. This is a significant increase which is certainly needed in this sector. There is also a one-off payment for providers of $3,500 per resident to be made before 30 June 2004. This is an area where there has been particular concern for some time with the ageing of some of the infrastructure and, with the changing of standards, there has been a need to upgrade facilities. In some cases, as we see at Bethlehem in Cairns, there is a need to relocate and build a new facility. There is always a desperate need for funding to provide this infrastructure. Only recently the Catholic diocese embarked on a program of expanding the Stella Maris facility in Port Douglas. The costs associated with that have been quite significant and it cannot be done without support from government. I am glad to see that we are now starting on the process of offering that support. While I am sure that there is more that will need to be done, it is certainly a significant boost for the aged care sector in my region. 
Among the other unsung heroes are those carers who provide a great service to the community by supporting and caring for those who are incapable of taking care of themselves. It is great to see that we have continued to recognise their contribution, and increasing support to the carers is something that we really needed to do. A one-off carer bonus, totalling $255 million, will be paid to eligible carers in June 2004 in recognition of the very significant role that they play in our community. This includes a $1,000 bonus payment for recipients of the carer payment and a $600 bonus for recipients of the carer allowance. This bonus is tax free and will not be treated as income when calculating social security benefits.
Another $107 million will be provided over four years to expand the eligibility for the carer allowance. One area that has been of particular concern to me is carers who are not domiciled with the person they are caring for. Up until this budget, they had been excluded from being able to access any carer payments. This anomaly—and it is an anomaly in my view—has been rectified through the allocation of funding in this budget. An additional $73 million will be provided over four years to expand access to respite services for older carers who care for adult children with disabilities. I had the opportunity to see the value of these respite centres recently. I was at St John Community Care at Gordonvale for the opening of a dementia garden which was built by two people from a Work for the Dole project—Keith Thompson and Brian Bartels. When you go there you see the outstanding work that is being done and the number of people that they are providing a service for by giving those carers a bit of time for themselves and a bit of a break. Dino Bazarbassis is the coordinator there. The St Johns program was originally set up many years ago and they really deserve recognition for the work that they do in providing this invaluable service. I spoke to them about this additional funding for the expansion of the service, and they were quite excited about. It certainly gives them an opportunity to look at expanding their services.
Another recipient of funding, which is relatively small in the overall picture of the budget but very close to my heart, is the cochlear implant funding. I have spoken in this place on a number of occasions and referred to a young man by the name of Sam Endres. He was fitted with a cochlear implant at a very young age, and it made a profound difference. I presented a photograph in this House when he first had the implant fitted and it was switched on. The expression on his face when he heard sound for the first time was very moving.
The Hear and Say centres like the one I have in Cairns do a wonderful job, but they all have difficulty with resourcing. One of the problems that we have with the cochlear implants is that it is important that, as children grow, the technology is continually updated. Any down time, if you like, means that they are missing out on vital education at a young age. It is great to see that $8 million will be provided over four years, which will basically eliminate the current waiting list in 2004-05 and also provide some 230 upgrades each year thereafter, allowing deaf children to get quicker access to the technology. That will certainly change their lives. 
There are another 12 medical places for JCU at some $2.2 million. That is certainly a major boost. The sugar industry package of $444 million was also funded out of this budget. I am pleased to see, after working very closely with the industry, that Mossman mill in my electorate, which employs quite a significant number of people, was able to access this package. Bill Phillips-Turner, the Chief Executive Officer, said of the package:
This package has put more confidence back into the industry. It means growers will be able to plant this year. It may also mean that bankers in the industry gain some confidence as well. In our 110th year I believe this gives us our best chance of saving the Mossman Mill.
I think that says it all. There will be some $7.7 million in funding for RASS, which is very important in my electorate. Some years ago I was successful in getting the first extension of the scheme in quite a number of years. Recently a bid was put in and quite a number of people who were receiving the service looked like missing out. I was pleased and I congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr John Anderson, for taking into consideration the concerns that I raised with him.
The $7.7 million in funding over four years is to not only maintain the service but also expand it. That is certainly good news for people like Leslie Whyte from Kendall River, who had looked like losing her service; Alan and Merylin Holmes from Kalinga; and Mick Callaghan, who contacted me raising concerns not only for himself at Palmerville but also for his brother Kev and sister-in-law Sally at Fairlight Station. Kev has not been travelling well healthwise recently and it was absolutely vital that we maintain the service. So it is certainly good news for all of those people on those properties; they can now be reassured of an ongoing service.
It was great to see that the Roads to Recovery program is continuing, the Black Spot Program has $90-odd million for ongoing funding for the widening of the Bruce Highway and the upgrading of the Peninsula development road will be funded through Roads of National Importance. There is certainly significant money for conservation initiatives in my area—in particular, for the Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, which has some $30-odd million, $10 million of which is to go towards compensation for those who may lose their livelihood or some of it through the recent RAP programs. As the minister has said, that is only a deposit. As the calculations are being done, compensation will be available for anybody who is impacted by the federal government's decision. There is also another $900,000 to fight the crown-of-thorns.
On top of that, for tourism, the white paper funding is $235 million. Recently you may recall the launching of the $360 million tourism program for advertising both domestically and internationally, with outstanding results. Indigenous funding is up some $37 million, including funding for the family violence program, which I think is very important. Of course, the biggest funding is $16.2 million over three years for ongoing projects throughout the Torres Strait. This is the third tranche of infrastructure development funding in that area. Hopefully this will finalise the upgrading of water, sewerage and waste disposal facilities that has been going on for some time. 
Finally, this is a very positive budget and it is certainly in stark contrast to that which was delivered in the reply to the budget by the opposition leader. Not a cent was committed to the protection of our borders nor for illegal fishing other than the three Coast Watch vessels that are going to be anchored around the country. There was absolutely no depth in it. Labor has a record of high debt, high inflation, high interest rates, high unemployment and has absolutely no vision for the future. The opposition leader's ad hoc response only proves that we will be in serious trouble if Labor were to get into office at the next election.

"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,2004-05-31,"—The ninth budget brought down by the Howard government is a blueprint for its re-election, not a blueprint for the next three years or, indeed, the next 10 years. It is certainly not a plan for the nation. Laid bare in this budget are the values that this Prime Minister and his colleagues hold dear to their hearts—namely, their naked quest for political survival at all costs and the manipulative contempt in which they hold the Australian people.
This politically crafted budget is simply too clever by half and is based on the cynical belief that the Australian people at the end of the day are mugs who can be bought off with 30 pieces of silver at election time. The truth of the matter is that the highest taxing, highest spending Treasurer in Australian history has had his hands in the pockets of Australian wage earners through bracket creep every year that he has been in office. Having taxed them mercilessly and hoarded the gold, he has now embarked on the father of all spending splurges to buy his way back into office at the next election. Australia's Prince Charles wants the prime ministerial throne, but King John will not abdicate. So the Treasurer spends like a sailor who is on land after six months at sea, hoping to buy the prime ministership one more time so that the Prime Minister can hopefully hand him the prime ministership if the coalition is re-elected.
Not having the intestinal fortitude to take on the Prime Minister, after having been dudded and doublecrossed and outsmarted by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer sulks late at night in his office, producing surpluses so that he can spend, spend and spend again to compensate for his loss of the big job. Over this side of the House we simply call him Ole Yeller. The tragedy for the Treasurer and many of his lemming supporters on the coalition back benches is that their political cowardice is hurtling them towards the political abyss. It would appear that the ninth Howard-Costello budget has gone down like the proverbial lead balloon. Following a $52 billion spend in this budget, the government's political fortunes have failed to bounce. There is a political reason for that: dead political cats don't bounce. I note in the chamber tonight the honourable member for Corangamite, a supporter of the Prime Minister. Let me say once again for the honourable member for Corangamite: dead political cats don't bounce. This Treasurer has wilfully accumulated those surpluses while Geelong families have bled financially and shouldered ever-increasing burdens in health and educational expenses.
The government, for over 18 months, has been told by aged care providers in the Corio electorate and elsewhere of the adverse impact of funding shortfalls on their capacity to provide aged care services. But the Howard government has acted only because there is an election around the corner. It has crafted its tax cuts to people whose incomes are in excess of $52,000, yet some 66 per cent of taxpayers earn much less than that amount and will receive no tax relief at all. It has brazenly offered cheques to families under its family tax benefit arrangements, but it has deceptively failed to tell people that the benefits will be offset against family tax benefit debt accumulated by families as a result of the government's own flawed scheme. 
Our grinning, arrogant Treasurer has failed to address the increasing financial burden on Geelong families, and he now cynically throws money around like confetti at a country wedding, believing that voters can be bought off. While Geelong families have borne this burden, the Treasurer seeks to line the pockets of commercial advertisers with a hundred million dollar pre-election campaign to sell the budget. I want Australian taxpayers, particularly electors in the seat of Corio, to ponder that one fact. This is a government that withdrew the Commonwealth dental scheme, worth some $35 million a year, that would have given pensioners some relief from the pain they suffer as a result of their dental problems. But, in one pre-election year, this government is prepared to spend $100 million, lining the pockets of advertisers all around Australia for its own political gain.
Geelong students face increasing HECS burdens, with increased fees and educational expenses hitting to make more and more debt. Yet this Treasurer has forgotten them in the budget. Geelong aged care providers and Geelong families with aged relatives have had to shoulder increased financial burdens over the past two years as a result of the government's misplaced priorities. And now, with some relief in this budget, they are expected to get on their knees and give thanks to a Treasurer, a Prime Minister and a government which has bled them dry financially.
I therefore support the second reading amendment moved by the honourable member for Hotham, Simon Crean, which:
... condemns the Government for:
(1)	its cynical election driven spending spree which, while spending a record $52 billion over the forward estimates, failed to deliver crucial services to Australians, including:
(a) 	funding the pneumococcal vaccine for children;
(b)	funding VET in schools so young Australians can either Earn or Learn;
(c)	ensuring access to Higher Education without excessive fees or increasing student debt levels;
(d)	ensuring all Australians can access bulkbilling services; 
(e)	ensuring adequate measures to respond to Australia's skill shortage; 
(2)	also condemns the Government for failing to present a strategy to adequately address the long term fiscal challenges facing the nation.
This budget is not about fairness. It is not about social investment and building community. It is not about vision for advancing the nation. It is simply of crude attempt by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to buy and bribe their way back into office one more time. 
There are several matters I wish to raise in the context of this debate relating to my electorate of Corio, which is based in the greater Geelong area. Firstly, many constituents in my electorate will be particularly disappointed at the targeting of the tax cuts to people with incomes in excess of $52,000. We know the government has indulged itself again in a cynical political exercise with these tax cuts, but recent census figures show that 84 per cent of Geelong income earners in the electorate of Corio earn less than $50,000 per year. There are 95,000 income earners in Corio according to the 2001 census and, of these, at least 79,717 earn less than $50,000 a year. 
Around Australia, the pattern is repeated. Four out of five income earners and singles receive no relief at all from this budget. Indeed, NATSEM has confirmed that three out of five families and single people will not receive anything by way of tax cuts or family benefits in the budget. Furthermore, although the government has provided some additional income to families through the family tax benefit, the debt clawback from some families still exists, and there is no relief from the high marginal tax rates on working families where a partner does some casual work or part-time work to supplement the family income. So the government has basically failed a large part of my constituency in this budget, which as I intimated earlier is fairly and squarely aimed at getting the Prime Minister re-elected rather than really addressing the pressing needs of Geelong families.
The second matter that I wish to raise in this debate relates to my disappointment that the government has failed to provide federal funding input into the Geelong ring road project. I raise this issue not in a party political sense, as the needs of the people in the Geelong region and the overall national and regional economic benefits that will flow from the early completion of this project transcend the political boundaries drawn by the Electoral Commission. Indeed, if this particular project were to be completed, significant benefits would accrue to my electorate of Corio and, of course, to the electorate of Corangamite. The member for Corangamite is in the chamber with me tonight. I understand from the member for Corangamite that, like me, he has received a large number of representations from people who support the completion of this bypass road. 
On 24 April I wrote again to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport and Regional Services outlining the case for supporting this important project in the Geelong region. Like many in the community, I was hoping for a favourable decision in the budget, and regrettably that favourable decision was not forthcoming. However, I do note in the budget papers that the government intends to announce its AusLink funding priorities on 7 June. I ask once again that this project be considered for priority funding. Following the budget, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services produced a press release relating to his AusLink funding proposals. I quote from that:
The 2004-05 Budget sets out the funding for the Government's new land transport plan, AusLink, which will incorporate the National Highway system, many Roads of National Importance and other freight links into a broader network of transport corridors.
I note in the tables that are provided that new projects for 2004-05 will receive an allocation of $155.3 million. I would imagine that any new land transport projects will be the subject of announcements by the government in June. It is very clear from the criteria that the Commonwealth employs in assessing whether a proposal fits its Roads of National Importance category that this particular proposal fits quite neatly. Although it is not part of the national highway system, it is certainly a road of national economic significance. We have recently seen the Jetstar announcement in Geelong and I understand that tomorrow the first jet will be landing in Avalon from Sydney. I will speak a little bit more about that, but certainly that particular event gives impetus to considerable tourism traffic along the Great Ocean Road. 
It is a sad fact of our national planning that the heavy reliance on road transport to move freight and passengers is putting quite intolerable pressure on existing infrastructure. It is contributing to urban congestion, pollution from greenhouse emissions, higher accident costs, energy depletion and a loss of social amenity. 
These problems are very acute in the Geelong region. Recent demographic and economic changes now make the completion of the ring road around Geelong really compelling from an economic, social and environmental point of view. As I pointed out in my recent submission to the Prime Minister, the growth in tourism along the Great Ocean Road which I alluded to previously will be given a huge impetus with the recent Jetstar announcement to locate at Avalon. I congratulate Qantas and LinFox on the deal that they have done to locate Jetstar at Avalon. I cannot be there tomorrow when the first jet from Sydney to the Geelong region lands at Avalon, but I do wish the venture well and I hope that the people of the Geelong region as well as the western district hinterland and further afar support this service, as well as the people from Melbourne. It is a very important regional initiative, one that not only will bring that increased tourist traffic to the region but will certainly spawn a significant degree of employment growth as well. 
The ring road is a strategic investment that, with Commonwealth support, will integrate the existing road network and propel benefits far in excess of any actual monetary contribution from the Commonwealth government. I want the project completed for the benefit of Geelong and I am not fussed how it is funded in the context of the total Commonwealth-state road funding effort in Victoria. Simply put, I want the road built. The project is necessary, nationally and regionally, and meets the criteria employed by the Commonwealth to evaluate similar projects around Australia.
However, I sound a warning to those who mistakenly believe that the completion of the ring-road around Geelong will be the answer to all our traffic problems in Geelong along Latrobe Terrace and the linkages from east to west. I have seen reports that it is anticipated that the road will only lead to reductions of 30 to 35 per cent in traffic volumes along Latrobe Terrace. Significant as that may be, the City of Greater Geelong has an onerous responsibility to get its traffic planning right, particularly in the CBD area of Geelong, as there is a view about in my electorate that the council decisions have exacerbated the movement of freight and passengers within and through the city. Even if a favourable decision were to be made today by the Commonwealth government, it would be a number of years before the project was fully completed, so the community needs an interim traffic management strategy to cope with existing and future traffic loads.
There is one more matter I wish to raise in the context of the budget appropriations, and it relates to aged care funding in this country. After years of neglect—and years of ignoring pleas from the industry, the opposition and, indeed, the community generally—the Howard government is now in election mode, proposing one of its short-term fixes in aged care funding.
I have received numerous representations from people in my electorate in relation to the aged care funding issue. I will not go through those arguments once again, because my time in this debate is coming to a close, but in the course of 2003 aged care providers alerted me to the dire financial consequences of the underfunding arrangements of the Howard government. Indeed, as I pointed out to them, the federal government deliberately used the Hogan review as a mask for shifting the costs of aged care funding onto the aged care providers.
The Hogan review was tabled in December last year, but it was not until the budget context some five months later that the government moved to address some of the capital funding issues that the aged care sector had been raising with me and other members of this place over a long period of time. Simply put, the Howard government bled the aged care providers dry so that they could drop a bucket of money in the context of this pre-election budget. That is the reality, and that is a real shame. 
In conclusion, we have the highest taxing government in Australia's history and we have the highest spending government in Australia's history. Each year the Treasurer's taxation harvest has netted $2.5 billion in bracket creep, but in 2004-05 his budget relief only returned $1.9 billion. The average taxpayer in this country is paying an extra $5,500 in income tax every year under the Howard government, and by 2007-08 they will be paying a further $2,800. Over the eight years of the Howard government, average election year spending has been $32.7 billion; non-election year spending has averaged $3.9 billion.

"McArthur, Stewart, MP",LP,2004-05-31,"—I am delighted yet again to follow the member for Corio, because, like his leader and the shadow Treasurer, he is providing a magic pudding solution to the problems of the Australian economy and the budget. He is, as I hear him, suggesting cuts in taxes. He is spending more money on health and more money on aged care, and he is still going to have a surplus. As a member of the Hawke-Keating government he had a very good understanding of those issues, because at that time they were real experts on bracket creep. He did mention in the conclusion of his speech that bracket creep has been a problem, and I will allude to that later in my speech. In the area of aged care, I suggest to the honourable member that the government have addressed those problems and they have increased their expenditure since 1996. They have addressed the problems within the area of aged care to the best of their ability as a government, and I think they have done an exceedingly good job.
For all the public comment on the budget, the fundamental issue is: can the Australian economy sustain a good budget and is it fundamentally based in terms of inflation, surpluses and interest rates? When you ask those kinds of questions about this budget, you can see that the Australian economy has got good growth rates. It also has a low inflation rate, predicted to run at about two per cent. Interest rates are between five per cent and seven per cent—a far cry from the 23 per cent that the member for Corio precipitated with his government. All the electors should be very aware of any argument about interest rates and the possibility of returning a Labor government to the Treasury benches. The government debt, which I will allude to in a minute, is quite remarkable, and business confidence in Australia is also very good. So, looking at all those criteria, and with a budget surplus of $2.4 billion, we have a situation where the budget is a fundamentally sound document. We cannot say that for the Hawke-Keating years, when the budget deficit grew year by year—and I will mention that again in a minute.
The key to the budget outlays and the budget source of income is the good economic conditions in Australia. These have been brought about by the reforms of the Howard government since 1996. I would like to quote from budget document No. 1, statement 4, `Sustaining growth in Australia's living standards', which is the key to the argument before the parliament today. It says:
This exceptional productivity growth was a payoff from sustained macroeconomic and structural reforms. The OECD, in its 2003 Economic Survey of Australia, noted that:
`Dogged pursuit of structural reforms across a very broad front, and prudent macroeconomic policies firmly set in a medium-term framework, have combined to make Australia one of the best performers in the OECD, and also one notably resilient to shocks, both internal and external.' 
There we have a comment from an independent source indicating that Australia, because of its reform program under the Howard government, has achieved a prosperity not seen for 40 years in this country. This has been brought about by changes to the industrial relations system.
The industrial relations reform introduced by the Hon. Peter Reith in 1996, something that I have had a long interest in, made the work force more flexible and freed up labour relations between management and the work force. The honourable member opposite has often referred to the waterfront dispute. Industrial relations reform brought about such a dramatic—historic—change on the waterfront that productivity on the waterfront is now reaching world-class levels of performance. It was suggested at the time of the waterfront dispute that we would never manage more than 20 containers per hour. We are now managing 25 to 26 containers per hour. Not only is the productivity higher but the reliability of the waterfront has also improved remarkably.
There was the introduction of the GST, which the honourable member opposite fought tooth and nail against. We know that the revenue growth to the state treasuries will be better. Over time it will ensure that the states can sustain their support for hospitals and education. There was the competition policy. Again, the honourable member opposite has been somewhat critical on occasions about it, although his government did implement parts of the competition policy, and I commend them for that. Dairy deregulation was another step in the right direction. That industry now will become world competitive and will contribute to export earnings of over $2 billion a year. That will add to the prosperity of all Australians.
Debt reduction is an aspect of economic management that I would like to dwell on particularly. No member opposite can deny that the increase in government debt that occurred under the Hawke-Keating government caused horrendous problems. The budget paper in 1996-97 put the government debt at $96 billion. That was 18 per cent of GDP. Interestingly enough, at that time they were paying $8.5 billion in interest. That is a lot of money that could have been allocated to other parts of the budget. By this year's budget, 2003-04, the debt is down to nearly $30 billion, which is about 3.7 per cent of GDP. More importantly, the government is only paying $3.6 billion in interest on the debt. So there is $5 billion extra every year for the Treasurer to allocate to those parts of the budget that the government sees fit to spend it on. There is no way that those opposite can suggest that the government debt that was created in the term of the Hawke-Keating government was not a problem in maintaining prosperity in Australia.
It is interesting to compare the debt in Australia to the debts of other nations around the world. I will be very brief on this. Looking at the general government debt levels as a percentage of GDP, Germany is in the range of 45 per cent, the OECD is in the range of 45 per cent, the European Union is 45 per cent to 30 per cent, Japan is up to 80 per cent and the United States is in the range of 35 per cent, whereas Australia is gradually reducing down to negligible levels of government debt. That is a remarkable performance, and it is one that I think we should all be very proud of. Very little credit has been given by those opposite to the government's performance in reducing the debt level so that future governments—eventually the member for Corio will be in government, though it will not be for a long while—have a sound base on which to run their economic policies. 
I want to look at the overall situation around the world, just to compare Australia's position. Global growth continues to rely very much on the USA, which accounts for a quarter of the world's goods and services production. Domestic demand in Japan and Europe is hampered by financial weakness, particularly bank weakness in Japan. The US current account deficit is a considerable worry to those Australians who trade with America and who understand the importance of America in the global financial system. US official interest rates are at approximately 40-year lows. Again, that is a matter of concern. If the US interest rate moves up just a couple of points, that will obviously reflect on Australian interest rate settings. More importantly, the fiscal situation in the US has moved from surplus to deficit, with a turnaround of about five per cent of GDP over the last two years. I must say it is of great concern to me that that powerhouse economy has moved into such a situation in such a short time. The price of oil is a major difficulty facing the Australian economy. Nobody—neither those on the opposition benches nor the members of the government—can be quite sure what will happen with the price of oil over time. It is about $US40 a barrel at this moment and, with the uncertain world out there, it could be a real problem.
Looking at Australian conditions, it is worth noting that the housing market is a problem facing all investors: whether the housing market will continue to hold, whether it will expand or whether the bubble will burst. Regarding the current account deficit, I again express my concern, as I did in last year's budget. From about 5.25 per cent of GDP it is up to 5.75 per cent. That current account deficit is a matter of concern to Australia, and it is important that our exporters continue to export profitably and that exchange rates remain favourable. The trade weighted index as of today stands at 61 and the Australian dollar at US71c. Exporters are very dependent on these exchange rates and they make a dramatic difference to their final profitability.
I would like to move to the problem of progressive tax. Other members have raised it in earlier debate, and it has been a matter that concerns me. The progressive tax system has now made it very difficult for middle of the range taxpayers. In 1970, the top rate was 8.6 average weekly earnings—the top rate was 67c. At that time, it was a multiplication of 8½ times. In this year's budget, 2002-03, the multiple is 1.3. Admittedly, the tax rate is only 48.5, but it gives an indication of the impact that the progressive tax system has had in terms of bracket creep. If the tax rate had been indexed from 1970, the top tax rate of 48c would kick in at $270,000.
The member for Corio and other members opposite have talked about bracket creep, but we had a situation during the Hawke-Keating years where a nine per cent inflation rate meant that a large number of taxpayers moved from one bracket to the other. It is interesting to note that in 1970, when the top rate was 67c, fewer than one per cent of taxpayers were in the top bracket. By 2000, about 17 per cent of taxpayers were in the top bracket. That shows you exactly how many taxpayers have moved into the top bracket. At the end of my speech, I will seek leave to table the taxation bracket table as set out in the budget documents. The table sets out the exact movement of the new tax thresholds. I am particularly pleased to hear that members opposite will on this occasion support the proposed movement, particularly that occurring in the high tax bracket—from the present level of $62,000 up to $70,000 on the first change and then to $80,000. Those taxpayers in the higher brackets will receive some relief by moving into a new bracket. As the Treasurer has said on a number of occasions, these changes will mean that 80 per cent of taxpayers will stay in or below the 30c tax bracket. Bracket creep goes on inexorably. As inflation—even with the low inflation rates now—has its effects, people move into higher brackets as their salaries increase, and that becomes a difficulty for all taxpayers. 
I wish to quote from some people who are interested in the problem of bracket creep. Mr Stephen Harrison, the Chief Executive Officer of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia, wrote an interesting article in the Australian on 31 May 2004. It is headed `Give us a break, the tax system stinks'. I would like to read a couple of quotes from that article, because he supports the views I have expressed in this parliament for some years. In the article, Mr Harrison says:
... personal income tax accounts for about 40 per cent of Australia's total taxes while the OECD average is about 30 per cent.
So again we see the emphasis in the budget process on individual taxpayers. He goes on to talk about the effective marginal rate, saying: 
As it now stands, the effective marginal tax rate inequities discourage people from undertaking further work or starting work because of the combined effect of the loss of welfare and increase in tax for earning additional income. 
For many, the effective marginal tax rate inequities mean any additional work is taxed so highly it is not worth the effort, or worse, there is actually no benefit for the additional effort. 
I have argued that strongly in the parliament over many years, and at least at this stage the government has moved to address the problem. I have no doubt that those opposite will make no effort to really address the difficulty of bracket creep.
Finally, I want to quote an interesting article that the Australian newspaper ran when trying to bring about some public awareness of the problem of bracket creep. The editorial on 12 December 2003 stated:
While bracket creep has been marked at every level of the taxation scale, with the tax-free threshold it has been particularly severe: wages have risen by about 350 per cent since 1980, but the threshold has only risen by about 50 per cent.
That is an interesting comparison: wages have gone up, particularly with the inflation that occurred under the Hawke-Keating governments, yet the taxation scale has not allowed for those thresholds to keep pace with that increase in wages. The editorial continued: 
The two biggest weaknesses of the current system are the low level of $62,500 at which the top marginal rate of 48.5 cents in the dollar kicks in, and effective marginal tax rates as high as 90 cents at the bottom end, once loss of means-tested welfare benefits is factored in.
There you have it. With the problems of family payments and the high marginal tax rates, many Australians are finding it very difficult to make ends meet. After these excessively high rates of tax they are finding it hard to have any cash on the table.
The budget, contrary to a lot of the publicity about it, has two major expenditures locked in. Social security spending accounts for 43 per cent of the budget—and it is difficult for the Treasurer of the day to make too many changes to that—and health spending accounts for 18 per cent of the budget. That means that 61 per cent of the budget is fundamentally expenditure that is locked in. There is very little capacity to change those parameters. As I have mentioned before, 53 per cent of revenue coming to the budget is from income tax. So we have a fundamental difficulty in Australia: more than 50 per cent of the money in the budget is received from hardworking taxpayers and they are suffering bracket creep to provide the major proportion of budget revenue. Those opposite have made some noises about how they are going to put forward a tax policy: I challenge them to tell me how they can handle that fundamental problem facing Australia. Social security payments are things that governments are forever trying to contain. There are needy persons in our community, but those payments do take up a large proportion of the budget. Likewise, the health budget is ever increasing, with increasing technology and an ageing population putting demands on both federal and state budgets. 
I wish to finish as my colleague the member for Corio did by advocating publicly the government's support for the Geelong ring-road. I made a submission to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the Hon. John Anderson, and I led a delegation and pointed out the benefits that the Geelong ring-road would bring to the people of Geelong. I have argued the case quite strenuously to the Treasurer, to the Prime Minister and to Minister John Anderson. The Latrobe Street thoroughfare is now totally clogged up with 18 traffic lights, and the ring-road, which has been on the drawing board since 1960, needs to be constructed at the earliest opportunity. The public position I have been advocating is that the ring-road should be a six-lane bypass and that the allocation of $196 million would allow this particular project to start. Hopefully the minister will look to the interests of Geelong in the AusLink statements on 7 June. I have advocated the ring-road along with the member for Corio. On that issue, we have been together.
I have been encouraged by the support of the City of Greater Geelong, the mayor, Councillor Ed Coppe, and other leading citizens who have supported this project and the public campaign. I put on the public record my ongoing enthusiastic support for this particular project around Geelong—completing the ring-road at long last, after it sitting on the books since 1960, with successive governments doing nothing about it. I commend the project. I commend the budget for its stability, long-sightedness and the fundamental correctness of the way in which it has been constructed. (Time expired)

"Roxon, Nicola, MP",ALP,2004-05-31,"—I would like to talk on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005 and cognate bills in three separate parts. Firstly, I would like to talk about the impact that this budget is going to have in my electorate of Gellibrand—or, more importantly, the impact it is not going to have but could have had if the government had put its priorities and its money somewhere else. Secondly, I want to talk about a number of issues that particularly affect women, in my capacity as the shadow minister assisting the Leader of the Opposition on the status of women. Thirdly, I would like to deal with a range of legal and justice issues that are within the budget papers that obviously relate to my portfolio as shadow Attorney-General. 
It was very disappointing on budget night to sit and listen to the announcements made by the Treasurer in this House and to go through in detail the commitments that were being made by the government. Everyone is aware that a large amount of money is being spent in this budget, going out to members of the community—but unfortunately not many of those people live in Gellibrand. In particular, the way the tax cuts are designed so that they are only delivered to people who earn over $52,000 a year has meant that many thousands of people living in my electorate of Gellibrand are not going to receive a single cent of that money through tax cuts. Many of them, because of the incomes that they are on, will be paying increased amounts of tax over the period of the next couple of years and will not be getting any of the benefits that are being offered by the government.
In fact, 87,689 people in Gellibrand will not get any tax cuts. Of course, some of those people are not working and would not receive any tax benefits, but a large chunk of those people are and will receive nothing. That is about 90 per cent of people living in my electorate who will receive nothing from the tax cut that the government has paraded around the country and said is such a big deal and people should be delighted that it has been passed. It is a real shame in Gellibrand the way the priorities have been put so that so many people on moderate incomes will be left out. According to the census material, the median weekly family income in my electorate of Gellibrand is $860 a week—significantly lower than the amount that you would have to earn to be able to receive these tax cuts. That is actually the median weekly family income, not individual income. This is of great concern to us. The average income in Gellibrand—to do those sums—is $36,000 a year. Those people will not receive any benefits. Clearly, if people have children they may receive something under government initiatives in terms of the family tax benefits and other payments, but there are nearly 11,000 couple families living in my electorate of Gellibrand who do not have children, and they will not receive any of those benefits either. 
Importantly, in my electorate we have been campaigning for a long time and urging the government to allocate more child-care places. We welcome the fact that there are some additional child-care places, but the critical issue of long day care and families in my electorate not being able to find places for their very young children has not been dealt with in any way by this government. The pressure has not been eased for them, and it is growing into an even more serious problem every day while we have a lack of places for families in my electorate. I am concerned that my electorate seems to miss out in all directions: people who are not earning enough money to get the tax benefit, the large numbers of families who do not have children and who are not going to get the family benefit, and those with children who might get some of the family benefits but who have no child-care places.
Really, there are no solutions on any of the service delivery issues that are a problem in my electorate. We have a massive waiting list in the dental area. We have a public dental hospital, which is a great service in Footscray, but the waiting lists are enormously long. Some people have to wait several years to be able to get their services. This has a huge impact on their quality of life. It is difficult to believe—I know, Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie, you would be surprised to find this out—that in all the western suburbs of Melbourne there is not one single rebatable MRI machine. If you go across the river and into the eastern suburbs, you will find that there are 11 of them all in the same area. But in the entire western suburbs there is not one. This means a combination of things: either people who cannot afford to have an MRI scan without a Medicare rebate go without, to the detriment of their health, or they often travel significant distances and have time delays, also to the detriment of their health. Labor have been campaigning for a long time to get a rebatable machine in the western suburbs of Melbourne. We were disappointed that there was nothing in this budget that deals with any of those problems. 
I also want to speak briefly about the fact that there was nothing in the budget to deal with youth unemployment. This is still a very serious problem in my electorate. There is a 23.5 per cent teenage unemployment rate in my electorate. Those figures are from January 2004. More than one in five teenagers is unemployed. It is a serious problem for us. I am very concerned that the government had no initiatives in this area, but I am delighted that the Leader of the Opposition has announced Labor's youth guarantee, our commitment to young people that they should be either learning or earning. We will make commitments to ensure that they have opportunities either to stay at school with more support or to go into training or employment in a way that is meaningful so that we do not squander the potential of those young people who might otherwise drop out of school or be unemployed. We know that people need a little bit of extra assistance sometimes. That is when the government should intervene—when people are young and still have the opportunity to learn more and to get some hands-on experience on the job. They should be able to go on to be active and well-engaged members of our community rather than be stuck, as are many young students who drop out of school, without many prospects for the future.
Secondly, I want to talk about issues relating to women. As I said in my capacity as shadow minister assisting the leader on the status of women, I am also concerned that, in a similar way to my electorate, working women in Australia do not do very well out of this package at all.
—The Minister for Science might guffaw about this, but he would be interested to know that about 90 per cent of Australia's working women do not earn $52,000 a year. They do not earn $52,000 a year because they work in professions that are often low paid, and they often do part-time and casual work. They are not going to receive any benefits at all from these budget tax cuts. In particular, women without children are the big losers. Just look at the sorts of average weekly earnings: hairdressers, $523 a week; shop assistants, $582 a week; receptionists, $622 a week; an enrolled nurse, $726 a week; and a social worker, $761 a week. All these people are working in industries where there are large numbers of women. They are not going to get any benefit from these tax cuts, and I think they have been seriously forgotten by this budget.
In fact, this is the first time for 20 years that the government have not released a women's budget statement as part of the budget package. It is the first time in 20 years that the government did not think that their budget had enough to offer women for them even to put out a statement explaining the impact of these measures on women. We know why. We know that they did not do it because all they were going to have to do was break the bad news to Australian women that they were not getting the benefits that many other people in our community were getting. They were not prepared, obviously, to explain or argue that. Labor is seriously disappointed that something that has been in place for 20 years as a way of measuring government commitment to Australian women has just disappeared without trace. I think that is a real tragedy. 
I am also concerned that there is nothing in the budget that goes to another range of issues that have an enormous impact on women—that is, in relation to Medicare. Women are very heavy users of Medicare services in this country. Across our entire lifespan we use Medicare services 50 per cent more than men. But, interestingly, between the ages of 20 and 45, in those key child-bearing years, women use Medicare services 100 per cent more than men. If we do not deal with the problem of the lack of accessibility to bulk-billing doctors and the increased cost of going to the doctor, we are going to have women making decisions about their sexual health, their pregnancies and their child-rearing based on whether they have enough money to go to the doctor and not based on their health care needs. This is a serious problem that is being not only neglected by the government but made worse by the initiatives that they are taking which do not deal with the problems of accessibility for ordinary families in our communities who need health care services. This is a very serious problem.
I also want to flag my disappointment that the budget does not really contain anything new in relation to women at all. It does keep in the budget items a commitment to run a campaign that I have been talking about a lot in this House: one called `No respect, no relationship'. Labor was bitterly disappointed that this campaign was cancelled when the government had spent a significant amount of money—several million dollars—and two years planning it. The campaign was planned to be a major prevention campaign about violence against women. The government at the last minute cancelled the campaign. I am pleased that in the budget papers it appears that there is still money to run the campaign.
The Prime Minister has made some commitments in this House that the campaign, in some form, will run. But following the Senate estimates process on this budget we find out that the government are actually intending to change the focus of this campaign. Instead of running a prevention campaign, they are going to run a campaign which tells people where they should go if they have been victims of violence. Whilst that might be of assistance, the states already run crisis phone lines, domestic violence services and CASA——Centres Against Sexual Assault—services. The distinctive role that the Commonwealth could have played—and we hope, when we see the campaign material, still might—is in preventing this violence from happening to start with and educating the community about ways to form happy and healthy relationships without resorting to violence, particularly focusing on young people, who were the target of the campaign previously.
Labor, as part of our response to the budget, have released a plan to combat violence against women. I will not have the time in this speech to go through the detail of it, but I do commend it to the House, to any listeners or to readers of Hansard. This is a package which shows what we can do to significantly make a difference, to combat what is a growing tragedy of violence against women both in the home and in the broader community. We have made a range of commitments that we think will make people's lives a lot better and will give us an opportunity to tackle this problem in the way that we can at the Commonwealth level, by taking a national perspective in the way that the individual states cannot.
The third matter that I want to deal with in this speech on the appropriation bills is in relation to my shadow Attorney-General portfolio. I want to flag that the initiatives in the budget in this area are very few and far between. There was some initial interest in an extra amount of money that has been put into legal aid funding—which, since this government has been elected, has been drastically cut. We have seen some adjustments over the past few years which do put in additional money. There is an additional $13 million each year for the next four years. As I say, I am sure that will be welcome, but it still does not bring our Commonwealth legal aid funding, in real terms, back up to where it was in 1996. I have had some representations from the legal aid commissions and the states that the restrictions that are being put on the legal aid services in order to access this new money may well in fact cost more than the extra amount that has been put in the package. 
There is also an argument about the way the money has been distributed. Some states have had offers made to them that are far more beneficial than those made to other states. In my home state of Victoria, there is only a very small adjustment—I think it is even less than the CPI—and there is a concern that they are not getting a fair share of the money, which has marginally increased in this area.
The most important issue to raise with regard to the legal areas is my concern that the items set out in the budget that tell us how much we spend on the High Court, the Federal Court and legal aid all pale into insignificance when we consider how much the government spends on getting its own legal advice. We have had to do an extraordinary amount of work to find out exactly what the government does spend on its legal advice because, search as you might through the budget papers, you cannot find anything that actually itemises that. We have had to ask questions on notice, use the Freedom of Information Act and go to great lengths to get the government to come clean about the amount of money that it is spending in getting its own legal advice. We are now in a position to be able to tell you what we have found.
Although we have some more current figures, the following figure will make my point in relation to the budget. For the year 2001-02, the Commonwealth spent more money on its own legal advice—in fact, twice as much money on its own legal advice—than it spent on the whole Commonwealth legal aid budget. This means that the Commonwealth government spent more money on its legal advice—getting QCs to draft opinions or appear in immigration matters or elsewhere—than on its whole Commonwealth legal aid budget, which is supposed to provide for everybody across the country who might need some financial assistance in taking their legal matters to court. There is a very strict means test. Most of the money at the Commonwealth level is used for family law matters, but we are in the ridiculous situation where in my electorate—or the electorate of the member for Hunter or another member—an ordinary constituent, who might be on a moderate income and in the difficult situation whereby their family has broken down and they need the assistance of the Family Court, cannot get legal aid because there is not sufficient money. People that qualify to get legal aid—they meet all the means and merits tests—are turned away because there is not enough money, yet we have the government spending twice as much money on its own legal advice to make sure that it gets absolutely the best rolled-gold advice that it can.
We are going to be asking a lot of questions about this because I think it is extraordinary that, in the latest answers to our questions, it has emerged that the Department of Defence can spend $60 million on its legal advice just in one year and just for one department. The parliamentary secretary at the table, the member for Murray, might want to spend some time thinking about just what that $60 million could have been spent on had it been given to her electorate in the budget. I know that, in my electorate, $60 million could make a huge difference. Think of the child-care centres that we could build. Think of the programs that we could run in our schools. Think of getting that MRI machine rebatable. Think of all of the things that could be done for that amount of money. To put it in perspective, when you look at the other areas in the Attorney-General's portfolio, the community legal centres, which provide invaluable advice in all of our electorates—and I do not think anyone here, no matter what side of the House— 
—I am not sure whether the member for Hunter thinks he is being helpful in this or not. The entire annual funding for the community legal centres is around $23 million. We see that one individual department spends three times that amount on its own legal advice. Just imagine in each of our electorates how many people on low incomes there are who need some basic legal advice but cannot afford to go to private solicitors and cannot get the support from community legal centres because of the extraordinary pressure that those centres are under. A few million dollars being saved on the government's own legal advice could actually make a significant difference to the community legal centres, who did not get any increase under this budget at all. I think it does come down to a question of priorities: is the government prioritising its spending properly when it comes to the legal advice that it wants and needs and the support that it gives members in our community when they want and need legal advice and are not in a financial situation to pay for it themselves?
I want to make sure that people understand the significance of the amounts of money that are being spent on external legal advice. It certainly puts it in perspective when you find out that the Commonwealth spends more on its own legal advice than it spends on running our entire federal court system. The High Court, the Family Court, the Federal Court, the federal magistrate's court, registries around the country, and staff and judges cost us less each year than the Commonwealth's own legal advice costs. This is an extraordinary comparison and I think it is very serious and legitimate for us to be asking questions about whether we are getting value for money. I am concerned that the budget papers do not reveal anything about this expenditure and that we have had to ask questions on notice and use the Freedom of Information Act to obtain this information. I am also concerned that we do not know which law firms are providing this advice—it is a small number of mostly very large firms—and which areas they act in, yet they are benefiting significantly, getting millions and millions of dollars each year, in giving the government advice. I think that the public is entitled to know who that money is going to and at least ask the questions and be satisfied that it is necessary for the government to obtain this advice and spend the sort of money that could otherwise be prioritised on significant community projects, legal aid, community legal centres or other initiatives in individual members' electorates which might be much more worthy.

"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2004-05-31,"—I rise to support Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005 and cognate bills before the House. Mr Deputy Speaker, you can imagine that I have awaited the details of the Labor Party's environment policy with some real interest. We had no details delivered in the Leader of the Opposition's reply to the Treasurer's budget, except a fleeting reference that said the environment was good—something like motherhood. I presumed that there was some hard work going on into the formation of the Labor Party's environment policy somewhere and over some time because it is the state of the environment—and access to water in particular—that will underpin the future productivity of rural and regional Australia, including the mining industry, and that will underwrite the amenity and future shape of our cities. But it is more than that. Australians deserve to know that the landscape and the elements that interact to shape and protect that landscape will be understood, preserved and remediated by any future Australian government. 
The public knows what the coalition have delivered and what we stand for. The community only has to look at the commitments and achievements of the coalition since 1996, when a new era of nationally driven environmental policy and the largest financial commitment of any government since Federation were put in place. The John Howard government have revolutionised the way vulnerable species and heritage can be protected through the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The government have changed the way Australians think and act. We have delivered the world's first oceans policy and created some of the world's largest marine protected areas, including the Great Barrier Reef and around the subantarctic Heard and McDonald islands. We have created the first national institution dedicated to greenhouse gas emissions reduction and we gave it $1 billion to ensure that Australia met its Kyoto greenhouse emissions reduction targets. At the same time we managed the economy in such a way that we produced one of the strongest eras of growth this nation has ever seen despite the extraordinarily difficult international circumstances.
The Howard government made Australia's biggest, strongest and longest environmental commitment ever to a Natural Heritage Trust. This trust is now driving total catchment planning and, hence, a strategic approach to funding biodiversity protection, water and soil protection, sustainable agriculture, feral animal and weed eradication, land care, coast care and Indigenous land remediation. The Howard government made the nation's first commitment to halting the sweeping scourge of dryland salinity and put together a package of more than $1 billion to do the job through the national salinity and water quality action plan. It brought the states and territories to the table, some very reluctantly, and forced them to acknowledge the threat of encroaching soil salinisation.
Just as we stepped up to the waterfront bullies and turned the joke of waterside go-slows into one of the most efficient systems in the hemisphere, the Howard government tackled some of the most intransigent and difficult problems of failed federalism that affected the management of the environment every day. In the first serious attempt since Federation, the John Howard led coalition has sought, via a National Water Initiative, to have agreed state and territory principles of water entitlement and allocation, and a set of guidelines for the provision of adjustment assistance, where changes are made to private water entitlements.
The breadth of experience and the scope of the interests of members of the John Howard government have never been more apparent than in the development of the national water initiative. The Deputy Leader, John Anderson, himself the member for an electorate with serious water overallocation issues—created of course by the New South Wales government—understood the significance of the issues and provided a driving force for reform. Perhaps it is the lack of on-the-ground engagement that is the reason successive Labor governments have never tackled the real and difficult issues impacting on natural resource management. 
There is no federal rural electorate represented by the Labor Party. I do not believe there is a single primary producer, much less an irrigation farmer, amongst the Labor Party's elected members and senators. The day-to-day issues of paper-thin cost price squeezes, the declining terms of trade, drought survival, labour shortages, water security and property entitlements are not on the Labor agenda because it is all unfamiliar territory. The complexities and intensities of the debates have frightened the Labor Party into simple slogans and vague references, presumably in the hope that no-one who matters to them will notice.
How else can you account for the failure of Mark Latham, the Leader of the Opposition, to mention rural and regional Australia, beyond the standard general health and education references, in his budget in reply statement? Why is it that the Labor Party apparently has targeted 13 government programs for axing, including FarmBis, the diesel fuel rebate scheme, tax write-offs for water conservation and land care expenses, tax concessions for telephones and electricity lines, drought proofing investments, income tax averaging, education allowances, and exemptions from capital gains tax for farmers? The Leader of the Opposition's budget reply speech said nothing hopeful or useful about Labor's commitment to those who live outside the cities, and he said little more about its commitment to the environment.
Let me quote from the limited references the member for Werriwa's budget reply speech made. He said:
... Labor believes in investing in the environment, passing on our natural assets and heritage to the next generation ...
Mr Latham repeated this line virtually verbatim last week in his Fraser Lecture speech on Labor and the environment. Clearly it has made an impression on him. I wonder: does the Labor Party realise that some 70 per cent of the stewardship of the continent is in the hands of private primary producers? Intergenerational farm succession is the most common way that Australia's natural resources, assets and heritage are passed on to the next generation. Does the Labor Party realise that due to the worst drought on record; the concentration of ownership of Australia's supermarkets, which continuously screws down prices; and the unfair competition in corrupted and subsidised export markets, farming families are often too financially stressed to protect their inheritance? They farm the land for the benefit of all who depend on the environmental services. At the same time they produce some of the developed world's cheapest and best food and fibre. The production of this cheap food at prices that producers must take from the supermarkets and the export markets means that much food production is simply not sustainable. It is literally costing our society the earth.
If the opposition does know and does care about this critical natural resource threatening dilemma, what is it going to do about it? We would all like to know. What is Labor's policy for sustaining primary production in this country? Instead, we find that one of Mr Latham's greatest concerns for the future, as espoused in his environmental policy speech, is the creation of new World Heritage areas. The listing of new heritage areas and the support of the currently declared ones is in itself a very laudable occupation. That is why the John Howard government has created new heritage protection regimes through the EPBC Act and has advanced this work. We have also instigated a new $52 million heritage program called Distinctively Australian. 
But I would not have thought that the creation of new World Heritage areas rated as more critical than strategies to deal with our overallocated or droughted river systems, or with feral animal and weed invasions, Indigenous owned land rehabilitation, salinity, acid sulphate soils, climate change impacts on water supply and biodiversity, capping the Great Artesian Basin bores, protecting Indigenous intellectual property, establishing new Indigenous protected areas, revegetating the landscape, overfishing and the list goes on—to name just a few threatening processes and key issues that the John Howard government is now tackling with some of the biggest budget injections ever committed by a federal government.
I suspect the clutch by the opposition leader, Mark Latham, at World Heritage listings as a key plank of his environmental platform is in part testimony to his ignorance but, as well, he has probably been advised that this represents some safe and non-controversial pandering to the urban constituencies who might be tempted away from Labor to vote for the Greens. I think Mr Latham is sadly out of touch with environmentally aware Australians throughout rural and metropolitan Australia. I am sure that thinking Australians want more than motherhood statements and iconic references when it comes to making their decision about which party is serious, for example, about policy settings that tackle such issues as equity balance between consumptive water use and environmental health, between holders of a water entitlement and the wider community, including taxpayers, and between current and future generations. All Australians need to know how the next federal government will respond to these potentially national development stalling issues.
We do know a little bit about the ignorance of the Labor leader, Mark Latham, in regard to Australian rural enterprise. The member for Werriwa is on record describing the farm sector as the most heavily subsidised part of our economy. Is he really unaware of the facts, or in this case is he again pandering to those who know nothing about the realities of modern agribusiness but who love to imagine that the countryside is peopled with rich capitalists driving cut-down Bentleys? The fact is that Australian farmers rank the lowest in the value of government support received compared to the other 30 countries in the OECD. That is why even our most efficient producers battle to compete against the subsidised competition in export markets.
I do not think the opposition leader has tried that old `subsidised farmer' line outside a capital city. I suspect he would not have survived to repeat it. This is old Labor trade union speak. It reflects the old jealousies and ignorance about owning land and landed gentry, make-believe class distinctions and a divide and rule mentality that has been dusted off and given a new lease of life under Latham's Labor. We see it in the references to so-called subsidised farmers and in any reference to so-called elite school funding.
The reality for Australia's rural and regional populations today is that many depend on the $900 million payments in exceptional circumstances that flow in fortnightly to put food on their tables and to pay down drought-induced debt. In the electorate of Murray, this amounts to over $1 million a fortnight to cover over 1,000 farm households. In this worst drought on record, some lenders in Victoria are pressuring farm households to sell their water entitlements to restore some equity in their assets. Selling permanent water rights has the potential to make parts of our irrigation systems non-viable and is strangling the chances of whole regions to recover from drought when rains eventually restore the irrigation supply. 
Drought relief or the impacts of drought on communities did not rate a mention in the Leader of the Opposition's budget reply—not a single reference to the D word—nor did it occur in his Fraser Lecture environment statement. The John Howard government has committed over $900 million to drought relief—nearly $1 billion—and it is an open-ended commitment. What is the opposition's policy in relation to the future of exceptional circumstances and drought policy? What does the shadow Treasurer think about the drought response of fellow Victorian, Premier Mr Bracks, in that state?
The Victorian government has refused to make drought declarations over parts of northern Victoria, in particular in the electorate of Murray. Only months after offering $20,000 per drought-stricken farm, Premier Bracks pulled this offer without notice, leaving communities bewildered and angry. Needless to say, the drought in northern Victoria continues, and for many this season is proving to be the hardest yet.
Perhaps the opposition's studied silence with respect to this government's $900 million drought relief fund reflects the intention of Labor to redirect the fund away from struggling rural families to fill their budgetary black hole, if they are ever in office. They have promised, of course, extra tax cuts and increased spending on all manner of favourite new city-centric policies that their union bosses have wheeled out. I challenge the Labor Party to clearly enunciate their exceptional circumstances policies and their intentions in relation to the $900 million commitment that this government has made. Rural families are waiting for that commitment.
It was also interesting to see Mark Latham, the member for Werriwa, waxing lyrical in relation to Tasmanian forest policy in his environmental speech, because not once did he call the Tasmanian Labor government to task for mismanaging elements of the regional forestry agreement, the RFA—for example, the clear-felling right down into the creek beds and gully lines, destroying the habitat and endangering the survival of the Tasmanian giant freshwater lobster. Not once did he refer to the use of poisons to kill off the species that try to survive on regenerating or new plantings in areas after the clear-felling and burning of the old-growth forest in Tasmania. Instead, the opposition leader, Mark Latham, thundered:
It's not social justice to put mature age workers with a single set of skills onto the dole queue. Working class communities in Tasmania would be devastated by such a policy.
And what policy was Latham, the member for Werriwa, referring to? Apparently, it was the `phasing out the clear-felling of old-growth forests'.
Certainly, the Labor government of Tasmania have to do much better in managing the regional forestry agreements in Tasmania. Their own population is becoming increasingly disturbed about the way they see some of the old-growth forests being trashed. But Mr Latham fails to make clear what Labor's commitment is to properly managed RFAs. After all, the RFAs are supposed to deliver sustainable forestry practices that look after the jobs of those employed in associated industry, while adequately reserving and protecting species and important ecosystems. As I say, the budget response and last Wednesday's environment speech from the Leader of the Opposition were a real window into the breadth and depth—or I should say the lack of it—of environmental thinking from the other side of the House. 
I met with some of Australia's leaders in eastern Australian irrigation enterprise last night, and they were appalled by the limitations and the naivete of the opposition leader's speech content when it strayed into the condition of the Murray River. The Leader of the Opposition feigned mock sincerity and declared:
It's time to end the buck-passing between the Federal Government and the States. Not tomorrow. Today. Scientists tell us the Murray/Darling needs an additional 450 gigalitres of environmental flows to re-open its mouth to the sea—the starting point for cleansing and regenerating the river.
For a start, dredging the mouth of the Murray is not the starting point for a Murray system cure; it is the last of a number of impacts that come from the worst drought on record and the reversal of the natural flow regime in the river. The coalition government and its Murray-Darling Basin Council state and territory colleagues have approved funds to dredge the mouth to restore the sea connection, while we all get on with the even more important and effective work upstream. So what does the Labor Party mean? Is it supporting the Murray-Darling Basin Living Murray initiative—which, under Commonwealth leadership, has brought the five jurisdictions in the basin to an agreed first cut of additional water allocation to the Murray, with $500 million on the table to undertake the work that will find that water from savings in the systems and improved water-use efficiency while, at the same time, being mindful of the social and economic impacts on the communities which also need to survive?
Does Labor support the Snowy joint government agreement that allocates another 70 gigalitres to the Murray River and 212 gigalitres to the Snowy River, with a further $375 million to find this water in overallocated systems or where water can be saved? Again, that agreement is between the states and the Commonwealth. Doesn't Labor understand that an agreement has been made? The farmers certainly want to know. Where does Labor think it is going to find the 1,500 gigalitres that it now claims is needed, within 10 years, from the Murray to be added downstream? Rural communities want to know if the Labor Party supports the principles of the National Water Initiative, which is in the process of negotiation with all states and territories and is led by the Commonwealth.
We all need to have some sense of the future as we work through extraordinarily complex water allocation and property rights issues. We do not need breast-beating nonsense. All we have had to this point is slogans from the Leader of the Opposition. I am most fearful when I look at what is happening in rural and regional communities that are droughted. There is the struggle to get a fair go with a decent price for produce when a lot of that produce is some of the cleanest and most efficiently produced in the world. I am also concerned about small- and medium-sized businesses in rural and regional communities. I want to pay my respects to the owners of the John Anderson Pharmacy who are in the gallery tonight—Aggie and John Anderson, their daughter and her friend. They manage a medium-sized business in Shepparton which gives excellent service to the communities of Shepparton-Mooroopna in these difficult times, in an area which has experienced its third and fourth years of the worst drought on record.
Small businesses in rural and regional Australia also want to know what the Labor Party has in mind in terms of policies in relation to their futures. One issue is how they can employ labour without the threat of unfair dismissal laws catching up with them. Too often in small rural and regional communities there are labour shortages. In the face of labour shortages, there is a strong disincentive for employing a new, untried work force when they know they could end up in court defending actions which have no basis. Unfair dismissals laws have been brought before the Senate 40 times in an attempt to get Labor to support them. I ask that Labor does so that people like the Andersons can continue to do excellent business in superb regions like the Murray in northern Victoria. I thank the House.

"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,2004-05-31,"—I would certainly associate myself with the amendment to the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005, and associated bills, which was moved by the member for Hotham. That amendment goes to the issue of the electoral driving force behind the budget—the question of pneumococcal vaccine for children; funding with respect to children who drop out of school; the increased cost of people going into higher education in this country; and the decline in bulk-billing, particularly in rural and regional Australia.
Before getting to the broader issues, however, I would like to deal with a few aspects in the area of settlement. I noticed that today the related minister has come out with a press release in which he defends his latest extravaganza in Melbourne: $200,000 to hire the Royal Exhibition Building for one citizenship ceremony. That is $200,000 for one day at the Royal Exhibition Building. This is supposedly part of a grand citizenship advertising campaign. Admittedly, there are reasons for some action by him. As opposed to an average citizenship rate of 109,000 people under Labor, citizenship has again declined in the last year, after a short-term increase. Previously the minister has said that he believes the essential important days for citizenship ceremonies are Australia Day, Harmony Day and his newly-created Citizenship Day in September. However, this latest event was justified because it was Mothers Day. Unfortunately, the reason for this grand $200,000 event in Melbourne was unknown to his public servants who appeared before Senate estimates last week. When they were asked why this event occurred and why there was this expenditure for hiring the centre, they said: `No particular reason. It was not an important day. We are not really sure why it happened.' So now it is Mothers Day. I gather that Apple and Pear Day is either today or tomorrow. I could be corrected as to which day it is. Maybe the minister will be doing Carmen Miranda impersonations with headgear decorated with apples and pears in a further attempt to milk citizenship for all it is worth.
However, other aspects of this budget are of concern in this portfolio. The government says it will be expending an additional $29.8 million over four years on promotional measures to encourage humanitarian settlement in rural and regional areas. We all know—the previous speaker talked about this—about the need to try to attract population to rural and regional Australia. The government is claiming that $30 million over the next four years is going for this. However, if we look at other portfolios, we find reductions in Medicare expenditure of $36 million over four years and a reduction of $30 million in social security payments for this new rural and regional migration platform. DIMIA will also gain $58 million from these new settlers over four years as a result of visa application charges for its new regional visas. So, in actual fact, this much-vaunted, much-promoted increased expenditure of $30 million is dwarfed by $58 million of revenue gains and $65 million of cuts in other portfolios—a net saving to the budget of $93 million. This much-promoted, much-speculated-about thrust for regional migration is essentially, at the end of the day, a revenue gain for the government rather than a massive, multimillion dollar initiative by the government. 
I also note, with regard to settlement services, that the overall increase in the budget is largely a matter of the higher migration intake. The government of small migration, the government that was hitting the previous government over the head for having excessive migration intakes, has of course been slowly increasing the intake each year and has announced a further rise this year—mainly around regional and humanitarian refugee intake.
It is interesting to note that much of the supposed increased spending in this field is actually to do with medical checks for those coming into Australia and transport costs of arriving here. They are not really about settlement service within Australia. Once again, there is gilding of the lily to some extent in regard to these claims. There was one gesture that seemed very worth while and we would not criticise it for a moment—that is, English language tuition for refugees. For some unknown reason, it is limited to those from 16 to 24 years of age. The paper speaks of refugees getting up to—and I stress `up to'—400 additional hours. However, we know from past experience that these citations of supposed figures of assistance are often not from the real world. In the past we know the minister talked about refugees getting up to—again, up to—an additional 100 hours, but we found that in reality the average was 68 hours. So there are a few concerns with regard to that portfolio.
I turn to the broader issues. The previous speaker spoke at one stage about make-believe class distinctions. Quite frankly, there are two fundamental aspects of this budget: one of them is the class based decisions in a number of portfolios and the other is the clear relationship of this budget to the electoral cycle. Other speakers have mentioned that 80 per cent of revenue initiatives by this government have occurred in the three pre-election years. It is nothing to do with the state of the economy or the supposed or very real budget positives in those particular years; it has more to do with the election cycle. Here we see $52 billion of initiatives, following the 2001 level of $25½ billion and the 1998 level of $20 billion, and included in this is $6 billion to be spent in a period of six weeks.
The real rub of this lies in the accompanying advertising campaign by the government—$100 million of taxpayers' money is to be devoted to selling to the Australian electorate the brilliance, management and initiatives of the government, an organisation that have attempted over the last decade constantly to create new loopholes in our electoral laws and find new ways of concealing the money that they are obtaining from the private sector. The infamous Greenfields Foundation is indicative of these kinds of problems. They are not content with that. They are not content with having a cloak-and-dagger approach to telling the Australian people where the government's revenue for their campaigning comes from; they are now seeking to spend $100 million of taxpayers' money on electoral promotion. I am very interested in my adjacent seat of Parramatta and it is interesting to note the campaign there. One of the aldermen from the council was out the other week campaigning in the Winston Hills area, which is probably the best part of the electorate for the coalition, and the comments of a Sri Lankan resident were probably a resounding indication of how this budget is coming over. He said: `In Sri Lanka they try to bribe us with a sack of rice. Here today we see the same kind of endeavour by this government—a desperate measure to try and survive.' That is indicative of the reaction in the electorate at this stage. Anyone who is a realist and a pragmatist knows that, over the next period, this campaign will have some impact at least. But at this stage it is not going very far. 
In this $52 billion extravaganza there is the question of tax cuts. Many speakers have talked about the degree to which this government has increased tax revenue over its period in government—$9,000 on average and $5½ thousand in income tax. But it is interesting to note that, while the previous speaker spoke about these `fanciful', `imaginary' and `unreal' class distinctions as not being around the place these days, these tax cuts are very much targeted at a particular sector in the economy—that is, people on particular revenue levels. I notice from the 2001 census figures—and I understand that this is self-reporting—that 92.7 per cent of people in the Reid electorate will not be assisted by these measures. In the adjacent seat of Parramatta, that figure is 85 per cent.
So the vast majority of people who trudged out to Parramatta Stadium the other week to watch Parramatta go down again to St George, the people who go to the Westfield shopping complex in Parramatta and the parents of the students at Delany College in my electorate or at Parramatta High School will not be assisted by this budget. Those figures for electors in the Parramatta subregion of our two seats contrast very sharply with the 33 per cent approximately of Bradfield electors who gain some benefit from this scheme and the 73.3 per cent of Kooyong electors who are in a similar situation. So much for claims that there is no class basis to these initiatives by the government. Clearly the vast majority of Australians will not gain by these measures. They are the people on lower incomes and who characteristically are settled in the electorates of Western Sydney.
We also have the $600 measure. It is interesting to note that this afternoon the shadow minister cited supposed system problems in the government department in regard to debts in the family benefits area. It appears that up to 150,000 families who lodge early tax returns will not be advised of their debt. He is quite correct in saying that this is reminiscent of the 2001 election, when the government decided to hold back debts until after the election. That is similar in fashion to the way in which they are holding back one of the two $600 payments. So there is no real guarantee that it is going to happen. Historically, given the pattern of core and non-core promises, one can have no confidence that it will. Today we see that, reminiscent of past practices in this particular area, people will not be receiving their bills until they cast their ballot papers. All up, it has been reported that 60 per cent of Australians will receive neither the tax cuts nor the family benefit.
In contrast, Labor has a series of proposals to address crucial problems confronting the people of this country. The issue of bulk-billing and the attempt to save Medicare, efforts in regard to children, the baby care payment that the government has now become attracted to in a very tardy fashion after Labor's announcement, the issue of 20,000 university and TAFE places and the earn to learn programs are worthwhile national initiatives.
I want to talk briefly about dental care. In 1996, when this government came in, one of its first measures was to scrap the then existing programs. It is interesting to note the very recent article `Social inequality in perceived oral health among adults in Australia' by Anne Sanders and John Spencer in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health Vol 28 No. 2. They said: 
For subjective oral health measures, the magnitude of difference across income groups was most pronounced in the 18-44 years age group. In multivariate analysis, low household income, blue-collar occupation, and high residential area disadvantage were positively associated with social impact from oral conditions and pathological tooth loss. Speaking other than English at home (relative to English), low household income (relative to high income), and vocational relative to tertiary education were each associated with more than twice the odds of poor self-rated oral health. 
They furthermore said:
... that socio-economic factors ... are markers of other genetic, social and psychological phenomena that drive variation in health. Such factors differentially expose people to risk and protective factors, thereby producing patterns of disease in populations correlated with socio-economic position. Prominent among the social determinants for health inequalities are social support and stressful living conditions.
That very recent article hit on the realities. Once again, the issue of class based politics in this country is supposedly imaginary, but one of the first actions of this government, as I said, was to scrap the then existing dental scheme. It has come up with something since then, reacting to Labor driving this issue over the last few months. It is a very minimal scheme—in the area of $5 million—helping only 23,000 Australians.
We have large numbers of people in this country who cannot get their teeth treated because they have not got the money. There have been a variety of surveys that have come to that conclusion. There are vast numbers of people in this country who cannot afford to go to dentists. This article discusses those decisions being based on socioeconomic circumstances, yet the government come in and abandon a program. Only at the last minute, just before the election, have they come up with a very minimal program to do something about it. Labor, in contrast, many months ago, proposed an initiative of $120 million which will actually do something. It will actually accomplish something—it will actually help people. 
The other measure is, as I said, just an advertising gimmick—an indication that it is not just sitting around doing nothing but is out there. I was out at Westmead hospital in the electorate of Parramatta the other week and I was amazed to see the facilities that are unutilised in the hospital from the former dental care program that operated out of there. On this front, the government's program has a number of conditions: you have to have a very serious health problem and your dental issue has to be related to that particular health problem. 
Medicare in my electorate still has a very high level of bulk-billing because of the nature of the constituency and the degree of competition, but we know that in vast parts of Australia it has been in freefall. Of course, that has led to initiatives by the government to try to delay and suppress statistics on this matter. Labor has said that it will immediately increase the patient rebate for each bulk-billed service to 95 per cent of the schedule fee and to 100 per cent in 2006-07. In contrast, the government has shambled together a proposal which sees people in Tasmania, which in many areas have higher levels of bulk-billing, being subsidised to encourage bulk-billing whereas vast parts of the outer regional belts of Sydney and Melbourne and regional Australia, particularly on the North Coast of New South Wales, have abysmal levels. They are going down because basically in some of those places doctors are intimidated not to bulk-bill as they are not towing the line, they are not part of the team. But, as I said, because of the way in which some Tasmanian senators jumped on the government's wagon, we see this anomaly where some parts of that state gain from enhanced encouragement of bulk-billing while other areas of Australia that need it far more suffer.
Labor has recognised that there is a significant problem in this country regarding people completing high school. Labor's earn or learn proposal has been very much welcomed as an initiative to do something about that problem. It is interesting to note that Kenneth Davidson, in an article in the last week or so, made the point that a variety of players in the system went to the Treasurer, Mr Costello, and suggested that this kind of initiative was very worth while. However, nothing occurred and it is now up to the Labor Party to come forward. I quote Kenneth Davidson: 
As the middle-class obsesses over the alternative public and private school pathways to higher education, the question of what happens to the 50,000 young people each year who don't achieve a year 12 or equivalent qualification has tended to be ignored by the Howard government and the public. 
But Mark Latham has now put the issue on the political agenda with “Labor's Youth Guarantee: Learn or Earn” which, to my surprise, is a serious attempt to put into practice the Coalition's concept of “mutual obligation”.
He further commented about the economics of this:
Even if the program was paid for by government borrowings at 5 per cent, the anticipated return of around 9.6 per cent over the period 2004 to 2005 means that it would more than pay for itself. Yet the proposal was comprehensively ignored in the budget. Costello appears obsessed with cutting taxes and repaying government debt rather than building up human capital that can generate additional net wealth for the future.
That submission came from the group of nine, which includes the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group and a variety of other players, including the ACTU. It was rejected but has now been put forward by the Labor Party and welcomed in large parts of Australia to make sure that every person at least gets the opportunity to get either a job or else some training. It does of course form a stark contrast to jobs for the dole, where people very often come out with lamentable skills improvements—pieces of paper sometimes but very little accomplished by way of learning.
Another facet of the budget is education. There is not only the question of earning or learning but the question of the government's obsession with helping the alma maters of the frontbench of the coalition. If you were to go along the front bench you would find that some of the schools that have been assisted are very much of that character—the King's School, in particular, has had an increase of 190 per cent over recent periods. That contrasts with Trinity Catholic College in my own electorate—the largest Catholic college in New South Wales—which has had a 20 per cent rise, and Fairvale High School, in Western Sydney, which has had a rise of 25 per cent.
I do not think the King's School really needs that money. Many have commented on the rifle range, the boat sheds, the swimming pools and educational facilities that outrun what the vast majority of Australian students receive. Labor promises a national resource standard with money to match it. It says that there certainly has to be a redistribution of funding amongst schools to make sure that some equity comes back into the process. It is all right for members opposite to talk about some cleaner who might send their kids to King's but that is not the reality of the school in Parramatta.

"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,2004-05-31,"—Even in responding to the appropriation legislation we get misleading statements like, `The Howard government discontinued the dental program introduced by the Keating government.' It was introduced for four years and was to be finished at the end of four years. It was designed to clean up the backlog and it was recognised that that responsibility had always resided with state governments, whatever their political persuasion. 
It is interesting to note, too, when one gets lectured about school funding and private school funding, that I have been in this place long enough to remember the new schools program, better known in my electorate as the `no new schools program'. It was the policy of the previous Labor government. That program made it impossible for the average community group to get a school off the ground, because the first thing they had to get was 50 full fee paying paid-up students, which was extremely difficult. I am getting fed up with being told about King's or some of the other so-called elite schools, whose parent bodies have been contributing through fees and donations for centuries in some cases—certainly decades—and have built up assets at their cost. Many no longer have the financial capacity of their parents or grandparents, who were in a different economic situation. Those people are entitled to have a share of the government largesse in this particular area.
I am old enough to remember the original program from the schools debate—I will think of the name of it in a minute—that was conducted during the Menzies era, when state governments were doing everything in their power to starve private schools out of existence. It was a philosophical debate. Menzies said that we wanted a choice for people and commenced the role of the Commonwealth government paying money into education which, of course, the states had never conceded to the Commonwealth doing at the time of Federation.
There are so many things that we hear from speakers like the member for Reid when they suddenly become enamoured of the earn or learn strategy. I do not know what that exactly means for some, because if you are at school and your academic capacity has been exceeded and you are just a nuisance in the classroom to those kids who can progress, then what are you doing there? The only way that kids will get a job is through having a job opportunity. I have seen it with three children and I will be seeing it very shortly with grandchildren. Getting that first job, whatever it might be, puts you on the rungs of the ladder to long-term employment that we often hear about. Many years ago I encouraged one of my children to take a job for nothing to get that first reference. I knew she had the ability, and it was demonstrated not many years later when she was receiving very high wages for a person of her age in that period. But she would never have got there without that first job. As far as I was concerned it did not matter what she got paid: it was about the employer having knowledge of her previous employment.
I had the privilege of going to see the musical stage show The Lion King—the lion king, not the lying king! The Lion King has some amazing characters and, for what I guess we would have thought was a kids' story, a pretty interesting interweaving story. There is the lion king, a man of great stature representing good governance, and his conniving, nasty brother. He goes to tell the hyenas how he will get them into power. When I was listening to the response of the Leader of the Opposition to the budget, I thought of that speech, which is set to music. He says, `I will save you. I will get you everything you want, you hyenas, just back me when I kill the king. Help me.' It is interesting to watch the hyenas all slavering away, waiting for the goodies to arrive. He sees off the prince consort, who goes away and lives, I think, with a warthog and some other animal. He convinces him that he is not wanted and that he contributed to the death of his father—it is an absolute lie.
I hope you can see the parallels, Mr Deputy Speaker Baressi. In the end, the people go searching for the prince consort because, when the conniving brother takes over on the death of the king, the economy collapses and they are in all sorts of trouble as a nation. There is no food for the hyenas—they were promised unlimited food and got nothing. The reality of that story is that you have to do more than promise; you have to make sure that you can fulfil those promises when the time comes. 
When we look at the budget papers and the tax initiatives and we see that there are adjustments being made to the thresholds in the higher levels, we are told that they can do that better. But what seems to be totally misunderstood among the arithmetically challenged members of the opposition—and I will have to join them in a three-legged race, I think—is this fact of life: everybody that pays tax pays it at the lower marginal rates of 17c and 30c. Some—an ever increasing number of Australians—also pay tax at the higher rates. When we look back a bit in history we find that there was a time not that long ago when you had to earn five times average weekly earnings—have five times the purchasing power of an average worker—before you hit the top marginal tax rate. Recently, as we know, it was almost getting to one to one; it was certainly below 1½ times average weekly earnings.
When that happens, government has a responsibility to make some adjustments to those rates, and those adjustments are modest. But what seems to be overlooked is that, if you go back and lower the other rates, as this government has done during its term of office, that is still a benefit for the higher paid, because they pay 30c on the component of their income that fits within the thresholds, they pay 17c on the lower component and they pay nothing on $6,000. The Leader of the Opposition in his budget response did not bother to enlighten the Australian people, let alone the parliament, on the arithmetic associated with his `I'll save you' type speech. The cost of even a 1c reduction in the tax rate—or the cost of extending those thresholds—is extremely high. But, furthermore, it is equally a benefit to those on higher incomes who, we are told, do not really need it. Our government thought they did need it, because the relationship between the different tax scales had become ridiculous.
Of course, there is a very good reason that so many people are getting into those higher income brackets: good economic management. That happens when a government, such as the Howard government, manages to deliver wage increases that buy more goods and not, as occurred in the Hawke and Keating years, wage increases that buy fewer goods. Please be reminded that throughout the 13 years of the Labor government, in a highly regulated industrial relations arrangement known as the accord, the buying power of the working man's wages increased by one per cent—not one per cent per annum, but just one per cent. Compare that to the current situation where, every year since the Howard-Costello economic team have been at work, we have seen a substantial increase in the buying power—the real power—of workers' wages. And that is with, surprisingly, substantial deregulation.
It is interesting that, down at the waterfront, as we have been told, half as many people are working and they have achieved a 30 per cent increase in productivity. That is what allows wages to grow and prices to be stable—productivity exceeding or at least matching wages growth. That is not the policy of the unions, who run the Labor Party. Their policy is that they have to be somewhere—in the Industrial Relations Commission or something—cranking up the nominal value of wages—with all the add-ons that employers must then bear—because it gives them a nice warm inner glow. But throughout its period, the Hawke and Keating government did not do much for the workers. They, in fact, had virtually negative buying power increases—and when they are not spending, there are no new jobs, including no new jobs for kids. Yet we are told that, by some miracle of legislation and a further strain on the taxpayer, the earn or learn policy will fix all that up. 
Kids are primarily in demand today. Yes, we can be quoted certain streets or certain suburbs that may still be enduring high teenage—not youth—unemployment. But this budget is going to give parents of a lot of those children more buying power, and their taxation responsibility is to be reduced. The differentiation is that, instead of just going to the 30 cent bracket, which currently applies to 80 per cent of Australians—they do not go above it—and making a 1c or 2c adjustment, the government has gone along and made an assessment that the people who have the greatest pressure on their earnings are those who are supporting children.
I laughed—in fact, I picked up my pen and wrote to the Financial Review—when I read a letter in that paper. One would think, when they are as discriminatory as they are in publishing letters to the editor, that they would have thought twice about publishing this one. This letter was from someone in their 30s, I think, who complained bitterly that they were not getting any special treatment out of the budget—someone who was single, had a single income and had no kids. Anybody who has had the opportunity to compare that lifestyle with the lifestyle you have when you are raising a family, with all the additional pressures that go on your income, knows that you could be taxed three times as much in that category—single, single income, and no kids—and still compare favourably to someone on a single income with a wife or husband and two or three kids.
So where have we delivered the benefits in this budget? We have added a substantial amount of money: $600 per child prior to the end of the financial year and another $600 thereafter. The member for Reid chose to run this rabbit down a hole, with the member for Lilley claiming that there is something dishonest and wrong about sometimes asking people at the reconciliation period to pay back overpayments they have received through the tax arrangements.
But what I have not heard from the Labor Party is their solution. Is it their intention to let people strap up against the regular taxpayers—with $1,000 of overpayment—and say: `It wasn't my fault. You can't have that back'? Is that going to proceed through to our income tax arrangements, where we have some discretion in how we get PAYE taken out of our wages if our employer goes: `Wink, wink, nod, nod, I'll only take this much out of this week. Don't worry about it, we've got a new Labor government and they won't ask you to settle that extra amount at the end of the financial year'? Is that what Labor are talking about? I can tell you that I bet it is not and they never have. Of course, if it is a tax arrangement, once a year we are expected by the community to reconcile it. Some of us might get a refund; others will get a tax bill. Some get them quarterly, if they are private businesses. Nobody has ever suggested that that is not the case. The more that can be done to make sure that people are not misled in the arrangements that they make with Centrelink and others, the better. But the reality of how the system works is showing up in the statistics the Prime Minister gave us today. Fewer and fewer people are receiving overpayments during the financial year; therefore, fewer and fewer people have to make arrangements to refund that money. But they have had it. It has been in their pockets. They have spent it. It is not as though it floated through their bank account and disappeared back out again. I find this one of the most illogical arguments that has ever been presented in this parliament since I have been here. 
There is another major factor in the budgets of the Howard-Costello government—that is, real taxes have not risen. I have to say that in my early years in this place and throughout the Hawke-Keating government, we never came to the budget to find out which taxes were going down; we just wanted to know which ones were going up. When some people in this place started to raise the issue of fuel prices, I went to the library to get confirmation of my own recollections. When the Hawke government was elected, excise on petrol was a bit over 7c a litre. When the Keating government was defeated, that excise was up around 34c a litre. Of course, that was a result of indexation. It was a self-generating tax mechanism, because petrol is part of the CPI. The CPI goes up, petrol goes up. Furthermore, there were discretionary decisions, as I recollect: one of 6c a litre—just a straight increase, over and above the CPI adjustment—and another of 3c a litre, which occurred in the l-a-w law tax election.
And please remember what that was about. Outside of politics, the coalition put forward the Fightback proposal, which included a goods and services tax. Then the leader of the government at the time, Mr Keating, told Australians: `You don't need a GST to get tax reform. I will deliver it without tax reform. To prove how dinkum I am, I'll put the actual personal tax cuts into l-a-w law, and I promise you faithfully there will be no increase in indirect taxation. I can do it.' Of course, the l-a-w law was discontinued after the election, we saw a 3c discretionary amount go onto petrol and, as I recollect, about two per cent or thereabouts on sales tax, with some more dramatic increases on individual items.
Here we are facing it all again. We had the speech from the lion king's brother to the hyenas, in response to a fully structured, carefully thought out financial plan. That is where the circumstance remains today, with the government delivering good economic management, putting the figures before the people, saving and reducing debt, and the opposition getting up and giving us all sorts of promises, with no evidence of where the money will come from. In fact, the other day I thought of the science of alchemy—turning lead into gold. There is plenty of lead on the Labor Party front bench, but I do not know whether they will ever be able to find the gold.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2004-05-31,"—I do not intend wasting any time on the member for O'Connor's contribution on this Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005 and its cognate bills—save to point out that the coalition engages from time to time in a furphy about wage increases and wages during Labor's period of office compared to those during the coalition's period of office. That furphy involves not taking into account advances in what are described loosely as the social wage—for example, the establishment of Medicare and the establishment of superannuation and employer contributions to superannuation, which are going to nine per cent and which make a substantial difference to the capacity of ordinary Australians to provide for themselves in retirement. His observation about wages also failed to take into account the impact of cost-of-living issues, such as the goods and services tax, rising petrol prices and the like.
The first thing I want to talk about in relation to this budget is the provision for defence spending, particularly in the context of the war in Iraq. That war has been a disaster—first and foremost for the people of Iraq themselves, but also in its ramifications right around the globe, including here in Australia. Progressively, misleading statements—indeed outright lies—have been exposed about the nature of that war. Firstly, we were told that we needed to go to war in Iraq to prevent the use of weapons of mass destruction. In fact, those weapons of mass destruction were not used when the war eventuated. They have never been found. The truth is they simply did not exist. They do not exist, and those governments and political leaders who told us that they did exist were misleading ordinary Australians for their own political advantage. 
Secondly, we were told that going to Iraq was a part of the war on terrorism. It was never part of the war on terrorism. Al-Qaeda was not involved in Iraq. Indeed, al-Qaeda is now involved in Iraq, so invading Iraq has been completely counterproductive. It has made the war on terrorism more difficult, and the leadership of the war on terrorism—whether it is in the United States or here in Australia—has been found wanting.
Thirdly, we were told that the Iraqi people wanted us to get rid of Saddam Hussein—that they wanted him out and, as soon as we got him out, people would rise up and sing hallelujah and rejoice. Some polling has been conducted in Iraq, and it tells us that most Iraqi people want the Western forces out. We are now engaged in fighting against the Sunnis, the Shiites, various militias and the remnants of the Baathist regime—which makes you wonder from time to time just who in Iraq is supporting us.
So what have been the achievements of going into Iraq? The first achievement that tens of thousands of innocent Iraqi men, women and children have been killed. Frankly, all the consequences that we talk about pale into insignificance beside that tragic and entirely unacceptable outcome. The second achievement is that this has made Australia a bigger terrorist target. This is the thing that the AFP commissioner, Mick Keelty, spoke about on TV—a statement of the bleeding obvious. For his pains, he was heavied by representatives of the Howard government and effectively forced to issue a retraction. But the truth stands—the truth will out—and there is no doubt that our involvement in Iraq has made us a bigger terrorist target.
The third achievement is that this has been a detour from the war on terrorism. If the sorts of resources that have been put into Iraq had been put into the hunt for Osama bin Laden, perhaps Osama bin Laden would have been captured. The truth is that, instead of the United States and other forces seeking to properly apprehend Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda representatives, they chose to go off on an unrelated frolic of their own in Iraq. Indeed, if a fraction of the resources which have been put into the war in Iraq had been put into seeking to find a lasting peace in the Middle East and dealing with the Palestinian question, we might have made progress there and we would be much better placed in the war on terrorism. There is no doubt in my mind—and I have many people of Arabic and Islamic background in my electorate—that one of the ongoing sources of grievance for people of Islamic background is the failure of the West to find an outcome in relation to the Palestinian question and to establish a genuine Middle East peace.
The fourth achievement that going into Iraq has done is to damage the United Nations and the idea of an international rule of law. It has damaged Australia's standing in the world. It has encouraged a cowboy and vigilante mentality, the international rule of the jungle and the belief that might is right and that, if we are able to go in there and overthrow a regime, we can do that. That kind of arrogant `we know best' attitude coming from United States Republicans has done the world a great disservice. Some on the other side say that Labor representatives are anti-American. Nothing could be further from the truth. I have no doubt that, had Al Gore been elected president of the United States, the war on terrorism would have been handled differently. We would certainly not have been invading Iraq and this debacle would never have happened. It is not about being anti-American. It is about asking: what is the correct approach to international affairs, what is the right way to achieve peace and justice around the world? 
The fifth achievement is that the price of petrol has gone up. I do not accept it as a legitimate element of foreign affairs policy to say that we can go into Iraq and kill tens of thousands of people in order to keep the price of petrol down but, even if you thought that was the objective, the opposite has occurred. This policy has been so spectacularly unsuccessful that we now find that the price of petrol for ordinary motorists is going up as a result of Middle East instability. So what we have got here is an absolute debacle—a shameful debacle—in the conduct of international affairs. We have the prisoner abuse scandal. We have got no exit strategy. We were deceived by the likes of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who said that we would be out of there in months, not years. The truth is we have been there for well over a year and the Howard government is unable to set any date at all for this country to remove itself from Iraq.
The impression given by those opposite was that this would be a walk in the park; in fact, it has been turning into another Vietnam. We are not wanted there. We should never have gone there without United Nations backing. The idea of Australia invading other countries who have not attacked us is repulsive. The idea that they were going to attack us and use weapons of mass destruction to do so was fanciful. It has been exposed as a charade, a fraud, and the impact of this monumental stuff-up on the part of the coalition will live on in Australia for years and years after those who made this error have departed. It is disgraceful.
The second thing I want to talk about is the fact that this is a budget for the few. I am sure it has come as a bit of a surprise to Liberal Party representatives opposite, whose branch members may well earn over $52,000 per annum, but the fact is that most voters do not earn over $52,000 a year and therefore have received nothing from the tax cuts. There is nothing for pensioners in this budget. That is something of particular concern to me in relation to the electorate that I represent. Wills has the highest number of aged pensioners of any electorate in Victoria—it had over 18,000 age pensioners as at June 2003—and the second highest number of any electorate in Australia.
By contrast, Labor do intend to support pensioners. For example, we believe that some of the budget proceeds ought to be invested in a dental care program. We propose that a Labor government would invest $300 million in Australian dental care over four years—that is to say, $120 million a year for this program when it is fully operational. Many people on the waiting list for dental care—and the waiting list is now over 500,000 strong, with people waiting up to five years to get their teeth fixed—are elderly. Our program will revive the vision of Ben Chifley, when he inserted an amendment intothe Constitution in 1946 which said that affordable dental health treatment was as essential as other medical treatments.
Under our plan, concession card holders such as pensioners, health care card holders and their dependents will now get free check-ups when they need them and subsidised dental treatment, restorations and dentures. Our plan will also assess the dental health of every person admitted to residential care and put in place an action plan to provide ongoing care. We will target programs for Indigenous communities, and we will provide public education awareness programs that help with prevention. We think that is important. 
We also think that other aspects of health are important, and that is why we have put forward the proposal to help restore bulk-billing from the levels to which it has been falling under this government. Under us, there was a year in, year out increase in the level of bulk-billing. Under this government, there is a year in, year out decline in the percentage of bulk-billing. Medicare needs the support of a Labor government genuinely committed to bulk-billing and to restoring Medicare.
The other thing we intend to do which is very important for many Australian families is in the area of access to higher education and post-secondary education—that is, to provide some 20,000 new university places and 20,000 new TAFE places and to reverse that 25 per cent increase which universities have been allowed to charge in relation to HECS. You will be aware that most universities have been putting their hand out and saying, `Thanks very much; we'll take the full 25 per cent'—the full tote odds—and that has placed a very great burden on students and their families and has diminished ongoing access to higher education. One of the great achievements of Labor governments was the establishment of better and improved access to higher education, more places and more affordable places. That has been in reverse under this government.
That third thing I want to refer to is the appalling handling of cooperative research centres by the government. Just prior to the bringing down of the budget, we discovered that it had changed the guidelines in relation to cooperative research centres to rule out those which are engaged in research for public good—to say that, unless you have a commercial focus, we are not going to support you. And so it was that cooperative research centres like the reef CRC and the rainforest CRC were told that they would be defunded. We found, when we looked at the budget, that the amount of Commonwealth spending for CRCs was $202 million in 2003-04, $193 million in 2004-05 and that it will shrink to $152 million by 2010-11. The Commonwealth has been getting out of support for cooperative research centres and undermining them. In the environmental area, the figures in the government's budget papers show that funding for environmental CRCs will decline from $54 million this financial year to $48 million next financial year, to $34 million the year after that and just $29 million the year after that. This government has treated cooperative research centres very poorly.
The final thing I want to talk about is this government's lamentable performance on environmental issues generally and in particular as revealed by the budget. The government likes to talk about deficit and debt. In the area of the environment, we are building up a legacy of environmental deficit and debt for our children and for our grandchildren. In the Treasurer's speech, we heard not a word about the environment—not one word, just like last year—demonstrating again the Howard government's contempt for the environment. In a budget which was splashing around money like there was no tomorrow, there were no serious environmental initiatives. To add insult to injury, it was able to find $21 million over four years for a program to be called `Climate change strategies—influencing international climate change policies'. We all know what that is about. That is money to be used to undermine the Kyoto protocol and collective international efforts to tackle climate change. In other words, this is not expenditure to save the environment; this is expenditure to wreck it.  
The Minister for the Environment and Heritage's claim of a $2.4 billion record level of environmental expenditure support for environmental action is an utter furphy. In fact, if you look at the $2.4 billion, you discover that over $2 billion of that $2.4 billion claimed environmental expenditure for 2004-05 is being spent by departments and agencies other than the Department of the Environment and Heritage. For example, Customs is spending $350 million; AusAID, $280 million; the tax office, $43 million; and other agencies, $162 million. So over $2 billion of the money the government claims it is spending on the environment is in fact being spent by other bodies.
When the environment budget expenditure is defined according to the more rigorous international standards used in the government finance statistics, we realise that from 1999-2000 to 2004-05 funding for environmental protection has plummeted from $555 million to $257 million per annum. It is scheduled to further decline to $233 million in 2007-08. As a proportion of total budget expenditure, this is a drop from 0.35 per cent to 0.13 per cent for environment protection expenditure. That is a drop of over 60 per cent. If you add in expenditure on `conservation and sustainable use and repair of the natural environment' from national parks, the national estate and natural resources development, expenditure has dropped by $58 million, from $984 million in 1999-2000 to $926 million in 2004-05. As a percentage of total budget expenditure, this is a drop from 0.61 per cent to 0.48 per cent—a drop of over 20 per cent.
So here is the reality: since 1999 the proportion of the Commonwealth budget being spent by the environment department on environment protection matters has been in virtual free fall. In order to make these outlandish claims of environmental expenditure, we have to have, for example, the AusAID budget counted as environment spending to the tune of $320 million last year, compared with $195 million in 2002-03, and we have to include spending by Customs on border protection, which has increased from $253 million to $295 million.
These claims of environmental expenditure are bogus. Unfortunately for our children and those who come after them, it is the Australian environment which will suffer as a result of this government's legacy of deficit and debt and their failure to tackle this nation's environmental problems. If this government were serious about tackling this nation's environmental problems they would adopt Labor's policies. They would adopt our policy to ratify the Kyoto protocol on climate change. They would adopt our policy to increase the mandatory renewable energy target to five per cent by the year 2010. They would introduce a national emissions trading regime. They would introduce a greenhouse trigger into the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. They would find 1,500 gigalitres in environmental flows for the Murray-Darling. They would establish a Commonwealth corporation, as we would—the Riverbank Corporation—with an initial capital injection of $150 million to enable that water to be found. They would save Point Nepean. They would do something about land clearing— (Time expired)",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2004-05-31,"—I am delighted to rise and support the Commonwealth Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005 and cognate bills, more commonly known as the Australian budget for the coming financial year. In looking at this legislation I want to do two things. I want to firstly point out the fact that this is a bill and this is a budget and this is a government about families. It is about delivering for families on a range of fronts. Secondly, I want to deal directly with some of the issues raised by the member for Wills. The fact is that you cannot do something like this, you cannot have a budget like this, unless you have a base achieved from eight years of economic discipline and resolve. 
What is this budget about for families? There are four great initiatives which are the pillars of this budget. First, the family tax benefit changes mean that for all of those families with an income, combined between husband and wife, of under $80,000 there will be per child an immediate benefit of $600. That will be repeated next year and again the year after. But just in case this seems in some way like a small thing, let me give you an example. A woman from Hastings came to my office last week and talked to members of my staff. She was in a desperate situation. She was a single mother because the marriage had broken up. To the best of my knowledge, she was not receiving any of the appropriate or proper support, and it was a difficult situation that she faced. She has to make choices weekly about clothing and food. She has four children. We asked a little bit about the ages of the children and we discovered that these four children, all at primary school or younger, together mean that she will receive $2,400 within the next month and within the next year she will receive an additional $2,400. When the member for Wills and others talk about the fact that this budget does not help families, that it does not help people on low incomes, they could not be more wrong. This woman, who came to my office with a difficult situation but who did not realise that she qualified for the immediate benefits, will receive $2,400 between now and the end of the financial year—less than a month away—and $2,400, non-taxable, to be paid in full within the coming financial year. That is what this budget is actually about.
I have a second example in relation to the carers payment. This family gave me the right to mention their name in parliament. The Omonds, who also live in Hastings, will receive $1,600 under the carers payment and carers allowance benefits. Ultimately, that is what this budget is about. It is about families who have done it hard and who will be rewarded in either of two ways: firstly, through direct payments through family tax benefit part A and through the support for carers or, secondly, through income tax deductions for those families who are working hard. That is the basis of this budget. I will continue with the economic platform and the specific benefits for the electorate of Flinders at a later time.

"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2004-05-31,"—I would like to talk about chronic fatigue syndrome, or CFS, a silent epidemic and debilitating disease evidenced by profound exhaustion and extreme flu-like conditions. It was CFS Awareness Week in Australia from 8 to 15 May, providing an opportunity to consider its impact locally and abroad as well as the work of organisations such as the Wollongong ME/CFS Support Group and the ME/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Society of New South Wales.
CFS is difficult to diagnose and cannot be cured and the causes are largely unknown. Some 250,000 Australians are affected by the illness and five in every 1,000 people attending a doctor have it. Its impacts are widespread, costing millions of dollars each year in medical expenses and loss of productivity. Urgent help is needed for sufferers and carers via Medicare and the welfare system to give them access to drugs such as neurontin and maintain their quality of life, pending recovery. 
The personal cost is enormous. I know, for I acquired CFS in 1989 and was incapacitated and bed-bound for approximately six months. I suffered overwhelming fatigue, aching bones, sickness, blurred vision, tingling in my arms and fingers et cetera. I was unable to read or concentrate for six months as mental and physical activity would exhaust me. I had to quit my job in Sydney and return home—although, after six months of rest and a good diet, I was able to start part-time work and after a period of about two years I had enough energy to return to full-time work. I have largely recovered from CFS, though I occasionally suffer bouts of fatigue and need to manage my time and energy to make sure I do not have a relapse. I was one of the lucky ones.
Not so lucky is Kerri Stephenson of Wollongong. Kerri was born in 1976 and developed symptoms of CFS during her first year of university in 1994. By 1996 she was forced to quit her studies and return home. Kerri has been bed-bound ever since. For the last eight years her parents, John and Winsome, have had to care for her around the clock, putting their lives on hold. Various treatments, including exercise and hospitalisation, have been tried but none work. As Kerri said in a letter published in the Illawarra Mercury in 2001:
To me, ME/CFS is not just about feeling tired, it is about feeling so physically worn out that I can't even get out of bed by myself.
At the age of 25, I have to be taken to the shower by the nurse, by wheelchair.
ME/CFS is about pain in every muscle. It's a whole body experience, affecting all the systems of the body through the central nervous system and the immune system.
I have the pain and the weakness, but the symptom that frustrates me the most is the cognitive destruction.
Like so many others with ME/CFS, I have trouble putting my thoughts into words, then having the energy to speak ... 
Kerri's case is nothing less than tragic. We need to find a cure so that young people such as Kerri can get their lives back. Unfortunately, the medical politics of the disease in Australia in recent years has left the CFS community feeling let down and abandoned. The publication just this month of a paper suggesting that exercise could alleviate the debilitating conditions of CFS has outraged sufferers and their carers. Exercise is important in the recovery phase, as in life generally, but CFS sufferers are usually so tired and fatigued that forced exercise can worsen their condition—and I know this from personal experience.
I am told that in Australia the severely affected—people such as Kerri—are not included in clinical studies. They are ignored. The severely affected are being harshly neglected by this government. In May 2002, outrage surrounded the release of the Commonwealth funded Royal Australian College of Physicians clinical practice guidelines for CFS in the Medical Journal of Australia. CFS was no longer an organic disease. It was now, according to the guidelines, primarily psychological in origin—a common mental disorder. What rubbish! Patient groups said the guidelines trivialised the condition, blamed sufferers for their illness and promoted harmful therapies.
Richard Larkins, former President of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, wrote to the Medical Journal of Australia, unequivocally stating:
There is no evidence that the illness is primarily psychological in origin.
There is significant evidence of a range of biological abnormalities occurring in people with CFS. 
It is evident that, amongst the medical fraternity in Australia, there is a lot of misinformation and misunderstanding about CFS—and the guidelines do not help. Doctors and researchers need to work with sufferers and their families to find the truth, to find treatments and to find a cure.
They need to learn lessons from people such as Kerri, John and Winsome Stephenson of Wollongong; from Christine Hunter of the Alison Hunter Memorial Foundation, set up in memory of a young 19-year-old Sydney woman who died in 1996 from complications arising from CFS; and from overseas research and experience. In 2000, I understand that Kerri Stephenson did not have the energy in her body to blow out the candles on her birthday cake. I look forward to the day when Kerri can blow out those candles and return to university to finish her degree. I know that day will come soon.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</title>,Adjournment,16,1,speech
