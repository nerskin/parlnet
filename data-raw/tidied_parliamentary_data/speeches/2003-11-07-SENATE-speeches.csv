"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-11-07,"—Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent him moving that the document be tabled.
The document I wish to table is the Migration Amendment Regulations 2003 (No. 8), which the government has already tabled in the House of Representatives and which the government has in play at the moment to specifically prevent the 14 people aboard a boat at Melville Island from accessing Australia's migration laws. I note that the opposition has said that it opposes the regulations. The Greens would this morning seek to have the regulations tabled—that is what I am in the process of doing—and then move for their disallowance. If the opposition is to be dinkum about disallowing these regulations, this is the time to do it. The boat has come within Australian waters. There is clear evidence that some of the occupants, the Kurds on that boat, have been on the Australian shore. There is legal action pending. But it is important that the regulations which were brought in by the government, retrospectively without the sitting of the parliament, be dealt with by the parliament expeditiously. The time to do that is this morning.
These regulations excise some 4,000 Australian islands. For those who are not aware of it, they extend the excision—which the government attempted before but which was rejected by the Senate—right down the eastern seaboard to Mackay. They exclude the Whitsundays, Brampton Island, Magnetic Island and a whole range of other islands. This matter should be debated. This is the division of Australia into two areas—one which has legitimacy under the law, the other which does not—by a government acting in a cavalier fashion as if this parliament does not count. The opposition is opposed to that procedure by the government. The time for the opposition to move to block this abuse of the parliament by the government is now. I will talk about the recall of the Senate when we get to the other matter which the government has in hand. But this is the time—now that the Senate has been recalled—to deal with this matter. 
The Greens are entirely opposed to the manoeuvre here by the government—which is a political one, of course—and so are the opposition and the Democrats. We can this morning disallow these regulations. I put it to the opposition that this is the time to do it. But what the opposition are doing if they do not support this course of action is simply saying, `We will leave it to another fortnight. We will wait until the people on this boat have been taken to Christmas Island and removed permanently from the reach of the law to which they should have access in a decent, democratic country like Australia.' In fact, the opposition are being a hollow opposition in this respect.
This is a very serious opportunity for us to put things right in this place and for us to insist that the Senate does matter and that the Senate is the backstop when the government loses decency, when the government divides this country and when the government ceases to respect this parliament as it should. I would have thought that the opposition would get up and insist that the Senate be respected, that the parliament be respected, that these regulations be disallowed—as this Senate disallowed them before and as this parliament disallowed them before—and that we do not become part of the executive government using extraparliamentary mechanisms and treating the parliament in a cavalier fashion and as nonexistent. I challenge the opposition to support this matter being promulgated and moved through to its obvious conclusion. We have the numbers in the Senate. We should be disallowing these regulations this morning before we move on to the matter of proscribing certain organisations. That is the challenge to the opposition.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2003 (NO. 8)</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,2,1
"Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",LP,2003-11-07,"—I oppose Senator Brown's motion for the suspension of standing orders. This sitting today is a very unusual occurrence. It requires a special procedure, as you have indicated, Mr President. A majority of senators request you to recall the Senate for the purpose of particular business, and obviously such business must be both urgent and important, or else senators would not be recalled—some from various distant parts of Australia. In this instance, we sought the recall of the Senate because of the need for urgent passage of a critically important piece of legislation which would extend the powers of ASIO in relation to potential terrorist situations. There are possibly few matters of greater importance than that, and I think the urgency of that is self-evident.
In those circumstances, I approached the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, explained the government's position and requested support in these circumstances from the Australian Labor Party for the recall of the Senate. I gave Senator Faulkner—and I do not mind saying this—an undertaking that the government would seek only to deal with this one piece of legislation. I explained to him why the government regarded it as being so important and so urgent. Special arrangements have been made. Because of the short notice of this sitting, some senators who may well have wanted to participate in debate on other matters, such as immigration matters, are not here today. Of course, they would not have known of any suggestion that they would need to be here if they wanted to debate immigration matters, because there was to be just one matter on the Notice Paper. The red has in fact been issued on that basis. 
In regard to the issue that Senator Brown has raised—that is, the Migration Amendment Regulations 2003 (No. 8)—under the Acts Interpretation Act, when the government makes regulations, it has to table those regulations in the chamber within 15 days and then, within another 15 sitting days, a notice of dissolution could be moved. That is the normal process. The government will table the regulations in this place within the time required by the Acts Interpretation Act, and then, subsequent to that, there will be the opportunity for any senator to move the normal motion and have the regulations debated.
There is no attempt here to avoid debate on the immigration issue. All I am saying is that this is not the time and place, when special arrangements have been made for dealing with one particularly critical and urgent issue and when we have asked all senators to return to the Senate today to deal with just that one issue. Whilst I am not surprised Senator Brown would seek to hijack the business of the Senate in his usual way for what he sees as his own personal political objectives—he does this quite often—I do, however, suggest it would be a major mistake if the Senate were to fall into his trap in this instance. The Senate should stand by the program that is on the red and the undertakings that we have given to individual senators, debate the Criminal Code Amendment (Hamas and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba) Bill 2003 and conclude that important matter as promptly as possible. Under those circumstances, I oppose the suspension motion.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2003 (NO. 8)</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,2,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-11-07,"—I also rise to speak on Senator Brown's motion for the suspension of standing orders. I indicate to the Senate that I think on this occasion Senator Hill has faithfully reported the background to the recall of the Senate. On Wednesday morning Senator Hill rang me and indicated that the government was requesting the cooperation of the opposition to recall the Senate to deal with the Criminal Code Amendment (Hamas and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba) Bill 2003. The approach the opposition took on this matter was to consult with the federal parliamentary Labor Party, and I did that. On behalf of the opposition, I indicated to my colleagues that I had received an approach from Senator Hill in relation to a recall of the Senate to deal with this matter and this matter only. Given the circumstances, the opposition agreed to that request.
I think it is important for all senators to understand that the recall of the Senate today is an unusual procedure. This is only the third time this has happened using these provisions. It happened in 1967, I have been informed, to deal with postal regulations. It happened over the loans affair in 1975. Now it has happened again, in November 2003, to deal with the Criminal Code Amendment (Hamas and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba) Bill 2003. It is a very unusual matter, and I think it is important to note the commitments that were given in relation to the Senate dealing with only one item of business. It is true that many of our colleagues cannot be here. Some have left Canberra. I think one of the difficulties in these circumstances, when important matters are proposed to be dealt with outside of the previously agreed sittings pattern of the Senate, is that it places many senators—not only major party senators but many senators around the chamber—at a disadvantage.
Today's sitting is to deal with terrorism and terrorism threats. It has not been proposed to sit the Senate to deal with the issue of asylum seekers. As far as the opposition is concerned, that is true. We have made it clear that we disagree with the government on its regulations to excise thousands of Australian islands. Labor will be moving to disallow and vote against those regulations. Labor has twice already opposed these moves by the government and will do so again when the government tables the regulations and it is competent for us to take that action. I want to say this and be very clear for the record: the harsh reality for I think it is 14 people currently affected by this government regulation is that disallowance on any date—today or in the future—will not affect their individual claims. 
The situation here is that the Senate has been recalled to deal with one item of business. That is the position that has been put by the government and it has been agreed to by the opposition. There is no alternative here, but it is in the interests of all concerned and also in the interests of proper process for us not to deal with the other matter. Of course there are many urgent matters that could be dealt with, but in this exceptional circumstance it is proper that the Senate's consideration be limited to that matter on which the government has proposed to sit the Senate.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2003 (NO. 8)</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,2,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2003-11-07,"—First of all, I would like to put on record the fact that, according to our leader and the whip's office, the Australian Democrats were not consulted about the decision to recall the Senate today. We accept that it is well and good the Senate has been recalled, and that has happened with the support of a majority of the Senate and we are here and willing to debate what the government has described as an issue of national importance in relation to national security, but that does not preclude other senators in this place, one or any others, from putting on the record today the issues they think are of interest or importance. This is not a willy-nilly issue. This is not something, as the Leader of the Government in the Senate has indicated, that can simply be dealt with in two weeks time—that somehow it will not make a difference.
What is proposed for debate this morning—and hence the suspension of standing orders debate we are having now—is that we look into these migration regulations that are effectively in force now. They are a matter of national urgency and national interest and, yes, they may affect the lives of up to only 14 individuals, which perhaps is comparative to other larger numbers of people that have been affected when we have had comparable debates, but nonetheless it is an important issue that is under way now. Those regulations were gazetted on 4 November—that was Tuesday—and they are in force now. That means a group of people are having their rights affected, their rights infringed on and their rights impinged on now.
If this issue is so important that the government rushes through regulations, tables regulations—or at least seeks to by gazetting them—if that is such an important issue that we have to excise part of the Australian territory, namely Melville Island, then why not have the debate now? Or was that just a stunt by the government to engender some sort of political capital by, once again, using the issue of refugees and asylum seekers? If it is such a big deal in the national interest, then let us have the debate now. This is not just a political matter; it is a legal matter. While I will not debate or comment on the specifics of Senator Faulkner's comments about the legal status of the claims of those particular individuals, what I will say is that in a broad sense these regulations are in effect until they are disallowed by the Senate. So let us have the decision today.
The Australian Democrats have said that it is fine to sit today to deal with government business as proposed by the government, but we also have the right to put on the record what we believe is urgent business of the Senate. I think there are many in the community who would argue that the recalling of the Senate today is in many respects the politics of panic by this government. There is a similar argument that in two weeks time we could be addressing the issue of prescription powers that we as a chamber have debated previously. However, in the case of these asylum seekers, two weeks could be too late. Let us remember too the retrospective nature of such regulations. The Democrats are not big fans of retrospectivity in legislation or, in this case, delegated legislation. So let us decide today the will of the Senate and the will of the Australian people in relation to asylum seekers. 
People would know that in early 2002 the Australian Democrats opposed the attempt by this government to excise islands by regulation, and then again by legislation later in 2002 and 2003. We are of the view that the Australian government's attempts to do this clearly violate our international obligations. We are not fooled. We may welcome yesterday's decision on Ibrahim Sammaki and his children—something we have been fighting for for a long time—but we recognise that that is not a change of heart by this government on asylum seekers and refugees. But let us deal with the legalities today. Let us deal with the regulations. We all know, Odgers tells us, from precedent that we can table the regulations now and we can disallow them or have a disallowance debate immediately. We are glad to see that this debate has come on this morning. I am sorry that the government and others have denied leave. If people feel so strongly about the Melville Island issue, then let us have the debate now.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Brown's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2003 (NO. 8)</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,2,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-11-07,"—by leave—I move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5), (6) and (8) of standing order 111 not apply to this bill, allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings.
I table a statement of reasons justifying the need for the Criminal Code Amendment (Hamas and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba) Bill 2003 to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
Purpose of the Bill 
The Bill will create the mechanism to list Hamas and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba as `terrorist organisations', for the purpose of Part 5.3 of the Criminal Code Act 1995.
Reasons for Urgency
The Bill creates the mechanism by which the  Attorney-General, if satisfied that strict criteria have been met, can list Hamas and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT) as terrorist organisations for the purposes of the Criminal Code Act 1995. 
In light of the current security environment and given the nature of ongoing investigations the passage of this Bill is a matter of priority.
The military wing of Hamas has been responsible for a series of suicide bomb attacks, shootings and kidnappings of Israeli / Jewish soldiers and civilians in Israel and Occupied Territories and does not discriminate between military personnel and civilians. Civilians from a number of countries have been killed in such attacks. Hamas has claimed responsibility for over 500 deaths and 3000 injuries perpetrated in their attacks. Hamas has recruited British muslims to carry out suicide bombings and recently in Tel Aviv four people were killed and over 60 injured in one such attack.
Hamas has been responsible for a number of atrocities, including suicide bombings in highly populated places, drive-by shootings and abductions and murders of Israeli civilians and soldiers. 
Although such attacks have been geographically removed from Australia, Australian intelligence agencies feel that this group is gaining momentum, and need to put the arrangements in place to deter such acts from happening in Australia, or to Australians.
LeT has also been involved in a number of terrorist attacks including suicide attacks in Kashmir and India. Again, our intelligence sources assess the threat from LeT to be very real in that LeT is continuing to prepare, plan and foster the commission of acts involving threats to human life and serious damage to property. In the course of pursuing its objective of creating an Islamic state covering Pakistan and Kashmir, the LeT is known to have engaged in actions that have killed many persons in attacks on both civilians and military personnel.
Recent and ongoing investigations reveal that LeT has links into the Australian community.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,4,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-11-07,"—This question of urgency is going to be an important matter for the Senate to hear about from the government this morning. The minister has moved that the Criminal Code Amendment (Hamas and Lashkar-      e-Tayyiba) Bill 2003 be exempted from the usual forms which would allow senators to look into the bill and consult with the community about the matters that are in the bill. The bill is to proscribe the Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hamas organisations, respectively in Pakistan and in Palestine, which have terrorist components. The Greens will have no opposition to these or other terrorist organisations being proscribed, and in particular any assistance that can be given to terrorism from this country in the form of money or other matters being tracked down and prohibited, because we have no truck with terrorism. 
But the question that arises here is: why has the Senate been recalled today urgently to deal with the proscription of these two organisations which were proscribed in the UK and the United States, for example, two years ago? Why has the government been so dilatory that it is has been unable to bring before the Senate in any of the last 24 months the legislation we have today to proscribe these organisations? What is it that has changed in those last two years since the organisations were proscribed in other similar countries that has now made this an urgent matter for the government? There has been nothing in the public debate about this matter that will give an answer to those questions, but it is right and proper that the Senate get an answer. To put it another way, why is it that the government could not wait until Monday fortnight, when the Senate is sitting, and save taxpayers the many thousands of dollars involved in this recall of the Senate today—as we have heard from the government, only the third such recall in history—by then having the matter dealt with on Monday fortnight?
Remember, Mr President, that we have already had these two organisations listed under United Nations provisions so that fundraising in Australia is prohibited for both of them. So that must mean there is some other function which is supporting these organisations which is going on in this country which must be stopped. It is not for us to be dealing here with this matter in an absence of information. The Senate is debating whether or not these organisations should be proscribed as a matter of urgency, and the government has to give reasons for that. Whatever it is to do with these two organisations and their terrorist arms, I repeat that the Greens have no worry with that. What I want to establish is why this government has recalled the Senate today to deal with it. Why didn't you do it in any of the Senate sittings over the last two years? I ask the opposition ditto. You have, with the government, brought the Senate back, with no consultation with the crossbenches. I hear from Senator Stott Des-poja that there was no consultation with the Democrats and there was certainly none with the Greens. When the big parties get together and ignore the crossbench, you have to wonder what is afoot. We are worrying about the safety of the Senate itself a little further down the line, with reform in the air and on the Prime Minister's agenda and the opposition being nowhere near as opposed to that as the Greens and others on the crossbench.
To see the Senate abused in this fashion is not going to pass lightly with me or Senator Nettle. It is an abuse of process unless the government can say that something has happened since the Senate sat two weeks ago which has demanded that immediately Lashkar-e-Taiba and the military wing of Hamas be proscribed. What is it, Minister? Make your case. Let the people of Australia know why the Howard government, together with the Crean opposition, is prepared to spend tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of dollars of taxpayers' money recalling the Senate, this extraordinarily important house of the Australian democratic system, to deal with this matter. 
So far you have completely failed to do that. So far not one shred of argument has come from the government or the opposition as to why we are recalled today and as to why this was not done two weeks ago, two months ago or two years ago. I will tell you what is left in the absence of an argument from the government, and that is that we have been recalled for political purposes by the Howard government, and the opposition have been suckers in falling into line with that. 
We have, we know, a new Attorney-General, the Hon. Philip Ruddock, and this bill comes under his auspices. This bill is the first. We can expect serial bills coming down the line which are going to proscribe other organisations already proscribed by other countries. Right through to the next election we are going to have this parade of terrorist organisations being proscribed serially under a political agenda, with fear being the driving force as we move to the next election. In the absence of argument about the timetabling of this proscription we are dealing with today, it is manufactured fear. 
The best that can be said about the government is that it did not care about these organisations over the last two years and it did not move on them. It saw the UK proscribe these organisations and it saw the United States do it—what was its worry about these organisations? —yet it did not proscribe them in this parliament. Fundraising for these organisations has been proscribed. So you move to the failure of the government to proscribe the organisations themselves and ask: why now? I will be interested to hear the government explain to the Senate, having removed the fundraising potential—money being siphoned out of this country legally to Pakistan or to Hamas in Palestine—what this proscription is going to do except drive these organisations underground, if in fact they are functioning in the country. We need to know from the government how they are functioning in Australia, how they are set up, who is involved and what the immediate threat to the country is that has suddenly brought on this legislation. We have not had that in the public domain, so I doubt we are going to get it today.
We are left—it is as plain as the nose on our faces—with the fact that this government has recalled this Senate for cynical political purposes in the run to the next election, and I object to that. The government cannot have it both ways: it cannot say that this is serious now and the Senate has got to act on it but apologise for not having acted for the last two years—that just does not wash. This is concocted by the government, and it is not acceptable to the Greens that the Senate be used as a political tool by the government. I cannot believe that the opposition fell for that and have accepted it. How weak kneed of the opposition not to say, `We will not be part of the manipulation of parliament by this government for these ends. We won't be part of that.' But no, the opposition meekly say, `Yes, we'll send the same letter to the President to recall the Senate for whatever reasons the government may have in mind.' 
The opposition have not got those reasons. I challenge Senator Faulkner or anybody else in the opposition to get up and explain to this chamber what has changed in the last two weeks that has made this proscription, which was not on the books two weeks ago, important now. There is only one factor I can think of, and that is that the Rt Hon. Mr Ruddock has become Attorney-General and has decided that it is politically in his interests and the interests of the Prime Minister to beat this issue up. What he is doing is saying that his predecessor failed—that the Rt Hon. Mr Williams as Attorney-General for two years sat on the information which should have proscribed these organisations and did nothing, and that the Rt Hon. John Howard, the Prime Minister, for the last two years, sat on the information about these organisations, proscribed elsewhere, and did nothing. I do not believe it. This is concocted. It is part of a process that is going to unfold over the next year to win an election through manufactured fear—and the opposition have fallen into line. That is a very poor state of affairs.
Let the government go out and make its case in the public arena. Let the government move legislation in this parliament according to schedule. But when you get the recall of the Senate for no good reason, no cogent reason—and no reason has been given in the public arena by either the government or the opposition—you have to wonder where it is going to end. This is the taxpayers paying for part of the government's election campaign and the use of the Senate to do that, and we object. However, we are here, the bill must be debated and we are not going to refuse to grant leave, as the government just did to the Greens. But I will be interested to hear what the minister comes up with to excuse this deplorable abuse of the Senate, the parliamentary system and the taxpayers' dollar. 
 (Senator Watson)—Minister, you are closing the debate, I presume?",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,4,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-11-07,"—I am closing the debate. I do not want to prolong things any longer than they have to be, but there are some matters that Senator Brown has raised which require some reply. Firstly, in relation to the lack of contact and consultation, I am advised that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Ian Campbell, attempted to contact Senator Brown. He spoke to Ben Oquist in Senator Brown's office and provided information on this matter. I also understand that the Attorney-General offered a briefing to the Greens on the bill and there was no answer forthcoming on that offer. I think it is very important that that be placed on the record.
Senator Brown has asked why we did not deal with this two years ago. I have tabled a statement of reasons in relation to the urgency of this matter but I would like to elaborate on a couple of points. The information that we now have was not available to us two years ago. In fact, in relation to the Lashkar-e-Taiba organisation, recent and ongoing investigations suggest that that organisation has links into Australia, so we had to move quickly to make sure that our criminal laws could be applied to that organisation's activities. I will expand on this more during the course of the debate on this bill when we get to that. By anyone's estimation the military wing of Hamas is a security concern. Whilst we have no direct evidence of links into Australia, this organisation is renowned internationally for being involved in terrorism and atrocities and it would require good governance to act swiftly and appropriately against it.
Senator Brown has made much of the recall of the Senate. Of course we have had senators in Canberra this week for estimates hearings and the government was of a view that it would be appropriate for those senators to stay on for today's debate, in view of the urgency of this matter. For all those reasons it is appropriate that the Senate be recalled and that we debate this bill today as a matter of urgency. I reject Senator Brown's statement that this is some sort of stunt. It is a matter that goes directly to the security interests of this country.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,4,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-11-07,"—I move:
That this bill be now read a second time.
I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
The terrorist attacks on the United States on September the 11th, 2001 signalled a terrifying new phase in international terrorism. And they marked the beginning of what has become known as the War Against Terrorism. 
Just 13 months later, the terrible reality of this war was brought home to Australia with a bomb attack on Bali, a favourite destination of Australian holiday-makers.
Recent bomb blasts in Jakarta and Baghdad have killed many innocent people.
Disturbingly, we have witnessed a trend of terrorist bombings targeting humanitarian organisations.
The war on terrorism is vastly different to traditional military engagements.
It is proving difficult to adapt to a new type of war and a new type of enemy. Terrorist organisations are extremely difficult to penetrate because of the ever-changing structures in such organisations.
And the enemy we confront is not only the bombers, it is the infrastructure that supports this type of warfare; the financiers, and others who provide material support.
In recent months we have witnessed major developments in the war against terrorism.
Key Al Qaida and Jemaah Islamiyah figures have been captured and prosecuted.
In fact the FBI estimates more than 3000 Al-Qaida suspects and 200 members of Jemaah Islamiyah have been detained in 90 countries.
It is estimated that over $220 million in terrorist assets have been frozen.
It is also estimated that 20 attacks in the US and a further 80 worldwide have been uncovered. 
There is no doubt that the war against terrorism is ongoing, but these successes indicate that the war against terrorism is winnable.
Terrorism is a very real threat to world peace and it is a real threat to Australia's national security.
Individual countries have a responsibility to protect their own security and to deter and prevent terrorist activity through a range of measures including strong criminal laws.
It is a responsibility this Government takes very seriously.
Our response to the threat of terrorism has been comprehensive and wide ranging.
And it is a task which is ongoing.
In the current environment, complacency is not an option.
As part of our comprehensive approach to the new security environment, the Government developed a package of strong counter-terrorism legislation, the bulk of which was passed by the Parliament in July last year.
Included in that legislation were amendments to the Criminal Code allowing the listing of terrorist organisations, subject to certain strict conditions, including the requirement that the terrorist organisation be identified as such by the United Nations' Security Council.
The requirement that Australia wait for the UN Security Council to agree with our own assessment of what constitutes a threat to Australians, and Australian interests, before we can act was an amendment insisted upon by the Opposition.
The Government argued at the time that this potentially created problems because it puts Australia in the unsatisfactory position that we can not act independently of the United Nations to list a terrorist organisation posing a threat to Australia and Australian interests.
Other countries can decide for themselves which terrorist organisations pose a threat to their citizens and to their interests and act accordingly.
In fact we know of no other country whose power to list terrorist organisations is linked to the United Nations.
But, thanks to the Opposition, Australia can not act independently of the United Nations' Security Council.
We can not list the military wing of Hamas or the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba organisation because neither has been formally identified as terrorist organisations by the UN Security Council.
Yet we have advice from ASIO that there is evidence that both organisations engage in terrorist activity.
If this legislation is passed, it will provide the basis for the Attorney-General to make regulations specifying either or both organisations to be terrorist organisations if the organisations meet the strict criteria in the legislation.   
Matters that could be relevant in making that decision is the fact that the military wing of Hamas has been responsible for a series of suicide bomb attacks, shootings and kidnappings. In fact the military wing has been involved in over 100 terrorist incidents resulting in the death of over 500 people and injuries to more than 3000.
In the case of LeT, it has been implicated in attacks in New Delhi and is alleged to have used hit and run tactics as well as suicide squads to target Indian security forces and police stations. I understand that it has cooperated with al-Qaida and other Islamic terrorist groups in training and undertaking operations.  
It should be noted that both organisations have been listed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs under the Charter of the United Nations Act as terrorist entities, the assets of which must be frozen in Australia.
We are introducing this Bill because we recognise the need to take swift action.
The simple fact is that we cannot wait for the Opposition to wake up to the problems they created and support our Terrorist Organisations Bill.
Under this Bill, the military wing of Hamas and the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba organisation will be listed as terrorist organisations for the purpose of the Criminal Code provided that the Attorney-General is satisfied that each organisation is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act, whether or not the terrorist act has occurred or will occur.
If the Attorney-General is so satisfied, a public statement to that effect will be issued.
Appropriate regulations will be made and gazetted with effect from the date of that announcement.
Any such announcement will be widely publicised in both print and electronic media.
And that announcement will only be made after consideration of available, relevant intelligence that satisfies the Attorney-General that the criteria for listing an organisation as a terrorist organisation have been met.
The Opposition has admitted previously that their UN listing process is flawed by acknowledging the inability to list the terrorist wing of Hizballah and now the military wing of Hamas and the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba organisation.
This is a serious matter of national security.
The Government will not allow the Opposition's obstinance to paralyse us and prevent what must be done to ensure the safety and security of Australia and Australia's interests.
We trust that the Opposition will wake up to the problems they created and support our Terrorist Organisations Bill as well as the Bill before Parliament today.
I call on the Opposition to put politics aside and support both Government Bills in the interests of the security of Australia.",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (HAMAS AND LASHKAR-E-TAYYIBA) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-11-07,"—The opposition supports the Criminal Code Amendment (Hamas and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba) Bill 2003 and has cooperated to facilitate its passage through the parliament. This bill would empower the Attorney-General to make regulations listing as terrorist organisations in Australia the terrorist wing of the Hamas organisation and the Lashkar-e-Taiba organisation.
Australia's security agencies have advised that these organisations should be proscribed. Previously, when advised that the Hezbollah external security organisation was a threat to Australia's interests, Labor initiated a private member's bill to list that organisation. The government later responded with its own bill, which was quickly passed with Labor's full cooperation. The current bill employs the same listing mechanism as was used in the earlier Hezbollah legislation. The terrorist wing of Hamas, known as the Hamas Izz al-Din al Qassam brigades, is well known for hundreds of terrorist attacks. It is acknowledged that Hamas also has a charitable apparatus, which provides a wide range of social services to Palestinians, including hospitals, clinics, kindergartens and schools, a blood bank, and welfare services such as the provision of food and other basic commodities for the needy. It is for this reason the legislation targets the terrorist wing of Hamas. 
Lashkar-e-Taiba—or LeT—is a radical Islamist group based in Pakistan, which primarily operates in the Jammu and Kashmir regions. LeT is known for its terrorist attacks on Indian politicians as well as other authority figures, civilians and Israeli tourists. It is reported to be the armed wing of Markaz-ud-Dawa-wal-Irshad. I am pleased it is better known as MDI; it is often better to try and use these acronyms. MDI is a Pakistani religious organisation of Wahabi sects and LeT is reported to be an armed wing of MDI. Importantly, LeT has links with the Taliban and al-Qaeda, having shared training in camps in Afghanistan against the Soviet invasion. It was founded with the support of Osama bin Laden, who remains one of its leading financiers. Given this association with the Taliban and al-Qaeda, it is legitimate to ask whether the Australian government has sought to have LeT listed by the United Nations Security Council. The answer is: they have not. This failure to seek a UN listing undermines the government's claims to be acting swiftly to deal with LeT.
On a matter closely related to this bill, Labor has made clear that we do not believe that the government's model of secret, unaccountable executive proscription contains appropriate safeguards against error or misuse. In June 2002, following justified community outrage at the proposal to give the Attorney-General power to secretly ban organisations, the government's executive proscription model was rejected by the parliament. No-one should forget that, at the National Press Club on 11 September 2002, the Prime Minister said of the final package of legislation passed by the parliament:
We have, of necessity, tightened our security laws. I believe through the great parliamentary processes that this country has I believe that we have got the balance right.
It is also worth remembering that it was the Labor Party and the Senate who corrected the imbalance in the proposed laws. Since 11 September 2001, Labor has worked with the government on these issues. After all, Australia has been engaged in a war against terror. Labor has attempted at all times to reach a bipartisan position on the security legislation that has been brought before the parliament. These issues are about protecting Australia and Australians, and should be beyond political point scoring.
In 2002 the opposition engaged with the government on the security bills, to get the balance right. In 2002 and 2003 we again engaged with the government to get the balance right on the ASIO bill. It was Labor who first introduced legislation into this parliament to list the terrorist wing of Hezbollah under the Criminal Code. In addition, in June this year the opposition presented the government with an alternative proposal to enable the Attorney-General to apply to a court for a listing of an international terrorist organisation not listed by the United Nations Security Council. Regrettably, almost five months later the opposition has not even received the courtesy of a reply from the government. It took a question to the Attorney-General in question time this week to elicit any response at all. Such tardiness and discourtesy justify the perception that the government is more interested in politicising the issue of proscription than in seeking a genuine outcome through the parliament.
Concerns about giving the executive arm of government a power to proscribe organisations are well founded in Australia. Without proper safeguards, executive proscription presents real risks. These risks are not limited to the rights of those individuals who might be associated with organisations identified as being of concern. We have already seen how public confidence can be shaken by slipshod decisions in this area. After the Minister for Foreign Affairs froze the assets of a Peruvian terrorist group, Shining Path, the bank account of a Melbourne record store called Shining Path was frozen, just because it happened to have the same name as a group of Peruvian terrorists. So you have to be careful about these sorts of issues. 
Strong safeguards will protect the fundamental rights and freedoms that Australians cherish. They will also protect the integrity of the decision maker and of the system as a whole. We are now witnessing an international debate over the accuracy of security advice on the existence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Serious errors have been made, and evidence has shown competing assessments and agendas, both within and between agencies. Any conclusion from such security assessments ultimately results from a complex and labyrinthine process within these agencies—within the Public Service as a whole. The debate about WMD has, rightly, shaken public confidence in the justification that was advanced for participation in the war in Iraq. No such weaknesses can be tolerated in a proscription regime.
A primary objective of proscription is public expression of revulsion for the activities of terrorists. In light of the extreme controversy that has historically accompanied the proscription debate in Australia, there is a risk that anything less than a process with fair and objective testing of security material will leave questions over any individual act of proscription. It is for these reasons that the Labor Party proposed a proper check on the power of the Attorney-General to proscribe organisations. Having sat mute on this proposal for almost five months, the government should not be too dismissive of Labor's desire to ensure fair and accurate testing of both the merits of the decision making process and the material relied upon to support proscription. I urge the government—and, particularly, the Prime Minister—to remember the balance that the Prime Minister himself extolled when the original security legislation was passed by the parliament. Balance is critical to any security laws, and Australia's parliament has consistently been determined to get it right.
The Labor Party has brought constructive proposals to the government based on the principle that decisions to proscribe organisations must be accountable and not open to abuse. I reiterate that only with such strong safeguards can the fundamental rights and freedoms that Australians cherish and the integrity of the decision maker and their decision be protected. The opposition supports the Criminal Code Amendment (Hamas and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba) Bill 2003 that is before the Senate today. We call on the government to drop their political rhetoric and, in the national interest, work with the opposition, work with the parliament and work with the whole community to ensure a bipartisan, balanced approach to these crucial issues.",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (HAMAS AND LASHKAR-E-TAYYIBA) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2003-11-07,"—We are debating the Criminal Code Amendment (Hamas and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba) Bill 2003 this morning because the government has claimed that there is an urgent need to proscribe two particular organisations. In fact, it has claimed that this is such a matter of urgency that it could not even wait for two weeks until the Senate sits again. We Democrats are not convinced. We think it looks a lot more like a cynical scare campaign by the new Attorney-General than any genuine emergency. What the Democrats have found is that when you delve through the cloud of panic to the facts of this case a very different story emerges. I want to take a moment to explore some of those facts. Fact No. 1 is this: during question time on Monday, the Attorney-General referred to the military wing of Hamas and Lashkar-e-Taiba, or LeT, as: 
... just two examples of organisations that we would consider listing but cannot because the United Nations Security Council has not listed them.
There was no suggestion of any urgent need to proscribe either of these organisations. On the contrary, the very opposite was implied, namely, that both of these organisations have been known terrorist organisations for a long time. The Attorney-General said:
... if you want to look for examples, they are not too hard to find.
Fact No. 2: the Attorney-General made these statements and announced his intention to list both organisations before he received any written briefing from ASIO. Fact No. 3: while the Attorney-General claims that the current legislation is inadequate because it requires a UN listing before an organisation can be proscribed, the government has never taken any steps to have LeT listed as a terrorist organisation by the United Nations. Fact No. 4: despite the claims of urgency, the Attorney-General admits that there is no evidence to suggest that either of these organisations poses an immediate threat to Australia. Fact No. 5: the Government has also admitted that there is no evidence to suggest that Hamas has any connections with Australia. The Attorney-General described the potential listing of Hamas as an example of `abundant caution', which is far removed from the urgency implied by the recalling of the Senate. Finally, there is fact No. 6: according to the Attorney-General's office, the possibility of Australian links with LeT was communicated to the Attorney-General as part of a routine briefing from ASIO last week. Given that this information was communicated in the context of a routine briefing, it would seem that ASIO did not perceive the need for any urgent action to proscribe the organisation. When you extract the truth from all the hype around this created by the government, it is very clear that the recalling of the Senate is nothing but a big, expensive political stunt.
In his second reading speech on the bill to the House of Representatives the Attorney-General said that the government takes seriously its responsibility to protect Australians. The farce surrounding the passage of this bill suggests quite the opposite. What the government has demonstrated this week is that it is prepared to play politics on really important issues relating to Australia's security. This bill is not really about protecting Australians from terrorism because, as the Attorney-General has said, there is no evidence suggesting that either of these organisations poses an imminent threat to Australia's security, and this has been backed up by at least one expert on terrorism. Despite the absence of any threat, the government has sought to create a false sense of urgency by recalling the Senate.
The problem with this approach is that when there is a real emergency in the future, when there really is an imminent threat to Australia's security, it will be easy to view the government's claims with some cynicism and to doubt whether they are true—whether they are a case of Philip Ruddock crying wolf. The threat of terrorism in Australia is real. Thanks in no small part to the government's ill-considered decision to join an ill-conceived war in Iraq, that threat is more acute now than it has been in the past. Of course this parliament has a responsibility to ensure that Australia has an appropriate legislative regime to address this threat, but we must also recognise—as Professor George Williams recently argued—that legislation alone will not prevent terrorism. 
We Democrats have considered each one of the government's antiterrorism proposals very carefully. On almost all occasions we have formed the view that they were misconceived and poorly targeted. This bill and the original proscription legislation are no exception. We Democrats believe that the very concept of proscription itself is flawed. It does not enhance Australia's security and it deviates radically from the way in which our community has traditionally defined criminal behaviour. As a community we should certainly seek to punish criminal behaviour—but not thought or association. Obviously, we want those who plan terrorist attacks and those who commit them to face the full force of the criminal law. But we do not want a regime that criminalises membership of an organisation, particularly when the penalties are so high and when the government wants the sole power to decide what constitutes a terrorist organisation and what does not.
Interestingly, it appears that at least some members of the government share our grave concerns regarding proscription. I note, for example, Senator George Brandis said in an opinion piece in the Courier-Mail on 21 May 2002:
There are two simple reasons why the proscription of organisations provision is a bad idea. First, it is wrong in principle and, second, because it would be useless. It is not the role of the criminal law to ban organisations but to prevent crime. Organisations do not commit crimes—criminals do. That elementary proposition applies just as much to terrorism as it does to any other grave crime.
To put it bluntly, it would be much more effective to prosecute an individual, such as Mr Willie Brigitte, for actually planning to commit a terrorist attack rather than because he has some association with a terrorist organisation. Of course, in the case of Mr Brigitte, the government was not aware of either of those facts at the relevant time and is now trying to divert attention by introducing legislation which is not really urgent at all.
The Attorney-General argues that it is impractical to have to recall the parliament each and every time an organisation that has not been listed by the United Nations needs to be urgently proscribed. In this instance, it appears that it was not necessary to recall the Senate at all. In any event, we Democrats believe that the government should stop its relentless pursuit of more powers and start putting more effort into working with the United Nations and with other countries, such as France, to combat terrorism. The threat of terrorism is a global threat which can only be effectively addressed, and redressed, with a global response.
The requirement for a UN listing before an organisation can be proscribed is an important safeguard against the abuse of the proscription power. If the government feels strongly that an organisation should be proscribed then it should take steps to have that organisation listed by the UN. However, if there is an overwhelming case for the proscription of an organisation that is not listed by the UN, this parliament has demonstrated in the case of the Hezbollah bill—and will demonstrate again today—that it is prepared to pass legislation to facilitate such proscription.
During debate on this bill in the House of Representatives the Attorney-General argued that, given that both legislation and regulations can be disallowed by the parliament, he did not see why proscribing an organisation by regulations would represent any derogation of the parliament's power to review the proscription. Actually, there is a crucial difference between these two processes—the difference being that with respect to legislation the parliament must allow the proscription, whereas with regulations it can only disallow the proscription. What this means is that, with legislation, the government needs to mount a case for the proscription in the first place and must therefore provide compelling evidence that the organisation is a terrorist organisation. 
Even in this context, the government has been reluctant to provide the relevant information to anyone other than the opposition. While Hezbollah, Hamas and LeT are clearly all terrorist organisations, or have wings thereof, in each case the Democrats have been forced to rely on the government's assessment regarding the threat, if any, that they pose to Australia or Australian interests. We have not had the opportunity to assess the intelligence leading to these assessments for ourselves and, in the present case, we have not been provided with any information to suggest that there is any urgent need to proscribe either Hamas or LeT. If this is the situation in relation to legislation, it is scary to think about how little information we would be likely to get to help us determine whether or not to disallow regulations which the government did not want disallowed. I suspect that the opposition might get a whole lot less information in those circumstances too.
The Democrats accept that both the military wing of Hamas and LeT are terrorist organisations. Each of these organisations has a long history of committing terrorist attacks in their respective parts of the world—Hamas in Israel and Palestine, and LeT in India and Pakistan. We abhor the violence from those organisations and condemn in particular the recent spate of suicide bombings. We take this opportunity to reiterate our opposition to the concept of proscription; however, we also accept that, despite voting against it, the proscription regime is now law within Australia. In this context, we acknowledge that the military wing of Hamas and LeT are the types of organisations that were intended to be outlawed by the proscription regime now in place. However, these organisations should not be proscribed retrospectively, even if that retrospectivity spans just a couple of days and even if the proscription has been publicly announced by the Attorney-General.
We Democrats have always had a strong antipathy towards retrospective legislation, particularly retrospective criminal legislation. However, we have from time to time been prepared to support limited retrospective provisions where there is clear justification for such provisions and where they do not substantially affect the rights and liberties of individuals. That is not the case with the bill before us which could lead to the imposition of extremely heavy criminal penalties of up to 25 years in prison. The government has not provided any evidence whatsoever to support the retrospective proscription of Hamas or LeT. For these reasons, I indicate that the Democrats will be moving an amendment to remove the retrospective provisions from this bill.
In closing, I reiterate that the Democrats are appalled by the actions of the Attorney-General this week which have led to the recalling of the Senate today despite the government's admission that there is no imminent threat to Australia's security. This is a political stunt at great expense to the taxpayer. If calls to Democrat offices are anything to go by, the Australian community are not anxious or alarmed or frightened about the legislation before us, as the government perhaps intended, but they are concerned and they are angry about the cynical way in which this legislation has been presented to the parliament today.",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (HAMAS AND LASHKAR-E-TAYYIBA) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2003-11-07,"—Today we are debating the Criminal Code Amendment (Hamas and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba) Bill 2003, and this parliament has been recalled to pass this very important piece of legislation. The Nationals fully support this legislation and the timing of this legislation going before the parliament today. Everyone would agree that our world has changed during the last two years. As Australians, we have been asked to consider for the first time in many years that we may not be safe. Our beliefs, our way of life and our open welcome to the world's citizens who want to become Australians have been shattered by the events of September 11 and, closer to home, the Bali bombings. Lost innocence was the common theme as we remembered only a couple of weeks ago in this place the loss and suffering of all those involved in the Bali tragedy. 
The bill before us today has been made necessary by the post September 11 and Bali bombings reality that terrorism is a threat to all of us. Once it was something that we only thought about or gave consideration to when visiting war-torn countries or the Middle East. Now, every Australian at home or overseas must think about the reality of terrorism. Terrorism is global and the activities of terrorists are not restricted by our borders or by our citizenship. The government has the responsibility to help protect its citizens from terrorism by ensuring there are tight security laws and by having strong criminal laws. The government has developed a package of strong counter-terrorism legislation, the bulk of which was passed in July last year.
Labor has said that it wants the United Nations to proscribe the criminal organisations Hamas and LeT. The Labor Party is giving its support to this urgent legislation, and its decision is one of the main reasons that we are back in this place today debating the inclusion of these two organisations in the Criminal Code. Hamas and LeT have not been formally nominated by the United Nations Security Council; therefore, a separate bill has to go forward today because of the Labor Party's decision on the United Nations proscription. The military wing of Hamas and LeT pose a real threat to our world; we are banning the activities of these two organisations in Australia for the safety of Australians.
The military wing of Hamas has been responsible for suicide bombings in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and it has caused much pain and suffering in the name of its cause. LeT has been implicated in attacks in New Delhi, and is alleged to have used hit-and-run tactics and suicide bombs to attack security forces and police in India. So, in the opinion of The Nationals, we have to proscribe these organisations under the Criminal Code. This government, which The Nationals are part of, will do everything in its power to protect its citizens against organisations such as these and against terrorism. The Nationals support the bill and call on the opposition to give its support and to allow fast and effective measures to be taken against organisations who threaten the security of our nation.",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (HAMAS AND LASHKAR-E-TAYYIBA) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-11-07,"—I will not reiterate my earlier speech, but I will say that the government has completely failed in the task of explaining to the Senate why it has been recalled to deal with the Criminal Code Amendment (Hamas and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba) Bill 2003 or to give evidence as to why this proscription should not have taken place a fortnight ago or indeed two years ago, when the United States, the UK and a good number of other countries proscribed LeT and Hamas. In fact, Lashkar-e-Taiba, which is from Pakistan, is currently proscribed by Canada, the UK, the US, the EU and Pakistan. It is not a new organisation; it was set up in association with Osama bin Laden in 1989—14 years ago. It has been under the direction of two academics in Lahore, one of whom was killed in an explosion in 1989; the other, Mr Saeed, has maintained supremacy in this organisation right up until recent years and probably still does. It is under a military commander subject to Mr Saeed, who wants to establish a caliphate—that is, Islamic domination not just in Pakistan but everywhere—and who believes that anywhere that is not under Islamic rule is open to attack. 
None of this will have escaped the government and the intelligence organisations over the last 14 years, as this organisation, while containing its terrorist activities to Kashmir, Pakistan and India, has become more devastating in its impact, including in the attack on the Indian parliament in 2001, with the deaths of a good many people there. This organisation is responsible for many terrorist attacks in Kashmir—and what express agony for the people of Kashmir, who ought to be left to determine their own future, as an independent country if necessary. But they are caught between India and Pakistan, both wanting sovereignty, and then there is this awesome interplay of terrorist organisations, leading to the deaths of tens of thousands of innocent people—the terrorisation of that populace. Indeed, people are fleeing death, destruction and summary execution, some of whom have made it by boat to Australia. I have spoken to some of them at refugee camps, including a young man who watched his father get shot and then escaped with his brother, who has not been seen since. When I last spoke to him, he was in a refugee camp in Australia with the potential of being sent home. As far as that unfortunate individual is concerned, we have a government apparently at odds with the very move it is making today.
The same is true of the military wing of Hamas. As has been explained here earlier, Hamas is an organisation which has been operating for many years in Palestine. It has political, military and social wings. It is thought that over 90 per cent of the funding it receives—which largely comes from wealthy individuals in Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich states in the Middle East but also from fundraising in Europe, the US and wherever else it can get it—has gone into social benefits for the poor in Palestine, and therein is its strength. It provides schools, hospitals, blood banks and so on. But it has this vicious military component which has been behind many of the suicide bombings that we have seen in recent years, much to the horror of the whole world.
I will stop for a moment here to add a word of honour to Hanan Ashrawi, who has been in the country over the last couple of days receiving the Sydney Peace Prize—an extraordinary individual, to be able to stand up in the thick of this horror, with operations like Hamas terrorising and blowing up not only their own young people through these suicide bombs but hundreds of other people. In fact, Hamas has been responsible for 104 of these terrorist outrages against innocent civilians in Palestine and Israel. Nobody, I believe, can countenance such activity.
The question must arise as to why the government did not proscribe these organisations years ago. If I were the Prime Minister standing here today, I would be accusing the people on the benches opposite of being soft on terror, because that is the political nature of the Prime Minister. The government has been soft on terror by not proscribing these organisations earlier. In the committee stages, I will come up with a list of other organisations which are proscribed elsewhere that this government has done nothing about. What we are seeing today is not an exercise in precipitate response to information that has come to the government in the last 10 days or so since the Senate last sat; it is a political exercise based on the lowest of political motivators, and that is fear—manufactured fear. 
This government has manifestly failed to proscribe these dangerous, deadly, lethal, disgusting terrorist organisations for the last two years. It has done nothing about it. Now it calls the Senate back to do something because we have a new Attorney-General who, with the Prime Minister, is saying: `Let's bring fear onto the agenda because we are getting close to an election.' What a rotten politic from this government! It fails to do its job and then, catching up on that failure, says, `We'll get a political spin out of this. What's more, we'll spend tens of thousands of taxpayers' dollars bringing back this Senate to promulgate this political exercise.' It is absolutely disgusting politics from the Howard government. It cannot have it both ways. It has failed, in respect of these organisations, to do what other countries have done. Now it has in mind serial political theatre to do the job it should have done years ago.
I remind the Senate that the freezing of funds for these organisations—which is the real way to stop complicity from people in Australia who are beguiled enough to put money into fundraising efforts which can be channelled into terrorism—occurred quite some time ago. I would like to hear from the minister opposite how the safety of Australians will be materially improved by listing these organisations now. The government has not done it for two years. What is now going to change things? I do not know the answer to this question, but has the government considered whether sending organisations underground, if they are extant in Australia—and I want to hear from the government about that—is effective, or in fact makes it more difficult to keep them under surveillance?
Proscribing their funding is of course the key matter. After that we need to know what has motivated the government today. Is it related to the Brigitte affair and, if so, why was this move not made weeks ago? Indeed, why wasn't this organisation proscribed two years ago, which may have brought this matter into clearer play in the government's mind when that man was applying to enter the country—a man who would have then been associated with a proscribed organisation, Lashkar-e-Taiba. The questions are greater than the answers we are getting today.
In the committee stage, I will be pressing the government as to why it has left it so late and what it is going to do about other terrorist organisations which are on the proscribed list, for example, in the United States and Europe. Let me make this absolutely clear: the Greens will have no truck with terrorist organisations whose aim is to kill innocent people as leverage for some political or religious purpose. They should be banned. They should be proscribed. The question here today is: why is the government recalling the Senate on this occasion to do the work it should have done a long time ago?",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (HAMAS AND LASHKAR-E-TAYYIBA) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-11-07,"—A number of issues have arisen in the speeches during the second reading debate on this very important bill, the Criminal Code Amendment (Hamas and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba) Bill 2003. Firstly, in relation to the issue raised by Senator Faulkner as to there being no reply to the proposal put by the opposition, the Attorney-General, Mr Ruddock, has replied to the shadow Attorney-General's letter, which I think was written on 13 October this year. The Attorney-General has answered the points raised by the shadow Attorney-General, Mr McClelland. I do understand that the former Attorney-General, Mr Williams, did discuss proposals which had been put to the government by Mr McClelland and they were addressed in that discussion. So the government would state very clearly that it has not ignored proposals put to it by the opposition. Certainly, the government would reject any allegation by the opposition—or the Greens or the Democrats, for that matter—that we have been slow to act on Lashkar-e-Taiba.  
I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, listed LeT as a terrorist organisation on 20 March last year under the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945. This made it a criminal offence for persons to hold assets that are owned or controlled by LeT within Australia. That action was taken to meet Australia's international obligations in the fight against terrorism that are set out in the United Nations Security Council resolutions. Of course, that deals with the very question that Senator Brown has raised about assets and finances. You have to remember that the power to go down the path which we are going down today—that is, providing for the proscription of a terrorist organisation through legislation—was provided for only in July last year. And that defeats Senator Brown's statement that we could have done this two years ago.
Let us go to the more important aspect—that is, that recent and ongoing investigations have revealed that LeT has links with Australia. That really is the reason for the urgency for the action that the government are taking. The government have said that they would like a streamlined process. We stand by that statement and we have always said it. That has been denied to us by those opposite. It is interesting that Senator Brown says that there are other countries which have proscribed LeT. Those countries he mentioned do not have to rely on a listing by the United Nations Security Council. They, in fact, are able to do their proscription by a much more streamlined method—something the government are attempting to do but have been stopped thus far by those opposite.
Senator Greig mentioned as well that we had failed to act earlier on LeT. I would point to those comments that I made earlier that, as a result of recent and ongoing investigations, we have discovered that LeT has links with Australia and, therefore, we must act in Australia's interests. Senator Faulkner himself said that LeT was a terrorist organisation that was fighting in Pakistan, in the Kashmir region, against India. It would seem that it is an organisation which was somewhat contained geographically but, of course, recent investigations, as I have said, have revealed that LeT could well have links with Australia. It would be irresponsible of the government, therefore, not to take immediate action.
Senator Brown has also mentioned that there is the expense of bringing back the Senate today and that this is a stunt. Of course, senators have been in Canberra this week for estimates committees. I do not know whether Senator Brown has been, but certainly I have and I know those in the opposition have. Not only did the situation present itself conveniently but also it was a course that was essential for the government to take. We could not have stood by and done nothing until parliament resumed on 24 November. One of the questions asked during the second reading debate was: why is the legislation needed? What can you do that you otherwise could not do if you do not have it? Of course, the proscription of these organisations, the military wing of Hamas and LeT, makes it an offence to be a member of those organisations and it gives more strength to the arm of our intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies in the prosecution of anyone who is involved with these terrorist organisations. As a responsible government, as a responsible Senate, we need to give our authorities in Australia the power to act in relation to terrorist organisations. I think we all agree that the military wing of Hamas is an organisation which has involved itself in bloody acts of terrorism, and that has been recognised internationally. Again, it would be irresponsible for us not to include the military wing of Hamas in this legislation.  
The path the government would take is that we not have to go through this process every time we want to list a terrorist organisation. Other countries, such as Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, do not have to have reference to the United Nations Security Council. We have seen that, unless an organisation does have direct links to al-Qaeda or the Taliban, it is a lengthy and difficult process to have it listed by the United Nations Security Council. That is something we envisage with LeT, and that is why we are embarking upon this course of action—but we should not have to. As a responsible government governing this country and particularly its national security interests, we should be able to act in a speedy fashion without any reference to the United Nations Security Council. What we propose—and there is legislation in the Senate which does just that—is that the government have the power with the necessary checks and balances to be able to proscribe terrorist organisations which pose a threat to this country's security.
The other question was that of Shining Path, an example which Senator Faulkner raised. He said that the assets of a business were inappropriately frozen as a result of its being incorrectly listed under the charter of the United Nations regulations. Of course, we do not want that to occur. We want only to attack terrorist organisations, and what we want to do is give our law enforcement agencies the appropriate powers to do just that. Certainly we are not intending to bring in any entity or organisation which is not involved in any way in a terrorist act or which is an innocent party. We have sufficient checks and balances in our proposal for dealing with this. We believe that the Senate, at an appropriate time, should give this government the necessary power for the proscription of terrorist organisations. The recalling of the Senate in this instance is appropriate and necessary for the security of this country, and that is the result of advice that we have received from our intelligence authorities.
Question agreed to.
