"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-02-06,"—The government has reintroduced the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2], ignoring the Senate's amendments, in the full knowledge that the Labor Party cannot and will not accept legislation that strips Australian workers of fundamental employment rights. This is the seventh attempt by this government to prevent a large group of Australian workers from getting justice when they have been unfairly dismissed. On this occasion, as on the sixth occasion, in the interests of political spin, the syllable `un' has been removed from the bill's title. Thus, we are dealing not with the previously named Workplace Relations Amendment (Unfair Dismissals) Bill but now with the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill. 
Small business employees across Australia must have heaved a sigh of relief when they heard about that change. They might well have thought that being denied protection from harsh, unjust and unreasonable dismissal simply because they happened to have 18 workmates and not 19 was unfair. But now they can rest easy. It is not unfair, according to the government; it is fair. But who knows? Perhaps the word `fair' in the title of this legislation is supposed to refer to fairness to small business owners rather than to their employees. After all, the government is always saying how much it takes the interests of small business to heart. Small business owners might have thought that legislation requiring that claims for unfair dismissal be assessed on the circumstances and profitability of the business was fair. They might have thought that having claims for unfair dismissal assessed on the principle of a fair go all round was exactly that—fair. They might have thought that being removed from that system and placed back in the realm of common law and court action where no protection applies was unfair. Yes, the government says that this is fair. I think we know how much weight to place on the government's claims.
The government asserts that this legislation will remove barriers to employment. Anyone who questions that is, according to the government, a mouthpiece of the union movement. That means that Professor Mark Wooden, called as an expert witness by the government in the case of Hamzy v. Tricon International Restaurants trading as KFC, must be a mouthpiece of the union movement, because Professor Wooden agreed that the growth of employment is dictated by economic factors. He agreed that employment growth was stronger between March 1994 and December 1996 than in the following three years—stronger, that is, when the unfair dismissal laws were at their most stringent, and weaker when they had been watered down. This is the government's own expert witness. It does not do much for the credibility of the government's claims that this legislation will create 50,000 jobs. What does it mean for these claims when even the government's own expert witness has to admit that the growth of employment has nothing to do with legislation of this kind? The figure of 50,000 jobs was whistled up from nowhere by the then minister, Peter Reith, to back up his argument, in just the same way as he whistled up photos of children who were thrown overboard to back another argument that he was running. Mr Reith was as truthful when he was Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business as he was when he was Minister for Defence.
The government claims that unfair dismissal laws are the main concern for small business owners. It also claims that unfair dismissal laws are the main barrier to small businesses employing more staff. I think this is a very unflattering view of a group that the government considers to be part of its core constituency. Minister Abbott has said:
... this government has confidence and faith in the decency of Australian managers.
He said that in a speech arguing that Australian managers will only employ staff if they are assured that they can unfairly dismiss them—sack them without a fair hearing, without a fair go. It does not seem to me like much faith in the decency of Australian managers. It seems the government thinks that small business owners are already planning to dismiss their staff, harshly, unjustly and unreasonably, before they even hire them.
Mr Abbott of course, as usual, is wrong. Small business owners are doing nothing of the sort. They say that unfair dismissal is the last thing on their mind when they think about the problems they face. They are much more likely to nominate the BAS form as small business enemy No. 1. Small business owners are right not to worry about unfair dismissals legislation. They are massively underrepresented in unfair cases. In fact less than 0.3 per cent of small businesses will experience a federal unfair dismissal in any year and only a quarter of federal unfair dismissal cases cannot be settled by conciliation. Of those very few cases that proceeded to a decision, only 27 per cent resulted in an order for compensation or reinstatement. This hardly seems like the crisis the government says exists.  
On all evidence unfair dismissals are not a major problem for small business; there are seriously worse aggravations for small business. Small businesses tell us that although unfair dismissals legislation is not a barrier to hiring more staff, some real barriers do exist. One is the lack of work or sales. Small businesses also told the Telstra Yellow Pages business index survey that cash flow was a real problem for them in considering taking on new staff. And what is the single biggest contributor to cash flow problems for small businesses? It is the GST—and that, of course, is wholly and solely the responsibility of the Howard government.
The government's lack of investment in education and training—indeed, its savage cuts to education and training—is another real barrier to finding suitably skilled staff. The government's savage cuts in that area are hardly the actions of a government interested in employment growth. The government has done nothing towards supporting small business owners in their need to develop effective strategies to hire, train and manage their staff. It has done nothing to support job seekers in their need to learn new skills in today's rapidly changing economy. Its only actions in this regard have been negative ones, destroying programs that gave job seekers genuine training—as the Senate knows. You could draw the conclusion that the government is not actually concerned with employment. It would be easy to draw the conclusion that the government is ignoring the real problems of small business and job seekers in order to indulge in yet another wedge politics scare campaign. 
This bill, which will apply to only a very small percentage of small business owners, may well make them worse off. Indeed, in terms of the regulated system under the current legislation—with conciliation, expert decisions and a legally mandated fair go all round—the small businesses affected by this legislation will be exposed to the possibility of actions under the common law of contract that are more complex, more costly and without any of the safeguards provided by the current legislation.
Small business owners might think that it is unfair for small businesses covered by federal legislation to be subject to different conditions and liable to different penalties from all other small business. Small business owners might think it is unfair that this bill assumes that size is a determinant of ability to pay damages. This bill would take away the right of employees in some businesses with fewer than 20 employees to be treated in a decent and reasonable manner. It would take away their right to be told if the reason for their dismissal was related to the operation of the business, and it would take away their chance to defend themselves if they are dismissed for cause.
In debate on this bill and its predecessors, speakers on behalf of the government have been eagerly relating anecdotes to support this supposedly `fair' legislation. Of course, as you would expect, the stories have been incomplete and one-sided. You would think, listening to the stories, that employees in small businesses have no other aim than to get themselves sacked so they can bring an unfair dismissal case and bankrupt their employers. Commonsense might indicate otherwise. Commonsense might tell you that the vast majority of employees want to do their job well and they want to hang onto it. Government speakers have made no effort to present the broader picture. They have made no attempt to give both sides of the story in these cases. The government, as usual, has presented a pack unsubstantiated assertions in an effort to make cheap political capital out of them.
The Senate amendments that the government has rejected are good amendments. They are constructive suggestions to make the unfair dismissal regime simpler by increasing the emphasis on reinstatement to reduce the amount of litigation purely for compensation, by reducing legal costs and by regulating paid agents who appear before the AIRC to ensure ethical standards. These measures would go a long way towards solving the problems of small business. The government does not seem to be remotely interested in any of the suggestions. 
Of course, politics, not policy, is their only consideration. It has been suggested in this debate that the government has brought this bill back to the Senate to provide itself with a double dissolution trigger. If the Prime Minister wants to go to an election on the basis of whether this bill has been passed or not, so be it. I want to say this: although our differences with the government have been many and have been very deep, nowhere will you find a deeper and clearer divide between the Labor Party and the anti-Labor parties than on the question of a fair go. Let us not forget that in his second reading speech on this bill, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Abbott, expressed his view on the possibility of unfair dismissal in three words. `That is life,' he said. If you are sacked from your job for no good reason, that is life, according to Mr Abbott. If you are without a job and you cannot pay your mortgage, you cannot pay your rent and presumably you lose your home, that is life, according to Mr Abbott. If you have, through no fault of your own, a black mark against you with future employers, the black mark of `sacked' beside your name, according to Mr Abbott again, that is life.
It has never been the Australian way to stand by while someone is mistreated—to stand by, shrug your shoulders and say, `That is life.' It has never been the Australian way to turn a blind eye to unfairness. It may be this government's way but it is not the Australian way and it is not the Australian Labor Party's way. On each occasion of the government's introduction of this or similar legislation, the inherent flaws have been pointed out. It is perfectly clear that the government is not listening. It is perfectly clear that the government does not want to listen. It is perfectly clear that the government does not have any interest in sound, sensible, sane industrial relations legislation. It does appear to be perfectly clear that what the government is interested in is a double dissolution trigger.
The government may think that the ALP can be bullied into passing bad legislation with the big stick of a double dissolution election on industrial relations being held over its head, but it is as wrong in that assumption as it is in its ideological pursuit of a workplace in this country where employees have no security and where employees have no rights. The Labor Party stands in this parliament in defence of the civil, political and industrial rights of Australians. Already in the first period of this parliamentary term we have prevented the government from stripping Australians of their civil rights through sloppy security legislation. We have prevented the government from disenfranchising tens of thousands of Australians through electoral regulations that would have prevented the most marginalised of our citizens from exercising their fundamental right to vote in an election. And now, in relation to this legislation, we will prevent this government from stripping away the protection Australian workers have from unfair, harsh and unreasonable sacking. The Australian Labor Party has always stood firm on these issues. The Australian Labor Party will continue to oppose this attack on Australian workers and will oppose this bill.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2003-02-06,"—When I first saw the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2] on the Notice Paper, I thought: what type of contribution do I want to make to it? Should I go back through the Hansard, pick up the six submissions I have made previously and have them incorporated in this debate? It would have saved us all time in repeating the same messages that have been repeated ad nauseam in this chamber on this issue on six, and now seven, occasions. In some respects I have been fortunate, because I tabled this morning in this chamber a report on small business employment on behalf of the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee. That inquiry was set up— after the last time this bill was brought into this chamber—to look at some of the rationale that has been preached on the other side of this chamber for the need for unfair or fair dismissal, whichever of those terms you want to use. The committee also went to the constituencies that are confronted with these issues to get their point of view on what they believed were the impediments to small business employment. 
We visited all of the states in the process of conducting that inquiry. Not only did we hear from the organisations that represent small business; we also held a series of roundtables with small business proprietors themselves. Some of them were employers of labour, some of them were not. It is fair to say that, despite what the government senators on the inquiry say, the issue of unfair dismissal did not rank highly in the number of issues that were raised with us in those discussions. It was well down the list. The issue that was raised with us which was of major concern to small business was government regulation. Senator Faulkner referred to the statements that Peter Reith has made on these issues. Peter Reith, when he was the small business minister back in 1997, made a commitment to cut red tape on small business by 50 per cent. He was never able to identify how he was going to do it, the processes involved in doing it and what measures would be taken to achieve that outcome.
When we raised this question with the small business proprietors they laughed. They said that regulation—red tape—is continuing to grow and is one of the major impediments to them being able to grow their businesses. Having to spend time in the backroom, hunched over computers or typewriters or whatever other bit of equipment they have, preparing documents—whether it is their BAS, tax returns, WorkCover requirements or what have you—absorbs enormous amounts of their time and constrains their ability to get out to operate at the coalface of the business. We heard that from people who had cafes and people who were running hotels. They said, `My skills are to be out there meeting and greeting my customers who want to stay in my hotel. What am I doing? I am spending all week stuck in a room at the back of the counter trying to complete and fill in forms and meet the requirements of government for regulation. We understand that not all the regulation that they have to confront is federal regulation— some of it is state, some of it is local government. The reality is that the burden of regulation is continuing to grow and it is continuing to become a major impediment for small businesses in their capacity to grow.
The second myth is that small businesses are out there all waiting with bated breath for this legislation to go through this chamber so that they can rush down to Job Network, get an application in and get the staff on that they otherwise could not employ. What an absolute nonsense. What was clearly identified in this inquiry—and the statistics are there—was that the vast majority of small businesses do not want to employ anyone. They are family businesses and lifestyle businesses and they are focused on essentially providing income for themselves. They are not interested in taking on employees. There is certainly a group of small businesses that are growing, that are focused on exports and not on employing. But the greatest driver for them is demand for goods and services. It is not unfair dismissal laws but demand for goods and services that is determining whether or not they will employ. That was the second aspect that came out in this report. That is a key element for small business employment.
The reality is that there is a range of issues that small businesses confront that are a major impediment to them employing more people. They are listed in part on page 43 of the report under paragraphs 3.59, 3.60 and 3.61. I will read them out because, as Senator Alston has previously identified in the chamber, he does not bother reading reports. The report says:
3.59	The full employment potential of businesses with growth aspirations and capacity may not be realised if there are barriers to employment. According to Pacific Access, companies with growth aspirations are more likely to identify impediments to employment, presumably because they satisfy the other preconditions for employment growth. Pacific Access submitted that the government should give greatest weight to the issues and concerns of growth-oriented businesses and focus on the key barriers they have identified, mainly lack of sales and finding suitable staff.1. 
3.60	A similar approach was taken by Mr Brian Gibson who argued that:
While business owners may express concern about issues such as employment it is unlikely that correcting the problems will result in significant changes in employment levels. The problems identified by small firms are undoubtedly identified in good faith. However while they may inhibit additional employment at the margin or encourage an alternate employment mix (full time or casual), they are unlikely to overcome the capped growth approach to business operations that is so dominant in the sector. Even if all the apparent barriers to employment were removed, the vast majority of small firms in Australia would not actively pursue growth resulting in employment generation.2.
3.61	With those caveats in mind, evidence to the committee identified a number of impediments to employment across the sector. These generally included both external and internal factors. One list comprised: 
·	time-poverty—this is where government regulation really hits; 
·	limited access to personal and investor capital;
·	uncertain cashflow streams—this is amplified in regional economies by fluctuations in commodity markets;
·	a shortage of skilled tradespersons and professional skills;
·	the costs of employing, including recruitment, training, leave and conditions, insurance and superannuation, and payroll tax;
·	the potential negative consequences of employing staff if problems arise;
·	a shortage of the enterprise skills required to grow businesses ...
1. ibid., pp. 1-2
2. Submission No. 77, op. cit., p. 4
On that point, one of the major impediments that was identified in this inquiry was the fact that small business owners themselves lack basic business skills. There are many small business proprietors out there today who are running small businesses and who have not done any formal training in business skills. They do not have a command of how to operate cash flows. They do not have business plans and do not plan. They do not understand how to employ staff, what regulations are required when employing staff and the legal requirements in respect of WorkCover and other commitments. They go into business with the expectation that, having come up with a good idea, they will be successful. 
There are literally thousands and thousands of small business proprietors who are losing substantial equity in the businesses that they have bought into because they do not have the skills and the competencies to run those businesses effectively. One set of surveys—which I think was by the CPA of Australia—clearly identified that the problem in the area of employment was that many small business proprietors did not know the basic requirements that they had to meet when employing people and that, if they did, a lot of the problems associated with employment would go away. One organisation—I think it was the business enterprise centres in South Australia—actually set up a program to enable small businesses to use its consultants, who were operating out of the business enterprise centres, to deal with their employment type issues. This has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of industrial problems that those small businesses are confronting.
I suppose the greatest myth of all, perpetrated by Tony Abbott, is that of the 50,000 jobs. As Senator Faulkner indicated, this was first raised by Peter Reith when he was the minister. But Minister Abbott went even further—Minister Abbott actually indexed it to inflation, from 50,000 to 53,600. No-one—none of the employer groups or small business people we talked to—was able to identify where any of these 53,600 jobs were going to come from. It is an absolute myth.
Another point that I want to raise in respect of my contribution is an issue that is a major impediment to employment for small and medium enterprises—the lack of skilled employees. There was a universal cry in all of the submissions we received from small business proprietors and their organisations that they had difficulty getting skilled employees. But, of course, when we asked them, `What are you doing to train skilled workers; what contribution are you making to the training of skilled workers?' there was deathly silence. The reality is that the small business community has never trained skilled workers in any significant numbers. Historically, the skilled labour force in this country has come out of the public sector. It has come out of the public utilities: the gas and electricity organisations, the railways and the shipyards. It has never come out of small business. The public utilities were the supply chain for the small business community and that supply chain has been considerably constrained in recent times for a whole range of factors, which I do not necessarily want to go into today. 
If the government is serious about trying to address the issue of creating employment opportunities in small business, it needs to talk seriously to its Minister for Education, Science and Training and get him to have a hard look at what the government is doing to provide opportunities to train skilled workers for the small business sector, because they will not do it. They have not done it. They have never done it. They will not train them themselves. 
There are some 29 recommendations in that report aimed at dealing with the issues that have been identified as being the major impediments to employment in the small business sector. Some of them require action by the federal government, some require action by federal and state governments, and some require action by all three tiers of government. But the important message is that they require action. They require that a constructive approach be taken to deal with the issues that have been identified by the sector—not the perpetration of myths as to why the sector will not employ. 
The fair dismissal issue is not an impediment to employment in that sector. It is not the single issue that determines whether or not they employ. We had a couple of examples of unfair dismissals given to us by proprietors of small businesses. We heard some of them recited here yesterday. Senator Boswell went on at length about some mate of his and the tale of woe he had with someone he had employed. But the reality is that, when we talk to these proprietors about the circumstances of their unfair dismissal cases, in many instances they did not know that they were not covered by federal law. We pointed out to them that, even if this bill had passed, it would have made no difference in terms of their issue because they were employing people under the state system. They were not aware of that.
There is a grave lack of understanding out in the small business community about the laws that apply with respect to unfair dismissal and, more importantly, about the laws that apply generally to employment by businesses. There is a crying need in the small business sector for the introduction of training programs that can provide proprietors of small businesses with the necessary skills to be able to operate their businesses effectively. If that were done, in my opinion, there would be a lot fewer failures in the business sector and a lot more potential for businesses to grow and create the employment opportunities that will arise out of a greater demand for their goods and services.
The lack of training for business proprietors or managers in this country is an area that was reported on in the Karpin report, which was presented in this parliament back in 1994. That report had a number of important recommendations that have never been acted upon. They have not been picked up and pursued by this government since it came to power in 1996. But it is in that area that there is real potential to do something about creating the circumstances and giving the confidence to small business proprietors to be able to grow their businesses, to get smarter about how they operate those businesses and for them to employ more Australian workers.
It certainly will not be done by the passage of this bill. But, as Senator Faulkner said, this bill is not about making it easy to employ people, it is not about making dealing with unfair dismissal claims easier. There are a number of recommendations in the bill by the Labor opposition which could have dealt with some of the problems that were raised with us in the inquiry. Has this government picked them up? Of course not, because it might actually make the legislation work. The last thing this government or this minister wants is for it to work because industrial relations is a convenient whipping boy—as always, they see industrial relations as being a convenient whipping boy. They want something that they can go out to the small business community with and say, `See, those awful people in the Labor Party won't pass these laws, they won't make your task easier. Therefore we are your great protectors and therefore you should vote for us.' This is about setting up the circumstances for a double dissolution. This is a political bill. It is not a bill about fixing a problem; it is a bill about creating political circumstances that, at some stage in the future, will favour the government if it feels it has to go to an election and if it wants to have an election based on a double dissolution. ",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2003-02-06,"—I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. It is vitally important to the integrity of our industrial relations system that this bill does not pass. As has been said by a number of other speakers today, this bill is a cynical attempt at policy from a government devoid of a third-term agenda. While it is the first time that I have encountered this bill in this place, my colleagues inform me that this government has been vainly attempting to pass this type of legislation for many years. In fact, this is the seventh time that the government has introduced into the Senate a bill that seeks to exempt small business from unfair dismissal laws. Each time, however, the government fails because each time the Senate sees through the rhetoric and the doublespeak of this government. An example of the doublespeak is the title of this bill, which contains the words `fair dismissal', when the process of fairness is what this government opposes and seeks to remove from the industrial relations system in this country. The bill's intention, which is quite clear from the explanatory memorandum, is to:
... prevent small business employees (other than apprentices and trainees) from applying under the WR Act for a remedy in respect of harsh, unjust or unreasonable termination of employment ...
The bill would exempt employers with fewer than 20 employees from claims by dismissed employees on the grounds that their dismissal was harsh, unjust or unreasonable. The bill, if it is passed, will see every Australian working within a small business have their current legal rights and job security diminished. There is no doubt that this bill simply seeks to make it easier for employers to dismiss their employees, even if their dismissal is harsh, unjust or unreasonable. 
The arguments against this bill have been put persuasively by my colleagues in the debate on this bill and in earlier debates on similar bills. I do not seek to repeat their arguments, as they continue to remain most persuasive. But there are a few points I wish to make about the bill. The first point I wish to make is that the bill operates on an arbitrary basis, stripping employees of their rights, dependent only the size of the organisation in which the employee is employed. In its submission to the Senate inquiry into the first bill, the Transport Workers Union argued:
The bill operates on a policy based not on whether a company has acted lawfully, but solely upon the size of the employer. It seems to us a very strange outcome that the size of the employer can be used to alter what would be clearly in other circumstances harsh, unfair or unjust treatment of its employees.
Or, as the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association said in their submission to the same inquiry:
... small businesses should not be differentiated from any other businesses when it comes to the need to act fairly, justly and reasonably in relation to an unfair dismissal. There are no grounds to allow some employees to be sacked unfairly without redress. This issue goes to the heart of the notion of the principles of natural justice.
The government seeks to create here one rule for big business and one rule for small business. Employees of both large and small organisations are no different: they do a good day's work for a day's pay regardless of whether their employer is the small corner store or a large national operation. The rights of these employees should be no different and they should not be able to be unfairly discriminated against by their employers. The government's bill excludes the employees of small businesses from the right to make an unfair dismissal claim. However, the government's arguments for doing so are extremely weak, to say the least. The Federal Court, in the case of Hamzy v. Tricon International Restaurants, trading as KFC, dealt with this particular area and looked at the connection between lower unemployment and an exclusion of unfair dismissal. In this case the workplace relations minister attempted to argue that a regulation excluding casual employees from unfair dismissal laws was justified because the provisions would operate against the interests of casual employees. In response to this argument, Justices Wilcox, Marshall and Katz concluded: 
... [It] seems to us the suggestion of a relationship between unfair dismissal laws and employment inhibition is unproven. It may be accepted, as a matter of economic theory, that each burden that is placed on employers, in that capacity, has a tendency to inhibit, rather than encourage, their recruitment of additional employees. However, employers are used to bearing many obligations in relation to employees (wage and superannuation payments, leave entitlements, the provision of appropriate working places, safe systems of work, even payroll tax). Whether the possibility of encountering an unlawful dismissal claim makes any practical difference to employers' decisions about expanding their labour force is entirely a matter of speculation. We cannot exclude such a possibility; but, likewise, there is no basis for us to conclude that unfair dismissal laws make any difference to employers' decisions about recruiting labour.
Those were the words of three justices of the Federal Court—impartial judges making their judgment on the claims of the workplace relations minister in this regard, rejecting them entirely. In this same case in the Federal Court, the minister's expert witness, Professor Wooden, claimed:
There certainly hasn't been any direct research on the effects of introducing unfair dismissal laws.
That is the case. It was reported in the AWIRS survey of 1995 that only 0.9 per cent—so less than one per cent of those surveyed—of small businesses stated that the unfair dismissal legislation was a reason for not hiring more staff. Despite this, the government claims that this is one of its primary motivations for introducing this bill. It argues that the bill will reduce Australia's unemployment rate. The government says that the prospect of an unfair dismissal action against an employer is a disincentive to hire additional staff and therefore unfair dismissal laws hinder job creation. The problem for the government though is that it has no evidence that this bill will reduce unemployment. The government speaks proudly of how unemployment will tumble downwards after worker's protection is removed, although it cannot show how. The total absence of any data to prove the government's case is a monumental weakness in its argument for this bill. The government expects us to take it on its word and its word alone.
In its submission to the Senate inquiry that I referred to before on an earlier yet similar bill, the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association made another important point that the government has overlooked in this debate. The SDAEA said in its submission:
A constant theme articulated by the advocates of this Bill is that small business costs are exacerbated in fighting unfair dismissal claims where the worker is supported by a union. Much of this rhetoric is premised on the assumption that invariably a union will represent the dismissed worker.
The reality is that most workers in small business are not unionised and do not have the benefit of union representation when unfairly dismissed.
In most respects, the only protection that employees in small business have is the fact of the existence of unfair dismissal laws and the hope that the employer will pay some (even slight) lip service to those laws.
The removal of the existing unfair dismissal provisions, as proposed by the Bill, will dramatically increase the balance of power in favour of employers and dramatically decrease the fundamental protections available to workers.
So, while it is well known that the government has a long-term agenda to dismantle the right of working Australians to join unions, this legislation will have the effect of cutting deep into an area of the Australian workplace that is largely unrepresented and therefore vulnerable to harsh and unreasonable treatment by employers.
The Australian Labor Party are not anti small business. We do not seek to oppose these measures because we do not value the interests of small business people. Small business people are the lifeblood of our employment market. They provide a substantial number of jobs and contribute significantly to productivity in Australia, and we all owe them a great deal. The Australian Labor Party support finding ways of making small business operators less burdened by the chains of regulatory regimes, especially since they have suffered so much throughout the life of this government under the GST and the business activity statement. Labor will also back legislation that reduces the burden of red tape under the unfair dismissal legislation. Labor will support amendments, as we did with the previous bill, to create a system that will give small businesses quicker resolutions, greater certainty of outcomes and reduced legal costs.  
We in the Labor Party will ensure that there are unfair dismissal laws that benefit both small business operators and employees. We in the Labor Party want to ensure that there are fair laws for all in the workplace. Of course, most small businesses in Australia will not be covered by this bill. This is due to the limited constitutional power of the Commonwealth in this area. In fact, to be covered by the federal unfair dismissal laws, a small business must be covered by a federal award and be a corporation—unless in the case of the ACT, the Northern Territory or Victoria. It has been estimated that probably only 27 per cent— so just over a quarter—of small businesses fit into this category, which does create somewhat of a fallacy about how much this bill is actually going to achieve out there in Australian workplaces.
It is now well and truly time for the government to move past partisan politics on this issue and support a real system of support for small businesses and job security and protection for working families in this country. Perhaps, as has been said by other contributors this morning, the true reason for this legislation is to force this chamber to dissolve. Since the Senate has already rejected this particular bill and is perhaps likely to do so once again, the government no doubt is seeing the opportunity to dissolve both houses of parliament to force an election on this issue. This would mean that, just over a year after the last election, the government would be forcing Australians to the polls over a law which strikes down workers' rights to have a sense of job security and a defence against harsh and unfair dismissals and other terminations of employment.
The Australian people will not accept this attempt to diminish the employment rights of workers in small businesses. This bill has nothing to do with good policy and everything to do with politics, although it is certainly not good politics. Australians will not accept this bill. They will not accept this kind of laissez-faire intervention into the Australian way of life and the Australian fair go. As other speakers have said, this bill is a waste of an opportunity to reduce the burden on small business while keeping protection for working people in place. It is again a cynical attempt by this government to attack the protection of employees while securing a political advantage for itself in the form of a double dissolution trigger.
In conclusion, this bill is bad policy and bad law and fundamentally unfair. It is an attempt by the government to remove from workers a fundamental employment right: to challenge their dismissal on grounds that it was unfair, unjust or unreasonable. This is a fundamental right of workers that is a feature of our industrial relations system in this country. This bill seeks to remove this fundamental right from workers on the sole basis that they are employed by a small business. Labor will oppose this bill and in the committee stage will move amendments to it that will afford justice to all employees and introduce simpler procedures for the processing of unfair dismissal claims.
Labor's approach on this issue is, as always, balanced, fair and just. It preserves the right of employees who have been unfairly dismissed to bring an action in the Industrial Relations Commission, whilst at the same time it will give businesses a straightforward, low-cost and simple procedure through which they can defend any claims brought against them. The rights of workers in small businesses must not be sacrificed for the political advantage of this government. I urge senators to oppose this bill and to support the opposition's amendments in the committee stage of the bill.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2003-02-06,"—One might have thought that George Orwell really got things right if one were looking at the rhetoric of the government over the last few months and the names of the various industrial relations bills that have been presented to the Senate. We have the Prime Minister of this country participating in what he calls a peace mission—a visit to various government heads, including President Bush, in support of the United States' clear agenda for a war on Iraq. One wonders how that can be called a peace mission. Equally, one wonders how a bill that really seeks to allow more people to be dismissed unfairly can possibly be entitled the `fair dismissal' bill. But that is what we have before us today: a piece of legislation that seeks to ensure that Australians can be dismissed unfairly if they happen to be employed by an employer who employs fewer than 20 employees. One wonders why the magic number is 20—why not 19; why not 15; why not 25? What is the significant legal and economic argument for 20 employees?
This legislation is unusual in that it seeks to abrogate rights of a particular class of Australians, allegedly on the basis that it has an employment-creating effect. I, with the rest of the Labor senators on this side, take the view that there is a general principle—a very good principle—in Australian political life and civil life that the law should apply equally to all, unless there is a significant and weighty reason for that not to occur. If you analyse the reasons that this government is putting forward as an argument why the law in this particular case ought not apply equally to all, we say that they are spurious, they do not bear close scrutiny and, as Senator Kirk has said, they really are about politics—but not good politics. I think this is the seventh attempt by this government to seek to place this or similar legislation before the parliament. Presumably, it will have the fate of the number of previous bills in this regard.
The government trumpets two reasons for the legislation that is proposed. The first reason, as I have said, is that it is supposed to have an employment-creating effect. For the reasons outlined by previous speakers and some which I will touch on subsequently, we say that does not bear up to close analysis. The second reason trumpeted by this government is that it is a small business measure. It is one of the central planks of their small business agenda. As I said, there is a principle in this country that the law should apply equally to all, that we should have rights that are equally gained by all citizens unless there is a good reason to the contrary. We say that is not the case in relation to this legislation. It is a bill which has been introduced for political advantage. There is some talk of a double dissolution trigger. It will be interesting, if that is the case, if those opposite wish to go to the election and say to the Australian people that part of their political agenda is to allow your employer to sack you unfairly.
Let us first look at the primary basis on which the government seeks to justify this bill—that is, that it is an employment creator. First, because of the legislative and constitutional limitations of the Commonwealth, estimates are that only some 27 per cent of small businesses in this country will actually be covered. That means that even if one accepted—which I do not—that this exemption would have an employment creating effect, only marginally over a quarter of Australian small businesses would in fact be affected, and one would have to question which of those would indeed employ additional people as a result of this legislation. The actual effect of the bill, however, is not only limited by constitutional limitations of the Commonwealth but by the fact that there are obviously other remedies employees could take if this legislation were passed.
Employees could take other remedies under the Workplace Relations Act; they could take other remedies in relation to common law; they might have other remedies, for example, if they have been sexually harassed and that was relevant to their dismissal. There are a number of other legal remedies which are not excluded by this legislation. So even from the government's own perspective they have a bill which would only affect at most around 27 per cent of Australian small businesses. But even within that we see that employees would obviously have remedies, as they should, for dismissal if the dismissal involved other grounds or grounds which would enable them to take other actions, whether under federal or state law. 
We on this side of the Senate say what many small business operators are saying to us: there are many factors other than the dismissal laws that impinge upon their financial position. There are many factors which one can identify as impediments to additional employment by small business. Previous speakers in this place and in the other place have echoed the views which have also been put to me by small business operators as to the major factors which impinge upon their ability to trade profitably in the Australian economy. The primary and major factor which has been put to me is government regulation and red tape. There has been far more outcry by the small business sector regarding the unfairly weighty GST reporting requirements imposed by this government than in any lobbying I have had in relation to unfair dismissal. Surely all Australians will remember the outcry by the business sector, particularly the small business sector, about the reporting requirements under the GST and the BAS. All of us would know, either through our political position or through personal experience, of small business operators who have expressed their real concern at the significant number of additional hours they have had to put into their small business to administer the government's GST. That is the primary issue that many of them have raised with us.
The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Abbott, in his second reading speech to the House claimed as evidence for the employment creating effect of this bill that a CPA survey found that some 27 per cent of small business owners thought they were unable to dismiss an employee even if the employee was stealing from them, and that 30 per cent of small business owners thought that employers always lost unfair dismissal cases. Minister Abbott said that these small business concerns would persist unless the law was changed. The logic of that is that if people are ignorant of the law and ignorant of their rights under it then that is a reason to change the legislation and to take rights away from a particular group of Australian workers. We say that is not a sufficient basis.
Other speakers have referred to the Hamzy case in which the government's witness, Professor Mark Wooden, was called to give evidence regarding the impact of the unfair dismissal laws on employment—the assertion that they are somehow job killers. As people have said, the Federal Court said that it seemed that the suggestion of a relationship between unfair dismissal laws and employment inhibition was unproven. We say that is not a particularly resounding endorsement of the government's contention that there is evidence of significant employment inhibiting effects by providing Australian workers with a uniform set of rights if they are unfairly dismissed. We say this is an attempt by the government to distract attention from other areas of policy where it is quite happy to impose further requirements on small business to their detriment or where the government has failed and continues to fail to act to protect the interests of small business.
The first example of that, as I previously indicated, is obviously the GST and the administrative requirements which have been imposed by this government upon small business. No-one in this country has been untouched by it. All of us deal with small business in our lives and know how many of those small business proprietors are still complaining about the additional workload that has been imposed on them by the government. The GST has not been good for the majority of small businesses in Australia in terms of their workload.
The second area where the government has been quite happy to seek to impose additional requirements on small business is in the area of superannuation. Honourable senators might recall that the government was keen to proceed with its choice of fund legislation. The bill proposed by the relevant minister in relation to choice was pretty amazing in terms of the requirements upon small business. It was a choice maze. It required 35 steps to be entered into and passed by employers, with significant compliance costs if the small business operator failed to observe those steps. It led to the Queensland Retail Traders and Shopkeepers Association asking, `When will bureaucrats and politicians realise there is a limit to the ability of a small business to cope with all of this?' That really sums up the public criticism of the impact of the choice regime on small business. 
The government's own modelling by Treasury officials of the costs associated with the proposed choice regime was around $27 million more in administrative costs in the first year and $18 million a year for the three years after that. That was the cost impact of the choice regime the government was proposing. In fact, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry suggested that the costs of compliance estimated by Treasury were a stab in the dark and that compliance costs would be significantly more. The government on the one hand says, `We are pro small business; we want to free them up in terms of allowing them to sack people unfairly. But we are quite happy, because we have an ideologically driven agenda in relation to superannuation, to impose upon small business a 35-step choice maze with significant compliance costs against the interests and wishes of small business.'
Another area where the government has shown its failure to act in relation to the interests of small business is the late payment of commercial debts. For many small businesses cash flow is a significant issue. Many small business operators have identified the failure by large business to pay their debts on time, with consequent implications for the cash flow of the small business as being a significant impinging factor upon their ability to trade profitably. For this reason Labor has put out for consultation a private member's bill, the late payment of commercial debts interest bill 2002, which is likely to be introduced later this year. We have had very good feedback, I understand, on the consultation process. 
We have not had from the government much indication of its views, other than Senator Abetz, in response to a question from me last year, indicating his view about the issue. I pointed out to the minister that the Motor Trades Association of Australia, a significant small business association, stated that Labor's draft private member's bill to crack down on late payments should be passed as soon as possible. I pointed out to the minister that the MTAA stated that the bill would be of significant assistance to the many hundreds of thousands of small businesses who find that payments to them by their suppliers and purchasers now regularly exceed normal commercial terms. The response by the minister was relatively predictable. He stated that the ALP was seeking to over-regulate everything, that the government believed in a free market and that businesses had to come to arrangements with their suppliers. He went on again to talk about the unfair dismissal laws.
The continuing tactic by the government is to not do things which might actually assist small business in a real sense to run more profitably; to continue to seek to impose on them for your ideological reasons additional regulatory requirements, additional administrative burdens and additional costs in relation to those two areas; and to continue to trumpet as your small business policy a piece of legislation which seeks to remove rights from a particular class of workers. I say that Australians will see through that. They understand that at the end of the day we are talking about a policy which should present a balance for employers and employees. Yes, governments should do things which encourage and support small business—it is an extremely important part of our economy—but we should also ensure that Australian workers have access to appropriate and, we say, uniform rights in relation to dismissal.
In closing, we say that this bill offends the general principle that all Australians ought to be equal before the law unless there are weighty reasons for that not to be the case. There are no weighty reasons. There is insufficient evidence for the government's argument but there is significant political rhetoric in the government's argument. We say that this bill offends the Australian principle of a fair go for all.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2003-02-06,"—We are debating the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. I must say that you have to give the government credit for having a sense of black humour. Someone with a penchant for black humour dreamt up the title of this legislation as `fair dismissal'. It is anything but fair; it is about removing rights rather than bestowing rights. It is about complicating the industrial relations system rather than simplifying it. To call this legislation `fair dismissal' is a joke that the whole industrial relations community in Australia understands. It is a joke in which irony is the principal character—the sort of irony that Robin Hood used when he called the tallest member of his clan Little John and the sort of joke that the Australian community understand when they refer to the Prime Minister as `honest John'. This bill is not about fair dismissals; it is about making the dismissal system unfair. 
It has to be said that this legislation is no stranger to this chamber or to this parliament; we have seen it before. This bill has been before us on two other occasions, and legislation of a similar sort with similar provisions has been before us on about seven separate occasions in the life of this government. This government has a fanatical view on this issue and it insists on running up this legislation even though it knows what the Senate's considered views are about it and it knows and can easily anticipate that it will reject the legislation, which I imagine it will do on this occasion. But the government is not naive. A cynical commentator would think that that is indeed exactly what the government wants. 
The Prime Minister himself—no less an authority than the PM—has described this legislation as a double dissolution trigger. This legislation is being dished up to the Senate in the first week back after the Christmas recess in order to create the possibility of a double dissolution so that the Prime Minister can keep alive certain things: the issue of a mid-term election; the hope, in his mind fondly regarded, that he can win yet another election; the hope at the back of his mind, secretly thought through but never spoken, that that will keep the leadership challenge of Mr Costello further at arm's length; and the hope that somehow, having regard to his penchant for thinking of himself as a historic figure in recent months, he will etch his reputation into the history books of Australia.
That is not what industrial relations should be about. That is cynical manipulation of industrial relations for political purposes. The relationship between workers and employers in the workplace should not be abused and exploited for political purposes. The greatest asset this country has is a work force working constructively and enthusiastically in the workplace, not a work force used for political purposes and cynically manipulated for that purpose. This legislation is aimed not at the first proposition but at the second proposition.
More importantly, what this government does not do is give any thought at all to what should be the ideal relationship in the workplace. It makes a lot of speeches about choice. It passes a lot of legislation that, theoretically, confers choice but which actually limits the opportunity of Australian workers to properly and fairly negotiate remuneration in the workplace, and it limits the opportunity in some respects of employers to bestow on their work force the conditions and wages that they want.
I just want to spend a moment to talk about that last proposition. I am not one who thinks that all employers in Australia are rapacious and have no view in mind other than to sweat their work force for the bottom line. There are many employers in Australia who regard their workplace as the place where the team they work with to produce the output of their company or enterprise is employed. They want teamwork, cooperation and enthusiasm from their workers. They do not want division; they do not want bitterness; and they do not want to be exploited by this government to pit themselves, in Mr Abbott's arcane view of the old class struggle, against their workers.
There are many enlightened employers in this country, but they may be competing with other employers down the road who can skin their workers, cut wages, reduce working conditions and hold over the heads of their workers the sort of provision that this legislation would enable them to have, and then cut the cost of the wage input into the product they produce and undercut the good employers. The reason we need uniform and widespread proper industrial regulation is to encourage the good employer to bestow fair conditions and not be undercut and driven into bankruptcy by employers who—and this is one way in which the system conceived by this government would work—exploit the system to undermine proper principles in the workplace. 
We know, as I have said, that this is a double dissolution trigger. We know, too, that this government regards this legislation as something that might appeal to small business sentiment in Australia. They think that way because, for them, wedge politics in this country is an article of faith. One does not have to go any further than to consider the last federal election and how the people of Australia were misled about children thrown overboard. We know those photographs were not true—they were not. The government used that incident and others like it to drive a wedge into the Australian community and ask people to choose which side they were on—were they in favour of immigration or were they not; were they in favour of refugees or were they not—and pretended that there was a real issue and used that division in order to be elected. Wedge politics is its stock in trade and wedge politics in the work force is part of what this legislation is about.
Australian small businesses are not confused by this government. If you talk to an Australian small business proprietor about the record of the Howard government, be prepared to take a step back as they give this government a spray about the GST and the weight of red tape imposed on them by the Howard government and by the Costello legislation on the GST.
The GST is the single biggest factor that has damaged the ability of the Australian small business sector to remain competitive. It is the single biggest reason why a number of people in small business have given up the ghost and have got out. It is the single biggest reason why we have high levels of bankruptcy among small business. It has turned small business proprietors, for whom time management is the most difficult constraint, into tax collectors for the government. It has meant that not only do they put in a full day's work that is often longer than most of us would regard as reasonable, but when they finish work at the end of the day they have to fill in their forms and comply with the red tape this government has imposed on them in order to ensure that their GST obligations are met. You do not have to talk for very long with the small business sector to learn that they are not at all enthusiastic about how the government has managed their business life and imposed red tape and extra provisions on them.
The other reason this legislation should be rejected is that it creates a situation in which complications are created in a system that should be made simpler. It creates a different class of employers, defined as small businesses with 20 employees or less, who work under a different set of regulations than other employers. It creates a different class of workers who have a different set of rights and entitlements under this legislation, should it be adopted, than the rest of the work force. Because of the particular carve-out of a uniform standard that this legislation would impose, it adds transactional costs and complications in trying to manage where the line is, who is entitled to what, and so forth. As a consequence, this confuses small businesses—who, as I say, do not have time for red tape, who only have time to do their job—who have to work out whether they are in compliance or otherwise with this legislation. From that point of view, the fact that the government markets this legislation as an aid to small business misrepresents the effect of it. This legislation would be a complication for small business and would be a blight on the management ability of many small businesses to effect their tasks.
The shadow minister for industrial relations, Mr Robert McClelland, speaking in the other place, gave an illustration of this point. Referring to how this legislation would work against the need for uniformity and commonly understood standards around Australia, he said: 
The imperative of achieving uniform standards around Australia is demonstrated by these figures. For the financial year ending 2001—and leaving aside the state of Victoria because they only have the federal provisions applying there—there were 2,534 claims filed under the federal legislation that this bill is proposing to amend, but—
and he goes on to make the distinction—
there were 8,485 filed under the state systems in the rest of Australia. 
That is a very good illustration of how, if you walk away from uniformity and introduce complexity and different standards, you get more disputes, more complications and more settlements that have to be entered into in the industrial relations arena. That is simply time wasting for business. Rather than getting on with business, this means that business has to constantly be involved in interpreting a wad of legislation which, on those figures, clearly leads to a series of disputes that could otherwise have been avoided.
There is no reason why—and the High Court has made this quite clear—the arbitration system or the industrial relations system in this country cannot be the effective agency through which matters of fairness and justice in dismissals can be settled. The commission can look at the particular circumstances of each case. When we are talking about relations in the work force, a set of legal criteria that turns the balance pro the employer means that you create an aggrieved work force with justifiable grievances that cannot be ventilated because the system is against them. On the other hand, if you turn that advantage too far to the worker, you create a system in which some employers are justifiably aggrieved because the system is against them.
Labor is in favour of a balanced system in which both parties have the chance to work through the problems and, where there is a need for dismissal, for that to be done in a way in which a sense of justice applies in those circumstances. If there is an argument, the way to do that is through the industrial commission where the commission is able to weigh the particular circumstances and make a fair decision in each case. The High Court has said that the commission is set up to do that. This government would take that ability from the commission, impose a set of regulations that disadvantaged workers quite considerably, impose extra costs and red tape on employers and pretend that the outcome is something that benefits the economy when of course it would be a drain on economic management. The legislation founders for those reasons.
In the few minutes left to me, I want to talk about the impact of this legislation on a part of Australia I know well. My electorate office is situated in the mining city of Kalgoorlie. In Kalgoorlie we have seen up close and personal the ravages that the federal industrial legislation has wreaked on the Australian work force. Kalgoorlie is a big community where a lot of people know each other and it is a big enough community to be a test bed for whether this legislation works.
The Commonwealth government's legislation on bargaining and individual wage contracts applied in the Kalgoorlie sense has meant that, in the first case, there was a belief that by trading working conditions for more wages, the illusion was that workers were better off. Many of them crossed from an award or a collectively bargained agreement into an individual work contract. They thought that the extra wage somehow advantaged them. They got a shock when they realised that they were in a higher tax bracket and the take-home pay was far less than they thought it was going to be. They also got a shock when they realised that many of the conditions which they had cherished and of which they had not understood the monetary value were lost and therefore some of the advantages that they would have had working under an award no longer applied. They also got a shock when the hours started to stretch out so that a 60-hour week is now a common feature of the employment of those workers.
When wage earners who are heads of families work a 60-hour week, the time they can spend with their family, the quality time they need to raise young kids, their participation in the life of the community—down to playing for the local footy or cricket team or going to the swimming club—is reduced. Community activities in Kalgoorlie have fallen because workers no longer have the same discretionary time to indulge in those community activities or to be part of the local community. They no longer have time to play the parental roles that they would have played had they been working a 35- or 40-hour week. Added to this in Kalgoorlie is the fly-in fly-out issue where many of the workers in the region do not live in the region. This has led to deterioration in the quality of family and community life because people are forever at work.  
The use of unfair dismissal laws and things of that nature to intimidate workers could be seen last Christmas when Kalgoorlie Consolidated Goldmines, a joint venture operator of the Kalgoorlie Super Pit, owned by two US employers, Barrick and Newmont Mining, demanded and required that all workers turn up for work on Christmas Day. If you did not turn up for work, you were in default and could be dismissed. Of all days of the year, the family day is Christmas Day—but not so in Kalgoorlie. Workers were required to be at work. They could not share the joy of opening presents in the morning with their children and could not share the family interaction of Christmas lunch. They were at work and they had to be at work. That is the sort of outcome that the industrial legislation imposed by this government on communities such as Kalgoorlie has brought.
It used to be said that the mining industry was a high wage employer and that workers in the mining industry received something like 130 per cent of average earnings. Lately, it has been said that workers in the goldmining industry receive something like 160 per cent of average earnings. Those figures sound fine, but the extra money has come because of the extra hours they spend at work. The casualties have been family life and the community life of that town. There is a high level of divorce and family breakdown. There is a high level of illness because of the pressure cooker situation. If those workers who have opted in the past for these types of individual work contracts had a choice now, they would choose to go back to the award. They would choose to go back to normal working hours. They would choose to go back to standard working conditions and to have some pride in their jobs and some pride as family members and community citizens in the Kalgoorlie area. This legislation only adds to the woes of workers. This legislation should once again be rejected. I commend a rejection of this bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2003-02-06,"—I rise to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2]—or so-called `fair dismissal' bill. There have been a number of speakers from this side and, I suspect, from the Greens and the Democrats, in relation to this bill. This is not the first or the second time that this bill has been here. The import of it has been here for some considerable time and has been rehashed and thrown up again and again. What is interesting now is that the Liberal Party are not even trying to support it. They do not want to speak on it. Senator McGauran does not want to speak on it. Senator McGauran does not want to support it. They bring it here simply to say, `We will have another run-up.' That is all it is: another run-up. It is actually wasting the time of the Senate. The Liberal Party know our position in relation to this bill. They know our view in relation to the real issue, which is unfair dismissal. They understand that they should do something about unfair dismissal procedures. They should make them fairer and simpler. They should ensure that processes are put in place to ensure that small business and large business can access unfair dismissal procedures. They should adopt the suggestions that we have put forward. But instead they run the legislation up again. It leads to a couple of conclusions: one, that they want to waste time in the Senate—and I have not heard from their side during this debate that that is not their intent—or, two, they like to hear the ALP speaking on unfair dismissals. I do not think it is the second option, so we are left with the first—that it can only be a time waster on behalf of the Liberal Party. They have no direction this year. They have no bills they want to progress. They have no policy that they want to pursue this year. We can only assume that all they really want to do is to listen to the Labor Party talk about how unfair they are in relation to unfair dismissal. 
I had the opportunity to listen to Senator George Campbell this morning when he presented the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee report entitled Small business employment. That report provided a very good overview of the issues that present to small business, which this government has done nothing about since 1996. This government has not been able to grapple with the issues that face small business. It has not been able to deal with the issues that face small business. All it can simply do is present a disappointing rehash of Mr Reith's legislation now stamped with the name `Mr Abbott'. It seems that all this government can do is swap names. It can genuflect to small business and say, `We are actually trying to do something to assist small business,' but does nothing. It sits on its hands.
You can see that clearly when you look at some of the issues that small business have raised in the report. Rather than look at those issues, this government is fixated on an unfair dismissal provision which does not actually help small business. Page 11 of the report contains a short overview of the issues:
These inquiries were prompted by perceptions of an increasing body of regulation affecting business and a growing recognition of the disproportionate burden on small business and the flow-on effects of business performance and productivity.
They are the issues—in other words, the red tape that this government is imposing on small business. We have heard from Senator Cook about the amount of red tape that the GST has imposed on small business. During this debate we have not heard from the government about how it is going to alleviate some of those concerns. We have not heard much from members of the Liberal Party today or yesterday in defence of their unfair dismissal legislation. Perhaps they know it is no good. Perhaps they are sitting in the wings, hoping above all else that they do not have to be heard or quoted and that they do not have to come into this chamber and argue about unfair dismissal. All they are intent on doing is bringing back this legislation and putting it before this parliament for us to point out its inadequacies and flaws.
The idea of this amendment—and I will repeat what many of my colleagues have already said—is to exempt those small businesses with fewer than 20 employees bound by federal awards, and which are constitutional corporations, from the dismissal laws of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. The plan is to have new employees who only have the right to contest a termination where it appears to have been made on discriminatory grounds. This is not the first time this legislation has been brought before the Senate. It was here last June when the House of Representatives failed to agree to the Senate's amendments. This chamber, in fact, tried to pick up your piece of legislation and improve upon it, and you could not see your way clear to support it. Essentially, underpinning the bill—and this is the rub—is the question: is there a valid public policy choice? Does one exist? Namely, can you trade the public good of job creation, as claimed by the Liberal Party, against the loss of rights of employees under federal awards in dismissal matters? That is the policy choice that is being proffered. 
To accept this proposition it must be able to be demonstrated that such a public policy choice, firstly, exists. The question that is posed then is: will removing the right lead to a significant increase in employment as a direct consequence? That is the point. Otherwise there is no point to the whole exercise other than the first point that I put forward, which I think, at the end of the day, is the right one. But to accept this argument the government, for all their rhetoric, have not been able to provide evidence that the intended result will occur. All you may do then is remove the right of employees. I cannot imagine in those circumstances that the government—if you were to remove the right and find that there was no policy choice of job creation as a consequence—would then go back and say: `We made a mistake. We admit that we made a mistake and therefore we will remove or otherwise put back the right.' In other words, I cannot imagine you will reverse this bill's effect. You know you would not, because it is effectively a milksop to small business. That in truth is what it is.  
There are many issues that affect small business when they turn to decide whether they are going to employ people or not. It is not whether this piece of legislation is passed in the Senate which will affect their decision making, notwithstanding the fact that most employees in the small business area are not even covered by federal awards in any event. The government knows that. I am open to correction, but I think the figure is around 27 per cent. Therefore, when you look at the sum total, what the government are saying is that for a small proportion of corporations that we can affect, we want to ensure that businesses with 20 or fewer employees have no cover and no right to look at dismissal laws that we set up under the Industrial Relations Commission. So those small businesses that are sole traders or partners still have the dismissal laws applying to them through the various state tribunals. By and large, all this amendment does is create two classes of employees: those that have no rights in ordinary dismissal matters under federal awards and the majority of employees who are covered by state regulation. Those are the two classes you set up. It is unfair. It is discriminatory. You know it and you should not be doing it.
There is no evidence to support the claims by this government that unfair dismissal laws have stopped employers from employing people. When you turn to the small business employment book, why don't you examine some of the issues that small business have put up in a serious way and look at the ways you can help small business. There is more to be done, but this government is not doing it to improve the ability of small business to employ people and continue to contribute to the growth of the economy. This government—as I have said and I will say again—is doing nothing.
One wonders also whether your second idea is simply to put it up as another double dissolution trigger. That was said this morning. I have not heard the government respond either today or yesterday. It is simply going through the motions. It is not a government with any direction. It is not a government with any consideration for what these issues are. It is not a government prepared to debate. It is a government that simply wants to hide behind harsh, unreasonable and unjust legislation. That is what this government is about. 
It is vital, however—and I urge the government to do so—to address the concerns of working people in Australia. There is now more than ever before a greater need to identify and introduce measures that better balance work and family. But it does not stop there. The Howard government should support issues like—and perhaps I could name a few that this government might be able to take the running on, or at least follow our agenda for—protecting volunteer firefighters by supporting Labor's proposed laws in that area. In addition, you could look again at your employee entitlement scheme, because the Auditor-General had a very good look at it and it presents a dreadful picture of incompetence and delay by your government. The Auditor-General's office said that the rules and procedures are incomplete and those rules that are in place are difficult to follow. It simply is not good enough that you put a scheme in place knowing the scheme is flawed. There is a need for the government to fix that problem. Labor has proposed that 100 per cent of workers entitlements be protected. Why don't you pick that up? It is not that hard for this government to take a look at those issues and say, `We will do something about them.' 
It would seem that there can only be one of two things preventing it: this government is either more interested in using this bill as a double dissolution trigger, or it is lazy—one or the other. I actually prefer the lazy option. You have not spoken in this debate. It does not appear that you will. Therefore I think you are lazy in relation to this bill. Supporters of this bill argue that the unfair dismissal laws adversely affect small business, but this clearly ignores the fact that the Industrial Relations Commission is in a position as the independent body to recognise these issues and work through them with the parties. Of course more can always be done, but not with such a blunt instrument as proposed in this bill. It would be far more effective to improve the commission's ability to deal with unfair dismissals in small business. 
The ALP does recognise that there is a need for a simplification of the procedures. Clearly, costs can and do arise for small business in defending dismissal cases. There is, then, a need for simplified provisions to ensure these costs are minimised. One such move could be to consider some of the proposals we have put forward, rather than being lazy and hiding behind this bill. You could look at the artificial line that you have put in place, an artificial line of 20 employees, which does not take into account the nature of the business or the experience or expertise of the business to adequately address workplace relations issues. This is being lazy again. All you have done is put in a line and a number. You have not considered the expertise of small business, the size of small business or whether small business can deal with issues of workplace relations.
Of course, what this bill does is amend the act by excluding small business. It does this by introducing a new provision in the act which provides that an application for unfair dismissal may not be made where at the relevant time the employer employed fewer than 20 people. In addition, in calculating the number of employees in the business, you talk about casual employees. So you again create this other fiction. You say, `What will we do with casual employees? Perhaps if they are regular and systematic then they can also be counted, but if they have not been regular and systematic for the last 12 months perhaps they should not be included in that provision.' You then sub-discriminate between casual and weekly employees in this area. The line becomes a little blurred. But rather than face up to the fact that the piece of legislation is flawed, you press it again, perhaps as I have said for those two issues and not for the arguments that you put forward in the bill to support it. That makes this job a little bit harder, but I will argue the rational issues first because it seems that you do not want to argue those yourself.
With the line that you have drawn, it is difficult to understand how it can work in any event. There are a number of devices that have been highlighted which throw up ways to get around the 19 or 20 employees a business could have each year: a new company could set up with 19 employees; or it could set up as company 1, company 2 and company 3 in a shop area that is divided up so that each company employs 19 employees to escape the legislation. You might ask: would business do that? Unfortunately, I have some experience of it doing that in the past. In relation to trading hours legislation, which I was involved in many years ago, there were ridiculous positions whereby, to avoid the trading hours legislation, companies would set up places with a number of companies on a shop floor and divide it up so that they could fall under the number of employees and could continue to open and trade. Clearly, business will find ways and means to avoid the artificial line that you have drawn.
This of course creates a knock-on effect in other areas. The bill would mean that, where an employee is told they cannot make a valid application in the commission, people may choose to exercise their rights in other places. That could mean that, rather than the intent of this government in trying to reduce the costs to small business—or the so-called intention to reduce the costs—what could happen is that the employer could end up defending their action in the Supreme Court, or perhaps even the High Court, as these matters are tested in common law or outside the jurisdiction of the commission. It has already occurred, not so much close to this area but, for example, in Pettet v. Readiskill LMT Mildura, where an application was made by a previous employee. Whilst it was unsuccessful, the point is that it demonstrated that this employee did not accept unfair dismissal and did not accept that the right of the employer was unfettered, and he took the matter to the Supreme Court to have his issue aired. Three judges decided—on appeal, I should say, after considerable cost and expense by all parties, I suspect—that there was no valid case for the matter. But the point I make is that the employer had to go through that process. Why do that? The Industrial Relations Commission has always been demonstrated to be the low-cost alternative where grievances can be aired and dealt with. Why do you want to remove the Industrial Relations Commission's ability to deal with it? You have not argued why. You should argue why and you should argue it in here. 
The real concern is that, where a specialist tribunal is set up to deal with these issues, you should allow it to deal with them rather than put in artificial lines and draw in artificial numbers to remove their ability. What you lead to is not that a dismissal can be unfair or harsh or unjust but the reverse. What you are saying to those 19 employees is that the employer can be unfair, harsh and unjust in their treatment in relation to dismissal but there is no right of redress for any of that.
Other matters that you could look at, rather than bringing in this bill, include paid maternity leave. We already know that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has produced a proposal for a national paid maternity leave scheme. The Labor Party has called for it and this government has equivocated. You have sat there on your hands again and equivocated. I think the government is hoping that these issues will disappear if it says nothing. I really think that, at the end of the day, you believe that if you sit there and say nothing these issues of workers' entitlements, unfair dismissals and small businesses dealing with growth and red tape will disappear and you will not have to do anything about it. Then you can get back onto your third term agenda, which is to sit there and do nothing, because you have not articulated a third term agenda. It seems that what you want to do is nothing. That has been the start of the argument and the end of the argument—this government is about doing nothing.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2003-02-06,"—There is certainly no exhausting the previous speaker, Senator Ludwig, because I think he has contributed every time the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2] has come before the Senate—and we know it has been many times. I think we could be up to our sixth occasion. But while he has spoken on every occasion—and he is one of the better performers but he has been unimaginative on each occasion—I think he ran out of material on this occasion. He raised the new argument that the government is putting this up because it is time wasting and seeking an extension of time in this Senate. How absurd.
I would like to bring to Senator Ludwig's attention the government's program. Merely for the autumn session there are dozens and dozens of bills log jammed, waiting to come into this Senate. Since we first came in in 1996 we have faced the most obstructionist Senate in the history of the Senate, I would say. In the 13 years that we were in opposition, even in the most frustrating and obstructionist moods that we would have from time to time, we were never so consistently frustrating as the opposition. You have consistently frustrated this Senate since 1996. I would like to point out to the other side the program the government has waiting to introduce. This is the first week back since the spring session. This is termed the autumn session. Who can forget the last day of the spring session? We had a marathon sitting of 27 hours to deal with one piece of legislation that was crucial to the government's program. We left this place at 10 o'clock in the morning. It was a 27-hour sitting. You think you are not time wasting?
This government is not after any time. This government is trying to get its job done. You wasted 27 hours straight on one piece of legislation and we still did not get it through—and you come in here and tell us that we are time wasting. We are approaching the next May budget and we have not even got our previous budget through yet. This government cannot even get their budget through. We are about to put out our 2003 budget and the Senate is still looking at rejecting, debating and committeeising all the government's previous budgets. And you tell us that we are wasting time by putting up this piece of legislation.
Every minister will tell you—and the one in the chamber today will surely tell you— that if they want a piece of legislation from their department to go through the parliament they have to book it 18 months ahead. No matter how small, no matter how technical, no matter how uncontroversial, they have to book it 18 months ahead because they know that when it lands in this place it will grind to a halt. The suggestion of the previous speaker that the government are time wasting just provoked me to stand up and challenge it and put on the record what an absurd claim it is. He is the one running out of material. Why didn't he just not get up? You are asking us why we are putting this legislation forward. That was his second claim, actually, that the government are not speaking and that we just like to hear the Labor Party speak. I believe that was your second claim. That is even more absurd than the first, of course. 
But I tell you what: the same old speakers are getting up. You feel that every time it comes in you must get up.
—How many times have you spoken on this, Senator Forshaw and Senator Hogg? All the old unionists are getting up and rehashing their old speeches. We heard from Senator Campbell. Well, he must get up, of course. If there is anything to do with industrial relations he immediately gets up, puts his pro forma speech down, whacks a 50 cent stamp on it and sends it straight off to his union bosses to say, `Look, I'm doing your work for the fifth or sixth time.' There is nothing new out of Senator Campbell. We know Senator Ludwig tried something new, absurd as it was. It has been well and truly countered.
He is talking about time wasting. Why do you feel that you have to get up and speak your full 20 minutes anyway? Do not talk about time wasting. Each one of you has spoken for the sixth time on this legislation and you have all taken your full 20 minutes. You feel you are obliged to because the union has asked you to do it on each and every occasion—show your form, show your masters that you are doing your job. It is all preselection stuff. It is a crushing bore listening to you rehash the same stuff six times—I believe it is as many as six times—just to keep your preselection in place. If you really know your position, do not get up. Or get up for three or four minutes. I said I would get up only for five minutes myself. In fact your whip is the only diligent one amongst you who does want to go about the business of things. He asked me to keep it strictly to five minutes, so I will. I will simply conclude by saying that the government's motivation is that we actually believe in this legislation and we are putting it up for that reason. Small business want it. And yes, it, amongst a whole heap of others, does become a double dissolution trigger.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2003-02-06,"—On a number of occasions I have, not by design, followed Senator McGauran in this debate, or he has spoken at or around the time I have been scheduled to speak. On each occasion I must say it has provided some comedy relief in the debate. Senator McGauran knows nothing about industrial relations, obviously, and knows nothing about the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. He just wants to embarrass himself by trying to participate in this debate.
If one looks at the inefficiency of the government, one would see why the legislation is stacked up as per the claim of Senator McGauran. But in terms of the crucial piece of legislation he referred to that we considered at the end of the last session, it is interesting that, when Labor have made approaches to the government about that piece of legislation, Labor have not heard back from the government as to any further progress that can be made with that legislation, Senator McGauran. Do not blame us for being obstructionist. The government have not got off their own backsides to do anything about it. As for the passage of legislation through this place, one only has to look at what is called typically the non-controversial legislation that will go through this chamber today. There are no fewer than six bills—as I was advised recently, and I think that is correct—that will go through this parliament today. They will be passed and become law in the not too distant future.
This parliament is about debating, in many cases, the controversial issues—the issues that get to the very essence of the beliefs of people in this place. One cannot be critical of the beliefs of people on any side of the political spectrum in this place. They have beliefs and are entitled to express those beliefs. If we have legislation, such as that before us today, that gets to the very basic rights of people, then people such as me will continue to stand up to see that such legislation is defeated on as many occasions as the government puts the legislation before us. The fact is that this is reprehensible legislation. This legislation seeks to take away the basic and fundamental rights of people in this country.  
I have no problem with having been a former full-time trade union official. I am proud of the fact that I am still an honorary official of my union to this very day. I am very proud of that because I am proud to defend the rights of people who are not necessarily in the best position to defend their own rights. If it takes people such as me and other colleagues on this side of the chamber to stand up and knock back the nonsense that has been put up by Senator McGauran, so be it. We will continue to do so. 
If one looks at the explanatory memorandum that the government have once again put up, one will see that there is nothing different in the explanatory memorandum. It is laziness, as my colleague Senator Ludwig alluded to earlier. Look at the basis of this bill. Why are we here arguing and debating this bill? It is because, as the explanatory memorandum states, the bill proposes to:
... prevent small business employees (other than apprentices and trainees) from applying under the WR Act for a remedy in respect of harsh, unjust and unreasonable termination of employment (“unfair dismissal”) ...
So the legislation is a denial of people's basic rights—their fundamental rights. 
We are looking at a turning back of the clock—something that no-one wants under any circumstances. We are not looking at people in respect of any minor transgressions or normal misdemeanours that might take place in the workplace; we are looking at people being denied their rights in terms of `harsh, unjust and unreasonable termination'. Those words have been determined either in the industrial relations tribunals or in courts of law to not mean petty misdemeanours at the workplace; they mean transgressions of the most serious nature where a person has a right—a right in natural justice—to go and seek redress.
This legislation, by its own explanation in the explanatory memorandum, seeks to deny that basic right to a class of employees. If people do not speak up against this sort of nonsense, who will defend them? Who will put up the arguments to stop the passage of this legislation, which the government have once again presented? Their legislation is based, of course, on their ideology. I understand that. But it is not a reasonable ideology. It is not a reasonable position and it is not a position that any fair-minded person could accept. This bill is seeking to go to an extreme in that it seeks to deny people the right to redress when they have been sacked on harsh, unjust or unreasonable grounds. That right seems to me to be eminently fair. Anyone in Australia with a sense of fair go and fair play would see it that way. The explanatory memorandum further says:
... require the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (the Commission) to order that an unfair dismissal application made by a small business employee is invalid ...
They are trying to ensure not only that the employee has no right but also that the role of the independent, impartial umpire, which has been the hallmark of industrial relations in this nation for the best part of a century— it will be a century next year—is eliminated from any determination of whether a dismissal has been harsh, unjust or unreasonable.
My lengthy experience in industrial relations has shown me that petty and minor misdemeanours never make it to an industrial relations tribunal. That is a fact of life; no-one can argue anything else. Get out there in the real world if you want to argue it and find out what it is all about. The fact is that those cases do not make it to the industrial relations tribunals. The only cases that make it to industrial relations tribunals are those that fall into the category of being harsh, unjust and unreasonable. If they are not judged to be harsh, unjust and unreasonable, they get the short, sharp shrift—they get pushed out of the system very quickly.
All of this, of course, is really about the government pandering to the small business community by building a straw man—or straw person, to be politically correct—and then trying to knock the straw person down. It is a load of nonsense. This leads one to the additional discriminatory part in the explanatory memorandum, which says: 
For the purposes of this Bill, a `small business' is a business with fewer than 20 employees.
According to the explanatory memorandum, those 20 employees include: 
... casual employees who had been engaged on a regular and systematic basis for a period or sequence of periods of at least 12 months (but not other casual employees) ...
So if a business has 19 employees—the vast majority of whom would be casual employees—who are not employed on a regular and systematic basis then there is a problem. You can have someone who artificially keeps the numbers down and does not employ casuals on a regular and systematic basis—that is one way around the legislation. They churn around the employment of casuals and turn them over. There is no justice in that. If you talk to people and find out what they want, you will find that they want secure employment and the opportunity to be able to earn an income so that they can have access to the fundamental necessities of life. They want access to a reasonable lifestyle. They want access to reasonable accommodation. They want access to credit. If you do not have a long-term sustainable job or find yourself locked into casual employment, you have no chance at all of gaining what many people accept as being the basic necessities of life.
This legislation is designed to take away the rights of people and encourage employers at the smaller end of the marketplace to take on practices that do not provide people with stable employment, do not provide long-term employment prospects and, as a result, do not provide the chance of a reasonable lifestyle. So this legislation is totally discriminatory. It seeks to pander to what is perceived to be the needs and the desires of the small business community in this country, when there is no indication anywhere that the initiative in this bill will, in any way, satisfy the needs of small business. Purely and simply: it is a political stunt. And we are being faced with it once again. The government know why we are being faced with it. The government know that it is a political stunt to set up the DD. I disagree with my colleague Senator Ludwig: I do not think the government are being lazy. I think it is a straight-out political stunt to set up the DD trigger.
Having said that, it is right and proper to answer Senator McGauran's contribution in which he spoke out against this bill, because it seeks to attack a reasonably large class of people—a group of people who are among the most vulnerable in our community because either they are young or they are women. I happen to come from the retail sector—the fast food industry—where there are many of these workers who are subject to many unscrupulous employers who have no problems whatsoever in turning workers over—churning them around, using them up and spitting them out at the other end. It is all for their own profit motivated reasons, which have nothing to do with making a contribution to the long-term employability of these workers or giving them any chance of a career in a particular industry. That is the reality of life out there. This gives the employer an unfettered right to treat these people in a most objectionable and senseless way.
The only exemption in this legislation— and this is a bit of a joke—is that it exempts people on the basis of age, gender or religion. If there were not an employer who could get around age, gender or religion and set up some trumped-up charge to get rid of someone, then I would be surprised. The issue of age has been in many of the service industries ad infinitum, as far as I can remember, and the more unscrupulous employers can turn the employees over once they reach the ripe old age of 18 or 19 and, in some instances, as young as 17, when they lose their usefulness to that particular employer. Of course, the issue of age has always been a difficult issue to pursue. Finding the evidence in that regard poses many a problem indeed. Whilst the exemption is included in the legislation, it was put there with no real seriousness—it was put there really tongue-in-cheek.
A look at the second reading speech sheds no new light whatsoever on the reasons for this legislation being brought back into this place. A couple of spurious claims are made in the second reading speech such as: 
If passed it will improve the employment prospects of people, particularly unemployed people, seeking jobs in the small business sector.
That is absolute nonsense. There is nothing to substantiate that. I would have thought that the report, which was handed down this morning, of the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee—chaired so well by my colleague Senator George Campbell—would dispel that myth completely. Some of the claims in the second reading speech are totally mythical. It states:
It will protect small businesses from the costs and administrative burden of unfair dismissal claims in the federal system.
Again, that is unsubstantiated—obviously someone has been sitting in a room that has been filled with some dubious smoke and has been writing some of these words. It goes on:
However, it will not exempt small businesses from the unlawful termination provisions of the act—
for a person being dismissed for discriminatory reasons—
such as ... age, gender or religion.
I have dealt with that. The second reading speech goes on to say that the bill will:
... free up the large number of small business jobs that are being lost because of the unfair dismissal laws.
Again, that is nonsense and is refuted by the report that I have quoted and that was handed down in this chamber this morning. Then the second reading speech talks rhetoric. The spin doctors have been at the jargon wheel and that is how this second reading speech has been put together, because the speech then states:
The unfair dismissal laws currently place a disproportionate burden on small businesses.
That is just a claim. There is no support for it whatsoever. Then the speech states:
Attending a Commission hearing alone can require a small business owner to close ... for the day.
Dear me! I do not think I have ever heard of that. If one goes to the more disturbing part of the second reading speech, one finds that it states:
Many small business owners are not confident that they know how to comply with the dismissal laws.
So, because the small business owners feel that they do not know how to comply with the law or because they do not know about the law, we change the law. This is mind-boggling. This is groundbreaking legislation. We will then find that when anyone has an ignorance of the law it will become a valid defence to change the law. I cannot follow it. In the second reading speech the government did try to offer a reason, which was that small businesses felt that they were unable to dismiss an employee or that they lost unfair dismissal cases—again nothing at all. But in a vain attempt they refer to research that has found that `small businesses are reacting to the complexity and cost' of the laws—again there is nothing to substantiate that. So why do the government keep bringing this legislation back? There is only one reason: they need a double dissolution trigger. It is a cynical political stunt indeed.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2003-02-06,"—In addressing the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2], I believe that this is the seventh time that this legislation, in one form or another, has been introduced to be dealt with in this parliament and in this chamber in particular. As previous opposition speakers have noted, there can only be one real purpose as to why the government has decided that this should be the very first piece of legislation dealt with in the Senate this year. The reason is, of course, to set up a double dissolution trigger for purely base political motives. That is clearly the purpose and that can be the only real purpose that the government, notwithstanding the many previous occasions on which the Senate has made it very clear that it will not pass this draconian legislation, has decided to bring it back again.
I am disappointed that Senator McGauran is no longer in the chamber, because prior to Senator Hogg's speech Senator McGauran jumped up and gave us a six-minute rant about why this legislation should be passed. Senator McGauran is the National Party senator who really has the job of being the court jester, although not a very funny one. He is like that character in the musical halls who comes on the stage between acts, cracks a few usually fairly lame jokes and then introduces the next act. Senator McGauran, in his very short contribution, demonstrated that he really had nothing at all to say about the bill and demonstrated that if you are going to speak about legislation in this parliament you should at least try to prepare yourself and understand what the legislation is about.  
Senator McGauran made the quite ridiculous claim that we were delaying the government's legislative program and that, to paraphrase his words, ministers sometimes have to book their legislation in 18 months in advance. We all know that is outrageously untrue. Indeed, this government uses the program of this chamber in particular, and certainly the program of the other chamber, for its own political ends. Senator McGauran claimed that ministers need 18 months to introduce legislation, but it is interesting to reflect that not so long ago this government brought on in the other place a bill to do with border security and gave the opposition half an hour's notice of that legislation. Yet the government had known for more than 18 months prior to introducing that legislation that boatloads of asylum seekers were arriving in this country. That is just one instance—and there are many more—that puts the lie to the claims made by Senator McGauran.
I want to now turn to this legislation, and I see that I am going to be cut off in about a minute because we have to go to other business. As I said, this is the seventh time this legislation, in one form or another, has been introduced. As we recall, the government started out talking about unfair dismissal legislation but then decided, after it had been rejected a couple of times, that maybe if it changed the title to fair dismissal legislation it might actually get passed. That is how seriously this government treats this issue, and it demonstrates the ideological obsession that this government has with attacking workers' rights, particularly the rights of some of the workers in this country who are least able to protect themselves. As Senator Hogg so eloquently pointed out, workers in small businesses—in many cases casuals or part-time workers but full-time workers as well—have very little, if any, bargaining power. The other point I want to make in the few seconds before we have to move to other business is that this government's obsession with industrial relations has resulted in 42 pieces of legislation on this subject being introduced since it came to office. It has brought 42 bills into this parliament—
Debate interrupted. ",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-02-06,"—The effect of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Advice Industry) Bill 2002 is to indefinitely extend the current regulatory system for migration agents which would otherwise cease on 21 March. For many years there has been concern about the activities of unscrupulous migration agents. Their activities can cause great harm to vulnerable clients and can threaten the integrity of our managed migration program.
Labor first introduced registration of agents in 1992. Subsequently, the Liberal-National Party did a deal with the Democrats to replace the earlier system with a form of statutory self-regulation under which the professional industry body, the Migration Institute of Australia, is empowered by this parliament to operate as the Migration Agents Registration Authority, known as MARA, until 21 March next. The Liberal government then commissioned an external review of the system chaired by Mr Ian Spicer, which reported in July last year. The review found that the industry was not ready for voluntary self-regulation, as has been advocated by some in the Liberal government, and recommended that MARA continue, but with increased powers.
The Labor opposition supports the speedy passage of the bill so that MARA's operations can continue without interruption. In doing so, we place on the record our view that the rest of the Spicer report's recommendations, which would strengthen the protections available to consumers through regulation, must be implemented without undue delay. I note that the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Hardgrave, has undertaken to introduce a further bill to do so in due course. We would also expect MARA to address the criticisms that the Spicer report makes of its administrative procedures. The Labor opposition supports this legislation.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-02-06,"—The Democrats also support the Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Advice Industry) Bill 2002, but I want to also take the opportunity to expand further on the Democrats' view about the Migration Agents Registration Authority and the legislation surrounding it. The legislation before us today is fairly simple and, as Senator Sherry has said, extends the operation of MARA indefinitely. Previously, there was a sunset clause. This will remove that sunset clause. I think that is a very positive step, because obviously there is always the danger with a sunset clause that either the current or a future government would allow that to expire and have no legislated protection regime. The Democrats are of the view that a voluntary self-regulation approach is certainly not desirable at the moment and is probably not desirable at any stage. I think this bill improves the protection against any government trying to go down that path without getting the approval of the Senate.
I think it is worth noting the essential role that the registration authority plays. As Senator Sherry said, the authority was established following an agreement reached between the Democrats and the coalition. Whilst its structure and processes et cetera and some of the fees it charges were not and are not entirely to our satisfaction, the alternative faced by the parliament was to have no framework in place at all. The government and the minister had made it quite clear that that would be the outcome. Having dealt with Minister Ruddock for many years now, one thing I would say about him—whether it is positive or negative—is that when he makes threats he does tend to carry them out. I have no doubt that he would have in that case. So we have the authority, which I think has now operated for five years or so, and I believe it is developing more and more effectively in its role.
The authority's annual report was actually just tabled earlier this week. I think that in itself highlights the important role that the authority plays. There are 2,773 registered agents in Australia now, so there are a lot of people to oversee. The issue of the resourcing of the authority is an ongoing one that needs to continue to be examined by government. I know there was a recent review in relation to how MARA operates and the whole system. That should provide a number of opportunities for improvement, but it does not matter how good the structure is if the resourcing is not adequate. There is always the balance that has to be made by the authority in making sure it operates effectively but also in managing its resources so that it does not run itself into bankruptcy.
In the last financial year, the authority received 362 new complaints against registered agents, which is more than a doubling of that of the year before. I think that is as much to do with growing awareness of the authority and growing effectiveness of the authority in doing its job of making people aware of those processes. Forty-two complaints were received against unregistered agents, which is also important. So there are a lot of complaints to deal with. Three hundred and thirty-three of the complaints were finalised. There were 10 agents who had their registration cancelled, eight who had their registration suspended and two who were cautioned. Importantly, 91 per cent of all registered agents did not have a complaint laid against them. So I think that, whilst those figures are significant, it should be noted that the vast majority appear to be operating in a way that is not attracting complaints, and that is certainly a positive sign.
In supporting this legislation the Democrats welcome the fact that it will give further certainty and stability to the authority rather than having the uncertainty of a sunset clause hanging over it. Certainly, the Democrats are keen to keep working with the government and with the authority to assist it in being all the more effective. I know, having had a fair bit of contact with many of the board members and its president, Laurette Chao, that the board members are very committed and put a lot of time into their roles, outside of their own professional working lives, because of their commitment to having the migration industry develop and operate as professionally as possible. I think their work needs to be acknowledged along with that of the executive officer, Mr David Mawson, who runs the MARA office. 
In supporting the legislation the Democrats indicate that we will continue to work towards getting this process—the oversight and registration of migration agents—operating more and more effectively as time goes by and getting better development of the whole area of that activity. It is a massive area that is often unacknowledged. Each year it affects the lives of millions of Australians with migration issues, as well as obviously many people from overseas. It is important that those consumers get the best possible outcome.
I note the immense difficulty that a migration agent has in being able to keep up to date with all the migration changes that occur. In addition to legislation that goes through from time to time, a massive number of regulations go through. Only yesterday new regulations to the Migration Act were tabled, making a huge range of changes to various visa categories and qualifications, as well as changes in criteria. It is very difficult for agents and the authority to keep across all that, so I think the complexity of this area needs to be acknowledged. Indeed, new regulations were tabled in relation to the authority itself and this particular act. I draw the Senate's attention to them as they are worth examining for their effectiveness. It is a huge area and it is a very important area. We welcome this legislation as it represents a small step in making that area work more effectively.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MIGRATION ADVICE INDUSTRY) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2003-02-06,"—I thank senators for their contribution to this debate on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Advice Industry) Bill 2002. The amendments made by this bill will ensure that ongoing consumer protection will be provided to vulnerable clients and it will enable the industry regulator to continue to improve the effectiveness of the migration advice industry. As has been commented, further legislation to implement other key recommendations of the review will be introduced in due course which will further strengthen the integrity of the migration advice industry. I commend the bill to the chamber.

"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2003-02-06,"—The Democrats obviously will be supporting the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2002 [2003], which is the latest attempt by the government to plug holes in their digital television policy. The bill contains a number of technical amendments which deal with allowing an annual averaging of digital television broadcasts, clarifying when only part of the television program is an HD program as defined so that only that part would be considered an HD program for the purposes of a quota, and other changes to quota arrangements.
The reason why I want to speak briefly to the bill today is to put on the record our continuing concerns about the government's failure to develop a digital television policy which promotes access and equity at all levels. It is worth noting that last year only around 5,000 new decoders for digital television were sold in Australia, compared with around 40,000 new DVD recorders a month. I think this highlights that the government has failed to ensure that there is a product of interest to consumers, notwithstanding the enormous amount of effort that has gone into promoting digital television. 
At this stage, probably the biggest single development in terms of promoting digital television will be occurring in the pay television arena. The ACCC only last month issued a discussion paper on Foxtel's application for exemption from access undertakings in respect of pay television. Foxtel has made it clear that unless an exemption is granted from access undertakings it certainly will not be providing the digitisation of pay TV. That particular process will proceed. The Democrats are of the view that access to pay TV for independent operators, and also for the other free-to-air operators, is a fundamental principle which, until it is clearly delivered by government, will open up the prospect of a monopoly or an excess market position developing in respect of pay TV. It is something which certainly the Democrats are concerned about and we are looking to the ACCC and to the government to make sure that access to that platform by independent operators and by other free-to-air broadcasters is guaranteed.
The other thing which has concerned us about the ACCC and the Foxtel pay TV approach is the ACCC's approval of bundling by Telstra in respect of various products. We notice that the ACCC is yet to bring down its discussion paper on the future market position of Telstra in respect of Foxtel and pay TV generally. That will be a very interesting report. The expectation is that that report will focus on Telstra's 50 per cent ownership of the Foxtel company and whether it is appropriate for the infrastructure provider to continue to also own 50 per cent of the distribution company for pay television. I noticed that the competition authorities in Europe have largely precluded telephone companies from also owning the pay TV operators in that jurisdiction. That is something which I think the ACCC will be dealing with and which the government will have to consider later this year—that is, whether that creates a position of excessive market power which needs to be resolved. I noticed yesterday that the National Competition Council, in its submission to the inquiry in the other place into the structural separation of Telstra, recommended that structural separation of Telstra should proceed. Pay TV might be the area where we will see the first element of that debate played out later this year.
The second element I want to deal with very quickly is the government's failure to resolve the issue of set-top boxes for digital television. I think it was only last week that the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts wrote to all operators in the industry, making it clear that he would not be proceeding with developing a standard or requirement for set-top boxes to ensure dual tuners that would allow terrestrial free-to-air television stations to be able to broadcast their full digital signal into the pay TV arena. This is something which has concerned us for some time. We in the Democrats do believe that it is possible to develop a reasonable standard that ensures that the free-to-air operators are not precluded from full access to the pay TV platform, particularly if we are proceeding towards a situation of having pretty much a single pay TV operator in this country. It is something with regard to which the minister has dropped the ball, and it is something where we would like to see the minister pick the ball back up again and ensure that the situation of competition within pay TV is made as reasonable and appropriate as possible. That will require some regulation of the content of set-top boxes. I have seen some of the low-cost alternatives which could be provided for dual tuning, and it is something which the government should consider. One suggestion that has been put to me is that if Telstra became purely the infrastructure provider to pay TV, as opposed to the operator as well as the infrastructure provider, then the set-top box could be something which was part of Telstra's responsibility. It is not necessarily an option I endorse but it is certainly one which I think should be considered.
The third area which I want to deal with in terms of digital television is quite an important one for government—again, over the next three to four months—and it is probably the one bright spot in promoting the uptake of digital television. It is the provision of multichannelling by the public broadcasters—the ABC and SBS. The ABC and SBS have been essentially providing multichannelling on their digital signals out of their current budgets. It is quite clear, as Russell Balding from the ABC has said and Nigel Milan from SBS has made clear, that they can no longer continue to do that unless there is some supplementation of their core budgets over the next triennium. It would be quite tragic if the ABC and SBS were unable to continue their trailblazing multichannelling options in the future. If the government is going to have a serious digital television policy dealing with the issue of the funding of the public broadcasters in the next triennium, then the recognition that the multichannelling which they are providing is one of the key attractions of digital television in this country at the moment is something which the government is going to have to really take on board. When talking with industry players it is quite clear that that is one of the key selling points for digital television at this particular point in time. 
In summary, this bill is the latest of the measures the government has tried to put in place to slow, I suppose, the requirements of digital television, recognising that the demand has not yet developed in the consumer market for the products that television is currently offering. But unless we get the pay TV market arrangements right, the issue of the set-top boxes right and the issue of the funding for the public broadcasters right, then digital television in this country might end up being a continuing mess, the way it has been since the government introduced its policy some five years ago. It is something which the Senate needs to be aware of and that the government needs to be much more proactive about in terms of ensuring that we get decent policy settings to promote the uptake of digital television.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 2002 [2003]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2003-02-06,"— The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2002 [2003] makes relatively minor amendments to the legislative framework for the introduction of digital television, which was put in place by parliament in 2000. The amendments provide greater clarity and some flexibility for broadcasters in the way in which they meet the high definition television quota. At the same time, the amendments ensure that HDTV programming is available to people who have or wish to purchase HDTV receivers. This bill represents a sensible adjustment to the regulatory framework while maintaining the government's commitment to HDTV as a key component of the digital environment. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2003-02-06,"—The National Gallery Amendment Bill 2002 [2003] will have a significant flow-on effect to regional galleries in Australia, and this is something that I am sure everybody in this place will commend. The promotion of regional excellence ought to be a central plank of any government's policy and it is pleasing that in relation to the present government this is certainly the case. The bill is regarded as non-contentious, which is also pleasing. The parliament of the Commonwealth should be concerned at all times to facilitate the arts, particularly the functions and, in a sense, the outreach of the National Gallery of Australia.
On a visit that I made to Cairns in North Queensland last month, which was my first visit to that fine city as a newly elected Queensland senator, I had the pleasure of visiting the Cairns Regional Gallery. I visited it at the wise insistence of a good friend of mine, Councillor Deirdre Ford, who has been one of the main instigators of that gallery, has been on its board from the very early days and is one of that gallery's strongest advocates. Honourable senators might like to know that the Cairns gallery services an area that is almost as large as Victoria, from Cairns to the Torres Strait. It may also be of interest to some honourable senators who live within cooee of Canberra that Cairns is about twice as far from Brisbane as Canberra is. These are the realities of distance in regional Australia. Distance—not to be mistaken for remoteness—is a constant factor in Queensland life and something which I believe needs to be more fully understood for the impact that it has on daily life. 
I am happy to report to the Senate that the Cairns Regional Gallery is a first-class institution that deserves the highest levels of commendation and resourcing, which was something that was put very strongly to me when I visited. Honourable senators may be interested to know that the gallery was a project that took shape over six decades of planning, lobbying and fundraising. It was opened in July 1995, and since then well over 250,000 visitors have enjoyed its offerings. The gallery is located in a very historic building, the state government public office building, which was constructed in around 1936. It is a very fine home for the great work that is displayed there.
When I visited, I had the pleasure of viewing the Listen to the Land exhibition. This was a very extensive collection of over 100 paintings, prints, bark paintings, carvings, sculptures, artefacts and textiles. This collection of contemporary and traditional Aboriginal art was a touring exhibition from the Edith Cowan University Art Collection in Perth. The exhibition showed different styles and techniques from more than 10 communities around the country and presented a very powerful statement on the richness and strength of Aboriginal culture in Australia today.
 (Senator Hutchins)—Excuse me, Senator Santoro, could I interrupt you for a moment. I wonder whether my colleagues here on the right, if they want to continue their conversation, would either keep their voices down or go outside.
—Each of the pieces in the exhibition was selected for either its direct depiction or its demonstration of the link between the artist and the land. The artworks were even more impressive when one considers that they came from a wide geographic area, including the Kimberley, the south-west, the central desert, Arnhem Land, Melville and Bathurst Islands, as well as metropolitan cities such as Melbourne, Sydney and Perth. I have described the exhibition so extensively because it clearly shows the capacity and capability of the Cairns Regional Gallery to put on displays and events which are truly of world-class standard. I did not really have a great appreciation of the gallery before I visited. In fact, some people would probably say that I do not have a great appreciation of art—full stop. I can assure you that I thoroughly enjoyed visiting the gallery.
I would like to make particular mention of the people who received me: the chairman of the gallery board, Mr Ron Davis, and fellow directors, Councillor Deirdre Ford, who made sure that I got there, Shirley Overend from Port Douglas, Margaret Gill, the Deputy Mayor of Cairns, and Hal Westaway. When I visited, these people were very keen to advocate on behalf of the facility. They are unceasingly and firmly focused on the great future that they believe the gallery has.
Before I conclude these acknowledgments, I also mention the great work and the passion for the gallery by one of my former state colleagues and the former Treasurer of Queensland, Keith DeLacy. Apparently, the art gallery is one of his true great loves and passions and he worked tirelessly, both as the local member and as a government minister, to make sure that it came about and stands as I have described it today. The gallery director is Louise Doyle. I was very impressed by her enthusiasm, her management of the facility and her strong artistic credentials. These are all essential elements in the gallery's day-to-day operations and in planning for its future. I also had the pleasure of meeting several other curators and, again, their dedication is to be commended.
Far North Queensland is a paradise for artists as much as for Australians and overseas tourists. The Australian tropics are a special part of the world. They are an alluring, unique and spectacularly beautiful part of the world and they have long been a powerful attraction for Australian artists, particularly the modernists. Who could ever forget the evocative words of the artist Donald Friend, who said in 1946: 
When I got off the plane in Cairns I was immediately in a different world. The air was like warm treacle and scented with a number of half-familiar odours ... molasses, frangipani, mango and other things hard to recognise. It was night and steaming hot ...
And so he went on. Those of us in this place fortunate enough to come from Queensland are more familiar with the `different world' that Donald Friend found all those years ago. It is still a different world—molasses, frangipani, mango and other things southerners might find hard to recognise still smell the same and are instantly identified with the tropics—but it is a different world in a wholly modern way. In this context, I inform the Senate that I have spoken to the Minister for the Arts and Sport, Senator Kemp, who has assured me that he will visit the gallery in the very near future. That is good news that the people up north would like to hear.
Cairns is now a major gateway to Australia through the Asia-Pacific, of which this country is such an important part. It is a vibrant city. It is a place that demands attention and deserves to get more attention than it does. This is particularly the case in the area of the arts. Assistance for projects and ongoing development in the arts is a major factor affecting regional Australia and, I believe, Far North Queensland. Due to its geographical position, Far North Queensland is in a prime position to do great things for itself and for Australia.
If Far North Queensland is to do great things in the most beneficial time frame, it will need expanded or increased support in the arts as in any other aspect of life. That is why the National Gallery Amendment Bill is so important. As noted in the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard when the bill was introduced by my friend and colleague Senator Ian Campbell, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, it amends the National Gallery Act 1975 in a way that is expected to broaden the scope for the gifting of works to other institutions, including regional galleries within Australia. The bill will enable the National Gallery to have better long-term planning of the management of its collection and will also assist regional galleries with their own collection management. For Queensland and other `regional places'—and I put that in quotation marks because in a federation such as ours everywhere is a regional place—these measures should help to bring a greater variety of what one might call world works to places where people can see them. I know from my discussions with the team at the Cairns gallery that this would be a great boon to them and to the growing community of people interested in the arts in Far North Queensland.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL GALLERY AMENDMENT BILL 2002 [2003]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2003-02-06,"—I want to place on the record some comments on the National Gallery Amendment Bill 2002 [2003] from Senator Ridgeway, who has had to leave today due to ill health. The Australian Democrats support the passage of this bill, which gives the Council of the National Gallery of Australia the power to gift works to other institutions, even when they have a saleable value. We would like to go on record as recognising the importance of the National Gallery as one of the nation's pre-eminent cultural institutions and the quality of the collection it has built up since 1982.
Criteria for disposing of works exist in the gallery's disposal policy. We would urge the National Gallery council to closely follow these criteria when it is considering the disposal of any works. The National Gallery holds a national collection in trust for the Australian people, to be maintained and used in the national interest. The public interest is served by ensuring access to Australian art by all Australians. Where possible, the Democrats believe public regional institutions should be given preference as recipients of works gifted from the National Gallery. This will enable improved accessibility and education through the visual arts for Australians across the country.  
In closing, I would like to commend the NGA for its longstanding dedication to sharing its works with Australia's regional galleries through its loans program, bringing artworks to parts of Australia that would otherwise have little opportunity to experience them. I would also like to credit the NGA for its travelling exhibitions program last year, as part of its 20-year celebrations, which again gave a greater number of Australians access to our cultural heritage. We support the passage of these amendments on the understanding that they will be used to further this objective on a more permanent basis.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL GALLERY AMENDMENT BILL 2002 [2003]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2003-02-06,"— I thank senators for their comments, particularly Senator Santoro, whose evocative remarks about Cairns made me recall my own very pleasant visits there, which I hope to continue to make in the future. I am aware of the very hard work carried out by regional arts communities and I am very glad that the government has put forward the National Gallery Amendment Bill 2002 [2003] to enable the National Gallery to gift works to galleries in regional Australia.
With this bill, the government is fulfilling its responsibilities to ensure rural and regional Australians are participating in and accessing diverse and high-quality arts experiences. This is in comparison to the progress of the previous government, which ignored artists and audiences in rural and regional Australia in its arts policies. The fact that there have been six shadow arts spokespeople over the last six years proves that Labor is not committed to the arts. I am delighted that, with a bill such as this one, this government has proved that it is committed to the arts, particularly in rural and regional Australia. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2003-02-06,"—Today I rise in my capacity as the Democrats' spokesperson for the territories, including the Australian Capital Territory. We agree that the amendments to the Australian Capital Territory Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 before us are necessary to address technical issues in relation to the Australian Capital Territory (Self Government) Act 1988 and the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988. 
I take this opportunity to briefly note two issues that have been of concern to the Australian Democrats with respect to both those acts. The first concern is the requirement that the ACT restrict the composition of its parliament and executive under sections 8(2), 8(3) and 41(2A) of the self-government act. The Australian Democrats have a policy— and obviously this is something we have discussed with our colleague Ros Dundas in the legislative assembly—that the ACT should be able to determine the size of its own parliament instead of being subjected to the Commonwealth structure of government. I note that a report from the ACT Standing Committee on Legal Affairs in June last year recommended that the ACT continue to lobby the federal government to devolve from the Commonwealth the power to determine the size of the assembly. 
The second concern, which the Democrats have raised previously, is the role and powers of the National Capital Authority, established under the Planning and Land Management Act 1988, which have been a source of continuing debate between the federal and ACT governments. The most recent example of bureaucratic authority being able to override the wishes of a parliament—one that has been raised in the media on several occasions—is the Gungahlin Drive extension. As I said, it has received quite a great deal of attention, so I will not go into it in any further detail in this place.
Finally, on behalf of my party, and I am sure all senators in this place, I would like to once again take the opportunity to extend our sympathy and support to the residents of the Capital Territory, especially those who have lost loved ones, those who have been injured and those who have lost their homes. The Australian Democrats and I as the spokesperson have pledged our total support to the territory, both to the minister on a federal level and the ACT Chief Minister, as well as to the emergency services and, most importantly, Canberra's residents, to work with them in a constructive debate that examines the issues in relation to the recent bushfires. It is really important that we do that in a constructive manner, whether we are looking at measures that were taken recently or the resources required for future prevention of such attacks.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2003-02-06,"— The Australian Capital Territory Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 consists of several technical amendments to the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 and the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988. The bill aligns the dates for ACT elections referred to in the self-government act with those established by the Electoral Act 1992 (ACT), as amended in 1997. The bill also removes transitionary provisions in the self-government act that have been made redundant since the 1997 amendments to the Electoral Act 1992 (ACT) were introduced. References to positions in the ACT Public Service which have undergone name changes since the introduction of the self-government act are addressed by this bill. Finally, the bill will allow a quorum to be formed at meetings of the National Capital Authority when the full-time member cannot participate in deliberations on a certain matter that they have declared a pecuniary interest in. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Is the minister aware that the Minister for Foreign Affairs in an interview yesterday stated that the only military forces Australia had in the Gulf in October last year were `the two ships and the support that goes with them'? Didn't you confirm yesterday that there was also an Australian headquarters element in the Gulf at the time in support of the US-led war on terror? Wasn't the primary role of the headquarters to ensure that Australia was integrated into US military thinking in the region, a fact that was confirmed last year by the Australian national commander in the region? Hasn't Defence also confirmed that we had personnel in Kuwait training and liaising with its defence forces? Didn't the Minister for Foreign Affairs mislead the public yesterday with his claim that only the two ships and their support were present in the Gulf at that time?

Minister, is your reluctance now to provide full details of these deployments in the Gulf and where they are situated because of Mr Downer's embarrassing gaffe?

—You're not my only source of information—thankfully.
—Unfortunately, in this instance your other source of information was incorrect. You were alleging at the time of the comments of Mr Downer that Australia had forces in the region that had some function in relation to Iraq, and that was not the case. The headquarters we had was basically to support the forces that we had in the Gulf that were engaged in the war against terror, which at that time were principally the ships in the Gulf, the special forces in Afghanistan and, for a time, the two in-air refuellers that were operating out of Kyrgyzstan.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2003-02-06,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Hill) to questions without notice asked today relating to military action against Iraq.
We have seen another example today of the Howard government's attempt to deceive the Australian people about the truth of their commitment to a war on Iraq and about the truth of their commitment to George Bush— that they will be there with him when he calls when he wants to go into Iraq, whether or not there is any UN sanction for that move. We have seen over the last couple of days Foreign Minister Downer's very convoluted attempts to explain his way out of his conversation with the New Zealand High Commissioner. Mr Downer has been unable to explain that conversation because, basically, he expressed the view to the New Zealand High Commissioner that they were committed to an invasion of Iraq. They were committed to follow the USA in whatever circumstances. They were unable to be open and honest with the Australian public about that; they were not prepared to be open and honest with the Australian public.
Today, interestingly, the Prime Minister in the other House responded to the issue of the conditions on which service men and women would be going to the gulf under the recently announced Operation Bastille: the predeployment. There was a question we raised with Senator Hill yesterday and he was unable to provide any information on those conditions because, he said, a declaration had not yet been made. So, yesterday, the responsible minister, the Minister for Defence, was unable to say what conditions applied because no declaration had yet been made. As the issue started to take hold—I know that the ABC and a few other media outlets picked up on the story today—we saw that the Prime Minister went into the House and said that in fact those involved in Operation Bastille will have the same conditions as those involved in Operation Slipper and the war on terror because they did not want to have an inequitable situation.
That is quite right: there should not be an inequitable situation because the government has deployed the Kanimbla to be involved alongside other ships where those conditions apply. But the interesting point of all this is that yesterday there was no declaration, and the reason there was no declaration is that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence, Senator Hill, are unable to bring themselves to utter the words `warlike service'. The key announcement in relation to the conditions that will apply to service personnel is whether or not their service is classified as warlike service. We saw today the Prime Minister and Senator Hill, in this place, unable to utter those words, unable to be honest with the Australian public, because the personnel are on warlike service; they have been committed to warlike conditions. But they do not want to come clean about that—they do not want to be honest. So we have this convoluted lawyer's explanation that somehow overnight we have suddenly decided that, while there is no declaration about warlike service, those that are going on the predeployment will enjoy the same conditions as those that have been deployed on the MIF and Operation Slipper. 
It is funny that Prime Minister Howard had no trouble announcing when he despatched Operation Slipper that they could be defined as being on warlike service. I have a copy of his press release from 2001. They were defined as being on `warlike service'— no problem there. But the Prime Minister could not bring himself today to say that those troops are on warlike service, and the minister here could not bring himself to say that they are on warlike service. They have tried to fix up the fact that the conditions were inequitable, that in fact the conditions were better for those people on the ships than for those SAS soldiers already committed in the gulf, already training and preparing for a potential war on Iraq. They have worse conditions because the government did not want to bring itself to declare that they were on warlike service. And today we had this slippery little convoluted answer: `They'll be on the same conditions but we haven't defined them as being on warlike service.' 
This government will not come clean with the Australian public. The personnel have been committed to warlike service and until we raised it in the Senate yesterday the government let it slip along. Those troops did not know the conditions under which they were going. The question has still not been answered. I see the Prime Minister's answer to the second question in the Reps today, but the government has still not answered whether this entitles the personnel to qualification under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. That is still not clear: the Prime Minister did not answer that question and Senator Hill did not say that. As I understand it, the definition of warlike service is what then allows them to count their service as qualified service under the VEA. We are still not convinced that they are getting equal entitlement, but the key issue here is that the government refuses to be honest with the Australian public. They are on warlike service, but the Prime Minister could not bring himself to use the words and Senator Hill could not bring himself to use the words because he knew the Australian public would—(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,20,1,speech
"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2003-02-06,"—I am quite surprised to hear Senator Evans say that he does not think the government is prepared to come clean with the Australian public and be honest with them, because at this stage nobody is being less honest with the Australian public than the Australian Labor Party. What we on this side of the chamber really want to know is: what is the truth of Labor's commitment in the event of any action being required? The Labor Party currently have no commitment at all—`it all depends'. We know weapons of mass destruction are being held by Saddam Hussein and his regime. The Labor Party's position seems to be that those weapons of mass destruction will have to be removed, provided the United Nations says it is okay to remove them. But if the United Nations cannot come to an agreement—and very often it cannot—then the Labor Party's position seems to be that it is okay for Saddam Hussein to keep and use those weapons of mass destruction, because they have no commitment to making sure that they are removed. The question that the Labor Party ought to be asking is: why isn't their leader, Mr Crean, demanding that the United Nations take action to remove these weapons of mass destruction? If the United Nations does, they are prepared to support them being taken out of the country and, if the United Nations does not, they are very happy for Saddam Hussein to keep weapons of mass destruction so that he can use them at some future stage.
Senator Evans talks about people being slippery. In this situation no-one is being more slippery than the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Crean, because he will not come out and demand that the United Nations instruct Saddam Hussein to get rid of the weapons of mass destruction—because the lefties in his own party will not let him. Senator Lundy, Senator Evans and all those people who have taken a strong line of no war under any circumstances simply will not allow Mr Crean to demand that the United Nations take action to make sure that those weapons of mass destruction are removed from Saddam Hussein to make this world a safer place. They say that we need more time: we must give the inspectors more time, we must let the United Nations process take place regardless of how long it takes. Twelve years is a lot of time to get rid of those weapons of mass destruction which Saddam Hussein promised to get rid of as part of the cease-fire arrangements at the end of the Gulf War. 
We know those weapons of mass destruction are there. We know of the intentions of Saddam Hussein to deceive the United Nations and the world about whether or not he has weapons of mass destruction. The statement by US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, to the United Nations Security Council last night only adds more weight to the argument that Saddam Hussein is a leader who is deceiving the rest of the world, the United Nations weapons inspectors and the United Nations Security Council all for his own ends to try to buy more time for himself. 
It is time that the Labor Party came clean. If they believe that weapons of mass destruction should not be held by Saddam Hussein, they should support some action to make sure that Iraq gets rid of them, and yet we have not heard Mr Crean come out and demand that the United Nations do that, which it is his obligation to do. Instead, he continually criticises the United States for the strong position it has taken, a position which has meant that military deployments have put the utmost pressure on Saddam Hussein. Had that not been done, there would have been no weapons inspectors there right now, because for four years Saddam Hussein would not let weapons inspectors in. So thank goodness the United States, together with the United Kingdom, put so much pressure on Saddam Hussein that the weapons inspectors were let in. We have seen the results and the reports of the weapons inspectors. They have said that Iraq is not cooperating. Iraq does not appear to have come to a genuine acceptance that it should get rid of these weapons, that it should abide by the United Nations resolutions and that it should come to terms with making sure that it fulfils the terms of the cease-fire agreement of the Gulf War.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2003-02-06,"—Senator Ferguson has kept the debate going about the UN and about the potential war. But let us talk about the troops for a moment. Let us personalise it for a moment. Put yourself in their shoes. I do not profess to be able to put myself in their shoes. I can say, having served in the reserve army, that I do understand, albeit in a minor way, some of the issues that they may face. But, if you put yourself in their shoes, you can see there are a number of matters that this government has failed to address for them in this instance. The government has not been able to clearly articulate to its troops the nature of the deployment. It is important for troops— Air Force, Navy and Army—to be able to follow what it is that is being required of them.
We have a deployment, but this government has not clarified two major issues that cross their minds and those of their families and friends, both when they leave and when they come back. Those issues are: are they eligible for rehabilitation and compensation cover under the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the Military Compensation Scheme? And will their service conditions be declared `warlike service' so that they can access those benefits? What we have heard from the Prime Minister and from Senator Hill is equivocation. They have not been able to come clean to the troops themselves and say: `This is the service that you will be deployed under.' It is a disgrace to find that this government cannot deal with that issue. It is not a difficult issue to deal with. As Senator Evans said, it seems to be that they slip on the term `warlike'. They are trying to differentiate themselves from that term but, in so doing, they create confusion and perhaps misunderstandings for the troops themselves. If there is no declaration of their service being warlike, then what is it the troops expect to do? What is it that they will face?
In terms of the UN, which Senator Ferguson mentioned, Australia has a proud history of involvement in the United Nations. It in fact goes back to the time when Prime Minister Chifley made the application to become a United Nations member on 1 November 1945. He agreed to accept all the obligations of the UN charter and, since that time, Australian troops have participated in matters such as the UN Commission for Indonesia in 1947-51, the UN military observer group in India and Pakistan between 1950 and 1985 and the UN command in Korea between 1950 and 1956. This continues right through to the Multinational Force and Observers, the MFO, in 1982-86 and from 1993 to the present. There was also the UN operation in Somalia between 1992 and 1993. And it goes on. There have been a considerable number of actions across the globe, since Australia, under Chifley, joined the UN, to deal with those issues. 
We now have no clear issue from this government about being deployed under UN conditions. There is no statement. The troops have been familiar with and have understood our deployments in the past, I would suggest. This government is abandoning them by ensuring that they do not have any clear understanding of what the deployment is now. It is necessary for this government to clarify this for them. It is helpful for them to be able to understand. Why doesn't this government come clean and make it plain? There are two issues: why don't you say that the conditions should be `warlike', to clarify it in their minds; and why don't you wait for the UN sanction? Why don't you then explain that to your troops? (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,20,1,speech
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2003-02-06,"—The Labor Party seems to be missing a key point here. It is one that I would like to stress, and I would like to glean from the ALP exactly what its position is with respect to the weapons of mass destruction held by Saddam Hussein and what efforts it is taking to ensure that we have a peaceful resolution. What efforts is it making to ask the UN to pressure Iraq to disarm? I am not aware of any initiatives taken by the ALP leadership either privately or publicly. I hope and request that it make that very clear. I want it to outline to the Australian public what initiatives it is taking.
I think I know what might be happening behind the scenes. I think there might in fact be some domestic goings-on within the Labor Party. I think they—this is the left wing of the Labor Party—might be too busy trying to fill the position of a frontbench vacancy created by Carmen Lawrence. I think it could be Senator Mackay, Alan Griffin or Jennie George. I think there is lobbying going on within the ALP and they are actually focused on those issues rather than on taking initiatives which will create peace, initiatives which will force or encourage the UN to pressure Iraq to disarm. So I think you have been hoodwinked and you have been misguided in your efforts to lobby for that frontbench position.
I also believe that there is a reason behind Kim Beazley's lack of interest in coming back to the front bench, and that is his uncomfortable feeling with respect to the populist policy of the ALP at this moment. No doubt it may change in due course. It is a short-term political traction that the ALP believe that they have at the moment, but of course that will change. It is probably a desperate measure. This is the third point I want to make about Mr Crean and his leadership: it is a desperate measure to retain his leadership and to hold on to the support that he hopes to have, particularly from the left wing of the Labor Party.
I would like to know what steps the ALP and the leadership of the ALP are actually taking to encourage and to stimulate the UN to pressure Iraq to disarm. That is the key question. Saddam Hussein does have a record of terror and oppression, he does have a record which is equal to none in using chemical weapons and weapons of mass destruction and he does have a record of torture and execution of his own people—the Kurds, and then of course members of his own family—which everybody in this chamber would be aghast at. He has refused to give up his weapons of mass destruction, and what are we actually doing about it? He has thumbed his nose for over 12 years at resolutions from the UN and now we see political and diplomatic pressure being applied as a result of the initiatives and the decisions of our Prime Minister and other leaders around the world, including President Bush and Prime Minister Blair. The number of countries in support of these initiatives to seek resolution and to seek peace is increasing. 
It has been clearly identified that he has weapons of mass destruction and the onus is on Iraq to prove that the weapons have been destroyed and what has actually happened. There is a full list of those weapons available on the public record. I want to repeat what Chairman Blix said about the efforts of Iraq to disarm. He said:
Iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance—not even today—of the disarmament ... 
He also noted that cooperation needs to be active. He said:
It is not enough to open doors. Inspection is not a game of `catch as catch can,' ...
Clearly, the onus is on them to act, and diplomatic pressure is being applied. We need action and we all want peace. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,20,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-02-06,"—I find it quite amazing that the coalition senator, Senator Barnett, used his five minutes to talk about internal Labor Party matters when we are faced with a life or death issue. It is about the war and it is about the coalition's deception to the Australian people about the status of troops heading towards the gulf and it is about the deception that has been played out on the people of this country by the Prime Minister for the last few months. It is painfully obvious that Prime Minister Howard has committed Australia to this war and it is becoming painfully obvious just how difficult it will be for him to turn that decision around. He has lost the confidence of this chamber and he has certainly lost the confidence of people around this country.
Let us look at some of the responses over the last few days. We have given the coalition government the opportunity on several occasions to come clean, to talk about exactly what they have committed to. We have asked series after series of detailed questions in this place and in the other place. Have we had anything but equivocation, ambiguity, fudging words? That is all we have had from the Prime Minister and his cohorts on the front bench. It is just not good enough. This is extremely serious. It is life or death for the Australian troops and, putting that aside, it is life or death for thousands—perhaps hundreds of thousands—of people in Iraq, and obviously more if the war spreads. 
Here we find ourselves wanting detail. I find it offensive and outrageous that coalition senators stand up and use this taking note debate to try and imply in some way that it is up to Labor to take up the peace march. No-one else is going to do it, so of course we will, and we will hold this coalition accountable. But the coalition is the government and they have no right to take Australians into war; they have no right to stand there and say, `We're just doing this without any authority, without any justification,' and flying in the face of the UN resolution. Yes, there has been more information and Simon Crean, the Labor leader, made it extremely clear today that we take that evidence extremely seriously. It adds to the case and it should go to Hans Blix for consideration. But let us use those UN processes; let us not stare them down and ignore them and ignore those protocols; let us not side with George Bush and argue that we stay by his side at all costs; let us respect the fact that we are a proud nation of Australian people that has the right to determine our own future, to determine our involvement in a conflict in whatever circumstances are presented before us. That is how it should be. That is not how it is under the coalition and it will be a very long time before the people of Australia will forgive the coalition government for what they have done here.
This issue is not going to go away. I know that this evening there will be another event where people will have the opportunity to debate the moral issues. It will be a public forum hosted by Phillip Adams at Old Parliament House, where we can have the opportunity, as we did in the debate here, to talk about those moral issues, to talk about that decision making process and the grounds to which we should look if we are going to commit to a conflict. This is the kind of considered debate, such as the one we had here in parliament the other day, where we should explore all of these issues. And so it goes on. 
I implore the coalition to take up the opportunity that the opposition has presented to them in question time to come clean. Unfortunately for them we now have a two-week recess when they will not have that opportunity. That opportunity was missed—it has gone. I have to say that that will only reinforce to the Australian population that this government are hiding behind decisions they have made, backtracking, being ambiguous about their answers, obfuscating the facts and so far have failed to come up with the truth to satisfy the growing demand and clamour of the Australian people.

"Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",LP,2003-02-06,"—I present two government responses to committee reports as listed on today's Order of Business at item 14. In accordance with the usual practice, I seek leave to incorporate the documents in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The documents read as follows—
Report of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee
Inquiry into Electromagnetic Radiation
Government Response
Introduction
The Committee's report was tabled on 4 May 2001. There are a total of thirteen recommendations listed in the main body of the Report, eight of which are attributed to the Committee Chair and the remaining five to the Committee as a whole. 
In addition to the main body of the report, there is a section entitled `Government Members' Comments' in which the Government members of the Committee comment upon the Report and the recommendations, generally opposing the recommendations of the Committee Chair.
A minority report by Labor Senators makes eleven separate recommendations and is highly critical of the report.
Recommendations in Body of the Report
The Government makes the following comments in relation to the recommendations in the body of the report:
Recommendation 2.1
The Committee Chair recommends that, particularly in the light of recent reports on the links between powerlines, radio towers and leukaemia, additional research into extremely low frequencies and TV/radio tower exposure should be encouraged.
The Government agrees with the commentary from the Government members of the Committee that little evidence was presented during the course of the inquiry concerning exposure to extremely low frequency (ELF) fields and that this part of the recommendation falls outside the scope of this inquiry.
The second part of recommendation 2.1 is concerned with the incidence of cancer in people living near to radio or television transmitters. The Government supports research into electromagnetic radiation (EMR) through the Australian Electromagnetic Energy (EME) Program and the research component administered by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).
Recommendation 2.2
The Committee Chair recommends that precautionary measures for the placement of powerlines be up-graded to include wide buffer zones, and undergrounding and shielding cables where practicable.
As with recommendation 2.1 this falls outside the scope of this inquiry. 
The Government notes the current prudent avoidance approach adopted by the electricity industry in the design and operation of its electricity generation, transmission and distribution systems. 
Recommendation 2.3
The Committee recommends that based on a growing body of research that provides evidence of biological effects, the Commonwealth Government considers developing material to advise parents and children of the potential risks associated with mobile phone use.
Studies involving exposure of animals and cellular systems to low level radiofrequency fields have sometimes shown biological effects. The evidence supporting a positive association (between the exposure and the effect), however, is inconsistent and further confirmatory research needs to be carried out. Nevertheless, the Government acknowledges that gaps in the current scientific knowledge are sufficient to justify a precautionary approach. 
With regard to educational material, a package of information relating to EMR, mobile phones and mobile phone base stations has been developed by the Australian Communications Authority (ACA) in consultation with the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) and other government organisations. The package includes:  
·	a poster (Mobile Phone Base Stations and EMR);
·	a fact sheet (Installation of Telecommunications Facilities—a Guide for Consumers);and
·	two booklets(Mobile phones...your health and radiofrequency EMR and Telecommunications Facilities—Information for Local Councils) and other related information.
The package was mailed to all Australian Local Government councils and to all Australian primary and secondary schools in early June 2001.
Also, the ACA and representatives of mobile phone manufacturers reached an agreement in August 2000 that industry should make available information on the specific absorption rate (SAR) of cellular mobile phones. An international SAR test standard has been finalised and mobile phone manufacturers have begun testing new products using this protocol. Handset specific SAR information is made available in the product manuals, or in a separate brochure in the box, for all new mobile phone models released in Australia. Information included provides the following handset details: 
·	the phone is a low-power radio transmitter and receiver;
·	it meets specific guidelines for RF exposure; and 
·	the measured SAR level.
This information is also available on the product manufacturer's web-site.
Recommendation 2.4
The Committee recommends that shielding and hands-free devices are tested, labelled for their effectiveness and regulated by standards.
In regard to hands-free devices the Government will ensure that ARPANSA and ACA cooperate in the provision of general information to the public on these devices but otherwise supports the view that if individuals are concerned, they can choose to reduce their exposure by using hands-free kits while operating their mobile phone away from the body.
The effectiveness—or otherwise—of shielding devices depends not only on the design features of the device, but on the particular model of mobile phone handset it is used with. Very few shielding devices have been scientifically tested and the Government will ensure that Commonwealth Authorities monitor the claims for and testing of these devices. 
Recommendation 2.5
The Committee Chair recommends that the Government review the Telecommunications (Low-impact Facilities) Determination 1997, and as a precautionary measure, amend it to enable community groups to have greater input into the siting of antenna towers and require their installation to go through normal local government planning processes.
The siting and installation of most telecommunications facilities, including all radiocommunications towers over 5 metres in height, require approval under State or Territory legislation (not Commonwealth legislation), with approvals being handled at a local level. In their consideration of mobile phone tower applications, local councils already typically require community consultation.
The levels of community consultation by carriers have recently been formalised and extended with the finalisation of the `Deployment of Radiocommunications Infrastructure' industry code. As noted by the Government members of the Committee, the development of this Code by the Australian Communications Industry Forum (ACIF) directly addresses Recommendation 2.5.
The Code complements the new limits-based human exposure standard, by requiring telecommunications carriers to consult with the local community and to adopt a precautionary approach in the planning, installing and operating of all radiocommunications infrastructure. The ACIF committee which developed the code was representative of industry and the community and included the ACA as an observer. The code covers:
·	site selection, facility design and operations;
·	notification and consultation processes;
·	health and safety information about radio emissions; and
·	complaints-handling and arbitration.
The ACA will register the Code under section 117 of the Telecommunications Act 1997 (the Act). 
Recommendation 2.6 
The Committee recommends the development of an industry code of practice for handling consumer health complaints.
The Government believes that the establishment of a centralised complaints register is a better way of handling consumer health complaints (see response to Recommendation 2.7).
Recommendation 2.7
The Committee recommends the establishment of a centralised complaints mechanism in ARPANSA or the Department of Health for people to report adverse health effects associated with mobile phone use and other radiofrequency technology, and for the data from this register to be considered by the NHMRC in determining research funding priorities.
The Government is aware of the concerns held by some users of radiofrequency technologies about the possible health effects of such devices. The Government accepts the establishment of a centralised complaints mechanism. It is proposed that ARPANSA will implement and manage a complaints register. The register may identify emerging issues as well as possible activities. This information would be shared with the public and industry (via ARPANSA's website) as well as other Commonwealth agencies.
Recommendation 2.8
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government consider sponsoring conferences on the health effects of radiofrequency radiation along similar lines to that conducted on gene technology.
The Commonwealth Government will consider sponsoring conferences to discuss the health effects of radiofrequency radiation. 
Recommendation 2.9
The Committee Chair recommends that a study into p53 mice be listed as an area of research for which future research applications should be encouraged.
The Government supports the NHMRC process for selection of research for funding. It notes that the Government and Labor Senators did not have any substantial criticisms of the NHMRC processes and that the Report found no evidence that the NHMRC had been deficient or biased in its allocation of the research funds.
Recommendations 3.1 and 3.2
The Committee Chair recommends that the equivalent of $5 for each mobile phone in use be collected annually for this purpose (approximately $40 million) and that the rate be reviewed after a period of five years.
The Committee Chair recommends that funding for maintaining the NHMRC administered research program be provided at $4 million per annum of the $40 million and that the balance be used by the CSIRO to establish a structured program of research and set up a specialised research unit for this purpose.
The Government considers that the present level of research funding dedicated to this field is appropriate. It supports continued research through the ongoing funding system of $1 million per annum, derived from a levy imposed upon the radiocommunication licence fees. The NHMRC is the body best placed to distribute the research funding through its competitive and peer-reviewed processes.
Recommendations 4.1 and 4.2
The Committee Chair recommends that the radiofrequency standard be defined and administered by a process similar to that used by Standards Australia. The Committee Chair recommends that the level of 200 microwatts per square centimetre in the expired Interim Standard (AS/NZS 2772.1(Int):1998) be retained in the Australian Standard.
The Australian/New Zealand Interim Standard (AS/NZS 2772.1 [Int]:1998 ) Radiation Fields— Maximum exposure—3kHz to 300GHz was officially withdrawn by Standards Australia in May 1999. Following the failure of Standards Australia to produce a revised Standard, ARPANSA undertook the development of a new standard: “Radiation Protection Standard—Maximum exposure levels to radiofrequency fields—3kHz to 300 GHz”. The task of drafting the Standard was carried out by an expert Working Group of ARPANSA's Radiation Health Committee (RHC). The new standard was formally released on May 7 2002.
The Standard was developed through ARPANSA's Radiation Health Committee (RHC). The RHC was established under the ARPANS Act to formulate national codes, standards and guidelines for consideration by the Commonwealth, States and Territories. The RHC includes a senior radiation control officer from each State and Territory, an NIR (non-ionising radiation) expert and a public representative. An expert working group of RHC was established to draft the Standard. The expert working group also included community and union representatives. 
The new Standard is in alignment with widely accepted international guidelines but incorporates a number of technical improvements. The Standard includes an improved methodology for determining compliance and offers greater protection against pulsed fields. In addition to the numerical exposure limits, the Standard provides major reviews of the current epidemiology and research on the effects of low level exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic energy. The Standard also adopts a precautionary approach in the protection of the public. The limits in the new Standard are fully defined so as to allow unambiguous interpretation by regulatory bodies. 
There has been broad public consultation on the Standard during its development. The draft Standard was released for public comment last year. All submitted comments were considered by the expert working group during the final revision of the draft Standard. A draft Regulatory Impact Statement for the new Standard was also released for public comment. All submitted comments were considered during the final revision of the statement. The final Regulatory Impact Statement was judged to meet the requirements of the Council of Australian Governments' Principles and Guidelines for National Standard Setting and Regulatory Actions by Ministerial Councils and Standard-setting Bodies (Nov 1997) by the Commonwealth Office of Regulation Review.
The Standard was published by ARPANSA in May 2001. It is intended that the Standard will be prescribed under the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act 1998 as a standard that controlled persons (Commonwealth entities and Commonwealth contractors) must observe and follow. 
ARPANSA has also published `An Explanatory Question and Answer Guide to the Standard'. The guide provides a clear interpretation of the technical subject area covered by the Standard. Both electronic and printed versions of the Guide are available from ARPANSA.
Recommendations of Labor Senators (page 187 of the report) 
The Government makes the following comments in relation to the Labor Senators' recommendations:
Research:
Labor Senators conclude there is justification to some of the criticisms of past studies of the physical and health effects of EMR. Accordingly, Labor Senators support ongoing research into potential adverse effects of EMR. (Chapter 4, p 209)
The Government accepts the conclusion clearly reached by the Government and Labor Senators that health effects due to electromagnetic radiation exposure at levels below those that produce heating effects have not been established. The Government, therefore, supports the recommendation of ongoing research into potential adverse effects of EMR.
Labor Senators note that in the light of the limited resources available for research into health issues where causes are identifiable, and given the existing inconclusiveness of the many completed studies into EMR, the funding available for EMR research does not appear to be inadequate. (Chapter 3, p 196)
The Government has continued the ongoing level of funding ($1 million annually) derived from a levy imposed upon the radiocommunications licence fees. 
Also see response to recommendation 3.1 and 3.2. 
Labor Senators conclude that there does not seem to be an identifiable problem with expenditure of funding by NHMRC on the evidence. (Chapter 3, p 195)
The Government supports the present NHMRC process in determining research-funding priorities.
Also see response to recommendation 3.2. 
Standards Setting:
Labor believes that Standards Australia should be the primary body for setting standards. However, in this case, Labor Senators conclude that Standards Australia failed to achieve an outcome. This is because the structure of Standards Australia in this instance allowed a small proportion of participants to exercise a veto on any outcome. Accordingly, this ongoing failure warranted the transfer of responsibility for setting a standard to an alternate body such as the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA). (Chapter 5, p 217)
Labor Senators find no substantial criticism of the transfer of the responsibility for setting a new Australian standard for electromagnetic emissions to ARPANSA. (Chapter 6, p 226)
Labor Senators support a standard setting process consistent with existing science on the health effects of EMR, and ongoing research into potential adverse health effects arising from non-thermal levels of exposure. (Chapter 4, p 206)
Labor Senators support the inclusion of precautionary measures in the new standard, and consider the approach taken in the draft standard to be sensible. (Chapter 6, p 226)
Given that the draft RF standard produced by ARPANSA incorporates a precautionary approach, and recognises the need for ongoing research, Labor Senators conclude that there is no justification for this Committee to recommend alternative courses of action. (Chapter 4, p 207)
Labor Senators conclude that there is currently no scientific evidence to support the proposition that maintaining lower permissible levels of RF radiation in the standards will decrease the potential for health effects, and that therefore there is no compelling scientific argument for such action at this time. However, Labor Senators support ongoing research in this area. (Chapter 5, pp 219-220)
The above comments relate to the draft ARPANSA standard published in March 2001. The final Standard was published on May 7, 2002. The Standard sets maximum exposure levels to radiofrequency fields. The Standard draws from the most recent research and accords with the guidelines of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection. It includes a precautionary statement designed to minimise unnecessary exposure of the public to radiofrequency fields. The Government supported the approach taken by ARPANSA and a detailed description of the process is given in response to Recommendations 4.1 and 4.2.
Other:
Labor Senators endorse the ACA's role in monitoring the dissemination of information to the public, and seek that the ACA table 12 monthly statements in the parliament which detail industry adherence to this voluntary undertaking and public or consumer complaints or comments about this process. (Chapter 4, p 208)
The Government supports the role of the ACA and its monitoring of information dissemination to the public. 
Although acknowledging the problem of inclusion of frequencies employed by the metals industry in the draft RF standard, Labor Senators consider that the issue would more appropriately be raised in the standard setting process being undertaken by ARPANSA. (Chapter 5, p 220)
The Government agrees that this issue can best be resolved through the ARPANSA Standard setting process. ARPANSA, through their Radiation Health Committee, could also consider developing Codes of Practice if the implementation of the RF Standard causes difficulties in any industrial sector.

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON THE NATIONAL CAPITAL AND EXTERNAL TERRITORIES
RISKY BUSINESS
INQUIRY INTO THE TENDER PROCESS FOLLOWED IN THE SALE OF THE CHRISTMAS ISLAND CASINO AND RESORT
THE HON WILSON TUCKEY MP
MINISTER FOR REGIONAL SERVICES, TERRITORIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT
February 2003
INTRODUCTION
The Senate referred the inquiry into the tender process followed in the sale of the Christmas Island Casino and Resort to the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories on 8 November 2000. The Committee presented its report to Parliament in September 2001. The report contains six recommendations. There is also a dissenting report from the non-government members of the committee containing a further three recommendations.
The directors of Christmas Island Resort Pty Ltd (CIR), the former developer of the Christmas Island Resort and holder of a casino licence under the Casino Control Ordinance 1988, closed the casino on 23 April 1998 because it was no longer economically feasible to operate.
The casino licence was cancelled by the then Minister on 28 July 1998 on the grounds that CIR had failed to meet its financial commitments to its creditors and its employees.
On 29 July 1998 the Federal Court appointed Mr Jeff Herbert as Receiver and Manager to CIR. Mr Herbert was subsequently appointed by the Federal Court as Liquidator on 8 December 1998.
The Liquidator commenced a tender process for the sale of the Christmas Island Casino and Resort in February 1999. As the casino licence had been cancelled, the tender process conducted by the liquidator was to sell the resort lease and other leases held by CIR. Any application for a casino licence by the successful tenderer or any other party would need to be dealt with separately and in accordance with stringent approval procedures set out in the Casino Control Ordinance 1988.
The Christmas Island Resort was sold to Soft Star Pty Ltd, an associate company of Asia Pacific Space Centre Pty Ltd, on 5 May 2000. While Soft Star Pty Ltd have publicly stated their intention to reopen the resort and casino, this has not yet happened.
Summary
The basis of the inquiry appears to have been related to the severe economic effect that the closure of the Casino and its subsequent liquidation had on the Island's residents and its economy. There was also concern that the tender process did not result in the reopening of the casino and resort.
The Committee's inquiry looked at the tender process conducted by the court appointed Liquidator, and matters associated with the outcome of that process. The Committee also examined a range of broader issues which they felt would bear directly on the future development of the Island. 
The Committee's report is critical of some aspects of the tender process, although they did acknowledge the difficulties experienced by the Liquidator during the tender process and that his primary obligation was to maximise the proceeds from the sale of the assets for the benefit of the creditors of Christmas Island Resort Pty Ltd.
The Committee acknowledged that the Commonwealth did not have commercial or statutory obligations within the tender process, however they were critical of the Commonwealth for not playing a more participative role in the process.
The report appears to contain second hand information from some witnesses who were not in a position to give direct evidence. Inclusion of such material in the report without commenting on it or adopting it, may leave readers with the impression that these matters might be true.
All of the Committee's recommendations relate to further action for the Commonwealth to pursue, some of which the Commonwealth has already commenced.
There are a number of aspects in the dissenting report, which the Government is either not in a position to, or believes are not appropriate to pursue.
THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE
Recommendation 1 (Chapter 4): The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth, where appropriate, take a more active approach in the provision of timely and efficient support, by clarifying and streamlining processes for the deliverance of administrative and policy assistance to the Christmas Island community.
Agree in principle:
The Commonwealth strives to continuously improve the timeliness, efficiency and appropriateness of the programmes and services it delivers to the benefit of the Christmas Island community, both directly and through arrangements made with Western Australian agencies. The establishment of the Administrator's Advisory Committee (AAC) on Christmas Island is an avenue for the Commonwealth to provide and discuss information with community representatives on a regular and formal basis.
The Commonwealth Grants Commission Report on the Indian Ocean Territories 1999 concluded that most Commonwealth, State and local government type services are provided at levels equivalent to those found in comparable communities. The improvements identified in that report's recommendations have been taken into account in the Commonwealth's delivery of services to the Territory and further improvements continue to be made in the spirit of this report as the opportunity arises.
Recommendation 2 (Chapter 5): The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth formulate a proposal to underwrite the payment of entitlements owed to former employees of the Christmas Island Casino and Resort.
The Committee also recommends that the Commonwealth underwrite the payment of salaries and entitlements owed to former employees of the Christmas Island Laundry Pty Ltd, not exceeding the total sum of $20,000.00.
Disagree:
The former employees of Christmas Island Resort Pty Ltd and the Christmas Island Laundry Pty Ltd are not eligible to participate in the employee entitlements schemes which are administered through the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations. The Employee Entitlements Support Scheme (EESS) applied to employees whose employment was terminated due to insolvency or bankruptcy between 1 January 2000 and 11 September 2001. The General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme (GEERS) and the Special Employee Entitlements Scheme for Ansett group employees (SEESA) apply to employees whose employment was terminated due to insolvency or bankruptcy on or after 12 September 2001. These schemes do not extend to former employees of Christmas Island Resort Pty Ltd or Christmas Island Laundry Pty Ltd because their employment ceased prior to 1 January 2000.
The Government shares the concern of the Committee that the former employees of the Christmas Island Resort Pty Ltd have been unable to receive their entitlements because of legal action against the validity of the Liquidator's appointment.
The Government notes orders made in the Supreme Court of Western Australia in August 2002 dismissing the appeal by the former Directors of Christmas Island Resort Pty Ltd and further notes that the liquidator of Christmas Island Resort Pty Ltd now intends to finalise liquidation.
The Commonwealth notes the Committee's conclusion that the Commonwealth is under no legal obligation to underwrite the entitlements owed to former employees of the Christmas Island Laundry Pty Ltd. 
Recommendation 3 (Chapter 5): The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth seek to finalise and implement an operational agreement with Soft Star Pty Ltd to replace the original agreement previously in place with CIR. The Committee further recommends that items specified within the new agreement include:
·	details of any proposed companies that may be contracted for the management and operation of the casino and resort;
·	a timetable for the refurbishment and re-opening of the casino and resort, if that is the direction of Soft Star; 
·	an administrative framework for the operation of the casino, including a gaming tax rate, Community Benefit Fee and a jurisdiction for any applicable casino control legislation.
Disagree:
The Original Agreement (the Agreement) between the Commonwealth, Christmas Island Resort Pty Ltd (CIR) and others was a development agreement providing for the construction and operation of the resort and casino and associated infrastructure and the grant of a casino licence on completion. These obligations were completed so the terms of the Agreement were discharged by performance.
The Commonwealth is not in a position to compel Soft Star Pty Ltd to enter into an agreement to reopen and operate the casino. Under the tender process, Soft Star Pty Ltd purchased the balance of a 99 year Crown lease and improvements. The licence to operate a casino was not for sale as the licence had been cancelled in 1998. Whilst the purpose clause in the lease provides for a “hotel/casino and ancillary thereto”, this is permissive, not mandatory.
Soft Star Pty Ltd has publicly stated that it is the company's intention to refurbish and reopen the casino when the economic climate is suitable. When Soft Star Pty Ltd is in a position to apply for a Casino licence, it will be required to comply with the stringent approval procedures for the issue of a casino licence as set out in the Casino Control Ordinance 1988.
All details relating to the management and operation of the casino are governed by the Casino Control Ordinance 1988. In accordance with the Ordinance, applicants for a casino licence are required to provide extensive information on their business affairs and experience, expertise and associated organisations so that the Casino Surveillance Authority can conduct financial and probity checks to ensure applicants are suitable organisations to be associated with a casino.
Recommendation 4 (Chapter 5): The Committee recommends that conversion of the Crown leases of the resort from leasehold to freehold title be pursued, provided that the Commonwealth undertake the following:
·	a formal consultation process with the Shire of Christmas Island; and
·	incorporation of community concerns, where practicable, into the application of certain covenants and conditions on the freehold title, as is commercially appropriate, in order to ensure that the property may be used as a casino and resort and ancillary thereto.
Agree in principle:
The Commonwealth will continue to liaise with the Shire and other community groups about the future of the resort/casino through the Administrator's Advisory Committee and the Community Consultative Committee.
Whilst a change in the type of land tenure does not formally require approval from the Shire of Christmas Island under the relevant planning legislation, the Shire will be consulted and kept informed of any changes. It is not necessary to register covenants on the land to permit the land and improvements to be used for a casino because this is covered in the draft Town Planning Scheme. 
Recommendation 5 (Chapter 5): The Committee recommends that, in the conduct of all future tender processes on the Island, the Commonwealth take active steps to ensure that all necessary financial and probity checks are comprehensively conducted before agreeing to the assignment of Crown leases.
Agree in principle:
Any tender processes on the Island conducted by the Commonwealth for the assignment of Crown leases in the future will take into account the Committee's recommendation. Should Soft Star Pty Ltd or an associate apply for a casino licence, rigorous probity checks will be conducted by the Casino Surveillance Authority.
Recommendation 6 (Chapter 6): The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth negotiate terms and conditions for the provision of vehicular access to Waterfall Bay for members of the Christmas Island community.
Agree in principle:
The Government agrees that it would be desirable for members of the Christmas Island community to have vehicular access to Waterfall Bay. The consent of Soft Star Pty Ltd would be required to create a public access route through the lease. The Government notes that the Shire of Christmas Island is in contact with Soft Star Pty Ltd in regard to such access. 
RESPONSE TO DISSENTING REPORT OF NON-GOVERNMENT MEMBERS
Recommendation 1: Non-government members recommend that if Soft Star Pty Ltd does not take demonstrable and significant steps towards the re-opening of the facility as a casino and resort within twelve months, the Commonwealth revoke the lease for the property and re-assign it to someone who will re-open the facility as a casino and resort.
Disagree:
The Government fully supports any action by Soft Star Pty Ltd to reopen the resort facility, however the Government is not in a position to terminate the lease in the event that Soft Star Pty Ltd does not take steps to reopen this facility within twelve months. See response to Recommendation 3 above.
Recommendation 2: Non-government members recommend that the leases for the Christmas Island Casino and Resort not be converted to freehold title.
We further recommend that if conversion of the leases to freehold title is pursued, the Commonwealth consult with, and seek the approval of the Shire of Christmas Island before any steps towards converting the leases to freehold are taken.
Disagree:
See response to Recommendation 4 above.
Recommendation 3: Non-government members of the Committee believe that, henceforth, no decisions or changes relating to the legal status or administrative processes of Christmas Island and its residents, be made by the Commonwealth without full consultation with the Christmas Island community through the Shire of Christmas Island.
Agree in principle:
Consultation is undertaken with the Christmas Island community through various methods, however two formal mechanisms which have been established are:
The Community Consultative Committee, which has been in place since the introduction of the law reform process in 1992. 
The Administrator's Advisory Committee, which was set up in 1999 to consider broader public policy issues affecting the social and economic well-being of the residents of Christmas Island.
The Shire of Christmas Island is represented on both these Committees and the Commonwealth provides funding to the Shire to undertake consultation and information services through the Community Consultative Committee or by other means.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reports: Government Responses</title>,Committees,21,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-02-06,"—Yesterday the Senate required that any submissions by the Department of Defence to the environment impact assessment for a national radioactive waste repository in South Australia be tabled before 4 p.m. today. The time frame for the tabling was unrealistically short. Nevertheless, I have been able to revisit relevant documentation.
The Department of Defence has consulted closely with the Department of Education, Science and Training about the location of a national radioactive waste repository. Defence also has worked closely with the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, who oversighted the preparation of the environmental impact statements. However, there was no formal public submission to the environmental impact statement process. Defence's input to DEST took the form of written interdepartmental advice. Traditionally, governments have regarded such advices as confidential and have declined to publish them. I do not intend to depart from that practice. DEST published its final EIS on 23 January. I shall be responding to Senator Kemp during the 30-day period for comment following publication of the EIS.",SENATE,<title>SOUTH AUSTRALIA: NATIONAL RADIOACTIVE WASTE REPOSITORY</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,22,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2003-02-06,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document tabled earlier today.
That report, which was tabled in September 2001, resulted from an inquiry into the tender process followed in the sale of the now ever-famous Christmas Island casino and resort. The inquiry came about because there was a need for a very close look at the conduct of the tender process, the outcome and the consequences for the people on Christmas Island. People on Christmas Island have waited many months for the government's response.  
As always, the federal government has not let us down when it comes to responding to needs on Christmas Island. Absolutely nothing at all in the response will solve any concerns that were raised in the inquiry, recognise that there are still outstanding problems and concerns or even acknowledge— this is the area on which I want to concentrate—that some 200 people on that island are still owed entitlements as a result of that casino being closed. The government's response really endorses government members' sentiments in the original inquiry. It has taken no time or effort to look at some of the problems that are raised in the report, to acknowledge in some way that they exist or to show that it is prepared to do anything about it. 
Very briefly, the history of this matter is that the Christmas Island casino was passed into the hands of the liquidators in about July 1998. There were flaws in the tender process in that the deadlines for the tenders were extended a number of times. In the inquiry there was much evidence that the final amount for which that casino was sold is questionable: at the end of the day, Soft Star Pty Ltd bought the casino from the government for $5.7 million, whereas we know that another company, ComsWinfair, had tendered $11.5 million. ComsWinfair was the company that the people on the island preferred to back. The people on the island believed that it had the best credentials to keep that casino up and running. During the inquiry it struck me as very peculiar that answers from the government were not forthcoming as to why, when you had an offer of $11.5 million, you would finally sell off the casino at less than half that price—just over $5 million. Of course, it came to pass that the people who bought the casino suggested to the government that they would be able to open the Asia Pacific Space Centre on Christmas Island.
I have no doubt in my mind that Minister Macdonald was well and truly behind the tender process and the sale of this casino to the point where it was assured that APSC would be able to get the casino and its premises in return for a sign-off on the space base and in return for them conning this government into believing that they would use that space base for accommodation and eventually reopen the casino. The casino has never been reopened—and I will get to that—but it has been refurbished, and it is used for accommodation on the island. There are probably APSC people staying in it and using it as overnight accommodation. The APSC have never sought to reopen that facility as a casino; they have never applied for a casino licence; they have never shown any intention whatsoever to reopen it again as a casino—despite numerous public announcements that they were intending to do so. We know, and this inquiry proves it, that that was a condition of the sale.
There was a recommendation in this report that there should be a time line on that condition—that a casino should be operated within a certain period of time. If that did not happen, the Commonwealth would have to seek further discussions with APSC. That suggestion has simply been whitewashed in this government's response. If the casino is never opened in the 99-year lease that APSC has over that land, it would seem from this response that the government does not care—it has simply washed its hands of it. 
Why is it so important? In a place like Christmas Island, it generated many hundreds of jobs and created a very stable economic climate for the small community— very important and serious considerations. So there is no indication in this government's response that they would push APSC to reopen the casino as a casino or do anything about the fact that they may never choose to reopen it.
Let me turn to the workers at the casino and the people on the island. There are two matters and the first is the issue of the salaries and entitlements that are owed to the former employees of the Christmas Island Laundry Pty Ltd. An amount of $20,000 is outstanding to five laundry workers. It has been confirmed that the money from the sale of the assets of that Christmas Island laundry is in the hands of the Christmas Island administration—that is, this Commonwealth government has that $20,000 and those five workers have still not been paid their entitlements. There is no acknowledgement in this government's response that it believes in any way that it is its responsibility to hand over the money that is duly entitled to the workers. In the response there are a couple of paragraphs of information which we already know. We know that these employees are not entitled to support under the Employee Entitlements Support Scheme because they were made redundant before 1 January 2000. The government's response simply tells us something we already know. 
During the inquiry and in the report which was tabled we asked that this government pay out those laundry workers. I think it would be fair to say that the people on this island were hoping, beyond all belief, that the government would at least acknowledge the ongoing work over the last 4½ years to get the $20,000 that is owed to these five people, let alone the payment that is due to other workers. There are 300 former casino employees that are on the island. They are being denied their entitlements pending the settlement of the very complicated dispute between the former owners and the liquidator. We know that that dispute was resolved through the courts in August last year. Because these employees were not entitled to support under the scheme, as members of this committee we pursued the Commonwealth government to underwrite the payment, to pay these people their entitlements and the wages they were due and for the Commonwealth to seek payment back from the liquidator. It is not beyond the means of this government to do that. There is goodwill on the part of the people, but they want their entitlements. 
This government has no goodwill in wanting to address that situation. There is no excuse why the money owed to the laundry workers has not been paid to them. This government could have shown goodwill towards the people on this island and it could have paid the 300 former casino workers their entitlements. This government could have sought that payment as a liability from the liquidator. Once again, we have seen a federal government that seeks to use and abuse the community of Christmas Island for its own political goodwill but, at the end of the day, it turns its back on the people who rely on them for their everyday needs and requirements. I am not overly excited about this response. It is what I expected.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2003-02-06,"—I would also like to take note this afternoon of the government's response to the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories report. I note that the committee inquiry was presented to this chamber more than a year ago and that it has taken some time for the government to respond to those findings and recommendations. I think that has only further exacerbated the difficulties that those people on the island who have been affected by the situation have been experiencing.
The island casino and resort were a concept from the 1980s. The casino itself came to fruition between November 1993 and April 1998. During that time, it had extraordinary support and it had a tremendously positive impact on the community and economy of the island, bearing in mind that much of the money which came into the casino during that time was from Indonesia and not necessarily from Australians directly. During its operation, an estimated $11 million per year flowed into the local community and local economy—an extraordinary amount. That included salaries, taxes and land rates. Some 350 locals were able to enjoy employment as a result of the venue. Given the lifespan of the existing phosphate mine on the island, the casino and the resort were a tremendous boost to local jobs and to local families. It was an added tourist attraction to what is an interesting tourist destination. But there are significant challenges, both financial and geographical, for those people who may wish to venture to Christmas Island. 
As the Democrats' representative on the committee at the time, along with other committee members I was to learn of the exquisite and unique biodiversity of the island, which are a consequence of the ancient evolution and isolation of what is a volcanic outcrop in a tropical region. It is also in close proximity to Indonesia, in particular Jakarta, for added tourist interest. 
All those things, accompanied with the multicultural nature of the 1,300 people living in the island community and the exceptional fishing and scuba diving opportunities, make the island ideal for tourism and for ecotourism in particular. The local island community is more than willing to encourage and facilitate this, knowing full well what that means for the longevity of the island community and the need for a reliable economic base in the wake of the waning mining resource. 
For that reason, the issue of closure, deterioration and hopefully resuscitation of the island resort and casino complex is of profound importance to these island folk and it is of interest to many in my home state of Western Australia who are aware of the island's tourism and commerce opportunities and who are keen to maximise those in a Western Australia-Christmas Island liaison. Regrettably, with the collapse of Ansett Airlines last year, travel opportunities to this very remote part of the world have become even more limited. For that reason, I am very keen to see the revival of the resort and I recognise the tremendous passion of the island community to also see that that goal is realised. 
When the project stumbled to a close in 1998, the liquidation process was begun but it was very protracted and complicated, to the point where the liquidator brought the process to an end, selling the complex to Soft Star Pty Ltd, a company we now know to be associated with Asia Pacific Space Centre, which is developing a satellite launching facility on the island, an issue which has itself been controversial. However, community and corporate concern and disquiet about the tender process in relation to the sale of the casino and resort saw the Senate refer the matter to the committee for inquiry and the committee table its findings and recommendations almost 15 months ago—not a year ago as I said previously.
As Senator Crossin said, the failure of the casino saw many employees lose their entitlements. The committee recommended that the Commonwealth underwrite a proposal to redress that, as well as underwrite the salaries and entitlements of the workers at the Christmas Island laundry who were also dudded by the collapse of the resort. However, the government has said no to that recommendation, which was one of the few recommendations which had strong committee support, including from government members. In its submission today, the government has argued that it is under no legal obligation to see out the entitlements and payments of these employees because of the date of the introduction of the legislation and the date when the employees lost their jobs.
I would argue that while the legal foundation may not be there, the moral foundation is there. Given the strong support from the Commonwealth to breathe life into the resort and casino complex in its early days, and recognising the particular and unique difficulties of the folk who live and work on the island, not least of which is that the current basis and essential lynchpin of the economy—the phosphate mine—has a lifespan that will not exceed the next 15 or 20 years at most, there is a desperate and absolutely essential need to find some other reliable form of economic base for that community.
As it stands, Christmas Island has been controversial in recent months because of the issue relating to asylum seekers and what that means for Australian intervention and protection of borders, and in relation to the proposal to build detention centres on the island. Some in the community have welcomed that, but many members of the community have expressed grave concern about what that may mean in the long term. They certainly do not want to build an economic foundation on that. 
One of the stronger recommendations and the principal recommendation from non-government senators on the committee—myself included—states:
Non-government members recommended that if Soft Star Pty Ltd—
the winning tenderer—
does not take demonstrable and significant steps towards the re-opening of the facility as a casino and resort within twelve months, the Commonwealth revoke the lease for the property and re-assign it to someone who will re-open the facility as a casino and resort. 
There is a great passion for that amongst the island community. It was manna from heaven for them when such an exotic and interesting proposal came about. It was unexpected but very welcome and it provided strongly for the community in both social and economic terms. The island folk expressed very strongly to those of us on the committee who visited the island for the committee hearing their great desire to see it reopen because it breathes such life into the community. They expressed their anxiety, frustration and desperation at seeing it sit there doing nothing and deteriorating. Given its position perched on the cliff facing out into the ocean, it is open to the weather, to strong winds and to the salty air. Just from walking around the complex as it is today you can see the rust and the damage and deterioration that is taking place. It seems an extraordinary waste given that it is hard to believe that a casino and resort complex could not succeed under the right circumstances. It is extremely unusual for a casino resort complex to fail anywhere. One of the interesting elements which the committee inquiry did not explore was why it did fail.
Given the extraordinary and unique opportunities that Christmas Island presents, we must give serious consideration to who owns the lease now. While we know who owns the lease, we must look at what they propose to do with it. It seems that in the short to medium term nothing is being done with it, and that is a great disappointment. The recommendation from the non-government senators was responsible and it should have been adopted by the government.
Having said that, we recognise the difficulty that the island community now faces given that the government is not going to respond to the key recommendations, which I think were the responsible ones from non-government senators. It is a great disappointment that the government has not come to the party in terms of paying out those employees from the casino and the laundry who are owed money. As Senator Crossin said, we are talking about only $20,000 amongst four people. I feel that if the government can find money—I am not sure whether it was hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars—to give to the failed company run by the Prime Minister's brother, Mr Stan Howard, the very least it can do is find the $20,000 for some battling workers on Christmas Island which has a failing economy.
It is a disappointing response from the government. The committee investigation was thorough. I would have thought that, at the very least, as some of the key recommendations have come from senators and government members they would have attracted a positive response, but that is not to be the case. It is my great hope that we can see the community in and of itself—which is the community's desire—breathe life back into a potential economic boom for the island which will attract the people who are needed to maintain the people who continue to want to live there despite the difficulty of the foundation mining industry being in decline.

The local island community is more than willing to encourage and facilitate this, knowing full well what that means for the longevity of the island community and the need for a reliable economic base in the wake of the waning mining resource. 
For that reason, the issue of closure, deterioration and hopefully resuscitation of the island resort and casino complex is of profound importance to these island folk and it is of interest to many in my home state of Western Australia who are aware of the island's tourism and commerce opportunities and who are keen to maximise those in a Western Australia-Christmas Island liaison. Regrettably, with the collapse of Ansett Airlines last year, travel opportunities to this very remote part of the world have become even more limited. For that reason, I am very keen to see the revival of the resort and I recognise the tremendous passion of the island community to also see that that goal is realised. 
When the project stumbled to a close in 1998, the liquidation process was begun but it was very protracted and complicated, to the point where the liquidator brought the process to an end, selling the complex to Soft Star Pty Ltd, a company we now know to be associated with Asia Pacific Space Centre, which is developing a satellite launching facility on the island, an issue which has itself been controversial. However, community and corporate concern and disquiet about the tender process in relation to the sale of the casino and resort saw the Senate refer the matter to the committee for inquiry and the committee table its findings and recommendations almost 15 months ago—not a year ago as I said previously.
As Senator Crossin said, the failure of the casino saw many employees lose their entitlements. The committee recommended that the Commonwealth underwrite a proposal to redress that, as well as underwrite the salaries and entitlements of the workers at the Christmas Island laundry who were also dudded by the collapse of the resort. However, the government has said no to that recommendation, which was one of the few recommendations which had strong committee support, including from government members. In its submission today, the government has argued that it is under no legal obligation to see out the entitlements and payments of these employees because of the date of the introduction of the legislation and the date when the employees lost their jobs.
I would argue that while the legal foundation may not be there, the moral foundation is there. Given the strong support from the Commonwealth to breathe life into the resort and casino complex in its early days, and recognising the particular and unique difficulties of the folk who live and work on the island, not least of which is that the current basis and essential lynchpin of the economy—the phosphate mine—has a lifespan that will not exceed the next 15 or 20 years at most, there is a desperate and absolutely essential need to find some other reliable form of economic base for that community.
As it stands, Christmas Island has been controversial in recent months because of the issue relating to asylum seekers and what that means for Australian intervention and protection of borders, and in relation to the proposal to build detention centres on the island. Some in the community have welcomed that, but many members of the community have expressed grave concern about what that may mean in the long term. They certainly do not want to build an economic foundation on that. 
One of the stronger recommendations and the principal recommendation from non-government senators on the committee—myself included—states:
Non-government members recommended that if Soft Star Pty Ltd—
the winning tenderer—
does not take demonstrable and significant steps towards the re-opening of the facility as a casino and resort within twelve months, the Commonwealth revoke the lease for the property and re-assign it to someone who will re-open the facility as a casino and resort. 
There is a great passion for that amongst the island community. It was manna from heaven for them when such an exotic and interesting proposal came about. It was unexpected but very welcome and it provided strongly for the community in both social and economic terms. The island folk expressed very strongly to those of us on the committee who visited the island for the committee hearing their great desire to see it reopen because it breathes such life into the community. They expressed their anxiety, frustration and desperation at seeing it sit there doing nothing and deteriorating. Given its position perched on the cliff facing out into the ocean, it is open to the weather, to strong winds and to the salty air. Just from walking around the complex as it is today you can see the rust and the damage and deterioration that is taking place. It seems an extraordinary waste given that it is hard to believe that a casino and resort complex could not succeed under the right circumstances. It is extremely unusual for a casino resort complex to fail anywhere. One of the interesting elements which the committee inquiry did not explore was why it did fail.
Given the extraordinary and unique opportunities that Christmas Island presents, we must give serious consideration to who owns the lease now. While we know who owns the lease, we must look at what they propose to do with it. It seems that in the short to medium term nothing is being done with it, and that is a great disappointment. The recommendation from the non-government senators was responsible and it should have been adopted by the government.
Having said that, we recognise the difficulty that the island community now faces given that the government is not going to respond to the key recommendations, which I think were the responsible ones from non-government senators. It is a great disappointment that the government has not come to the party in terms of paying out those employees from the casino and the laundry who are owed money. As Senator Crossin said, we are talking about only $20,000 amongst four people. I feel that if the government can find money—I am not sure whether it was hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars—to give to the failed company run by the Prime Minister's brother, Mr Stan Howard, the very least it can do is find the $20,000 for some battling workers on Christmas Island which has a failing economy.
It is a disappointing response from the government. The committee investigation was thorough. I would have thought that, at the very least, as some of the key recommendations have come from senators and government members they would have attracted a positive response, but that is not to be the case. It is my great hope that we can see the community in and of itself—which is the community's desire—breathe life back into a potential economic boom for the island which will attract the people who are needed to maintain the people who continue to want to live there despite the difficulty of the foundation mining industry being in decline.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2003-02-06,"—I seek leave to present a delegation report and to make a short statement in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the United States of America and the European Institutions, which took place from 1 to 13 September 2002. I seek leave to make a statement relating to the matter.
Leave granted.
—I am pleased to table this report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the United States and European Institutions within Belgium, a delegation in which I participated in September last year, and I acknowledge that Mr Speaker is tabling and speaking to a similar report in the other place. 
The delegation was led by Mr Speaker, the Hon. Neil Andrew, and, apart from myself, also included Mrs Kay Hull, Senator Kerry O'Brien, Senator Ross Lightfoot, Mr Wayne Swan and Mr Barry Wakelin. The visit to the United States of America was part of an ongoing parliamentary program of biennial visits to the United States, with the purpose of reviewing any issues affecting the bilateral relationship and renewing parliamentary contacts. The delegation visited Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington and New York. In San Francisco our program included briefings on the information technology industry, and in the Silicon Valley we visited companies with branches in Australia. The delegation also visited the wine growing area of the Napa Valley and met with the Chairman of Southcorp Wines, Mr John Gay, who confirmed the expanding success of Australian wine sales to the United States.
In Washington, the delegation discussed with the Office of the United States Trade Representative and with various farming organisations the direction of United States trade policy and the impact on Australia of the proposed Australia-US free trade agreement. Our delegation also took the opportunity to express support for further multilateral trade liberalisation through the Doha Round of trade negotiations within the WTO.
We also met with the then Senate Republican minority leader, Senator Trent Lott, to discuss international relations and, in particular, the situation with Iraq. The delegation's visit coincided with a special session of Congress held in New York City to commemorate the thousands of lives lost in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. We were taken to see the ground zero site, an experience that touched and saddened all of us.
The delegation then travelled to Belgium to meet with representatives of several important European institutions and members of the European Parliament. There have been regular biennial visits between our two parliaments, which have served to strengthen and emphasise our support for continuing contact with the European Parliament and European institutions. The delegation was able to assess the European Union's evaluation of the European security situation since September 11, including the role of a changing NATO. Security issues were also discussed at length with Mr Gareth Evans, President of the International Crisis Group, which has its headquarters in Brussels.
The sessions with the European Parliament covered many topics, ranging from the processing of asylum seekers, human rights in Australia and immigration to EU expansion. Discussions focused heavily on issues of subsidies and dumping, together with restricted trading access. The delegation emphasised Australia's support for common agricultural policy reform and promoted the cause of free trade by condemning restrictive measures that deny Australian producers access to fair, competitive world prices. We emphasised both in the United States and the European Parliament that, without the false protection of subsidies and tariffs, Australian producers have had to become some of the most efficient in the world. 
Animal health and food sanitation issues were also raised. Of particular interest to the delegation was a session of the temporary committee on foot-and-mouth disease, at which we were included in the debate. I am sure the delegation will acknowledge the very fine contribution made to that debate by the Australian participants, led by Senator O'Brien, who presented Australia's bipartisan agricultural trade policy. This session in particular provided a significant opportunity for the Australian delegation to vigorously defend the need to maintain Australia's strict quarantine regulations. We also visited the historically important Menen Gate memorial and paid our respects to the thousands of Australians and their comrades who lost their lives in the bloody battle for the Ypres Salient.
Delegations such as these require, I have to say, a great deal of organisation by Australian officers in our overseas posts. The delegation was ably assisted by His Excellency Mr Michael Thawley, the Australian Ambassador to the United States of America; Mr Allan Rocher, Consul-General in Los Angeles; and Mr Peter Frank, Consul-General and Senior Trade Commissioner in San Francisco, together with Miss Angela Lowrey of the San Francisco office. Thanks also go to Her Excellency Ms Joanna Hewitt, the Australian Ambassador to Belgium and the Mission to the European Union, and her staff, and in particular to Ms Antoinette Merrillees, who assisted in assembling the delegation's program. Special mention should be made of Ms Tanya Smith and Mr Matthew Tinning, both of the Australian Embassy in Washington, who assisted the delegation, particularly in New York City. Thanks also to the officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of the Parliamentary Library for the thoroughness of their briefing material provided before the delegation's departure. I also wish to express the delegation's gratitude to His Excellency Mr Thomas Schieffer, the United States Ambassador, and His Excellency Mr Piergiorgio Mazzocchi, Ambassador and Head of the Delegation of the European Commission, for their frank and informative briefings prior to departure.
Delegates worked hard to effectively represent Australia and to promote Australia's interests throughout what was an informative exchange, but not as hard as some of the staff from the Speaker's office and the Parliamentary Relations Office who accompanied the delegation, Mr Peter Gibson and Ms Brenda Herd. Theirs was a tough assignment keeping us all in order, and I am sure I speak for the entire delegation when I thank them most sincerely for their professionalism. I commend the report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Parliamentary Delegation to the United States of America and the European Institutions</title>,Delegation Reports,26,1,speech
"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2003-02-06,"—Just a couple of weeks ago, Canberra lost one of its more colourful journalists, with the death of Bruce Juddery. Bruce and I worked together as journalists at the Canberra Times and for several years I sat next to him, which required a good deal of patience and goodwill on my part and probably on his as well. Those of us who knew Bruce well will understand when I say that Bruce was not always an easy friend to have. But over the years I came to respect his intellect and his ability to write articles of all kinds on highly complex issues. His son Mark will continue to provide the Juddery by--line in the ACT with his interesting and very often entertaining articles on film. His daughter Delisay was also a great source of pride to Bruce.
I last saw Bruce a few weeks before Christmas. I gave him a lift to the local shopping centre. We had our usual disagreement about his propensity to smoke cigars inside my car and he departed with the usual slam of the door. `It's lucky we love you like we do—you work so hard at being obnoxious,' I called to him. His reply is best left to the imagination. They were the last words we exchanged, and they probably encapsulate our 30-odd years of friendship quite accurately.
Bruce was a colourful Canberra identity for more than 30 years and he was a frequent visitor to the Senate estimates, from which he was able to write a range of articles covering mostly education—particularly university and tertiary education—and defence related issues. Sometimes I marvelled at the way he was able to write such lengthy articles on what had seemed to me to be a fairly mundane exchange of questions and answers between senators and public servants. Bruce's professional life was very eloquently covered in an absolutely outstanding eulogy delivered at Bruce's funeral service by the Editor-in-Chief of the Canberra Times, Jack Waterford. With the agreement of Jack, I seek leave to incorporate an edited version of Mr Waterford's contribution into the Senate Hansard.
Leave granted.
The eulogy read as follows—
We are all here united by a common idiosyncrasy—we loved, liked or respected Bruce Juddery. I suppose some of us are here to be sure that he is dead so that there is no fear of interruption, correction or contradiction when we tell tales of him at the wake at University House, but even there, one of the certain things is that the stories—which I expect will be scabrous and not always entirely to his credit, will be mostly tinged with affection and respect. An affection indeed that Bruce would find hard to handle, and likely to be coped with by his becoming just as abusive as he could become if one was reading a Riot Act of an entirely different kind.
Our affection and respect for Bruce is, in fact, in almost all cases, more than common sense would dictate because, despite his many talents, there was never a person who could more test any relationship than Bruce Juddery. And that was with his friends, rather than his enemies. There was hardly ever a person with a greater capacity to make friends feel let down, insulted for no reason, abused against his own interests.
But no one was harder on Bruce than himself, than none of his friends were punished for his misbehaviour or ineptness more than Bruce himself, and that even as he acted so often perversely against his own self interest, few people more appreciated the friendship and the counsel of those who could look past his demons and see that he was at heart a good man, a clever man, and one who left the world, perhaps a little more disorganised, but also a better place.
He was fearless, even foolhardy in exactly the same way he was in relationships with his friends, in that he would not hesitate to attack, on well-stated principles, contacts who gave him good information, just as he would sometimes not hesitate to praise people whose professional animosity to him was palpable. I wouldn't always say that he was fair—because Bruce was rather more capable of having bees in his bonnet than most—but he was fair-minded, with a great respect for evidence, a willingness to acknowledge that there were viewpoints other than his own, and generally that acme of professionalism—a capacity to fairly state the actions or views on those on whom he was commenting critically. He was honourable—a person who could keep secrets, respect undertakings and abide by ethical considerations. I cannot think of a time when the public interest was other than his only consideration, and I can think of occasions when that interest ran against his own, and he unhesitatingly respected his calling. There are people here today who were mauled in their professional dealings with him, but maintained reasonably cordial relationships—so far as one could ever have such a thing with Bruce—even at the height of a storm. 
He was deeply interested in the interplay between different people and how their tensions and their cooperation's produced movement. He was interested in the way in which organisations themselves developed cultures and ideas, ideals even, and became almost organic personalities in their own right. In how an understanding of the clashes and collisions of different organisations and cultures threw into perspective some of the great policy and program disputes which make for ordinary politics. That he was someone himself unsocialised, so often seemingly simply unaware of how people should interact with each, may make this absorption in organisations seem a little more strange; perhaps in a way, however, it made him rather more than the foreign correspondent even as he was reporting on things in his own community.
He did this first in developing a fresh sort of reportage of the Australian National University, a field in which he stayed interested and again became absorbed in later years, to the point, I think I could say, that probably no one attended more university council meetings than he did.
But his lasting monument must be in the way he pioneered the coverage, not only in Australia but in the world, of public administration, government with a small g, as opposed to the supposedly higher politics practised in Parliament Houses, within and between parties, and between politicians and the electorate.
Bruce wrote, necessarily, about Government with a large G too; indeed he found quickly found that his understanding of the way bureaucracy worked, and his deepening understanding of the personalities and the great ideas of those who advised the politicians gave him not only a great insight into the stuff of pure politics, but often, a big jump on journalists who hardly ever thought to ring a bureaucrat, preferring to take all their spin from the ministers, their opposite numbers and their minders.
There are wonderful images, not least in his brilliant book At the Centre, and a later history of public service unionism of government departments as medieval city states, and, elsewhere, as continents on tectonic plates in almost casual collisions with each other. But there is much more than that. For most of us, it is from Juddery that we learnt of the importance and the influence of great public servants and were able to associate them firmly not only with particular achievements but with particular views and personalities. In this day and age, when the public servant is, as often as not, a public figure, this is not so unusual, but the role of Bruce in bringing this about can hardly be underestimated. Most public servants were highly uncomfortable in dealing with journalists; many of them thought it was a prima facie breach of the Crimes Act. Bruce not only brought them, unwilling and reluctant into the light, but taught them how they could develop their ideas and their policies, and promote their agendas by doing so.
Bruce was one of the reporters first on the scene after the death of Harold Holt, and played a substantial role in chronicling the rise and fall of Gorton, McMahon and Whitlam. His reportage and commentary on the Whitlam Government, much of which became the fodder of At the Centre was perhaps more significant because of the role that uncertainty and ineptness with the government reins played in the Whitlam Government demise.
He had enormous energy and productivity, and in all fields of reportage, a person who could in a day write an editorial, a book review, a piece of commentary, an obituary, a substantial profile and half a dozen news items, and, in a week of doing that, nonetheless read half a dozen substantial books, a dozen works of science fiction and probably a dozen marvel comics as well, not to mention propping up some bars and attending a few conferences. There are other journalists who can virtually single-handedly fill newspapers, but what was astonishing about Bruce was his range and the intrinsic interest of much of the material on which he worked. It's the content, and the breadth that matters as much as the quality.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,"<title>Juddery, Mr Bruce</title>",Adjournment,35,1,speech
