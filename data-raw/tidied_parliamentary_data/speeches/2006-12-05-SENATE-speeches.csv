"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2006-12-05,"—These two amendments abolish the private health insurance rebate. For some time now, the position of the Australian Greens has been that this over $3 billion of public funds which the government uses each year to support private health insurance should be redirected and instead spent on our public healthcare system. It is a position that the Greens have taken because of our strong commitment to social justice. When we were debating this bill last night, we heard from each of the parties represented here and I note that we heard no support for the idea of redirecting these public funds, and making sure that that money that taxpayers contribute to the government to ensure that there is a quality healthcare system that can be accessed by all Australians is invested in the public health system. Instead we continue to see both of the major parties supporting the redirection of wealth from taxpayers into the pockets of those people who have private health insurance.
In this chamber I have been through many times before the Greens’ analysis of which people in the community do have private health insurance: predominantly they can be found in the wealthier, Liberal-held electorates. It is the constituents of the poorer electorates—predominantly Labor held, and indeed in National Party electorates, where we see some of the lowest levels of income and also the very lowest levels of private health insurance—who are subsidising those in Liberal Party electorates such as that of health minister Tony Abbott, whose electorate has the highest level of private health insurance.
So this money, this over $3 billion of public funds, is available for people who live in the wealthy suburbs of Sydney or the wealthy suburbs of Melbourne, but those other Australians, particularly in regional areas, do not get access to these public funds. And they do not have private health insurance. Why would you? There is no private hospital or private hospital services. So, effectively, what we see are people living in National Party electorates and people living in Labor electorates subsidising the private health insurance of people who live in Liberal Party electorates. For all of the areas that the Greens’ analysis is based on—I have looked at Sydney, I have looked at Melbourne and I have looked nationally—the pattern is the same. The pattern is the same across the board: it is Australians in poorer parts and regional parts of this country who subsidise the private health insurance of people who live in wealthy Liberal suburbs like those in the health minister’s electorate.
What the Greens are saying is that we want some social justice injected into the system. We want to ensure that that over $3 billion of public funds is spent on the healthcare system that delivers the most efficient outcomes, on the healthcare system that is available to all Australians, regardless of their capacity to pay—and that is the public health system. The Greens support the public health system and we want to see this money going into ensuring there is a quality system that all Australians can access regardless of their capacity to pay. So I commend these amendments to the Senate because they inject social justice into the way in which health care is funded in this country.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2006-12-05,"—The Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 before the Senate today amends the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1997 and the principal act, the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act 2005, to make land nominations—as distinct from decisions—non-reviewable under the ADJR Act; provides that failure to comply with the site nomination rules in the CRWM Act will not affect the validity of the minister’s approval of a nomination; and removes any entitlement to procedural fairness in relation to the nomination of a site.
The bill also amends the principal 2005 act to provide for the return of nominated Aboriginal land used for a radioactive waste management facility when no longer required for the facility and indemnifies traditional owners following the land return against any damages claims arising from the use of the land for a facility.
Labor will oppose this bill. This is the latest instalment in a series of three extreme, arrogant and heavy-handed bills. Labor will defend the right of communities, including Indigenous communities, to be properly and fully consulted before decisions are made about the location of radioactive waste dumps. This bill continues the Howard government’s sneaky and misleading practice of removing the voice of local communities in the government’s campaign to impose a waste dump on the Northern Territory. This campaign should be seen for exactly what it is: a pointer to the methods the Howard government intends to use in imposing nuclear power stations and high-level waste dumps on unsuspecting communities right around Australia; tricky tactics, like denying its real intentions before an election then springing it onto a community straight after; and misusing parliamentary numbers to override every legislative right, every protection and every safeguard normally available to everyday Australians when they want to have their say on government decisions that affect them.
To begin with I want to remind the Senate of the circumstances underlying the 2005 bill pushed through this parliament late last year. The stated purpose of the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act 2005 was to put beyond doubt the Commonwealth’s power to conduct activities relating to siting, constructing and operating a radioactive waste management facility in the Northern Territory. The 2005 act contains a number of provisions excluding procedural fairness in relation to selecting a site for the facility. The Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management (Related Amendments) Act 2005 excludes application of judicial review under the ADJR Act to the minister’s decision on a facility site. Labor opposed the 2005 bills on a number of grounds, all of which remain relevant today.
The government’s acknowledged purpose for these provisions is to prevent local individuals or communities, representative bodies or state or territory governments from being able to undertake legal objections to the Commonwealth’s actions, which might delay the project. The government stated at the time of the parliamentary debate that these provisions give the Commonwealth some certainty, subject to normal regulatory processes, of having a facility operating by 2011 when repatriation of spent fuel reprocessing waste from the United Kingdom is currently due to commence.
Labor does not oppose the establishment of a nuclear waste facility per se; indeed, Labor explicitly agrees that there is a need for a properly sited, properly operating facility to securely handle and store the low- and intermediate-level waste produced by the use of radioactive materials for research, industrial, health and medical purposes. However, Labor firmly remains of the view that the siting, establishment and operation of such a facility needs to be done in an open and transparent way, in full consultation with local communities and with the relevant state and territory governments. Such a process would be in full compliance with the recommended approach set out by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The original 2005 act was for assessments of three potential sites, on defence land, for the Commonwealth waste dump—those being Fishers Ridge near Katherine; Harts Range, 200 kilometres north-east of Alice Springs; and Mount Everard, approximately 42 kilometres north-west of Alice Spring—but this bill makes those provisions more difficult.
I turn to the specific provisions of the amendment bill before the Senate. They all relate in one way or another to the nomination process placed in the bill by the member for Solomon late last year. While the Minister for Education, Science and Training chose not to reveal this important fact in her second reading speech to the House, the Senate statement of reasons for introduction briefly states the circumstances which have led to the drafting of this bill, namely:
The bill addresses concerns raised by the Northern Land Council (NLC) in relation to nominating a site under the CRWM Act. If not addressed, the NLC may be unwilling to nominate a site should a community within its jurisdiction wish to volunteer its land.
When the opposition made inquiries of departmental officers as to the nature of the concerns raised by the Northern Land Council, apparently no further information could be made available. Therefore I seek a response from the minister, when closing this debate, on the nature of the concerns raised by the Northern Land Council so that the Senate can decide for itself whether the bill before us properly meets the concerns raised.
The acknowledged purpose of the legal challenge provisions of the 2005 act is to prevent local individuals or communities, representative bodies or state or territory governments being able to undertake legal objections to the Commonwealth’s actions which may delay the project. Due to the late consideration of the Tollner amendments, departmental officers advise that the same protections against legal challenges to the Commonwealth’s actions were not applied consistently to the site nomination procedures inserted by the Tollner amendments. In effect, the provision of the bill before us today will extend the current protection from judicial review even further to the processes and decision making of the land councils in the Northern Territory, who are statutory agencies for the purpose of the ADJR Act. Similarly, the bill proposes to extend the current provision that no person is entitled to procedural fairness so as to ensure that it applies to the nomination of a site as provided for by the Tollner amendments to the principal act. Labor opposed the corresponding provisions in the 2005 bill on the grounds that they were a heavy-handed attempt to remove important rights to judicial scrutiny and review from the site decision-making process, and Labor will oppose the provisions of the current bill which remove those same rights from the nomination decision-making process.
Before I turn to the third specific set of provisions of the amendment bill before the Senate relating to the rules of nomination, the Senate needs to consider the nature of the amendments to the 2005 bill moved from the floor on 1 November last year by the government member for Solomon, Mr Tollner, which the government supported into law. These were the 30 pieces of silver that the government threw the member for Solomon to get him to recant his pre-election promise that the Northern Territory would not have a radioactive waste dump foisted on it.
Those amendments provided for the Northern Territory Chief Minister and Aboriginal land trusts or land councils to nominate potential sites for the waste dump in addition to the three sites set out in that bill. Given that the Chief Minister has always been and remains implacably committed to representing her community’s opposition to this waste dump being imposed on the Territory, these amendments were clearly designed to smooth the way for a nomination by a land council. Given that the Central Land Council also remains utterly opposed, that only leaves the Northern Land Council as a realistic possibility.
Included in the amendments moved by the member for Solomon was a set of criteria or rules against which such a nomination should be judged, including provisions that the process of nomination by a land council must demonstrate evidence of consultation with traditional owners, that the traditional owners must understand the nomination, that they have consented as a group and that any community or group that may be affected has been consulted and had adequate opportunity to express its view. Interestingly, the member for Solomon chose not to inform the House why he chose to deem valid those particular rules for nominations.
I turn now to the clauses of the bill which address the issue of potential invalid nominations made under those provisions inserted into the principal act by the member for Solomon—which I will call the Tollner amendments. There are two ways any nomination of land for a radioactive waste dump would be made invalid: through procedural inadequacies or—a more substantive issue—by a failure to comply with the rules of nomination so carefully inserted by the member for Solomon. Given that procedural inadequacy, such as not lodging such a nomination in writing, is extremely unlikely, we can only conclude that the only likely noncompliance of any future nomination relates to those nomination rules. In other words, this bill proposes to validate a nomination which otherwise would be automatically ruled invalid for ministerial consideration. So the fact that traditional owners have not been informed of the nomination, did not properly understand that their land was being nominated or had not consented to the nomination—or the fact that other affected communities or groups, such as those in neighbouring lands, have not been consulted or given an opportunity to express their view—can no longer invalidate a nomination.
The bill before us proposes a new section 7(5A), which provides that a failure to abide by these currently binding rules of nomination will not affect the validity of a nomination. In effect, these statutory rules would become mere guidance, because a failure of the minister or land council to abide by these rules will not render a nomination unacceptable. A site could still be nominated and accepted even though traditional owners do not know it has been or do not agree with it being used to dump radioactive waste.
In addition, it is important to recognise that this provision would remove the current statutory right of affected neighbouring communities or groups to be even consulted or to express their view. Given that under the Tollner amendments these groups are not required to consent to the proposed nomination, the provision aims squarely to block their statutory right to even express a view. As well as being an almighty slap in the face for the member for Solomon through this outright repudiation of his rules of nomination, the Howard government has also completely backtracked on its own rhetoric about fully consulting with, and achieving informed consent from, all affected local communities and groups—in particular, the Indigenous traditional owners of any nominated sites.
The provisions of the bill in this regard are a direct contradiction of the minister’s own commitments to the parliament in her second reading speech on this bill in which she stated:
Current provisions of the act set down a number of criteria that should be met if a land council decides to make a nomination. Importantly, these criteria include that the owners of the land in question have understood the proposal and have consented to the nomination, and that other Aboriginal communities with an interest in the land have also been consulted.
And she emphasised:
I can assure the House that, should a nomination be made, I will only accept it if satisfied that these criteria have been met.
The minister’s words in her second reading speech are just that—hollow, condescending words. Faced with the clear intent and outcomes of the bill before us, the minister’s contradictory commitment in her speech is simply meaningless rhetoric providing no comfort whatsoever to traditional owners or their representatives.
Importantly, the outcome of the proposals contained in this bill are also in conflict with the Northern Land Council’s full council resolution of October 2005 which provided a mandate for the Northern Land Council’s further dialogue with the government on a possible nomination. The resolution stated:
The Northern Land Council supports an amendment to the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005 to enable a Land Council to nominate a site in the Northern Territory as a radioactive waste facility, provided that:
the traditional owners of the site agree;
sacred sites and heritage are protected (including under current Commonwealth and NT legislation);
environment protection requirements are met (including under current Commonwealth and NT legislation);
Aboriginal land is not acquired or native title extinguished (unless with traditional owners’ consent).
Given the clear intent of this resolution, there is a serious question to be asked here: has the Northern Land Council approved the proposal to remove the mandatory nomination rules which closely parallel their own requirements? In effect, the current bill proposes to relegate both the Northern Land Council’s resolution and the nomination rules inserted by the government’s own member for Solomon into irrelevance, and they will be opposed by Labor as an important matter of principle.
We need to be very clear about this. Under this bill, traditional owners or affected persons will have no enforceable rights to be even informed of such moves—to ensure that the implications are fully understood—or to give or withhold consent for their traditional lands, which can be compulsorily acquired and used for the handling and storage of radioactive waste for at least 300 years. And, as if that is not enough, they will have no enforceable right to get their land back once the Commonwealth’s use of it as a waste dump has concluded, because the bill simply provides that it may be handed back.
All traditional owners, all of their representative groups and all Northern Territorians should understand this point. The Howard government is intent on making sure that you cannot express your views and that you have no rights, no legal review avenues, no informed consent and absolutely no say in its blind pursuit of being able to dump nuclear waste in the Northern Territory.
I want to now turn to the provisions of the bill relating to the return of that land to the original Indigenous owners. Section 119 of the Lands Acquisition Act 1989 allows the Commonwealth to dispose of Commonwealth land. However, the department has advised the opposition that there is some legal doubt that this power allows the Commonwealth to grant land title with the same status as land granted under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. Accordingly, the government argues that the provisions of this bill are necessary to ensure that, where acquired land is Aboriginal land immediately before the acquisition, such land may be returned with the same status as Aboriginal land.
The department has indicated that any site chosen will be required for the operations of a waste facility for at least 100 years and that, even when waste is no longer being accepted into the site, it will need to be closely monitored for a further 200-year period. So any possible return of land to original owners will not take place for at least 300 years. However, legal advice received by the opposition indicates that the proposed provision is not legally necessary as the government of the time could simply hand the land over to traditional owners under the provisions of the land rights act if it applies at the time.
Under this bill the government does not have to make any such hand-back but simply provides for a hand-back should the minister of the time determine that it is safe to do so. It appears that this bill is simply providing some political cover for the Northern Land Council should they make a nomination and subsequently face criticism for giving away hard-won ownership of traditional lands for three centuries or more.
This is an extraordinarily bothersome piece of legislation and Labor is not supporting it. The government’s history in relation to the nuclear waste facility in the Northern Territory gives us a real indication of how they propose to move on nuclear issues at large and in taking Australia much further down the nuclear road, with 25 nuclear power stations and radioactive waste dumps. If the Howard government cannot consult, cannot build community consensus, cannot leave important legal rights untrampled and cannot gain the informed consent of Indigenous people for a low- and medium-level waste facility, what hope do we have that they can comply with best-practice guidelines in relation to nuclear power and the resulting radioactive waste? Labor will not support this bill. I move:
Omit all words after “that”, substitute:
         “but the Senate:
         (1)    Condemns the government for:
              (a)    the continuing arrogant approach imposing a nuclear waste dump on the people of the Northern Territory without proper scientific assessment and consultation processes;

"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2006-12-05,"—I rise today to oppose the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 and to put it in the context of the Howard government’s nuclear agenda for Australia, because it has to be seen in that context. The government is currently working on three separate fronts to advance the cause of George Bush’s Global Nuclear Energy Partnership. That is what we are talking about here today. Earlier this year, in 2006, President Bush announced his grand nuclear vision for the world: the US would set up a number of nuclear fuel supply centres around the world, they would produce the nuclear fuel, it would be leased to other countries and then those nuclear fuel supply centres would take back the waste.
Up until that point, the Howard government’s total nuclear agenda had been about expanded uranium mining. That is something that a large number of Labor Party supporters and members object to. But others in the party, like Mr Martin Ferguson, actually want that to occur. That debate will happen at the ALP conference next year. Either way, up until President Bush’s announcement earlier this year, the government’s agenda had been expanded uranium mining and exports to China, Russia and anywhere else they could get away with sending it to. That included a debate about whether they would sell it to India, even though India is not a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
In May this year Prime Minister Howard went to the United States, where he had a meeting with President Bush and was told that, if Australia did not engage in President Bush’s Global Nuclear Energy Partnership, Australia would not be invited to meetings at the table. That was a horrendous indication to Prime Minister Howard that he would not be part of George Bush’s grand plan. It was from that point that things changed.
What facilitated the change was the role of someone whose name is not on the lips of most Australians—in fact, they have never heard of him. But they should hear of him. He is Dr John White, chairman of the federal government’s Uranium Industry Framework. He is also head of Australian waste company Global Renewables, which is a strange name for essentially a nuclear waste dump management company.
Dr White went to Washington at the same time that Prime Minister Howard was there. He is the person who links all of these politicians. In an interview with an Australian journalist with regard to Australia setting up a nuclear waste dump to take high-level nuclear waste from around the world—in particular, from the US—this is what he had to say:
If we agree to do this for America, we will never again have to put young Australians in the line of fire. We will never have to prove our loyalty to the US by sending our soldiers to fight in their wars, because a project like this would settle the question of our loyalty once and for all.
Of course, the project he was talking about was the nuclear waste dump in Australia—a waste dump to be developed by an international consortium of nuclear experts, US think tanks and businessmen from around the world. It fed into the Prime Minister’s nuclear task force and into the House of Representatives report on nuclear energy, which came out yesterday.
The interesting thing is that Mr White, the chairman of the Prime Minister’s Uranium Industry Framework, has already spent $45 million developing an Australian nuclear fuel leasing company, which would facilitate and manage enrichment, fabrication, leasing, transport and storage of 15 to 20 per cent of the world’s nuclear fuel needs. This person has a very grand vision for Australia as a global waste dump.
We are now seeing all of this coming to fruition via the Howard government’s legislation. Let us go through it. We have already had the ANSTO legislation through this house. What did that do? Firstly, it gave to ANSTO the power to manage nuclear waste dumps in Australia and, secondly, it gave to ANSTO the capacity to accept the management of waste generated outside Australia, not from within Australia.
Then we have the EPBC amendments before this house. What they do is set up a number of loopholes which would allow the federal environment minister not to examine a nuclear waste dump proposal under the environmental legislation of this country. They do that by saying that if the minister determines that a nuclear waste dump is consistent with the principles of a bioregional plan then it would not have to be assessed, could be the subject of a ministerial declaration and could be the subject of a partnership arrangement. Of course, in this case the way in which a nuclear waste dump is being envisaged by Mr White, and no doubt the Howard government, is that it would be a private sector investment. In fact, the Prime Minister’s task force report said that any nuclear enrichment facility in Australia would not see Australian companies managing it, that there is a very high entry level, that it is likely that it would be managed by multinational corporations and that either a UK or a US company would be facilitated in that regard.
Then we have the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry and Resources released yesterday. What does it say? I am very pleased that Senator Stephens has stated clearly that a Labor government would not overrule consultation with Indigenous people because, unfortunately, three Labor MPs signed on to this report: Mr Martin Ferguson, Mr Dick Adams and Mr Michael Hatton. They have signed on to a report that, at recommendation 9, says:
The Committee recommends that the Australian Government, through the Council of Australian Governments, seek to remedy the impediments to the development of the uranium industry identified in this report and, specifically ...
ensure that processes associated with issues including land access, Native Title, assessment and approvals, and reporting are streamlined …
Here we have three Labor MPs signing on to a government report which says ‘get rid of the impediments’, which is code for saying, ‘get rid of native title legislation in this country that might hold up our nuclear ambitions and particularly our nuclear waste dump.’ So I am glad that the Labor Party has got this amendment in here. And I hope that the new leader of the Labor Party will pull Mr Ferguson, Mr Adams and Mr Hatton into line, because what they are doing is undermining the capacity of traditional owners to exercise the ownership rights that they have over their land. It flies completely in the face of all the talk from the new leader about community rights, public participation and so on.
Also in the House of Representatives report we have further proof that the whole Global Nuclear Energy Partnership—the George Bush plan, the John White plan and the Uranium Industry Framework plan—is alive and well. Recommendation 12 recommends that the Australian and state governments:
... examine whether, in light of the advances in spent fuel management proposed in the GNEP initiative, there is in fact a potential role for Australia in the back-end of the fuel cycle ...
‘Back-end of the fuel cycle’ is code for ‘nuclear waste dump’. That is also something that the three Labor members signed on to and, of course, it supports the government’s total initiative in this regard.
Sadly, they also signed on to the ludicrous proposition that there be a community education campaign that is nothing other than a propaganda campaign to be put through Australian schools. Specifically, the report recommends that the government:
... seek to rectify any inaccuracies or lack of balance in school and university curricula pertaining to uranium mining and nuclear power ...
In other words, ‘Let’s run a propaganda campaign through Australian schools to promote nuclear power.’ The government should, the report goes on to say:
encourage companies to conduct programs of visits to uranium mines for teachers, school groups, media representatives and political leaders; and
encourage industry to be forthright in engaging in public debate, where this may assist in providing a more balanced perspective on the industry and its impacts.
As soon as you see the words ‘balanced perspective’ used in relation to the curriculum you know that it means the government’s view is underrepresented. So what you have is Prime Minister Howard’s vision for the country whereby you do not get school funding unless you have a flagpole in the front yard, and you do not get school funding unless you teach history—and the history that you teach is the John Howard version of history. And now we have a curricula directive on putting in a nuclear education campaign. I wonder if the version of history that is going to be taught in Australian schools will include the hideous nuclear accident at Chernobyl, the use of nuclear bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki or, indeed, the current nuclear arms race that is going on around the world. Or will that be deemed to be not ‘balanced’ in the curriculum that is envisaged?
And so I come to the current legislation, which we now have before us, the government having already given ANSTO the right to manage the dumps and take back waste from overseas and having brought in amendments to the EPBC. Interestingly again, the House of Representatives report recommends that the EPBC should be amended to abolish the prohibitions that relate to nuclear facilities which are already in the EPBC. The report says to abolish them, so the Labor members signed on to the abolition of those particular clauses in the current legislation.
Now we have before us a bill which does three things. First, it says that if a waste dump is put forward it can be accepted as an appropriate nomination even if it has not complied with the requirements of consultation under the Native Title Act and other provisions associated with Aboriginal rights. It says quite clearly, ‘It does not matter if you haven’t consulted the traditional owners, if they haven’t given prior consent and if they do not understand; you, as the minister, are quite within your rights to accept it as an appropriately nominated site.’
Second, the bill goes on to say, ‘Having accepted the nomination on that basis you can approve that nomination and be exempt from judicial review if the judicial review relates to procedural fairness.’ So we have abolished procedural fairness. I find it extraordinary that any government could come in here—having already done this time and time again in relation to Indigenous people—and extend the abolition of procedural fairness to the issue of nuclear waste dumps and the approval of those dumps and then say it is exempt from judicial review.
All you are going to do is block up the High Court. That is what will happen. That is what happened under immigration law. When you tried to remove procedural fairness it ended up as a prerogative writ case in the High Court, and that is precisely what is going to happen here. If you think that taking away these rights in this matter is going to stop Indigenous people standing up for their own rights, and advocacy groups working with Indigenous people and helping them to take it to the High Court, then you are sadly mistaken. That is where this is going to be fought out, and I do not think the High Court will appreciate the fact that, once again, you have shoved a whole new workload up to the High Court because you have abused due legal process.
There are fundamental principles in the law and procedural fairness is one of them. The right to judicial review if you have been denied procedural fairness is a basic tenet of law. It demonstrates what hubris has set in in the Howard government—that it should take away and try to deny people the most fundamental rights they have in a democracy. And it will go to the High Court with one of the prerogative writs. We will see that occurring when the government moves on this agenda.
Third, the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 says that the government has a discretionary right or ability to return to Indigenous people any nominated waste site that has operated as a waste dump. You know how that is going to play out. It will be managed, for as long as it is profitable, by a private company. And then as soon as it is no longer profitable—as soon as liability issues kick in and vast amounts of money have to be paid in liability claims—the government will exercise its discretionary right to hand back the mess to Indigenous people. The government will hand Indigenous people back their own land, degraded by the onslaught and assault on the spiritual integrity of the land by a waste dump, and then say, ‘Here, you can have it back; we’ve finished with it and we don’t want to engage in and have to put up with the liability issues.’
Earlier this year I went to one of these prospective sites—Mount Everard in the Northern Territory—and I spoke to some of the traditional owners. They took me to where the proposed site is going to be. They told me what an affront it will be to their cultural integrity if that site is undermined and destroyed by what the government intends to do. Even then they only had a vague idea of what a nuclear waste dump might be like. Unlike in the United States, where there have been huge cases—huge protests about the Yukka Mountain site—these Indigenous people have no idea of what is coming their way. In fact, they were flown down to Sydney to look at Lucas Heights and told, ‘There you are; it is just going to be a small repository taking this. Don’t worry, this’ll all be sorted. No problem here.’ What the government is doing with this decision to impose on Indigenous people a radioactive waste dump is completely dishonest and disingenuous.
So when I see the collective of what the government is doing I have to stand in the Senate and ask myself about the state of democracy in Australia under a Howard government, which is using its majority power in both houses to undermine the fundamental principles of law, the fundamental principles of participatory democracy and the fundamental principles of fairness. I can see that people are amused by this. I can see advisers in the box amused by the notion that this is my view of the world. Well, it is how I see it. I happen to have sat out there with Indigenous people and shared with them and listened to their stories about how they are feeling about this assault on them and their land without consultation and prior consent.
I do not know how anybody who says that they embrace Australian and family values which relate to fairness, decency and honesty, could bring in a piece of legislation—on top of the other two lots of legislation—which is setting up the whole process for the Howard government to go down the path of expanded uranium mining and taking back high-level waste.
What happens with enrichment in the middle, with fuel fabrication and transport remains to be seen. I have always thought that the nuclear reactors issue was just a distraction from the main game, but I know that Prime Minister Howard is locked in with President Bush to the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership. The key to who is facilitating all this is John White of the Uranium Industry Framework. Those linkages needed to be examined here, and I hope that when history looks at the fact that the government was able to force this legislation through the Senate, when a waste dump site is selected, when it does not comply with consultation with Indigenous people, when it is approved, having taken away procedural fairness and judicial review and when it ends up in the courts and there are protests around the country, people might recognise the damage that has been done to democracy in this country by a majority Howard government. That is why I will be opposing this legislation.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2006-12-05,"—I too rise to speak on the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Legislation Amendment Bill 2006. This is an extraordinary bill. It paves the way for the Commonwealth to take away native title rights, in essence, in order to site the very unpopular national radioactive waste facility in the Northern Territory. Like much of what is happening here, where legislation is being rammed through, where legislation is being pushed through very short inquiry processes, this is ramming through a proposal to put a radioactive waste dump in the Northern Territory, despite the objections of those traditional owners who oppose it.
I agree with Senator Milne that this is part of a much bigger picture. This is about bringing Australia into the nuclear cycle. It is pretty obvious that the government is not prepared to ban high-level waste at this dump. I recall Democrats amendments that have been put up to that effect being opposed by the government. It is in the same week that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry and Resources tabled its report, which is full of glowing recommendations about us engaging in everything from enrichment to uranium leasing, whereby we would take back waste from countries that use our uranium in order to generate electricity. So it is an extraordinary time. It is a bit like a tsunami that has hit this country. We were, for a time, a country that wanted nothing to do with nuclear power. We were strongly opposed to nuclear weapons proliferation. We were very careful, as much as one can be, about where our uranium went around the world—not considering countries like China, which has not signed the comprehensive test ban treaty, and certainly not considering India, which has also not signed the non-proliferation treaty.
In the last few years we have seen more and more nuclear weapons grace the world, if I can put it that way. In fact, there are almost as many now as there were when the non-proliferation treaty was signed more than 30 years ago. So it feels like Australia is becoming very engaged in nuclear matters, whether it is expanding uranium mining, whether it is contemplating enrichment, whether it is setting ourselves up as a waste dump for the rest of the world. There are parts of this picture that are now starting to come together which I think Australians are very concerned about. However, back to the bill.
As I said, what this bill allows is for this site to be imposed on communities that do not want it. It removes procedural fairness, it removes a whole lot of processes that might have come to play had this bill not been introduced. We can all see that it is going to pass; the government obviously has the numbers, so it is hardly going to be a surprise. But the fact of the matter is that traditional owners will not have any right of appeal against the arbitrary decisions of land councils or of the minister. It is currently mandatory for land councils to consult and receive consent from traditional owners about the intended uses of their land. But all that goes now, because the government wants no delays whatsoever in imposing its radioactive waste dump on the landowners unfortunate enough to have had their land selected.
The very short hearing into this bill was unable to discover how politically motivated appeals, which is what this bill is described as preventing, would be defined. So we can only assume that all appeals would be categorised in this way. There was an extraordinary exchange with the department in trying to understand what was the real intent of this idea of ‘politically motivated.’ Not only was the hearing very short—just a couple of hours—but the time allowed for submissions was a mere two weeks. As I recall, much the same complaint was made when we dealt with the original bill that this amends. On neither occasion did the committee have an opportunity to visit the Northern Territory to gauge local opinion or to inform itself about the complex issues beneath the government’s policy gloss. No traditional owner was invited to appear before the committee in Canberra. We did have a teleconference hook-up with members of the land council but it was unsatisfactory in terms of reaching those people who we understand are opposed to the choice of the likely site.
The haste would not be such a problem if the government was prepared to be more transparent in its consultation and policy-making processes. But this whole sorry affair is cloaked in so-called commercial-in-confidence agreements. We were asked, as the committee, to swallow the highly improbable claim that the privacy of Indigenous people would be at risk if the Senate were to be privy to any details of negotiations between the government, through the Department of Education, Science and Training, and the Northern Land Council. Group officials who came before the committee said that details of their meetings with land councils and traditional owners could not be disclosed, on the grounds that they were commercial-in-confidence. The committee was not given any reason for how this might be the case, despite our questions. Presumably, commercial-in-confidence agreements relate to financial transactions of some kind, but there is no provision for this in the bill and officers denied that they were empowered to discuss financial considerations for site nominations. So we can only conclude that there were no discussions about money which might change hands, which makes it difficult to understand why commercial-in-confidence would apply at all.
But to step back: the government has been quite consistent on all of this. It abandoned what was described as a bipartisan approach to selecting a site when it had great difficulty getting one up in South Australia, so it chose the Northern Territory. It is a lot easier to override Northern Territory law, as we all know, and it would seem it is a lot easier to change native title in order to fast track or make smooth the passage of this site. So the amendments to the bill that we passed earlier allowed land councils and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory to nominate sites for assessment as a radioactive waste dump on land which they control. I think it is interesting to note that the act as amended during its passage restored the statutory right provisions similar to those applying to the land rights act.
The problem is that it is widely believed that Muckaty Station is the site that has been chosen or is likely to be nominated by the Northern Land Council. That station is just north of Tennant Creek and is within the Northern Land Council boundary. The Muckaty nomination is considered likely because the station is said to be close to a railway line, with a spur constructed for use by a local mine, geologically stable and distant from surface or underground water. But, despite the fact that officers and anthropologists were seen at the site, we were not able to get any confirmation from the department that this had happened and so the reports in the paper are all that we have to go by. It is highly problematic that, at this stage in our deliberations, we are not able to know just what has gone on to bring us to this point. It is clear that those who live close to this site but not in the NLC area are disaffected. They have not been consulted. They have been given propaganda and the education, apparently, but they have not been seriously consulted and, more importantly, their consent has not been given. Muckaty Station is the site everyone is anticipating will be the waste dump and the waste dump is what this legislation is all about.
Land councils are required to consult with their communities about projects that require approval and the crux of the problem with this bill is that it removes a whole lot of conditions related to this from the act. Those conditions are: consulting with traditional owners; having regard to the interests of traditional owners; not taking action without the consent of traditional owners; ensuring that traditional owners understand any proposal; ensuring any affected Aboriginal community has expressed its views; and complying with traditional decision making processes. New subclause 3B(2A) says that failure to comply with any of the points I have just mentioned does not affect the validity of the nomination. That is the key to this whole bill. We once had a set of things that the Northern Territory government or land councils had to go through before offering up a site, but this bill now says, ‘If you don’t do any or all of those things, that does not invalidate the nomination.’ It is, in effect, an invitation to ignore the provisions of the original act, weakening Indigenous land rights. As the Central Land Council stated in its submission:
Removing the need to comply with the procedures for consultation laid down in Waste Law 1 is the most problematic for traditional owners because it is these procedures for consultation which allow them to have their say. Not having to comply with them would necessarily repeal the consultation provisions under sections 23 and 77A of the Land Rights Act and sections 203BC and 251B of the Native Title Act to the extent they apply to site nomination.
This a very convoluted and deceptive way of removing protections for Indigenous people. The changes appear to be designed to obscure the real intent of the government—mind you, it did not take people very long to understand what they meant.
In her second reading speech, the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Julie Bishop, asked the parliament to be reassured. She said:
Current provision of the Act set down a number of criteria that should be met if a land council decided to make a nomination. Importantly, these criteria include that the owners of the land in question have understood the proposal and have consented to the nomination, and that other Aboriginal communities with an interest in the land have also been consulted ... I can assure the House that, should a nomination be made, I will only accept it if satisfied that these criteria have been met.
Again, I would ask: how is her satisfaction going to be made public? How will we know that she is satisfied? There is no process for us to understand that. Is that also going to be commercial-in-confidence? If we put a question on notice to the minister after she determines the site, will she tell us exactly what it was that satisfied her about the process? We say that it is not good enough just to have that in a speech; it ought to be in the legislation. We should remove entirely the reference to the nomination not being invalidated if any of those conditions are not met.
On procedural fairness, the other significant amendment is the removal of judicial review. We are similarly very much opposed to this erosion of administrative and judicial safeguards against the arbitrary powers of governments. The current act removed procedural fairness, giving the minister unfettered discretion over decisions. This bill extends that to exclude the entitlement to the right to judicial review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1989 in relation to site nominations. The minister explained in her second reading speech that this was intended to prevent politically motivated challenges to land council nominations. As the minister told the House of Representatives, the government will not accept what she describes as speculative legal challenges intended to delay the establishment of waste facilities. You cannot have a system whereby all the traditional owners need to agree, as was the case, and then say, ‘We’ll talk about some as being politically motivated and others speculative.’ It is not good enough—either you have consent or you do not have consent. We are extremely concerned about the fact that this bill waters that down.
As I said earlier, we were unable to get any definition of what politically motivated challenges might look like. Mr Ross, the Director of the Central Land Council, said:
... it also talks very clearly about the ability of the Commonwealth to do what it wants to do in regard to ... what it considers to be politically motivated challenges. I think the real issue here is that Aboriginal people are not interested in the politically motivated challenges; they are interested in their rights and in being consulted about what is to take place or what is not to take place on their land. That is what interests Aboriginal people more than anything else.
The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission also pointed out that the effects go further than this:
They prevent legitimate challenges to a nomination based on grounds such as a denial of procedural fairness or other grounds of judicial review such as bias, bad faith, fraud or lack of evidence.
So we are not altogether sure what the government is going to do by way of implementing this legislation, but we can be fairly confident that whatever site is nominated is likely to go ahead without too much pesky objection, whether by Indigenous people or by pastoralists. We did hear how much they would be affected by this dump going to Muckaty Station, or any other site for that matter, in the Northern Territory. The point was made by the local member that Australia has a reputation of being clean and green and that that reputation would be well and truly shot if a radioactive waste dump of this scale were to be built in the area. This legislation has a lot of ramifications. It is about Indigenous owners and their rights, but it is also about the reputation of the whole of the Northern Territory and this region in particular.
South Australia managed to ward off the government’s efforts to put a dump there. South Australia has borne the brunt of nuclear activity with Roxby Downs and with Maralinga. It has had its fair share of nuclear engagement. No doubt the government thinks that the Northern Territory with its uranium mines is the next most likely state to accept the dump but, as we have argued many times in this place before, it is not appropriate for there to be a single national dump.
The Democrats are realistic in understanding that there needs to be a safe repository for nuclear waste, whether it is from Lucas Heights or from hospitals. We accept that it is important that there is a national engagement in all of this, but we do not accept that it should go to one state alone and certainly not one as distant from the sites of generation as this one is proposed to be. The out of sight, out of mind mentality is not a good one. It is far better for this material to be kept—as it is at present—close to the site of production so that it can be monitored, but instead of that we are putting it into Aboriginal land. Typically, that is the easy answer: out of sight, out of mind, a long way away from metropolitan parts of the country so that other people carry the burden of the waste which, by and large, is generated by others.
It is a sad day to see a bill like this go through the parliament. I think it is an indication that the government is willing to trample over the rights of anyone and, in particular Indigenous people, who are already so disaffected, so seriously disadvantaged in economic development and in every area you can name. The most we can give them is a dump in their backyard. I am sure that when the site is nominated, there will be lots of extraordinary claims about how good this will be for Indigenous communities, about the jobs that will be created and so forth and the roads that will be put in. Who knows? But, at the end of the day, it is not much of a choice for Aboriginal Australians in this area.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2006-12-05,"—I rise to make a few brief remarks on the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 following on from my contribution to the debate on the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Amendment Bill 2006. The Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act 2005, which the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 amends, was rammed through both houses of parliament without adequate scrutiny. It is an extreme piece of legislation. It imposes a toxic nuclear waste dump on the people of the Northern Territory and it overrides the Howard government’s own environment and heritage protection laws. It overrides the Native Title Act and the Lands Acquisition Act. It removes procedural fairness. It allows the Commonwealth government to do whatever it deems necessary to establish or operate a nuclear waste dump and whatever it pleases to ensure the nuclear waste gets transported to the nuclear waste site. In other words, the bill brushes aside critical environmental protection, community safety and Aboriginal rights laws to ensure that Territorians get dumped with a toxic nuclear waste dump.
This bill amends the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 and the principal act, the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act 2005, to make land nominations as distinct from decisions not reviewable under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. This bill provides that failure to comply with the site nomination rules in the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act 2005 will not affect the validity of the minister’s approval of a nomination. This bill proposes to validate a nomination which would otherwise be automatically ruled invalid for ministerial consideration because, for example, traditional owners had not been informed of the nomination or traditional owners did not properly understand that their land was being nominated or traditional owners had not consented to the nomination. The provisions of the bill in this regard are a direct contradiction of the commitments of the Minister for Education, Science and Training to the parliament in her second reading speech on this bill, when she stated:
Current provisions of the act set down a number of criteria that should be met if a land council decides to make a nomination. Importantly, these criteria include that the owners of the land in question have understood the proposal and have consented to the nomination, and that other Aboriginal communities with an interest in the land have also been consulted.
A site could still be nominated and accepted even though traditional owners do not know it has been or do not agree with it being used to dump radioactive wastes. This bill also removes any entitlement to procedural fairness in relation to a nomination of a site. The bill also amends the principal 2005 act to provide for the return of nominated Aboriginal land used for a radioactive waste management facility, when no longer required in around 300 years, and indemnifies traditional owners, following the land return, against any damages claims arising from the use of the land for a facility.
Before the last election the people of the Northern Territory were given an undertaking—a promise, in fact—by the Howard government that there would not be a dump in the Northern Territory. When this government needed to be re-elected it could not wait to reassure Territorians that there would be no nuclear waste dump in the Territory. Just prior to the federal election, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage ruled out the Northern Territory as a site for a nuclear waste dump. He said:
The Commonwealth is not pursuing any options anywhere on the mainland, so we can be quite categorical about that, because the Northern Territory is on the mainland.
However, once the Howard government was safely back in office it seems that it could not break that commitment fast enough. Just last year, Mr Tollner, the member for Solomon, continued to claim not to support the nuclear waste dump in the Territory. At that time, he said:
There’s not going to be a national nuclear waste dump in the Northern Territory ... That was the commitment undertaken in the lead-up to the federal election and I haven’t heard anything apart from that view expressed since that election.
Unfortunately Mr Tollner showed his constituents what he is made of when he rolled over and got his tummy tickled by the Prime Minister and voted for this bill. But we should not be surprised.
We know that the coalition have form when it comes to the location of nuclear facilities. They certainly know how to keep them secret. In 1997, the government considered a short list of 14 possible sites for nuclear research reactors, and they kept the list secret from the public. The confidential briefing—signed with ‘Good work’ by the former science minister, Mr Peter McGauran—said that the short list should be kept secret because release of information about alternative sites may unnecessarily alarm communities in the broad areas under consideration. But it seems that the new generation of coalition MPs do not share Mr McGauran’s caution.
Dr Jensen, the member for Tangney, has the prescription for what ails you. He has already told the parliament:
Having evolved in the surrounding radiation, our bodies not only adapted to radiation but, indeed, need radiation to survive.
In his speech in the second reading debate on this bill, Dr Jensen expanded on his theories on what is good for the people of Western Australia. Just in case honourable senators missed what he had to say, I am more than happy to enlighten them. He said:
I believe that Western Australia should have a role and responsibility to look after its own nuclear waste.
He then went on to say:
The placement of nuclear waste is a matter beyond the concerns of states alone. It is a national concern and a matter that clearly should be dealt with by the federal parliament. This is not a matter for parochial ‘nimbyness’. The ‘not in my backyard’ mentality exists all too freely.
So here we have Dr Jensen, the member for Tangney, the Prime Minister’s favourite whose neck the Prime Minister personally pulled off the chopping block, in spite of the express wishes of the local Liberal Party preselectors, telling parliament that not only should Western Australia be used to store nuclear waste but the Commonwealth should make it happen against the Western Australian state government’s will. According to Dr Jensen, all these people who respectfully disagree with Dr Jensen’s view, people who consider that turning the beautiful expanses of Western Australia into a radioactive rubbish dump is a bad idea are just a bunch of parochial nimbys. The main reason put forward by Dr Jensen for wanting to use Commonwealth power to force Western Australia to become a nuclear rubbish dump was:
... the waste from ... is only harmful for a period of 200 to 300 years.
What a relief. Dr Jensen might feel comfortable leaving a toxic legacy for his great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great grandchildren. But, personally, I am not so comfortable. Dr Jensen finished his speech with an invitation to us all, when he said:
I want to re-encourage members ... to investigate and discover for themselves the exciting technologies that are significantly contributing to the global solutions on nuclear waste.
Dr Jensen has a friend in Mr Wilson Tuckey, the member for O’Connor. In his speech in the second reading debate on this bill, Mr Tuckey told the parliament:
I am neither frightened of nor concerned about a nuclear power industry. In fact, I have advocated for the storage of international nuclear waste in Australia ...
Maybe Mr Tuckey will take up Dr Jensen’s offer and they can both visit Chernobyl together on their next study tour. Maybe at Chernobyl they will get all the beneficial radiation that Dr Jensen would have us exposed to. The waste dump that is being planned by this government is intended to house water from the new reactor presently under construction; the old reactor, which is still operational, including waste from France and the United Kingdom; defence waste held at various sites across Australia, including contaminated soil from the Woomera test site; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation accelerator waste; and other Commonwealth waste. But none of the sites under consideration were short-listed when scientific and environmental criteria were used to assess alternative sites around Australia in 1997.
This is a government that ignores science, ignores economics and ignores the environment. Australia should remember this track record when they consider John Howard’s determination to impose no less than 25 nuclear reactors across Australia. But they are not the only ones being deceptive. That fawning toad Piers Akerman has criticised the Labor Party for its concerns about the potential dangers posed by nuclear reactors. In an article in the Hobart Mercury on 19 June 2006, he said:
... Albanese talked about nuclear safety as if every one—

Can the minister confirm that yesterday’s audit report into the ADF’s military police concluded that the system is so seriously flawed that even with ‘unremitting resolve and commitment’ it will take ‘no less than five years to correct and remedy’? Don’t these findings echo Ernst and Young’s report into the Army military police in 2004, which identified the same deficiencies of a lack of qualified military police and expert forensic skills?

In that context, my supplementary question is this: isn’t it the case that the bungled investigation of Private Kovco’s tragic death occurred because of the military’s lack of forensic skills and experience? Isn’t this the same problem that was clearly identified three years ago by both the Senate committee and Ernst and Young reports?

What response has the government received to its proposals to ensure children at risk of neglect continue to benefit from federal payments to families?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Family Payments</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2006-12-05,"—I thank Senator Troeth for her important question. Australian families are benefiting from coalition policies that are delivering a stronger economy, more jobs, greater security and greater prosperity. As Australia’s economy has grown on this government’s watch, the coalition has placed even more emphasis on helping families, particularly those with children. In fact, senators will recall that total family assistance payments have increased from $14 billion in 1996-97 to nearly $28 billion in 2006-07. Combined with the tax relief the coalition has delivered in recent years, this family assistance has significantly reduced the financial burden on families. The coalition government is committed to continuing to develop policies that provide support and security for Australian families.
Recently, the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs made another significant announcement on family payment policy at the 50th annual conference of the Australian Council of Social Services, most commonly known as ACOSS. While most of the welfare money provided by Australian governments to families is used wisely, in some cases it has to be said this benefit does not flow to children. The sad reality is that, where drugs, alcohol or gambling are a problem, children are often missing out on the basic nutrition, secure housing, clothing and education that we all consider a child’s basic rights. At the ACOSS conference, the minister proposed to allow a proportion of welfare payments to be quarantined to pay for children’s needs in cases where children have been identified as being at risk of neglect. This proposal will not take one cent of welfare from families but it will provide another tool to child protection authorities.
Over the five years between 1999 and 2004, child protection notifications across Australia more than doubled from 107,000 to 235,000. The latest proposal is an important tool in our efforts to promote child protection. This new proposal will be introduced—and I stress this—in consultation with the states. The minister has proposed three steps that he wishes to discuss with state governments: (1) to look at ways in which the current use of the Centrepay facility can be made mandatory in cases already identified by state child protection systems where there is a risk to the child but the child remains with the family; (2) further development in conjunction with state authorities and service deliveries for quarantine payments to be further differentiated for food, clothing, education and other specific needs, and allocated to families using a more refined debit systems; and (3) the application of quarantining provisions in cases of serial truancy. This proposal builds on a recent COAG commitment by state and national leaders to reinforce compulsory school education.
I am pleased to report some positive responses. For example, the Queensland minister for child protection said that if a voucher system could prevent parents blowing money on drugs or alcohol instead of feeding and clothing their kids then it would have merit. The coalition government are committed to continuing to build on supporting Australian families, and we look forward to working with the states and territories towards protecting children at risk.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Family Payments</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,answer

(Question No. 2505)

Senator Allison asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 25 September 2006:
How many Australians lose their lives to fires caused by cigarettes each year.
Can the Minister confirm that in March 2005, Australia’s fire chiefs and all state emergency services ministers unanimously called for the fast tracking of reduced-ignition propensity (RIP) cigarettes legislation.
Have any of the three major tobacco companies operating in Australia voluntarily introduced RIP cigarettes.
Are consumer safety standards for cigarettes routinely set to laboratory standardised conditions; and (b) does this include testing for tar and nicotine yields.
What is the timeframe for further action now that Standards Australia has released the draft standard, Determination of the extinction propensity of cigarettes.

Senator Ellison—The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:
Six deaths per annum.
The Ministers did not call for legislation. The Ministers agreed to the development of a standard for Reduced Ignition Propensity cigarettes. The standard is currently in draft.
No.
The draft standard, Determination of the extinction propensity of cigarettes, does include laboratory standardised conditions.
The draft standard does not include testing for tar and nicotine yields.
The issue was discussed at the Ministerial Council of Police and Emergency Management on 17 November 2006. The Council: agreed to request the Australian Government Treasurer to introduce a compulsory consumer product (Safety) standard under the Trade Practices Act 1974 requiring that all cigarettes manufactured in or imported into Australia must meet an identified performance standard based on that adopted in the USA and Canada. That is, that no more than 25 percent of cigarettes tested in accordance with the Australian Standard will exhibit a full length burn.
New South Wales will lead the development of a Regulatory Impact Statement including consideration of any possible toxicity and liability issues. It is expected that this will take between 12 and 18 months subject to COAG and other processes.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2006-12-05,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.
Before I get to that I want to pay my deepest and most sincere regrets to the community of Oenpelli, who, as we know, lost two teenagers to the awful addictive habit of petrol sniffing last week. One of the four teenagers involved in this incident remains in a critical condition on life support at Royal Darwin Hospital.
In the intervening time between Senator Santoro’s answer to me and now, at five past three, I have had my office re-ring the community of Oenpelli. I notice that Senator Scullion during question time was trying to allude to the fact that Oenpelli has Opal fuel. In fact, I knew my sources were correct. It beggars belief that a minister in question time can have such inaccurate information when it comes to providing answers on such a critical national problem in relation to Indigenous people in this country.
The community council at Oenpelli has Opal fuel for use in its own council vehicles. There is no retail outlet of Opal fuel at Oenpelli—that is, nobody at Oenpelli can buy Opal fuel; it is only bought by the council for use in its own vehicles. So that would mean that in fact it is not accessible to the majority of the community at Oenpelli and it is certainly not available for retail—that is, for public and private use.
My sources tell me that on 28 November—only last week—the community council at Oenpelli approved a request by the service station and its owners in that community to apply for Opal fuel. That request was agreed to by the community council, which will now embark on a joint process with the service station to put in the paperwork to apply for the subsidy. But really the issue here is why this government did not, immediately on receipt of that news, send somebody from Health and Ageing or from Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs straight out to the community to say to them: ‘Don’t worry about the paperwork. Let’s get that done in weeks or months time, but let’s just get Opal rolling in here as fast as we can.’ But a week has gone by and there has been no activity on behalf of this government in relation to what is happening with respect to these young Indigenous people around our country.
In June this year the Senate Community Affairs Committee tabled a report called Beyond petrol sniffing: renewing hope for Indigenous communities. We have referred to this report numerous times. Six months on we are still waiting for this federal government to respond to this report. Let me take you to recommendation 22:
That Commonwealth Government discuss with BP Australia what role they may have to assist the distribution of information on Opal and the distribution of Opal identification stickers.
Recommendation 23 states:
That the Commonwealth and State and Territory Governments examine the procedure at Maningrida—
a community very close to Oenpelli—
whereby contracts are used to prevent contractors bringing regular unleaded petrol into their communities …
These are two recommendations I want to concentrate on in the next couple of minutes, as well as the fact that this report suggests that Opal should be rolled out as soon as possible. The kids at Oenpelli were trying to break into a shipping container of leaded fuel that was going to contractors, so another issue that has now come to light that we did not pick up on in our inquiry is that there could be immediate discussions with land councils about ensuring that nobody, no contractor, gets a permit to go onto those lands to do any work unless they are using unleaded petrol.
In recent weeks there was a debacle in Alice Springs with the shameful advertising and reporting in the media that Opal fuel somehow wrecks cars. We know from our inquiry that that is simply not true. We know that the federal government’s communications backbench is sitting on a strategy to roll out Opal fuel and to advise retailers and consumers in Alice Springs that it has no detrimental effect. We know that they met on 12 December and that nothing will happen until next February.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2006-12-05,"—I want to respond to a question asked by Senator Bishop of the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, Senator Ian Campbell, on the performance of military police surrounding and following the untimely death of Jacob Kovco in Iraq. Jacob Kovco died on 21 April 2006 as a result of a single gunshot wound whilst serving with the Australian security detachment inside the green zone in Baghdad in Iraq. The Chief of Defence, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, appointed a board of inquiry to investigate the facts surrounding the death of Private Kovco, including the incident in which he lost his life, relevant instructions and procedures, and the adequacy of training and equipment involved therewith. The board of inquiry commenced at Victoria Barracks in Sydney on 19 June 2006.
Defence went to great lengths to accommodate an open and transparent inquiry in the face of serious safety concerns for many of the witnesses involved, who were serving at the time in a potentially lethal operational environment. That is why all deployed personnel involved in the inquiry were referred to by a randomly chosen number rather than by name. This measure ensured that Defence provided these personnel with the confidence that their evidence would not jeopardise their safety, the safety of people they were charged with protecting or the safety or privacy of their family members. The measure ceased immediately upon the return of the soldiers to Australia.
The board was headed by Group Captain Warren Cook, an RAAF specialist reservist who is also a retired magistrate and a former coroner. He was supported by a civilian member, Jim O’Sullivan, a former Queensland Commissioner of Police, and Colonel Michael Charles, a reservist with an extensive military background. The board was also assisted by a number of witnesses and subject matter experts from the New South Wales Police Service investigations branch, forensic and ballistics specialists and leaders in the field of psychiatry. As a result of the report that I believe was presented yesterday, the Chief of Defence, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, acknowledged a number of shortcomings in the performance of the military police. The Air Chief Marshal has said that those shortcomings have been observed and identified and that he is going to conduct a proper response to those so that appropriate action can be taken.
This matter is one of ongoing concern. There has been a number of inquiries on this. Also, with respect to boards of inquiry, we have undertaken substantial reform wherein a number of civilian personnel have been enabled through amendments to the defence inquiry regulations to be contracted into supervised boards of inquiry.
The point of all this is that, as far back as 2005, the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee inquiry into the effectiveness of Australia’s military justice system made a number of recommendations and the government response was quite emphatic, with more than 30 of the 40 recommendations accepted. One of those committee recommendations was that:
... the ADF conduct a tri-service audit of current military police staffing, equipment, training and resources to determine the current capacity of the criminal investigations services. This audit should be conducted in conjunction with a scoping exercise to examine the benefit of creating a tri-service criminal investigation unit.
This recommendation has been undertaken. The government will conduct a tri-service audit of service police to establish the best means for developing investigative capability. These establishments are underway and are being conducted.
The problem is that the Australian Defence Force is under intense operational requirements at the moment in Iraq—and may I say that I have been to Iraq—Afghanistan, the Solomons, Fiji and East Timor. This has put an enormous burden upon the Australian Defence Force. Angus Houston, the Chief of Defence, has committed to sorting these matters out. I have great faith in his ability to do that.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2006-12-05,"—I also rise to take note of the response Senator Santoro gave to us this afternoon on the question about petrol sniffing. I agree totally with one of the comments that Senator Santoro made, and that was his opening comment that the issue around petrol sniffing is a complex one. There is no doubt about that. Along with Senator Crossin, I want to—as I am sure we all do—send my deepest thoughts and sympathy to the community of Oenpelli as they struggle with the loss of two more of their children to the scourge of petrol sniffing, and also the prospective loss of other kids facing this horror.
However, I want to continue with comments we have made before in this place. I see that Senator Siewert, who has also spoken on this issue, is in the chamber. It is now six months after the extensive inquiry we had into the issue of petrol sniffing where we were able to receive evidence from so many people who acknowledged how bad the problem was, acknowledged the complex reasons behind the problem and also shared that there were ways forward. One of the many ways forward was the access to Opal fuel. It is particularly frustrating that we cannot get a clear answer.
The minister today tells us that some Opal fuel has been rolled out to the community. We have other information that that is not widespread and that the major suppliers of fuel in the community are not Opal exclusive. That is such a simple issue in regard to what we were able to find out about how petrol sniffing affects communities. We know that where there is access to petrol, for a whole range of reasons to do with community development and community opportunities, people will turn to petrol sniffing—not just Indigenous people. This is not just an issue that has an impact on Indigenous people, but today, particularly in the community of Oenpelli, there are a number of young Indigenous people who are suffering from the end result of the ineffective process of engaging people not only locally and federally but also, most importantly, individually in families to work together to address the range of complaints.
What we have is uncertainty even though six months ago representatives from the federal government, from the Territory government and from a range of local communities could spell out really clearly what needed to occur. What was needed was to make sure that Opal fuel was available in communities and to make sure there was a widespread personalised education program about options and about what people could do to regain hope in their communities, not just for the young people involved but also for the people who supply and sell fuel so that they could see that they had a particular role to play.
Increasingly we found similar shared experiences. People were repeating the same questions but they also knew the answers. What we did not have was action. We heard from the department, FaCSIA at the time, and OIPC that there was a plan in place that was going to be implemented immediately but also with a long rollout time to ensure that, while there would not be an immediate solution, they knew what had to happen. There was a sense of confidence that, whilst these issues about the impact of fuel, a relatively cheap substance which people could take to remove themselves emotionally from whatever was troubling them, have been discussed for so long—in fact we had people going back 20 and 30 years—people understood the problem.
What I am offended by is that we only ever seem to see the headlines; we only ever seem to get responses or action when there is a tragedy. The fact that some young people have died has actually refocused the attention of the community on the issue. We should not need those tragedies. We should be able to take the recommendations of our committee report. We should be able to take the goodwill, intelligence and knowledge of a range of people who came and gave evidence to that committee and we should be able to take the clear understanding of what needs to happen and make it happen. Instead we hear again of tragedy, when we should be hearing of successes where communities have taken the opportunity to improve what is going on and ensure their kids are not dying. That should be our expectation.
I would hope that when the minister comes back to the chamber with the extended information that he has promised today, we will be able to get some confirmation of exactly what the response of the department is going to be. I do not want to come back when we meet again in February to hear more stories about communities where, during the wet season when there was no other activity, when there was no community involvement, more kids have died.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2006-12-05,"—I rise to take note of the answer given by Senator Ian Campbell to a question from Senator Bishop in question time in relation to the report of an audit of the Australian Defence Force investigative capability. The audit report into the ADF investigative capability has resulted from the government’s response to a Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee inquiry tabled in 2005 into military justice—a report which has been much discussed in this chamber in very many of its aspects and a report which has had far-reaching ramifications both in the broad of the Australian Defence Force and for many of the Defence Force community. The sixth recommendation of the military justice report was:
… that the ADF conduct a tri-service audit of current military police staffing, equipment, training and resources to determine the current capacity of the criminal investigations services. This audit should be conducted in conjunction with a scoping exercise to examine the benefit of creating a tri-service criminal investigation unit.
What we have before us today, made available publicly by the Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, is the result of the acceptance by the government of that recommendation in full. Even a cursory glance at the report, made public this week by the chief and produced by Adrien Whiddett and Rear Admiral Adams, shows that the government has responded comprehensively to the recommendation of the Senate inquiry. The report in eight or nine chapters is a very forensic examination of the current operations of service investigation processes and makes a raft of recommendations, I understand numbering 99, all of which are accepted by the chief and by government for implementation.
The report goes to the effort of examining the different nature of ADF investigations as compared to civilian investigations in many cases. It contemplates the different environment in which those investigations are conducted and that is a very important aspect of this particular area of Defence Force activity and something which, I believe it is fair to say, came to the Senate committee inquiry’s attention on more than one occasion. But we are not talking about apples and apples when we are talking about civilian investigative approaches and military investigative approaches; we are, in fact, talking in many cases about apples and oranges, to use that tired metaphor.
The report goes on to look at the current service police investigative capability, the legislation, the policy and the doctrine that underlies all of those activities and the powers that are provided to service police. It looks at the training that currently exists within the organisations within the different services and how appropriate the resources devoted to this area are. The report then provides a very comprehensive examination of new service police command, of organisation and conditions of service arrangement and then, very usefully, I think, the eighth chapter of the report looks at an action plan for how this is to be implemented.
One of the most important things to do in the chamber this afternoon is to acknowledge Adrien Whiddett and Rear Admiral Adams for the work they have done on this very comprehensive audit. It is a very valuable tool both for the ADF and for those members of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee, chaired by Senator David Johnston, who continue to have an oversight role, as you would be more than well aware, Mr Deputy President, on this particular aspect of military justice. It is one on which the implementation team, headed by Rear Admiral Mark Bonser and colleagues, reports regularly through the CDF to the Senate committee. We have discussed at least one of those reports as well in this chamber. The responsiveness of the ADF to some of the very serious concerns raised through the military justice inquiry, and the preparedness of the ADF to accept all 99 of these recommendations, some of which are very sweeping and some of which canvass the serious issues which we had already identified—in many cases with the service investigative capability—and implement them, is a very good sign.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2006-12-05,"—I rise to take note of answers by Senator Campbell to questions from me and Senator Hogg. I was going to make some remarks generally on the issue of military justice, on the reaction of the government to the Kovco inquiry and on the more recent release of the audit report, which both Senator Johnston and Senator Payne have more than adequately addressed in this debate. But I think it is time to place on the record the outrage being felt by the opposition in the way the Minister representing the Minister for Defence in this place deliberately chooses to go about his work and about his business.
In the last two days three questions have been asked on the Joint Strike Fighter project, Private Kovco and military justice. The last question was on Seasprite helicopters. Over the last six to 12 months there has been a huge amount of press on each of those issues. There has also been constant questioning and debate in the various committees of this parliament, and the minister himself has made numerous press releases on each of those issues. They are topical, they are of public interest and they involve, in some instances, huge outlays of taxpayers’ dollars. Any reasonably competent person acting as a representative in this chamber would have properly anticipated that an opposition would ask questions on those topical issues, as we have indicated repeatedly, via press release and other mechanisms, that we would.
But the response from Senator Campbell has been characterised by ignorance, belligerence, bullying and a refusal to answer. His response is insulting, offensive, ignorant and, twice today, just plain wrong. His response is insulting to the Senate in that legitimate questions which should properly be anticipated are not answered. It is not that the department has not provided a brief, and it is not that there are not numerous references in the files as to the questions and possible suggestions for answers, but because the minister refuses to bring the brief into this place and, if he does, he refuses to open it to read the agenda and see where the brief is located. That is nothing other than insulting to the proper role of the Senate.
Secondly, as well as being insulting, his answers are offensive to the family of Private Kovco and offensive to thousands of people in the armed forces who want to represent their country and who expect to be protected by just laws passed by their government. Senator Campbell’s response is offensive to both of those interest groups. Worse, for a minister representing an important portfolio in this area, Senator Campbell is ignorant of the government’s own policy and decisions in both areas.
With regard to the audit report, both Senator Johnston and Senator Payne outlined that the government has released it. It was made pursuant to a recommendation by the Senate inquiry and had 99 recommendations. The government and the Chief of the Defence Force have publicly, via a media release, accepted each of those recommendations. But Senator Campbell’s response was, ‘We will get round to it in due course; it’s an important matter but we haven’t yet had the opportunity to do it.’ Two days ago the government made a response. Two days ago the government said that it would accept the 99 recommendations. What is worse—to be lazy or to be incompetent? In the case of Senator Campbell, it is both. It is deliberate and it is belligerent. He refuses to answer questions, he refuses to make himself familiar with the work he has been allocated and he refuses even to open the file that has the answers to questions that can reasonably be anticipated.
In respect of the report into Private Kovco, that has been in the press almost every day for the last nine months. When the government released its response via the chief of the armed forces, it put out a 30-part implementation plan addressing each of the recommendations and a time plan for implementation.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2006-12-05,"—On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Customs, I present the government’s response to the report of the former Finance and Public Administration References Committee on its inquiry into regional partnerships and sustainable regions programs, and I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
SENATE REPORT FINANCE AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REFERENCES COM-MITTEE REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS AND SUSTAINABLE REGIONS PROGRAMMES GOVERNMENT RESPONSE
November 2006

Introduction

On 2 December 2004 the Senate referred a number of matters to the Finance and Public Administration References Committee (the Committee) regarding the administration of the Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions programmes.
The Committee tabled its report in the Senate on 6 October 2005. The report comprised a majority report and a minority report from Government Senators.

Government Response

The majority report of the Committee responds to allegations of misuse of the programmes in the period prior to the 2004 election, serious impropriety in approval and announcement processes, concealed processes and political conditions placed on grants. The report fails to substantiate any of these allegations and reaches the conclusion that the administration of both programmes is ‘reasonably sound’.
The Government welcomes this finding and with it the bipartisan endorsement of the role of the Area Consultative Committee (ACC) network and Sustainable Regions Advisory Committees (SRACs) in delivering positive outcomes for Australian communities.
The minority report highlights the hundreds of successful projects across the country and the benefits these projects are providing to local communities. Some $250 million has been approved for nearly 1000 projects identified by local communities as high priority since 2001.
Six case studies cited in the Report from which the majority of conclusions have been drawn are atypical of most projects funded.
Two of these projects (Primary Energy and Beaudesert Rail) were originally assessed under arrangements that existed prior to commencement of the Regional Partnerships programme.
In two of the six cases (A2 Dairy Marketers and Tumbi Creek) no Australian Government funds had been spent at the conclusion of the Inquiry, and approval for the A2 Dairy Marketers project had been withdrawn.
The Committee found no evidence of inappropriate interference by Ministers in the assessment of projects and has not identified any breach of the established caretaker conventions prior to the 2004 election.
The Committee also received evidence in this Inquiry that the distribution of approved projects closely reflects the pattern of applications received. The Government encourages all Senators and Members of Parliament across all States and electorates to work with their local communities to identify worthwhile projects within their communities that may be eligible for assistance under the Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions programmes.
The majority report claims to have been hindered by a lack of cooperation by the Department of Transport and Regional Services (DOTARS). It is critical of claimed “misleading information” provided by the Department to ACCs and for failure to table all documents sought by the Committee, particularly in relation to the Department’s advice to Ministers.
The Department operated over the course of this Inquiry within long-standing conventions accepted by successive Governments relating to non-disclosure of advice provided to Ministers. The Department’s position was supported by advice from across the public service and Ministers. Consistent with that advice, the approval of the Minister was sought before documents were released to the Committee.

RESPONSE TO RECOMMENDATIONS


Response to Majority Report Recommendations


Regional Partnerships Program


Recommendation 1: The Committee recommends that the operation of the SONA guidelines cease.


Government Response – Noted

The Government announced on 15 November 2005 that changes to the Regional Partnerships programme will permit the Government to direct a pool of funds within the Regional Partnerships programme for specific investment priorities which may not otherwise be brought forward by Area Consultative Committees (ACCs). 1

The Regional Partnerships programme has been used by the Government to deliver associated programmes. One such example is the Rural Medical Infrastructure Fund, which is based on Regional Partnerships programme guidelines but is also subject to specific criteria. These criteria are published on the Regional Partnerships web site. When new Government priority areas are identified, additional or modified guidelines or criteria may be issued as required, and published on the Regional Partnerships web site.
The SONA procedures have not been used since August 2004 and it is considered that special considerations such as those made under SONA procedures will no longer be required.

Recommendation 2: The Committee recommends it be mandatory for all Regional Partnerships program applications to be developed in consultation with local Area Consultative Committees.

Government Response – Disagree
It is usual practice for ACCs to be consulted in relation to Regional Partnerships applications, however, it is important that the Government maintains the ability to fund projects which have not come to its attention through the work of ACCs and which it regards as a high strategic priority. It is also important for reasons of fairness that applicants retain the ability to have an application assessed under the programme even if it is not supported by an ACC.

Recommendation 3: The Committee recommends that Area Consultative Committees must receive relevant applications and be afforded an opportunity to consider and make recommendations not less than ten working days from receipt of the application.

Government Response – Agree
This is existing practice under the Regional Partnerships programme. It is normal practice for ACCs to comment on applications and generally have at least ten working days for comments.
See response to Recommendation 2.

Recommendation 4: The Committee recommends that the Department of Transport and Regional Services incorporates and outlines appropriate assessment procedures for multi-region funding applications into the published Regional Partnerships guidelines.

Government Response – Agree in part
There has never been an impediment to multi-region projects under the Regional Partnerships programme. The published guidelines apply to multi-regional projects.
As part of the Government’s proposed enhancements to the Regional Partnerships programme, DOTARS Regional Offices will work with local ACCs to facilitate the development of quality projects including the coordination of projects which cross ACC boundaries.2

Recommendation 5: The Committee recommends that multi-region funding applications be referred to all relevant Area Consultative Committees for review comments and recommendations.

Government Response - Agree
This is existing practice under the Regional Partnerships programme.
See also response to Recommendations 2 and 3.

Recommendation 6: The Committee recommends that a biannual statement be tabled in the Senate by the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, listing:
the Regional Partnerships program grants approved in the preceding six month period;
the Department of Transport and Regional Services and Area Consultative Committee’s recommendations; and
where the funding decision is inconsistent with the departmental and/or Area Consultative Committee recommendation, a statement of the reasons for the decision.

Government Response – Disagree
The Government is not persuaded that this proposal would improve programme accountability. The publication of advice concerning recommendations made to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services by departmental advisers and by other bodies such as ACCs, is not supported. Publication of such advice would make it difficult for ACCs to provide a critical assessment of projects. This approach is consistent with long-standing practice in relation to the confidentiality of departmental advice to Ministers.
A list of all projects funded under both programmes is already available on the Department’s web site.

Recommendation 7: The Committee recommends that the Government address inequities in the distribution of Regional Partnerships program funding consistent with the ANAO Better Practice Guide.

Government Response – Agree in part
The distribution of approved projects reflects closely the pattern of applications received. ACCs are already required to ensure equitable distribution of projects within their regions under key performance indicators imposed by the Department.
In accordance with ANAO’s Better Practice Guide, all applications for funding under the Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions programmes, are assessed “in accordance with requirements of procedural fairness” (page 45).

Recommendation 8: The Committee recommends that the exclusion of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) from eligibility for Regional Partnerships program funding be rescinded.

Government Response – Agree
Current programme policy permits Australian territories to apply for funding. However the programme guidelines do not permit the funding of projects which would result in cost-shifting from Territory Governments to the Australian Government. Guidelines will be changed to clarify Territory government eligibility.

Recommendation 9: The Committee recommends that the Government review resourcing of Area Consultative Committees, and training for committee members and employees, to ensure that they can adequately perform their role in relation to the Regional Partnerships program.

Government Response – Agree
See also response to Recommendation 10.

Recommendation 10: The Committee recommends the introduction of three-year operational funding contracts for Area Consultative Committees.

Government Response – Agree
The Government announced on 15 November 2005 that funding to meet the annual operating costs of ACCs, which is currently met from within the funds appropriated to the Regional Partnerships programme as a whole, will be separately identified and ACCs will be allocated funding in accordance with a three year contract.
This three year contract will encourage ACCs to continue to facilitate other Government programmes though they will not be permitted to reduce the level of effort involved in developing suitable Regional Partnerships projects.
The operational funding appropriation for ACCs will also be indexed within existing appropriations. 3

Recommendation 11: The Committee recommends that the Government negotiates with each Area Consultative Committee in relation to key performance indicators including job creation and partnership support, to ensure performance measures are regionally appropriate.

Government Response – Agree in part
Key performance indicators currently apply to ACCs to ensure programme objectives are met. Performance indicators for ACCs will be reviewed this year. While the review will involve consultation with ACCs, effective measurement of ACC performance and performance across the Regional Partnerships programme, requires a national set of indicators.
The Government announced on 15 November 2005 that the Minister for Transport and Regional Services will provide written advice and guidelines each year to ACCs outlining the Government’s broad policy priorities for the Regional Partnerships programme.4

Recommendation 12: The Committee recommends that Area Consultative Committee recommendations be disclosed to funding applicants on request.

Government Response - Disagree
The Department provides unsuccessful applicants with advice setting out the reasons their projects did not meet the programme’s criteria, including the extent of support for the project. It is not appropriate to release the views of ACCs or other bodies and individuals which are provided to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services in the course of considering the merits of individual projects. To do so would reduce the ability of ACCs to provide a frank assessment of the priority of individual projects.

Recommendation 13: The Committee recommends that the Government conduct a review of the role of Area Consultative Committees to ensure that their contribution to regional development is maximised.

Government Response - Disagree
The Inquiry report reaches positive conclusions regarding the role of ACCs. ACCs often make suggestions for improvements to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and the Department which are often adopted. The need for a further review is not considered necessary at this time beyond the normal processes for ensuring continuous improvement.
The Government is implementing a series of changes to improve the effectiveness of ACCs and their governance arrangements that were announced on 15 November 2005. These changes include:
local communities and local Members of Parliament will be consulted more extensively by ACCs in the process of developing each ACC’s strategic regional plan;
funding to meet the annual operating costs of ACCs, which is currently met from within the funds appropriated to the Regional Partnerships programme as a whole, will be separately identified and ACCs will be allocated funding in accordance with a three year contract;
the Government will appoint the Chair and Deputy Chair of each ACC, and provide guidelines for the appointment of other members to help committees be representative of the communities they serve; and
ACC boundaries will be reviewed to ensure boundaries of rural ACCs reflect areas of common interest, and consider whether the boundaries and number of metropolitan ACCs are appropriate.5

Sustainable Regions Program


Recommendation 14: The Committee recommends that the appointment process for Sustainable Regions Advisory Committee members, including selection criteria, be made public.

Government Response – Disagree
It is not usual practice to disclose the reasons for the appointment or non-appointment of Board members. The case has not been made to depart from that convention in relation to this programme.

Recommendation 15: The Committee recommends that the Government adopt a skills-based approach in relation to the appointment of future Sustainable Regions Advisory Committees, including the two new bodies announced during the 2004 election campaign.

Government Response - Agree
This has been the approach adopted.

Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions Programs


Recommendation 16: The Committee recommends that the Australian National Audit Office audit the administration of the Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions programs, with particular reference to case studies highlighted in this report.

Government Response – Noted
The Australian National Audit Office is conducting a performance audit of the Regional Partnerships programme in 2006.

Recommendation 17: The Committee recommends that projects that cannot obtain or have not yet obtained relevant approvals or licences not be eligible for Regional Partnerships or Sustainable Regions funding.

Government Response – Agree in part
This is already generally the case. However, there are some instances where it is not appropriate to insist on development approvals ahead of assessment. For instance, a community group that has raised funds through raffles and similar activities should not necessarily be forced to use those funds seeking approvals while there is high uncertainty about a project proceeding because they have not secured programme funding. In such cases approvals are made subject to securing relevant consents.

Recommendation 18: The Committee recommends that competitive neutrality procedures be strengthened, including the introduction of a procedure for potential competitors to lodge objections.

Government Response – Agree in part
The Government announced on 15 November 2005 that greater emphasis will be placed on assessment of competitive neutrality issues associated with applications. Projects where assistance greater than $25,000 is sought for a business or commercial venture will require a statement from the ACC Chair that identifies any competitive neutrality risks posed by the project, prior to the assessment of the project for funding approval.6

Recommendation 19: The Committee recommends that due diligence procedures be strengthened, including a routine inquiry into legal action against applicants.

Government Response – Disagree
Due diligence is already assessed rigorously. The scope to continually improve processes will be reviewed. It is not considered appropriate to exclude consideration of an applicant due to pending legal action as such action may have no basis.

Recommendation 20: The Committee recommends that no funding be approved for projects that do not meet Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions guidelines and fail other tests including proper due diligence.

Government Response – Agree in part
See response to Recommendation 1.

Recommendation 21: The Committee recommends that it become formal policy that ministers and their staff are kept strictly at arm’s length from decisions, including all relevant departmental advice, on applications from their own electorates. The portfolio minister and his or her staff should not be included in the circulation of departmental advice on applications for projects in the minister’s electorate.

Government Response – Agree in part
The Government announced on 15 November 2005 that funding approval will be subject to decision by a new Committee comprising the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, and the Special Minister for State.
The Committee has adopted the practice that, where there is consideration of a project in the electorate of one of the Ministers, the Minister in question does not take part in the decision-making process.
However, the Government considers that Ministers should retain the normal capacity of Members and Senators to make representations on behalf of their constituents in respect of an application for funding.

Recommendation 22: The Committee recommends that Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, and their staff, should be prohibited from intervening in the assessment of grants.

Government Response – Agree in principle
No evidence of inappropriate interference has been identified by the Inquiry.

Recommendation 23: The Committee recommends that from 1 July preceding a general election, the following procedures apply to grant approvals and announcements: when a Minister’s decision to approve or not approve a grant is different to the recommendation of either the Area Consultative Committee or the Department, or the funding amount approved is different from the amount recommended, then the grant approval decision be made in conjunction with the relevant Shadow Minister. The Committee further recommends that all grants approved in these circumstances be jointly announced by the Minister and the Shadow Minister.

Government Response - Disagree
Established caretaker conventions already exist which prescribe grant decision making practice ahead of an election. The Committee found no evidence that there was any breach of caretaker conventions prior to the 2004 election in the case of these programmes.

Recommendation 24: The Committee recommends that the government develops and discloses procedures to govern cessation or transition of Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions programs.

Government Response – Agree in principle
As such transitions are now complete, there would appear no need for such procedures. However, this recommendation will be considered should such circumstances again eventuate.

Recommendation 25: The Committee recommends that the government reviews the efficacy of a grants-based approach to regional development.

Government Response - Disagree
The Government is committed to a grants-based approach to regional development.
The Stronger Regions Statement of 2001 sets out the Australian Government’s policy for regional development which contains the following principles:
regions and communities taking responsibility for dealing with the challenges and opportunities confronting them;
the Australian Government standing by as a partner to help regions and communities realise the future they want for themselves; and
a recognition that regions and communities almost always have a better understanding of their needs and opportunities than central agencies or governments.

Recommendation 26: The Committee recommends that the Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions programs should complement, not compete with state and local government funding programs.

Government Response – Agree
Regional programmes are aimed at working partnerships with a wide range organisations, government agencies and businesses.
The programmes leverage on average three dollars for every dollar of Australian Government support. State and/or local governments are funding partners in relation to the majority of projects. Contributions to projects by state governments equate to an average of $0.93 for every $1 of support from the Australian Government under the Regional Partnerships programme. Contributions to projects by funding co-partners (including state governments) equates to an average of $2.15 for every $1 funded under the Sustainable Regions programme.

Response to Minority Report Recommendations


Recommendation 1: The Government Senators recommend that the Government promotes the RP and SR programs and educates the public on how the programs work, to restore the public’s confidence in these programs following the misperceptions generated by this inquiry.

Government Response - Agree
Options to best promote the support available under these initiatives are being considered. Area Consultative Committees and Sustainable Regions Advisory Committees will continue to play a key role in assisting their regions to understand the programme guidelines to enable them to access this assistance.

Recommendation 2: The Government Senators recommend that the Key Performance Indicators be promoted publicly, to assist in educating the public about the benefits of the programs and the outstanding returns delivered to local communities.

Government Response - Agree
Key performance indicators for ACCs have been put on the Regional Partnerships and ACC web pages (www.regionalpartnerships.gov.au and www.acc.gov.au). Aggregate results against indicators will be published when available.

Recommendation 3: Government Senators recommend that project applications requiring co-funding be considered simultaneously by the relevant levels of government.

Government Response - Disagree
Implementation of this proposal could adversely affect applicants and could delay approval of applications. State and local government programmes have different mechanisms for considering proposals, including annual funding rounds.

Recommendation 4: Government Senators recommend that restrictions on ACC media activities be lessened.

Government Response - Disagree
As organisations that receive the majority of their funding from the Australian Government, it is appropriate that the current procedures for marketing of ACC activities be retained so that consistent messages about programmes and the ACC network can be communicated.

Recommendation 5: Government Senators recommend that template marketing material be developed for only minor adjustment by individual ACCs.

Government Response – Agree
ACCs are provided with generic marketing material. Templates that ACCs can tailor for their own purposes are being developed as part of ongoing support for ACCs.

Recommendation 6: Government Senators recommend that ACCs be advised of grant approvals in advance, and that they be encouraged to assist with arranging grant announcements and any follow up matters relevant to their local projects.

Government Response – Agree in part
Members of Parliament and Senators are encouraged to include their local ACCs in the announcement of successful applicants and any subsequent public events including launches and openings.

"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-12-05,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
Better late than never: 14 months after this very important committee report was presented to the Senate, we see this document presented. Having had the opportunity to look at the document, I now know why—because this is a feeble response to a very important committee report which was presented to the Senate. In the last sitting week of 2006, we see this document presented.
Let me remind the Senate that this report shows that the government had taken advantage of its stewardship of the public purse to fund projects willy-nilly around the country, with more regard to its electoral prospects than to the interests of the taxpayer, fairness or proper process. As a result, quite a number of recommendations—some of which have actually been accepted by the government—were proposed by this committee. Let me remind the Senate that I said when the report was presented that it was a report which would shock the nation, and indeed it did. At that time, I named some projects where the spending total of $5 million was to do such things as fund a steam train that would not go, a creek that dredged itself, a milk company that folded before the ink on the funding announcement was dry, an ethanol company worth $1 that still has yet to produce a drop of fuel and a hotel funded to run ‘Wacky Wednesdays’ and stunt bikini babes while other communities on the Atherton tableland cry out for potable drinking water. What a travesty!
And, 14 months later, what particular matters was the government keen not to agree to in this report? Surprise, surprise, from the point of view of the majority report of the committee: the government has declined to agree with those recommendations which allowed better scrutiny of the government’s ad-min-istration of this program, ‘regional rorts’. That is what the public came to know this program as. ‘Regional rorts’ were editorialised around the country as shocking misbehaviour by this government in the exercise of its administrative responsibilities—spend-ing from the public purse basically for the purpose of funding the government’s election campaign rather than really funding the interests of regional Australia.
We see that, where the committee recommended that area consultative committee recommendations be disclosed to funding applicants, the government disagreed. Where the committee recommended that the government conduct a review of the role of area consultative committees to ensure their contribution to regional development is maximised, the government disagreed. Where the committee recommended that biannual statements be tabled in the Senate by the minister representing Minister for Transport and Regional Services, listing the Regional Partnership Program grants approved in the preceding six-month period, the Department of Transport and Regional Services’ and the area consultative committees’ recommendations, the government disagreed. Where the committee recommended that, where funding decisions were inconsistent with the department and/or area consultative committee recommendations, a statement for the reason for the decision be tabled, the government disagreed. Where the committee recommended that, to avoid the suggestion that this program was being used simply as a means of courting electoral approval as we got close to an election, the government effectively extend the caretaker provision of this program, the government disagreed.
In relation to the Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions programs, better known around the country as ‘regional rorts’, we have seen that this government is keen to maintain the ability to use this program for the purpose of funding its electoral campaigns, in effect, putting money into regions where it either thinks it needs to build up its support to retain a seat or is seeking to campaign to take a seat—potentially, probably from one of the Independents in this parliament, as they attempted to with the seat of New England at the last election.
The public has had enough of issues such as the abuse of process that was involved in the Tumbi Creek grant. Two grants were announced by the Prime Minister. But we found out that, before there was approval of the process, storms had led to a partial dredging of the creek—in other words, the ordinary course of running water from the storm had done part of the job that the Commonwealth was going to pay for. We saw a steam train in Queensland that ceased to operate even though over $1 million had been paid towards the project. We saw, on the Atherton tablelands, a hotel being given funds to improve its competitive position in relation to others in that town—but, in the same community, we found a town that had drinking water that was barely drinkable and water pressure that did not allow the community to fight fire. What a travesty! What an outrageous performance by this government—and no contrition at all in relation to this program.
What the government are keen to do is maintain their ability to pump money out during the lead-up to an election campaign and make promises during an election campaign without the constraint of actually having to show that the projects have the support of the organisations that the government has set up to, in part, vet these projects—the area consultative committees. They are not prepared to show the public that this body that they have set up that is supposed to have the expertise to deal with these matters, that is supposed to have the interests of the region at heart and that is impartial to government supports the project. They are not even prepared to say that. They are not even prepared to say that where there is a disagreement between the government and this body—this body that the government are setting up; they have total control over who is on this body—the government will make a statement of reasons or actually publish that fact.
They are not prepared to allow the applicants who think that perhaps they are not being properly dealt with by the area consultative committee to know whether the area consultative committee actually approved their application in the process of consideration by government. What the government are clearly indicating here is that they intend to go through the same process again. They intend to follow the discredited process of using this program in the way that has become known—as a series of regional rorts to deliver electoral advantage to the government.
I think the Australian community has had enough of this. I think the Australian community expects that, as taxpayers, when they pay money this government will account for the way they use it and account properly. I think the Australian community is sick and tired of governments using their money simply as a means of currying electoral favour. When the government makes these announcements they had better be prepared for a backlash. It may seem that there are opportunities for electoral advantage, but the reality is that a lot of people in the community are going to be asking questions about how this is being funded, who is paying for it, what the process has been and why other projects which are in the pipeline did not get funded when the ones that the government selected did get funded.
This will become a poisoned chalice for the government. When it comes to the consideration of these projects, the opposition will be pointing out to the Australian people that this government wants to shield from the public the way that they handle this process, just as they shielded from the committee originally the determinations by the department and details of the particular projects, where even the department’s advice was overturned by ministers so that the minister could deliver the political advantage that they thought they had.
I was going to seek leave to continue my remarks, but Senator Forshaw is going to seek the call, and perhaps there will be someone else. This is a very shabby response to the committee’s report. It is eight months late, inadequate and one to which we will return and make sure the public is aware of. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Finance and Public Administration References Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,21,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2006-12-05,"—I rise to speak to this motion to take note of the government response to the report of the former Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee into the Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions programs. As Senator O’Brien has pointed out, it is a totally inadequate response to that report. It is a totally inadequate response, I believe, to the very serious, important and constructive recommendations made in the majority report. It is particularly inadequate because it has been 14 months since the report was handed down and we get the response from the government to it in the very last days of this year’s parliament. The report was tabled in October 2005 and it has taken almost 14 months for the government to present what I believe is pretty much a pathetic response.
I note that the government response indicates that they agree with a number of the recommendations, or agree in part with a number of the recommendations, of the committee, and I welcome that. But the government have rejected the substantial recommendations, the key recommendations that go to the heart of better accountability and particularly accountability to the parliament.
I note that the government tries to make some capital out of the fact that the committee’s report found the overall administration of the programs to be reasonably sound. We did, and we have always said as an opposition that these programs, properly administered—certainly, the Regional Partnerships program—were a worthwhile way of funding important projects to promote employment and development in regional areas, particularly in areas that had otherwise undergone significant restructuring with the downsizing of rural industries or that had suffered economic hardship more than the rest of the country. The fact that the committee found that does not mean the government can just escape responsibility for the substantial and glaring inadequacies in the administration of the program.
The government response says:
Six case studies cited in the Report from which the majority of conclusions have been drawn are atypical of most projects funded.
The fact of the matter is that the committee, in the time it had available, took the approach of looking at six very important projects or case studies that had been funded under these programs. The flaws, poor administration and political interference in those case studies were substantial. The amounts of money that were involved were substantial. In the case of Beaudesert Rail, for instance, it was of the order of almost $6 million—$6 million of public money put into a venture which was pretty much doomed from the outset, no matter what the good intentions of the proponents were. There was a litany of mistakes and a litany of failure to take action at a time when it would have prevented a substantial waste of taxpayers’ funds.
The Atherton Hotel project has become notorious. I notice that Senator Carr is in the chamber. I am sure he can comment even more about the scandal—
—The tabletop dancers!
—Yes, the tabletop dancers project, as it was referred to. Other worthwhile projects were simply ignored or not considered in any proper way.
There was the Tumbi Creek fiasco, where money was advanced for a project to dredge a creek. There were serious questions about whether it was an appropriate project, given the wider consideration of problems in that region. When the money was no longer needed because the rain actually flushed out the creek and the dredging was not required, attempts were made to divert these funds to some other projects. There is no doubt in my mind that there was political interference by people associated with it—indeed, members of the coalition parties. That evidence was overwhelming. There was evidence that staff of ministers had engaged in an exchange of secret emails to divert those funds to other works.
When we tried to have that matter brought before the Privileges Committee—and, from my recollection, the President concluded that it should have been given precedence in going to the Privileges Committee—the government used its numbers to stop that. That is the only occasion that longstanding members on that committee can recall where a matter was not referred to the Privileges Committee when there was a clear, prima facie case of political interference.
This government just says: ‘Oh well, there are only six projects that the committee looked at. They were atypical.’ Then they say, ‘In the case of Tumbi Creek and A2 Dairy Marketers, no Australian government funds were spent by the conclusion of the inquiry.’ That is not the point. The reason that the funds were not ultimately spent was that the facts were out in the open and, in the end, the government became embarrassed and pulled the funds. The facts are that this committee looked at the processes involved in considering the applications that had been lodged and whether they had been approved or rejected by the department and, ultimately, by the minister.
There was evidence of other projects where, after the area consultative committee had considered the merits of a proposal, the department determined that in their considered view the projects should not receive funding. Yet those projects did receive funding. It seemed to be a situation where the government, or somebody, had decided: ‘Maybe it should proceed. It is in a marginal electorate, and there is an election coming up.’ That is all on the record.
The other point I want to draw attention to in the time I have available—and I think we could speak for a lot longer about this extensive inquiry—are the steps that were taken by the department to, in my view, sandbag the operation of the committee and prevent the committee from carrying out its properly constituted task of conducting this inquiry into this substantial government funded program. We sought information from the area consultative committees—documentation and other forms of information—about projects that they had considered. After the committee had written seeking that information, the department wrote to the area consultative committees and told them that they did not have to comply with our request. They gave them advice that privacy considerations meant that they really had not only no obligation to comply with the Senate committee’s request but also probably a duty not to comply. When it was pointed out that that was really a severe interference with the committee’s processes and was also incorrect legal advice, the department then said, ‘It’s up to you to decide if you want to comply.’ In the end, of course, we received the information but it took us a lot of effort. In fact, in the end we had to subpoena some of that information in a couple of cases. This committee was hamstrung by the failure of departmental officials who were maybe acting on instructions not to cooperate—I believe that, but testing it is another issue. I think this is a totally inadequate response. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

SENATE REPORT FINANCE AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REFERENCES COM-MITTEE REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS AND SUSTAINABLE REGIONS PROGRAMMES GOVERNMENT RESPONSE
November 2006

Introduction

On 2 December 2004 the Senate referred a number of matters to the Finance and Public Administration References Committee (the Committee) regarding the administration of the Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions programmes.
The Committee tabled its report in the Senate on 6 October 2005. The report comprised a majority report and a minority report from Government Senators.

Government Response

The majority report of the Committee responds to allegations of misuse of the programmes in the period prior to the 2004 election, serious impropriety in approval and announcement processes, concealed processes and political conditions placed on grants. The report fails to substantiate any of these allegations and reaches the conclusion that the administration of both programmes is ‘reasonably sound’.
The Government welcomes this finding and with it the bipartisan endorsement of the role of the Area Consultative Committee (ACC) network and Sustainable Regions Advisory Committees (SRACs) in delivering positive outcomes for Australian communities.
The minority report highlights the hundreds of successful projects across the country and the benefits these projects are providing to local communities. Some $250 million has been approved for nearly 1000 projects identified by local communities as high priority since 2001.
Six case studies cited in the Report from which the majority of conclusions have been drawn are atypical of most projects funded.
Two of these projects (Primary Energy and Beaudesert Rail) were originally assessed under arrangements that existed prior to commencement of the Regional Partnerships programme.
In two of the six cases (A2 Dairy Marketers and Tumbi Creek) no Australian Government funds had been spent at the conclusion of the Inquiry, and approval for the A2 Dairy Marketers project had been withdrawn.
The Committee found no evidence of inappropriate interference by Ministers in the assessment of projects and has not identified any breach of the established caretaker conventions prior to the 2004 election.
The Committee also received evidence in this Inquiry that the distribution of approved projects closely reflects the pattern of applications received. The Government encourages all Senators and Members of Parliament across all States and electorates to work with their local communities to identify worthwhile projects within their communities that may be eligible for assistance under the Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions programmes.
The majority report claims to have been hindered by a lack of cooperation by the Department of Transport and Regional Services (DOTARS). It is critical of claimed “misleading information” provided by the Department to ACCs and for failure to table all documents sought by the Committee, particularly in relation to the Department’s advice to Ministers.
The Department operated over the course of this Inquiry within long-standing conventions accepted by successive Governments relating to non-disclosure of advice provided to Ministers. The Department’s position was supported by advice from across the public service and Ministers. Consistent with that advice, the approval of the Minister was sought before documents were released to the Committee.

RESPONSE TO RECOMMENDATIONS


Response to Majority Report Recommendations


Regional Partnerships Program


Recommendation 1: The Committee recommends that the operation of the SONA guidelines cease.


Government Response – Noted

The Government announced on 15 November 2005 that changes to the Regional Partnerships programme will permit the Government to direct a pool of funds within the Regional Partnerships programme for specific investment priorities which may not otherwise be brought forward by Area Consultative Committees (ACCs). 1

The Regional Partnerships programme has been used by the Government to deliver associated programmes. One such example is the Rural Medical Infrastructure Fund, which is based on Regional Partnerships programme guidelines but is also subject to specific criteria. These criteria are published on the Regional Partnerships web site. When new Government priority areas are identified, additional or modified guidelines or criteria may be issued as required, and published on the Regional Partnerships web site.
The SONA procedures have not been used since August 2004 and it is considered that special considerations such as those made under SONA procedures will no longer be required.

Recommendation 2: The Committee recommends it be mandatory for all Regional Partnerships program applications to be developed in consultation with local Area Consultative Committees.

Government Response – Disagree
It is usual practice for ACCs to be consulted in relation to Regional Partnerships applications, however, it is important that the Government maintains the ability to fund projects which have not come to its attention through the work of ACCs and which it regards as a high strategic priority. It is also important for reasons of fairness that applicants retain the ability to have an application assessed under the programme even if it is not supported by an ACC.

Recommendation 3: The Committee recommends that Area Consultative Committees must receive relevant applications and be afforded an opportunity to consider and make recommendations not less than ten working days from receipt of the application.

Government Response – Agree
This is existing practice under the Regional Partnerships programme. It is normal practice for ACCs to comment on applications and generally have at least ten working days for comments.
See response to Recommendation 2.

Recommendation 4: The Committee recommends that the Department of Transport and Regional Services incorporates and outlines appropriate assessment procedures for multi-region funding applications into the published Regional Partnerships guidelines.

Government Response – Agree in part
There has never been an impediment to multi-region projects under the Regional Partnerships programme. The published guidelines apply to multi-regional projects.
As part of the Government’s proposed enhancements to the Regional Partnerships programme, DOTARS Regional Offices will work with local ACCs to facilitate the development of quality projects including the coordination of projects which cross ACC boundaries.2

Recommendation 5: The Committee recommends that multi-region funding applications be referred to all relevant Area Consultative Committees for review comments and recommendations.

Government Response - Agree
This is existing practice under the Regional Partnerships programme.
See also response to Recommendations 2 and 3.

Recommendation 6: The Committee recommends that a biannual statement be tabled in the Senate by the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, listing:
the Regional Partnerships program grants approved in the preceding six month period;
the Department of Transport and Regional Services and Area Consultative Committee’s recommendations; and
where the funding decision is inconsistent with the departmental and/or Area Consultative Committee recommendation, a statement of the reasons for the decision.

Government Response – Disagree
The Government is not persuaded that this proposal would improve programme accountability. The publication of advice concerning recommendations made to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services by departmental advisers and by other bodies such as ACCs, is not supported. Publication of such advice would make it difficult for ACCs to provide a critical assessment of projects. This approach is consistent with long-standing practice in relation to the confidentiality of departmental advice to Ministers.
A list of all projects funded under both programmes is already available on the Department’s web site.

Recommendation 7: The Committee recommends that the Government address inequities in the distribution of Regional Partnerships program funding consistent with the ANAO Better Practice Guide.

Government Response – Agree in part
The distribution of approved projects reflects closely the pattern of applications received. ACCs are already required to ensure equitable distribution of projects within their regions under key performance indicators imposed by the Department.
In accordance with ANAO’s Better Practice Guide, all applications for funding under the Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions programmes, are assessed “in accordance with requirements of procedural fairness” (page 45).

Recommendation 8: The Committee recommends that the exclusion of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) from eligibility for Regional Partnerships program funding be rescinded.

Government Response – Agree
Current programme policy permits Australian territories to apply for funding. However the programme guidelines do not permit the funding of projects which would result in cost-shifting from Territory Governments to the Australian Government. Guidelines will be changed to clarify Territory government eligibility.

Recommendation 9: The Committee recommends that the Government review resourcing of Area Consultative Committees, and training for committee members and employees, to ensure that they can adequately perform their role in relation to the Regional Partnerships program.

Government Response – Agree
See also response to Recommendation 10.

Recommendation 10: The Committee recommends the introduction of three-year operational funding contracts for Area Consultative Committees.

Government Response – Agree
The Government announced on 15 November 2005 that funding to meet the annual operating costs of ACCs, which is currently met from within the funds appropriated to the Regional Partnerships programme as a whole, will be separately identified and ACCs will be allocated funding in accordance with a three year contract.
This three year contract will encourage ACCs to continue to facilitate other Government programmes though they will not be permitted to reduce the level of effort involved in developing suitable Regional Partnerships projects.
The operational funding appropriation for ACCs will also be indexed within existing appropriations. 3

Recommendation 11: The Committee recommends that the Government negotiates with each Area Consultative Committee in relation to key performance indicators including job creation and partnership support, to ensure performance measures are regionally appropriate.

Government Response – Agree in part
Key performance indicators currently apply to ACCs to ensure programme objectives are met. Performance indicators for ACCs will be reviewed this year. While the review will involve consultation with ACCs, effective measurement of ACC performance and performance across the Regional Partnerships programme, requires a national set of indicators.
The Government announced on 15 November 2005 that the Minister for Transport and Regional Services will provide written advice and guidelines each year to ACCs outlining the Government’s broad policy priorities for the Regional Partnerships programme.4

Recommendation 12: The Committee recommends that Area Consultative Committee recommendations be disclosed to funding applicants on request.

Government Response - Disagree
The Department provides unsuccessful applicants with advice setting out the reasons their projects did not meet the programme’s criteria, including the extent of support for the project. It is not appropriate to release the views of ACCs or other bodies and individuals which are provided to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services in the course of considering the merits of individual projects. To do so would reduce the ability of ACCs to provide a frank assessment of the priority of individual projects.

Recommendation 13: The Committee recommends that the Government conduct a review of the role of Area Consultative Committees to ensure that their contribution to regional development is maximised.

Government Response - Disagree
The Inquiry report reaches positive conclusions regarding the role of ACCs. ACCs often make suggestions for improvements to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and the Department which are often adopted. The need for a further review is not considered necessary at this time beyond the normal processes for ensuring continuous improvement.
The Government is implementing a series of changes to improve the effectiveness of ACCs and their governance arrangements that were announced on 15 November 2005. These changes include:
local communities and local Members of Parliament will be consulted more extensively by ACCs in the process of developing each ACC’s strategic regional plan;
funding to meet the annual operating costs of ACCs, which is currently met from within the funds appropriated to the Regional Partnerships programme as a whole, will be separately identified and ACCs will be allocated funding in accordance with a three year contract;
the Government will appoint the Chair and Deputy Chair of each ACC, and provide guidelines for the appointment of other members to help committees be representative of the communities they serve; and
ACC boundaries will be reviewed to ensure boundaries of rural ACCs reflect areas of common interest, and consider whether the boundaries and number of metropolitan ACCs are appropriate.5

Sustainable Regions Program


Recommendation 14: The Committee recommends that the appointment process for Sustainable Regions Advisory Committee members, including selection criteria, be made public.

Government Response – Disagree
It is not usual practice to disclose the reasons for the appointment or non-appointment of Board members. The case has not been made to depart from that convention in relation to this programme.

Recommendation 15: The Committee recommends that the Government adopt a skills-based approach in relation to the appointment of future Sustainable Regions Advisory Committees, including the two new bodies announced during the 2004 election campaign.

Government Response - Agree
This has been the approach adopted.

Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions Programs


Recommendation 16: The Committee recommends that the Australian National Audit Office audit the administration of the Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions programs, with particular reference to case studies highlighted in this report.

Government Response – Noted
The Australian National Audit Office is conducting a performance audit of the Regional Partnerships programme in 2006.

Recommendation 17: The Committee recommends that projects that cannot obtain or have not yet obtained relevant approvals or licences not be eligible for Regional Partnerships or Sustainable Regions funding.

Government Response – Agree in part
This is already generally the case. However, there are some instances where it is not appropriate to insist on development approvals ahead of assessment. For instance, a community group that has raised funds through raffles and similar activities should not necessarily be forced to use those funds seeking approvals while there is high uncertainty about a project proceeding because they have not secured programme funding. In such cases approvals are made subject to securing relevant consents.

Recommendation 18: The Committee recommends that competitive neutrality procedures be strengthened, including the introduction of a procedure for potential competitors to lodge objections.

Government Response – Agree in part
The Government announced on 15 November 2005 that greater emphasis will be placed on assessment of competitive neutrality issues associated with applications. Projects where assistance greater than $25,000 is sought for a business or commercial venture will require a statement from the ACC Chair that identifies any competitive neutrality risks posed by the project, prior to the assessment of the project for funding approval.6

Recommendation 19: The Committee recommends that due diligence procedures be strengthened, including a routine inquiry into legal action against applicants.

Government Response – Disagree
Due diligence is already assessed rigorously. The scope to continually improve processes will be reviewed. It is not considered appropriate to exclude consideration of an applicant due to pending legal action as such action may have no basis.

Recommendation 20: The Committee recommends that no funding be approved for projects that do not meet Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions guidelines and fail other tests including proper due diligence.

Government Response – Agree in part
See response to Recommendation 1.

Recommendation 21: The Committee recommends that it become formal policy that ministers and their staff are kept strictly at arm’s length from decisions, including all relevant departmental advice, on applications from their own electorates. The portfolio minister and his or her staff should not be included in the circulation of departmental advice on applications for projects in the minister’s electorate.

Government Response – Agree in part
The Government announced on 15 November 2005 that funding approval will be subject to decision by a new Committee comprising the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, and the Special Minister for State.
The Committee has adopted the practice that, where there is consideration of a project in the electorate of one of the Ministers, the Minister in question does not take part in the decision-making process.
However, the Government considers that Ministers should retain the normal capacity of Members and Senators to make representations on behalf of their constituents in respect of an application for funding.

Recommendation 22: The Committee recommends that Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, and their staff, should be prohibited from intervening in the assessment of grants.

Government Response – Agree in principle
No evidence of inappropriate interference has been identified by the Inquiry.

Recommendation 23: The Committee recommends that from 1 July preceding a general election, the following procedures apply to grant approvals and announcements: when a Minister’s decision to approve or not approve a grant is different to the recommendation of either the Area Consultative Committee or the Department, or the funding amount approved is different from the amount recommended, then the grant approval decision be made in conjunction with the relevant Shadow Minister. The Committee further recommends that all grants approved in these circumstances be jointly announced by the Minister and the Shadow Minister.

Government Response - Disagree
Established caretaker conventions already exist which prescribe grant decision making practice ahead of an election. The Committee found no evidence that there was any breach of caretaker conventions prior to the 2004 election in the case of these programmes.

Recommendation 24: The Committee recommends that the government develops and discloses procedures to govern cessation or transition of Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions programs.

Government Response – Agree in principle
As such transitions are now complete, there would appear no need for such procedures. However, this recommendation will be considered should such circumstances again eventuate.

Recommendation 25: The Committee recommends that the government reviews the efficacy of a grants-based approach to regional development.

Government Response - Disagree
The Government is committed to a grants-based approach to regional development.
The Stronger Regions Statement of 2001 sets out the Australian Government’s policy for regional development which contains the following principles:
regions and communities taking responsibility for dealing with the challenges and opportunities confronting them;
the Australian Government standing by as a partner to help regions and communities realise the future they want for themselves; and
a recognition that regions and communities almost always have a better understanding of their needs and opportunities than central agencies or governments.

Recommendation 26: The Committee recommends that the Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions programs should complement, not compete with state and local government funding programs.

Government Response – Agree
Regional programmes are aimed at working partnerships with a wide range organisations, government agencies and businesses.
The programmes leverage on average three dollars for every dollar of Australian Government support. State and/or local governments are funding partners in relation to the majority of projects. Contributions to projects by state governments equate to an average of $0.93 for every $1 of support from the Australian Government under the Regional Partnerships programme. Contributions to projects by funding co-partners (including state governments) equates to an average of $2.15 for every $1 funded under the Sustainable Regions programme.

Response to Minority Report Recommendations


Recommendation 1: The Government Senators recommend that the Government promotes the RP and SR programs and educates the public on how the programs work, to restore the public’s confidence in these programs following the misperceptions generated by this inquiry.

Government Response - Agree
Options to best promote the support available under these initiatives are being considered. Area Consultative Committees and Sustainable Regions Advisory Committees will continue to play a key role in assisting their regions to understand the programme guidelines to enable them to access this assistance.

Recommendation 2: The Government Senators recommend that the Key Performance Indicators be promoted publicly, to assist in educating the public about the benefits of the programs and the outstanding returns delivered to local communities.

Government Response - Agree
Key performance indicators for ACCs have been put on the Regional Partnerships and ACC web pages (www.regionalpartnerships.gov.au and www.acc.gov.au). Aggregate results against indicators will be published when available.

Recommendation 3: Government Senators recommend that project applications requiring co-funding be considered simultaneously by the relevant levels of government.

Government Response - Disagree
Implementation of this proposal could adversely affect applicants and could delay approval of applications. State and local government programmes have different mechanisms for considering proposals, including annual funding rounds.

Recommendation 4: Government Senators recommend that restrictions on ACC media activities be lessened.

Government Response - Disagree
As organisations that receive the majority of their funding from the Australian Government, it is appropriate that the current procedures for marketing of ACC activities be retained so that consistent messages about programmes and the ACC network can be communicated.

Recommendation 5: Government Senators recommend that template marketing material be developed for only minor adjustment by individual ACCs.

Government Response – Agree
ACCs are provided with generic marketing material. Templates that ACCs can tailor for their own purposes are being developed as part of ongoing support for ACCs.

Recommendation 6: Government Senators recommend that ACCs be advised of grant approvals in advance, and that they be encouraged to assist with arranging grant announcements and any follow up matters relevant to their local projects.

Government Response – Agree in part
Members of Parliament and Senators are encouraged to include their local ACCs in the announcement of successful applicants and any subsequent public events including launches and openings.

"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-12-05,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
Better late than never: 14 months after this very important committee report was presented to the Senate, we see this document presented. Having had the opportunity to look at the document, I now know why—because this is a feeble response to a very important committee report which was presented to the Senate. In the last sitting week of 2006, we see this document presented.
Let me remind the Senate that this report shows that the government had taken advantage of its stewardship of the public purse to fund projects willy-nilly around the country, with more regard to its electoral prospects than to the interests of the taxpayer, fairness or proper process. As a result, quite a number of recommendations—some of which have actually been accepted by the government—were proposed by this committee. Let me remind the Senate that I said when the report was presented that it was a report which would shock the nation, and indeed it did. At that time, I named some projects where the spending total of $5 million was to do such things as fund a steam train that would not go, a creek that dredged itself, a milk company that folded before the ink on the funding announcement was dry, an ethanol company worth $1 that still has yet to produce a drop of fuel and a hotel funded to run ‘Wacky Wednesdays’ and stunt bikini babes while other communities on the Atherton tableland cry out for potable drinking water. What a travesty!
And, 14 months later, what particular matters was the government keen not to agree to in this report? Surprise, surprise, from the point of view of the majority report of the committee: the government has declined to agree with those recommendations which allowed better scrutiny of the government’s ad-min-istration of this program, ‘regional rorts’. That is what the public came to know this program as. ‘Regional rorts’ were editorialised around the country as shocking misbehaviour by this government in the exercise of its administrative responsibilities—spend-ing from the public purse basically for the purpose of funding the government’s election campaign rather than really funding the interests of regional Australia.
We see that, where the committee recommended that area consultative committee recommendations be disclosed to funding applicants, the government disagreed. Where the committee recommended that the government conduct a review of the role of area consultative committees to ensure their contribution to regional development is maximised, the government disagreed. Where the committee recommended that biannual statements be tabled in the Senate by the minister representing Minister for Transport and Regional Services, listing the Regional Partnership Program grants approved in the preceding six-month period, the Department of Transport and Regional Services’ and the area consultative committees’ recommendations, the government disagreed. Where the committee recommended that, where funding decisions were inconsistent with the department and/or area consultative committee recommendations, a statement for the reason for the decision be tabled, the government disagreed. Where the committee recommended that, to avoid the suggestion that this program was being used simply as a means of courting electoral approval as we got close to an election, the government effectively extend the caretaker provision of this program, the government disagreed.
In relation to the Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions programs, better known around the country as ‘regional rorts’, we have seen that this government is keen to maintain the ability to use this program for the purpose of funding its electoral campaigns, in effect, putting money into regions where it either thinks it needs to build up its support to retain a seat or is seeking to campaign to take a seat—potentially, probably from one of the Independents in this parliament, as they attempted to with the seat of New England at the last election.
The public has had enough of issues such as the abuse of process that was involved in the Tumbi Creek grant. Two grants were announced by the Prime Minister. But we found out that, before there was approval of the process, storms had led to a partial dredging of the creek—in other words, the ordinary course of running water from the storm had done part of the job that the Commonwealth was going to pay for. We saw a steam train in Queensland that ceased to operate even though over $1 million had been paid towards the project. We saw, on the Atherton tablelands, a hotel being given funds to improve its competitive position in relation to others in that town—but, in the same community, we found a town that had drinking water that was barely drinkable and water pressure that did not allow the community to fight fire. What a travesty! What an outrageous performance by this government—and no contrition at all in relation to this program.
What the government are keen to do is maintain their ability to pump money out during the lead-up to an election campaign and make promises during an election campaign without the constraint of actually having to show that the projects have the support of the organisations that the government has set up to, in part, vet these projects—the area consultative committees. They are not prepared to show the public that this body that they have set up that is supposed to have the expertise to deal with these matters, that is supposed to have the interests of the region at heart and that is impartial to government supports the project. They are not even prepared to say that. They are not even prepared to say that where there is a disagreement between the government and this body—this body that the government are setting up; they have total control over who is on this body—the government will make a statement of reasons or actually publish that fact.
They are not prepared to allow the applicants who think that perhaps they are not being properly dealt with by the area consultative committee to know whether the area consultative committee actually approved their application in the process of consideration by government. What the government are clearly indicating here is that they intend to go through the same process again. They intend to follow the discredited process of using this program in the way that has become known—as a series of regional rorts to deliver electoral advantage to the government.
I think the Australian community has had enough of this. I think the Australian community expects that, as taxpayers, when they pay money this government will account for the way they use it and account properly. I think the Australian community is sick and tired of governments using their money simply as a means of currying electoral favour. When the government makes these announcements they had better be prepared for a backlash. It may seem that there are opportunities for electoral advantage, but the reality is that a lot of people in the community are going to be asking questions about how this is being funded, who is paying for it, what the process has been and why other projects which are in the pipeline did not get funded when the ones that the government selected did get funded.
This will become a poisoned chalice for the government. When it comes to the consideration of these projects, the opposition will be pointing out to the Australian people that this government wants to shield from the public the way that they handle this process, just as they shielded from the committee originally the determinations by the department and details of the particular projects, where even the department’s advice was overturned by ministers so that the minister could deliver the political advantage that they thought they had.
I was going to seek leave to continue my remarks, but Senator Forshaw is going to seek the call, and perhaps there will be someone else. This is a very shabby response to the committee’s report. It is eight months late, inadequate and one to which we will return and make sure the public is aware of. (Time expired)

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2006-12-05,"—I rise to speak to this motion to take note of the government response to the report of the former Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee into the Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions programs. As Senator O’Brien has pointed out, it is a totally inadequate response to that report. It is a totally inadequate response, I believe, to the very serious, important and constructive recommendations made in the majority report. It is particularly inadequate because it has been 14 months since the report was handed down and we get the response from the government to it in the very last days of this year’s parliament. The report was tabled in October 2005 and it has taken almost 14 months for the government to present what I believe is pretty much a pathetic response.
I note that the government response indicates that they agree with a number of the recommendations, or agree in part with a number of the recommendations, of the committee, and I welcome that. But the government have rejected the substantial recommendations, the key recommendations that go to the heart of better accountability and particularly accountability to the parliament.
I note that the government tries to make some capital out of the fact that the committee’s report found the overall administration of the programs to be reasonably sound. We did, and we have always said as an opposition that these programs, properly administered—certainly, the Regional Partnerships program—were a worthwhile way of funding important projects to promote employment and development in regional areas, particularly in areas that had otherwise undergone significant restructuring with the downsizing of rural industries or that had suffered economic hardship more than the rest of the country. The fact that the committee found that does not mean the government can just escape responsibility for the substantial and glaring inadequacies in the administration of the program.
The government response says:
Six case studies cited in the Report from which the majority of conclusions have been drawn are atypical of most projects funded.
The fact of the matter is that the committee, in the time it had available, took the approach of looking at six very important projects or case studies that had been funded under these programs. The flaws, poor administration and political interference in those case studies were substantial. The amounts of money that were involved were substantial. In the case of Beaudesert Rail, for instance, it was of the order of almost $6 million—$6 million of public money put into a venture which was pretty much doomed from the outset, no matter what the good intentions of the proponents were. There was a litany of mistakes and a litany of failure to take action at a time when it would have prevented a substantial waste of taxpayers’ funds.
The Atherton Hotel project has become notorious. I notice that Senator Carr is in the chamber. I am sure he can comment even more about the scandal—
—The tabletop dancers!
—Yes, the tabletop dancers project, as it was referred to. Other worthwhile projects were simply ignored or not considered in any proper way.
There was the Tumbi Creek fiasco, where money was advanced for a project to dredge a creek. There were serious questions about whether it was an appropriate project, given the wider consideration of problems in that region. When the money was no longer needed because the rain actually flushed out the creek and the dredging was not required, attempts were made to divert these funds to some other projects. There is no doubt in my mind that there was political interference by people associated with it—indeed, members of the coalition parties. That evidence was overwhelming. There was evidence that staff of ministers had engaged in an exchange of secret emails to divert those funds to other works.
When we tried to have that matter brought before the Privileges Committee—and, from my recollection, the President concluded that it should have been given precedence in going to the Privileges Committee—the government used its numbers to stop that. That is the only occasion that longstanding members on that committee can recall where a matter was not referred to the Privileges Committee when there was a clear, prima facie case of political interference.
This government just says: ‘Oh well, there are only six projects that the committee looked at. They were atypical.’ Then they say, ‘In the case of Tumbi Creek and A2 Dairy Marketers, no Australian government funds were spent by the conclusion of the inquiry.’ That is not the point. The reason that the funds were not ultimately spent was that the facts were out in the open and, in the end, the government became embarrassed and pulled the funds. The facts are that this committee looked at the processes involved in considering the applications that had been lodged and whether they had been approved or rejected by the department and, ultimately, by the minister.
There was evidence of other projects where, after the area consultative committee had considered the merits of a proposal, the department determined that in their considered view the projects should not receive funding. Yet those projects did receive funding. It seemed to be a situation where the government, or somebody, had decided: ‘Maybe it should proceed. It is in a marginal electorate, and there is an election coming up.’ That is all on the record.
The other point I want to draw attention to in the time I have available—and I think we could speak for a lot longer about this extensive inquiry—are the steps that were taken by the department to, in my view, sandbag the operation of the committee and prevent the committee from carrying out its properly constituted task of conducting this inquiry into this substantial government funded program. We sought information from the area consultative committees—documentation and other forms of information—about projects that they had considered. After the committee had written seeking that information, the department wrote to the area consultative committees and told them that they did not have to comply with our request. They gave them advice that privacy considerations meant that they really had not only no obligation to comply with the Senate committee’s request but also probably a duty not to comply. When it was pointed out that that was really a severe interference with the committee’s processes and was also incorrect legal advice, the department then said, ‘It’s up to you to decide if you want to comply.’ In the end, of course, we received the information but it took us a lot of effort. In fact, in the end we had to subpoena some of that information in a couple of cases. This committee was hamstrung by the failure of departmental officials who were maybe acting on instructions not to cooperate—I believe that, but testing it is another issue. I think this is a totally inadequate response. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
Leave granted; debate adjourned.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,COMMITTEES,21,2,speech
"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2006-12-05,"—In continuing my remarks on the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Legislation Amendment Bill 2006, I would like to briefly conclude the comments I was making before being rudely interrupted by Senator Kemp prior to question time. I was explaining to the Senate that the Howard government were not the only ones being deceptive about nuclear safety issues. I was in the process of pointing out that the obsequious and fawning toad Piers Ackerman has criticised the Labor Party for its concerns about the potential dangers posed by nuclear reactors. In an article in the Hobart Mercury on 19 June 2006, he had this to say:
Albanese talked about nuclear safety as if every one of the 440 nuclear reactors currently operating around the world was a ticking bomb. He even had concerns over Lucas Heights.
Unfortunately, the toad went on to say:
If he knows something that the workers there don’t, he should outline his concerns to the staff there - or apologise, and shut up.
How very touchy. Piers Ackerman is either deceptive or very ill informed. To be fair to him, it seems his only source of information is to grovel for scraps off the Prime Minister’s desk. If he ever bothered to do some independent research of his own, he might learn that Sydney’s Lucas Heights nuclear reactor recorded no less than 13 safety breaches in only 18 months prior to his article.
—Thirteen?
—Yes, Senator Polley, 13—including an incident only weeks before the article in which radioactive gases, including krypton, escaped after an explosion inside a radioactive hot cell. But I guess publishing that information would not have served Piers Ackerman’s bigoted, anti-Labor ranting.
This series of three bills makes it clear that the Howard government will override community objections and, unfortunately, state and territory laws to impose nuclear reactors and high-level nuclear waste dumps on local communities across Australia. If the Howard government cannot consult, cannot build community consensus, cannot leave important legal rights untrampled and cannot gain the informed consent of Indigenous people for a low- and medium-level nuclear waste facility, what hope can we have that they will comply with International Atomic Energy Agency best practice guidelines in relation to nuclear power and the resulting high-level radioactive waste? On that note, I urge all senators to vote against this bill. (Quorum formed)
",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,23,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2006-12-05,"—As earlier speakers made clear, Labor is opposing the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Legislation Amendment Bill 2006. The bill seeks to make land nominations for a Commonwealth radioactive waste facility non-reviewable under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. It also seeks to ensure that noncompliance with the site nomination rules in the 2005 act will not affect the validity of the minister’s approval of a nomination. The bill will remove any entitlement to procedural fairness regarding site nominations. It also makes amendments to the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act 2005 concerning the return of Aboriginal land used for a waste management facility. And it provides an indemnity to traditional owners against any damages which may arise out of the use of land for a facility.
In removing the mechanisms for appeal and transparency over site nominations and weakening the requirements for consultation, the government has run roughshod over affected Indigenous communities, and that is why I join this debate. The legislation is a major attack on the rights of Aboriginal traditional owners and an abuse of the power of the Howard government. Labor recognises the need for the establishment of a domestic radioactive waste facility. It has been known of course for the last 10 years that the government has been seeking to establish a facility; it is now having to rush that project because of the scheduled repatriation of Australian radioactive waste in 2011. What we are dealing with here is the removal of any potential obstacle as the government rushes to meet the deadline. The obstacle being removed is the right of Aboriginal traditional owners to have a say over what happens on their land. As has been usual throughout our history, the rights of Aboriginal people will be overridden.
The intent of the government’s 2005 legislation was to put beyond doubt its capacity to pursue activities concerning the siting, construction and operation of a waste facility in the Northern Territory. Labor opposed that legislation because it undermined the rights of Indigenous people in the Northern Territory and Territorians more generally, it broke a coalition election promise, it overrode a number of federal legal protections and it was implemented without hearing the concerns of Territorians.
The legislation explicitly removed the right to procedural fairness regarding the selection of a site for the facility. The 2005 related amendment excluded application of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 to ministerial decisions on a facility site. The CLP member for Solomon moved amendments to last year’s legislation to allow for the nomination by the Northern Territory Chief Minister or a land council of land to be assessed for a site. Those amendments set down statutory rules that would have to be followed by land councils in the nomination process. These included demonstrated evidence that traditional owners had been consulted, had understood the nomination and had consented as a group. They also required that any affected, adjacent community or group be consulted and given the opportunity to express their view.
The legislation before us today downgrades those statutory rules to the status of guidelines. The bill therefore seeks to remove the requirement for consultation with and informed consent of traditional owners. It removes the right of adjacent communities to even be consulted and removes recourse to judicial review and procedural fairness.
With this bill the government is reneging on the commitment to consultation, consent and process which it made by accepting one of its own backbenchers’ amendments last year. Where Aboriginal owners and communities currently have a statutory right to proper process, they are now seeing that replaced with an unenforceable undertaking by the current Minister for Education, Science and Training, who in her second reading speech said:
Current provisions of the act set down a number of criteria that should be met if a land council decides to make a nomination. Importantly, these criteria include that the owners of the land in question have understood the proposal and have consented to the nomination, and that other Aboriginal communities with an interest in the land have also been consulted.
I can assure the House that, should a nomination be made, I will only accept it if satisfied that these criteria have been met.
That assurance is a pretty flimsy replacement for a set of legal rights. You have to be cynical about the value of a promise to uphold proper process made by a minister as she legislates to remove the right to such a process.
The establishment of a radioactive waste dump on Aboriginal land will have a major impact on the affected landowners. It could mean traditional owners losing access to their land for anything up to 300 years and it could have ramifications in regard to environmental health for nearby communities. That is not to say that all Aboriginal people are necessarily opposed to the establishment of a facility on their land. That is a decision for them to be informed about and to make after proper consultation. But how the traditional owners use their land is very much a decision for them and their communities. In doing so they should have the right to a transparent process, legal protections and procedural fairness.
Given the extremely long-term nature of a waste disposal facility, and its potential health and environmental impacts, it stands to reason that community consultation, consent and process are of the utmost importance. In the report of the Senate inquiry into these measures, government senators concluded that the overriding concern was the establishment of a facility and that ‘questions of due process and appeal rights are minor and subsidiary’. How dismissive and insulting! This is not a position which I think reflects well on those senators. I think many people would question whether those senators would have come to the same conclusion if it were their property rights and their entitlement to due process which were at stake. And I think many people would question why the government’s decade-long failure to establish a facility means that Aboriginal people’s property rights should now be diminished. Again, it is Aboriginal people whose rights are going to be overridden in order to facilitate government policy.
This legislation is being debated in the context of the changes to the Aboriginal land rights regime that were passed in the Senate in August. Those changes were the most radical redefinition of that framework since its enactment three decades ago. The government pursed its agenda without paying the basic respect of consulting with or gaining the consent of Aboriginal traditional owners. As such they trashed the long-established bipartisan commitment to the land rights regime—one of the most important and significant acts of reconciliation in Australian history.
The government is now seeking to coerce Aboriginal communities to sign up to 99-year leases on their land in exchange for basic services such as education. This is a calculated undermining of basic citizenship rights of Aboriginal people. The restoration of land to its traditional Indigenous owners was a vital step in reconciliation between black and white Australia. The government’s undermining of Indigenous rights over Aboriginal land—either through imposing changes to the land rights act or through the bill before us today—reflect a return to an approach that views Aboriginal people’s rights as some sort of gift of the government, to be removed at the government’s pleasure.
The siting of a radioactive waste facility on Aboriginal land is a decision of huge and long-term significance. To remove the legal rights that Aboriginal people have in that process is to do them a terrible wrong. It further entrenches the despair of so many Aboriginal people at their treatment and the continued lack of respect shown to them. It sends a clear message that the Howard government believes that Aboriginal rights are expendable and Aboriginal views can be ignored. It is not a message this Senate ought to endorse. It is not a message that this parliament ought to send to Indigenous people. I urge the Senate to reject the bill.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,23,1,speech
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2006-12-05,"—Through my role in representing the state of Western Australia I come into contact with a number of people who live in the west who are highly and deeply suspicious of any form of centralised government and any edict that comes from Canberra. In fact, those of us who represent Western Australia are often accused, even by some on our own side, of being somewhat parochial. We admit to that, and we are quite proudly so. But when we debate legislation like the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Legislation Amendment Bill 2006, and when you consider the track record of this government and statements by some of its ministers, it is little wonder that people in Perth, let alone in rural and regional Western Australia, are suspicious of the conduct of this government.
Consideration of legislation like this involves a couple of significant issues. As Senator Evans has said, this legislation goes to the heart of removing any say that traditional owners of the land have about where the siting of a radioactive waste dump will be. But it also highlights the fact that this government seeks to legislate away opposition rather than consult or try to have a constructive relationship with either state or territory governments or traditional owners. When faced with any form of criticism or opposition, its solution is to legislate it away.
The fear of a nuclear power industry and the site of a nuclear waste facility is one that has been discussed in my state for quite some time. And that is little wonder, because federal members of the Liberal Party have put it on the agenda. Last year the member for O’Connor, Mr Tuckey, was talking about the issue. Who can forget the comments that he made as well as those made by the federal member for Kalgoorlie, Mr Haase, and indeed the infamous comments of the federal member for Tangney, Dr Dennis Jensen. When you add together those comments with those of the former state leader of the Liberal Party, Mr Matt Birney, the state member for Kalgoorlie, then you really have to be deeply suspicious of what this government is up to.
Mr Birney, when he was leader of the Liberal Party, Leader of the Opposition in the state parliament, when the state parliament had passed the Nuclear Waste (Storage) Prohibition Act, went on the record last year to say that, if he were in government, he would repeal that legislation, that he was happy for a nuclear waste dump to be in Western Australia. He said that one of the first things he would do would be to repeal legislation passed by the state parliament in March of the previous year—he said this last year, so in March 2004—which bans radioactive waste dumps being established in Western Australia. So when you match Mr Birney’s comments with those of some of the federal representatives of the Liberal Party, it is something that people in my state should be suspicious of. They should be suspicious of what this government has in mind for them. Add to that the report from the Australian on 24 May this year that reported the federal member for Kalgoorlie, Mr Haase, as saying that Australia, and particularly Western Australia:
… should also consider storing high-level radioactive waste and was in the perfect position to “charge like a wounded bull for those services”.
In the same article the Liberal member for O’Connor, the infamous Mr Tuckey, was quoted as saying:
We are the ideal repository for those spent fuel rods for the simple reason we have the best geological stability …
Then there is the federal Liberal member for Tangney, Dr Dennis Jensen. He also backed the option of storing high-level nuclear waste in Western Australia.
So when you add together this government’s drive to not in any way allow the traditional owners of the land any say on whether they are going to have to deal with the radioactive waste to Mr Birney’s pledge—no doubt he is on the way back to the front bench of the Liberal Party in Western Australia, and I am sure one day we will see him completely resurrect his political career—to repeal the state legislation that outlaws a radioactive waste dump in Western Australia and to this government’s drive to expand the nuclear industry in this country, and the significant comments of leading members of the federal Liberal Party from Western Australia, it is obvious that there is a plan and that the plan goes beyond the bill that is currently before us. It is obvious that there is a plan being generated by the government, and that is to soften up people in my home state to agree to the state becoming a nuclear waste dump. As even Mr Tuckey has conceded in some quarters, and I know Senator Minchin has in others, it is not something that is electorally popular, it is not something that the people of Western Australia are prepared to be softened up for and it is not something that any of them will stand for.
This is an issue that people in WA feel very strongly about. They do not trust what people are talking about here. They have seen what has happened with this government overriding the wishes of the Northern Territory government and insisting that the site will be there. Let’s face it: that is because it is a territory and they can do it; it is not because there has been any consultation or any agreement. Now they want to remove the rights of traditional owners to have a say. People are legitimately suspicious of what is going on here.
And then who can forget the leaked cabinet submission that talked about sites for the spent fuel processing plant, the leaked submission to the federal cabinet of 1997. It talked about Perth being a likely site for a nuclear power station; it talked about what electorates they were going to be in; it talked about not releasing information about alternative sites because that may unnecessarily alarm communities in the broad areas under consideration. It is little wonder that people in Western Australia are a bit sensitive, a bit suspicious and a bit parochial. You cannot take what this government says about these issues on face value. It is just chipping away, legislating away opposition so that it can get its own way and ride roughshod over what local communities want, not just traditional owners but all local communities. I am sure the people of the Northern Territory—a territory that I spent a significant part of my early childhood growing up in—are pretty suspicious of this government.
This issue is something that people in my home state are quite legitimately concerned about because the government keeps using its numbers to chip away section after section of the legislation and to prevent one group of people after another from having a say in what is going to happen within their communities. When you add that to the stance that is taken by key Liberal Party politicians in state parliament, we really should be worried about the plans that the Liberal Party has for our community in Western Australia.
There is no doubt in looking at the roles of Dr Jensen and Mr Tuckey and in adding the comments of Mr Haase to those of his state colleague Mr Birney—whose star is on the rise again; I am sure he will have a significant contribution to make to the state Liberal Party—that there obviously is a plan, at least in the Western Australian division of the Liberal Party, to turn my home state into not just a state that has nuclear power but also one that has a radioactive waste dump. What is being said by these significant Liberal politicians is part of the softening-up process. We are not being parochial; we are being quite rightly concerned about the conduct of some of these significant Liberal politicians and what they have planned for Western Australia. These issues are not as simple as the government would have us believe. You cannot just accept what it has to say at face value; you have to look at its conduct as a whole. I think it is important that people in Western Australia understand the real plans that the Liberal Party has for our state.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,23,1,speech
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2006-12-05,"—I rise to support the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Legislation Amendment Bill 2006. This should not be surprising; it was me who introduced particular amendments that allowed for three other classes of land. One was a class of land that could be nominated by the Northern Territory government—a very large landholder in the Northern Territory and principally responsible for land. The other two principal landholders are the Northern Land Council, which is effectively responsible for the northern half of the Northern Territory, and the Central Land Council, which is responsible for those remaining lands in the southern half of the Northern Territory.
The purpose of this bill falls principally into two parts. The first part is to provide for the return of land when the facility may no longer be required and also to indemnify those landholders following the return of the land against potential damages arising from the original use of the land. The second aspect of the bill deals with a number of issues that may cause a delay in the nomination process. We are all pretty familiar in this place with the history of this legislation, and the siting of a radioactive repository on behalf of all Australians—which was the original idea, and a very laudable one at that—with years of effort to try to get it right. I think everybody knows that that effort has been thwarted by those who create mischief by saying, ‘I will do anything to prevent a radioactive facility from being sited anywhere in Australia.’ That is not in anyone’s interest. This bill is very important because the second aspect of it deals with ensuring that there is no more mischief to be made in this matter. We have put beyond reach of the mischief makers the ability to cause any further, and clearly unnecessary, delays in this matter.
The bill also deals with the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 and makes some amendments to the land nomination process, particularly section 3A. This has the effect of adding a site nomination under proposed section 3A of the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 to the classes of decisions that are not decisions to which the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act applies. Again, we think that it is a bit of a hole in what we consider to be a pretty clear future. This bill is all about making sure that there are no more holes in the future and no more little avenues where people can make some mischief.
It is also important to note that these amendments principally come from the Northern Land Council. Under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act, the Northern Land Council has a great deal of responsibility for not only the land under their jurisdiction but also the Aboriginal people who are the traditional owners of that land and it has the responsibility to ensure that the wishes of those people are met on a number of matters such as development and change and the siting of things, whether it be fishing entitlements, mining or railways. Historically, the Northern Land Council is quite expert on this matter and I have to commend it for its efforts in ensuring that traditional owners have an option, one which is in the amendments that I have put forward in this place. That option is that they can consider whether or not this is something they would like to have sited on their land or otherwise. This council has gone a long way to ensure that the processes are in place so that people are well-informed of the options before them.
Particular parts of these amendments, as I say, come from the Northern Land Council. Their concern is that a challenge may be raised on the basis that the Northern Land Council did not properly consult all interested parties, as required by subsection 3B(1) of the act, prior to making a nomination and the seeking of judicial review under the nomination under the AD(JR) Act, which I previously covered. Of course, the government shares that concern.
The Australian Government Solicitor believes on balance that, whilst a failure to comply with subsection 3B(1) of the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 would not affect the validity of the nomination, there is not an insignificant risk that a court may decide otherwise. So the AGS considered the greatest risk was from a successful challenge to any siting decision made under section 7 of the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act or from an ongoing court action that prevented progress in making that decision, so that a challenge could be made at any time in the future after considerable time and effort has been spent on assessing a nominated site. Given the possibility of receiving a nomination of land adjacent to the Central Land Council’s jurisdiction, the prospect of a legal challenge is considered high, given the Central Land Council’s vocal opposition to the facility.
I have to say that there is a stark contrast between the behaviour of Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council in regard to these matters. It was interesting that I knew exactly what the Central Land Council thought about the amendments and the opportunity to be included in the discussion over the siting of a radioactive storage facility almost the following day after I made the amendments in this place, because there were yells and screams from the Central Land Council: ‘No, we’re not going to have it. We’ll have absolutely none of that.’ I have to say I was amazed at the time it took to consult so many people over those lands. It seemed like the next day they had it all squared away. There was no way they were going to have it on their land.
I had the opportunity during a committee hearing on Monday, 27 November to place a question on notice. They certainly put in the evidence that their position was a solid position because they had unanimous support for that decision. I actually asked them in a question on notice if they could provide the minutes of meetings reflecting upon who was there and that will obviously give me some guidance in that matter. I am looking forward to that answer.
It is in stark contrast to the Northern Land Council, who have, I consider, done an absolutely outstanding job. I inquired as to how Mr John Daly, the chairman of the Northern Land Council, a traditional owner himself, had gone about the process of informing individuals. He was able to tell me that the full council of 80 Indigenous traditional owners from the Northern Land Council region met in a place not far from Darwin in the Northern Territory—in Bynoe Harbour, I believe. They met for two full days and considered no other issue apart from informing the traditional owners what the amendments I brought before this place enabled them to do. They had two full days of deliberations where they invited ANSTO scientists to provide information about what it actually meant and they were able to question and deliberate slowly and, in a proper way, make a decision. Their decision was not, ‘Yes, we are going to have something on our land.’ Their decision was not, ‘Yes, we want it here.’ It simply informed those people from the Northern Land Council and they unanimously decided that they would allow and assist people in making a nomination should the landholders require it. It is, as I said, in pretty stark contrast to the Central Land Council. The Northern Land Council certainly made it clear in an announcement on 21 October last year which read:
The full council of the NLC has called for an amendment to the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005 so that the Land Council can nominate an alternative site in the Northern Territory for a waste facility provided that the traditional owners agree.
I have heard a lot of absolutely unadulterated garbage from the other side—I have only been listening to the debate for short time—but I did note a couple of comments from the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and I must say it brought me some sadness to hear him say that Aboriginal people have had their rights taken from them. I note that later in his submission he said that Aboriginal people have the right to make determination on their own land. The single word ‘self-determination’ I thought would come with the respect to stand up in this place and say that, if individuals from the Northern Land Council and the traditional owners want to make up their minds, they can choose to nominate a site to do anything they like on that country.
From my perspective, if you ignore the fearmongering from the other side, this process is no different from the process of establishing a corridor for a railway. It is a very important thing for the Northern Territory. Of course, the Northern Land Council did exactly the same in that matter and ensured that everybody was consulted for the entire length of the Territory. You can imagine the difficulties in doing that. They are very good at this. Why would we change the respect that was afforded them at that stage now? Why do we think this development is any different? Of course, it is because there is mischief afoot.
I have to say that the main mischief has been that provided by the Labor Party. The word ‘disingenuous’ starts paling into insignificance when you look at a bit of the history here. In this country some time ago—I was still catching fish when all this was happening—there was a principal agreement between the heads of the states and territories in Australia that it seemed very fair and reasonable that we would form a Commonwealth or a national repository where any radioactive material from around Australia would be stored to the very best level of amenity, properly and safely. So it was to everybody’s benefit that we studied that. I understand that it took some four years to go through that process and they established that it would be in the Officer Basin in whatever the section is in Woomera. They decided that that would be the very best place to have it. Of course, that is when the mischief starts. Mr Rann decided he was not doing too well in the polls, so a bit of fear and loathing would not hurt, and he suddenly said, ‘We’re not having radioactive waste in my backyard.’ He said that at the last moment.
—He did all right in the last election.
—Senator Wong, I can tell you right now that you should hang your head in shame. Right at the moment, you are dragging the good names of the traditional owners of the Northern Land Council through the mud. If you want to stand up and—
 (Senator Kirk)—Order! Senator Scullion, I suggest that you address your remarks through the chair.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I think that Senator Wong should hang her head in shame over this entire issue, because I can tell you right now that we would not be in this very sorry circumstance—
—Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: I have observed what has happened. It is very rare that I would ever question a ruling of the chair, but my colleague was being seriously provoked by Senator Wong’s interjections, and I think she should have been asked to restrain herself, as would be entirely appropriate.
—Senator, there is no point of order.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: the minister has passed a very serious aspersion on the chair, and I ask him to withdraw it.
—Yes, of course, I do. But I make the point that Senator Wong was calling out, and it is entirely appropriate for the chair to call Senator Wong to order.
—I was calling both senators to order. Please continue, Senator Scullion.
—I thank Senator Wong her for her interjection, because she reminds me that any senators from South Australia, if they are fair dinkum about this issue, must understand that they need to bear some of the shame in history that makes us face up to this particularly perilous set of circumstances we find ourselves in today. The more mischief—
—Dumping waste in the Territory! It’s an excuse to dump it in the Territory.
—The dump—we have more fear and loathing from Senator Crossin. She refuses to call it a repository because it is sexy in the media. She is supposed to inform people in this place but, instead of informing people, she uses this whole rattle of fear and loathing. That is why the Labor Party have absolutely nowhere to be on this issue. The mischief of the Labor Party continues. We know they will be out there, whether it is Elliott McAdam down there in Tennant Creek saying, ‘This is all very terrible; you need to be very careful of all these sorts of things,’ and then—
—Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order. That would be Minister Elliott McAdam from the Northern Territory government, I believe.
—Senator Scullion, I remind you to refer to all members of parliament according to their proper titles.
—I have to say, Madam Acting Deputy President, that that was not an intentional slight. I was not sure whether he is still a minister or not. Whether he is Minister for Local Government or Minister for Central Australia, I will certainly refer to him as Minister McAdam. When I was questioning him during the Senate process, I was not pulled up for that; perhaps that is what led me to that error.
The main mischief is the Labor Party. History shows that Mike Rann started us off on this. Isn’t it interesting that we have people saying, ‘It’s really dangerous; it’s radioactive.’
—Senator, again, would you refer to the Premier of South Australia according to his correct title.
—Premier Mike Rann—certainly; continue to remind me if I forget those things. Premier Mike Rann started off this process by being disingenuous and saying right at the last minute that waste would not be stored in South Australia. Everybody had decided it was in the very best interests of Australia. He has some short-term political gains, so suddenly the entire process that everybody had agreed to has been absolutely thrown to the wind.
The Commonwealth has to show some leadership in this matter. As far as I am concerned—and as far as most clear-thinking Australians and most people in the Senate are concerned, I would have to say—this is a very important issue for the health of Australians. This is not an issue about a repository; this is an issue about access to fundamental health for Australians. I really do not understand the agenda of those who stand in the way of it. At the end of the day, this is about health and this is a very important issue for all Australians.
Of course, the mischief of Labor continues. The Minister for Central Australia, Elliott McAdam, whilst giving evidence, was putting it about the place that people in Central Australia had not been consulted. He was generally putting it about the place that there was something uncomfortable or dangerous about this radioactive facility. Anybody, including those people, could have afforded themselves of a process that informed them, which the Northern Land Council did. They actually visited ANSTO and asked some questions. They asked questions about safety. They wanted to see the materials, touch them, look at them and understand more about them. When they did, they came to the same conclusion I have. I went through exactly the same process, and the conclusion I have come to is that this is an extremely safe process.
Today we know that the Central Land Council are now saying that they would like to have a say over the traditional owners in a completely separate jurisdiction. I have been dealing with Indigenous people for a very long time, and to want to have a say over somebody else’s country is, I believe, beyond the pale. Again, we know that mischief is afoot and we need to pass legislation that puts beyond doubt all of those things. The process we have gone through identifies all the processes where I think there will be a bit of mischief, and I really hope that this will eventually put to bed any delays that come this way.
I have to say to those people in this place who say that we have trampled all over the rights of Indigenous Territorians that I think that is an absolute fallacy; it is quite the opposite. Indigenous Territorians have said quite clearly that they want the right to nominate a site on their land if they choose. I can remember clearly the times when the only three sites that were nominated were Commonwealth sites. The same people were jumping up and down and yelling in the aisles that that was a terrible affront and a terrible tragedy. I came up with some good amendments that said: ‘Let’s have much better scientific amenity. Rather than having it just anywhere, we should put it where it would best be.’ The Northern Territory government has completely failed. From day one they have said: ‘We won’t be putting in a nomination because we’re fundamentalists. We are simply ignoring the wider benefits to Australia in this and we’re going to play politics.’
That is interesting. Premier Mike Rann and Chief Minister Clare Martin are the very same ones who got together and said that radioactivity is bad. But somehow Mike Rann can put his yellowcake on the train or on a truck and send it right up through the Northern Territory—Clare Martin does not mind that, I have to say. It can go through Alice Springs, Tennant Creek and Katherine into Darwin, on to the Darwin wharf and get unloaded. Of course they have a mutual interest: Mike Rann actually wants to export his yellowcake; Clare Martin is interested in exporting Ranger uranium, of which we have been big supporters. But suddenly when it comes to fundamentally protecting the health of Australians it is: ‘Let’s make a bit of political mischief.’
The purposes of this bill are very basic. First of all, it is to ensure that the land is returned to Indigenous Australians after the facility is no longer required. Secondly, it ensures that it is put beyond the reach of those causing mischief—and I have to say that most of that is driven by those opposite. I hope that this is the last time we look to amending this legislation. I commend the bill to the house.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,23,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2006-12-05,"—I rise to provide a contribution to this debate on the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Legislation Amendment Bill 2006. This bill perpetuates the lies and half-truths that were told to Territorians before the last election about the placement of this nation’s radioactive waste, which is now going to be dumped in the Northern Territory. This is despite the fact that we were given a categorical assurance that the dump would not be built in the Northern Territory and that an offshore option was being considered. This was never ever the intention of this dishonest government.
This time last year we were faced with the first piece of legislation that bulldozed the Territory’s legislation out of existence. It overrode the Territory’s right to conduct its own affairs and it began the process of finding a place at which to dump the nation’s nuclear waste. The original bill, which the government is trying to amend today, was a huge embarrassment in the Northern Territory for Senator Scullion and his mate in the other place. I might add, as I refer to Senator Scullion’s mate one Mr David Tollner that, while reading the Hansard of last week’s proceedings of the House of Representatives, I noted that Mr Tollner did not even bother to make a contribution to the debate on this bill when it went through that house. He has given up trying to defend his position of overriding the rights of the Territory.
—He voted for it.
—Senator Scullion, I will take that interjection. You are right: he did vote for this legislation, as you will vote for it.
—Absolutely.
—This shows that you have simply sold the Territory down the drain. I remember a number of previous senators representing the Northern Territory simply being chastised if they did not stand up for the rights of Territory legislation, particularly in respect of internet gambling and the euthanasia debate. I have referred to these in previous debates about this matter. It seems that in this day and age it is okay for people like Mr Tollner and Senator Scullion to simply support and protect their federal Liberal and National Party mates and completely sell out the Territory.
As a face saver, the Northern Land Council came to Senator Scullion’s aid, saying, ‘We might be interested in a dump.’ Senator Scullion, it is interesting that you have again confessed that some of these legislative amendments have been brought about by the request of the Northern Land Council. It is funny that that is not what your minister said in a Stateline interview last Friday night. I will get to that in the minute.
The Central Land Council opposes these amendments but the Northern Land Council does not, so what are we doing here? We have legislation that is driven at the behest of one land council in the Northern Territory because it suits their political agenda. It is a pity, Senator Scullion, that you did not seek to inform yourself about the extensive consultations that the Central Land Council have had on this matter. In fact, only two weeks ago there was a three-day meeting at Finke. While I know you are avid about what has happened during the Northern Land Council’s meetings, you should inform yourself about what has happened at the Central Land Council’s meetings. I note that at a meeting of the Northern Land Council—I do so with all due respect; it is not my intention to criticise it here—only DEST and ANSTO appeared, not the Australian Conservation Foundation or the Medical Association for the Prevention of War or other experts in this field who might provide an alternative view. They were never given the opportunity to brief or to talk to traditional owners about this matter.
Anyway, let us get back to last year when Senator Scullion was able to wriggle around his embarrassment, saying, ‘We’re going to have a dump in the Territory whether we like it or not and if you don’t like the proposed site we’ll amend the bill to let the Northern Territory or a land council propose one for us.’ Of course the bill was amended to allow this to happen. The Northern Land Council said, ‘Okay, we’ll have a look at it but we want some further changes to ensure that traditional owners are in control.’ As government senators noted in their report from the Senate committee of inquiry into the first bill:
It is clear that the NLC’s support for the legislation is conditional on traditional owners retaining a final veto right concerning the location of a waste facility on the basis of sacred site and environmental considerations.
Twelve months on, we now have this bill indicating that traditional owners or affected persons will have no final say on the siting of the dump. What we are doing today is legislating to remove traditional owners’ final veto right. A submission from Katherine Residents Against Nuclear Dump noted:
The implications of this are extraordinary, as it reduces the former rules of nomination to guidelines, allowing Land Councils to nominate land for a Commonwealth dump irrespective of traditional owners’ opposition and concerns, contrary to their usual, statutory obligations under the Land Rights Act.
The bill explicitly says there will be no right to procedural fairness or judicial review. The government’s legislation was to block what it called ‘politically motivated challenges’ to the process, but, as David Ross, the director of the Central Land Council, said in its submission in the last week or so:
I think the real issue here is that Aboriginal people are not interested in the politically motivated challenges; they are interested in their rights and in being consulted about what is to take place or what is not to take place on their land. That is what interests Aboriginal people more than anything else.
The site nomination by the land council will be the end of the process as far as traditional owners are concerned. The Northern Land Council correctly points out that leases granted over Aboriginal land cannot be invalidated on the basis of faulty consultation. However, under this bill, once a site is given up by traditional owners it will be a done deal for those people—before the government does the environmental assessment, or the designs for the facility and the access corridors, or any other work involved in getting the dump off the ground. Traditional owners will be effectively shut out, well before any of those other processes happen. That is why the provisions of this bill are, unlike other agreements, protected from any disputes about faulty consultation by the Land Rights Act.
Under the Land Rights Act, the protection of the agreement occurs at the end of the negotiation process, perhaps a few years down the track when all the details have been negotiated and what is to be done on the land that is to be leased would be well known by the interested parties. But, under this amended bill, once the site is nominated by the land council, and before the government even has a clear idea of what it will do at the site or in any access corridors, there is simply no further redress or say for traditional owners, even though they may find out a whole lot more about the waste facility, its size and its impact on their country.
This bill absolves the government of any responsibility to traditional owners of a site to ensure that they agree with it becoming a radioactive dump site and losing access to it. It also absolves the land council of meeting its responsibilities under the Land Rights Act to act only on the advice of traditional owners.
The Central Land Council in its submission to the inquiry last week asked:
Why are Australia’s most disadvantaged group being denied a basic entitlement to accountable and transparent process merely because of the possibility of “politically motivated challenges”?
It is ironic that after years of the Country Liberal Party accusing land councils of not acting in the interests of traditional owners, here is the very same Country Liberal Party and their coalition partners actually legislating to encourage it.
The Conservation Foundation said in its submission:
The new provisions in the CRWM Amendment (2006) Bill which specify that failure to comply with 3B(1) would not invalidate a nomination by a Land Council—or declaration by the Minister—just as clearly are intended to revoke Traditional Owners existing rights.
It is extraordinary and profoundly shameful that in a matter as controversial and contested as the siting of a nuclear waste dump such long held and procedurally proper processes are being circumvented.
Senator Scullion’s previous amendments to the dump legislation in 2005 made great play of giving traditional owners control of nominating their land for a dump. Now, in the interests of fast-tracking this dump at all costs, traditional owners will be shut out.
The No Waste Alliance in Darwin’s submission noted that the minister, in her second reading speech, has given a personal assurance that:
... should a nomination be made, I will only accept it if satisfied that these criteria have been met.
The submission continued:
Why, then, has the Minister proposed amendments which specifically state that failure to adhere to these criteria would not validate a nomination—or her declaration—of a site for a Commonwealth nuclear waste dump?
If the minister is being honest with traditional owners in the Northern Territory, and if she would only accept a nomination if she were satisfied the criteria had been met, I ask: why then do we need this legislation?
In the face of repeated lies and broken promises by federal politicians on the various parameters of dumping nuclear waste in the Territory, this empty assurance rings as hollow as her colleague Senator Campbell’s ‘categorical assurance’ two days before the last federal election that the Northern Territory would not be used to dump Commonwealth nuclear waste.
This government purports this bill is really about returning the land to traditional owners after hundreds of years, but—if that ever happens—it can be done at the government’s discretion already, without this legislation. What this bill is really about is blocking the rights of traditional owners or others from challenging any nomination of Aboriginal land for a dump site. But to take the government’s claim at face value: how likely is the return of the land in the foreseeable future?
Australia has just opened its new nuclear reactor in Sydney. It will be producing both low level and intermediate level waste for years to come. Trucks will be rolling into the dump for years and years. In Senate estimates, Mr Davoren of DEST Science Group spoke of the best case scenario with even low-level waste. He said:
You deal with radioactive material that, in the case of low-level radioactive material, for instance, might be disposed of to the environment and is regarded as posing a potential hazard for an institutional control period. If the facility is closed in 50 years, you would maintain surveillance over that site for the institutional control period, which might be 200 or 300 years.
Unless there is a great scientific leap forward, I imagine we will still be producing low-level waste in 50 years time, so why would the government close the facility then, when it is going to be monitored for hundreds of years into the future anyway?
That is the low-level waste; the intermediate waste is too dangerous to just be left in the desert to rot, so it will be stored, temporarily, possibly in the desert, so the government says. That is the same as all other intermediate and high-level waste in the world, which is ‘temporarily stored’ because no scientist anywhere in the world has yet devised a means of building a permanent disposal facility.
The reality is that traditional owners will be waiting a very long time—perhaps generations—until Australia finds a cheap, scientific and sound solution to storing intermediate waste and moves it, eventually, off their land. As the Northern Territory local member for the area of Aboriginal land most likely to nominated, the member for Barkly, Minister Elliott McAdam, said in his submission to the Senate inquiry:
The reality is however, that if radioactive waste is buried, the land will never be returned. If there is contamination from the storage of radioactive waste [on the] land it will never be returned and if no other site is ever found to relocate this radioactive waste, the land will never be returned.
Once again the government has used its numbers to ram through legislation and to allow only the most token of Senate inquiries into this important area. I note comments from my other colleagues about the process of dealing with these Commonwealth waste management bills. This is the second time we have dealt with the bill, the second time that the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Education has looked into what is contained in the detail of this bill, and this is the second time we have been denied an opportunity to travel to the Northern Territory to meet local people concerned, to hear from traditional owners and to meet with the people who will be most affected by this radioactive waste dump.
The hearings have been held here in Canberra—and, if it were not bad enough that we did not give people the opportunity to fly down here, the hearing last Monday week was held by teleconference. It was a total abrogation of the right of people in the Northern Territory to attend a Senate inquiry and to take the time that is needed to put to the Senate committee their objections and concerns about this whole process. In its submission to the inquiry, No Waste Alliance Darwin notes that:
The lack of time for written submissions undoubtedly leaves all parties particularly keen to present further oral submissions to the inquiry. It is therefore once again a source of disappointment that the Committee will not be visiting the impacted regions, let alone the major cities, of the Northern Territory.
No justification or rationale has been presented for this unseemly haste; we can only speculate. One clear reason for rushing this Amendment through at high speed must be to evade unwanted scrutiny of its assault on the existing rights held by Traditional land Owners in the Northern Territory. Further, this haste denies impacted communities and electorates not only access to participation in, but also observation of the process.
As I said, this bill compromises the rights of Indigenous people living in the Territory to make decisions based on free, prior and informed consent. It negates the rights of procedural fairness and natural justice by excluding, under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, any judicial review process in respect of proposed sites for the location of a Commonwealth radioactive waste facility.
The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission provided a submission to the inquiry. On page 6 of the submission they talk about the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People. They say that article 29 of that declaration states:
2. States shall take effective measures to ensure that no storage or disposal of hazardous materials shall take place in the lands or territories of indigenous peoples without their free, prior and informed consent.
This government’s own draft report on uranium mining, processing and nuclear energy—the Switkowski report—says that it is widely accepted that ‘effective community engagement is a common element in the successful siting of repository investigation sites’. There has been no effective communication in the Northern Territory by the federal government through this process—and, of course, there is no intention to have any effective communication.
But let us cut to the chase. On Stateline last Friday night, Minister Bishop suggested that the need for these provisions is a result of the numerous threats by the Northern Territory government to oppose this government’s actions by any means available, including legal challenges. She is very incorrect. There has never been any suggestion by the Northern Territory government that they would make any legal challenges to oppose this dump. They have never said that. That was an incorrect statement by the Minister on Stateline last Friday night—and I hope that, at some stage, she will have the courage to correct the record in respect of the actions of the Northern Territory government.
But let us be really clear what this is about. This is about ensuring that this government’s proposal to push this dump towards being on Muckaty Station is realised. Let us line up all the dominoes here. Earlier this year the Office of the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations amended the constitution of the Muckaty Trust Association—with, I might say, some concern from the members of the Muckaty Land Trust, who believed they were not well informed by ORAC prior to that happening. ORAC tightened up their constitution, broadened the representation and ironed out a few rough edges in terms of the way in which the Muckaty trust can be managed.
This is also about the five families who belong to Muckaty Station, three of whom live on adjoining land. Senator Scullion himself said—and I will be interested to see the Hansard at some stage—that this was about ensuring that anyone who was on land adjacent to the Northern Land Council boundaries could provide no objections. That is exactly the political reality of this bill. This bill is about cutting out all the people affected by Muckaty Station, not just some of the traditional owners but a majority of them—not the ones who live within the Northern Land Council boundary but the ones who live within the Central Land Council boundary. I have a copy of a letter that was written by those people to the chairperson of the Northern Land Council, Mr John Daly, back in July. It states:
Dear Mr Daly,
We write to you with deep concern.
In the past, we have trusted the Northern Land Council (NLC) to protect our Homelands …
…            …            …
Mr Daly, why are you talking to David Tollner and Nigel Scullion for us about our country? Why are you helping the Commonwealth Government to take control of our land to build a nuclear waste facility?
…            …            …
Mr Daly, we ask you to stop talking for us. We do not want a nuclear waste facility built on our land.
This bill is exactly about silencing these traditional owners. (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2006-12-05,"—It would be hard to recall better representatives for the Northern Territory than Senator Nigel Scullion and Mr David Tollner. We have had some good representatives from the Country Liberal Party over the years—the representatives from the Labor Party have not always been so hot—but you would go a long way to find better representatives than Senator Scullion and Mr Tollner. They both have the interests of the Northern Territory and Australia at heart in all the decisions that they make—and they do that again in relation to the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Legislation Amendment Bill 2006. They do not act from some left wing ideology like the Labor representatives from the Northern Territory. They act in the interests of their constituents and in the interests of Australia.
I do not want to keep the Senate long, but I do want to indicate that I am in favour of the safe and responsible management of nuclear waste and I am in favour of Aboriginal people being able to make their own decisions about infrastructure development on their own land. Accordingly, I support the amendments.
It seems from the previous speaker’s speech that she and her party are in favour of Aboriginal people being able to make their own decisions only when it is Aboriginal people who happen to have the same view of life as they do. If it happens to be an Aboriginal group such as the Northern Land Council, who have indicated quite clearly that they want something, and it does not accord with the left wing view of the Labor Party, then the Labor Party are not very interested in what Aboriginal people want. Senator Crossin said she was not here to criticise the Northern Land Council but then she spent a fair proportion of her speech doing just that. I hope that the Northern Land Council and other Aboriginal people understand that Senator Crossin and her party are more interested in the Big Brother approach of saying: ‘We will tell Aboriginal people what is good for them. If they happen to have a view that doesn’t accord with ours, then that is not good for them. They don’t understand what is happening. We will tell them what is right.’ I am proud of Senator Scullion and the member for Solomon, Mr Tollner, in standing up for Northern Territorians, standing up for these Aboriginal people who have indicated what they want to do through their land council, and pursuing this particular policy.
Senator Crossin said with some feigned amazement, one would think, that the Australian Conservation Foundation, the ACF, was not invited to peddle their view on life around the Northern Territory. Why would you get the Australian Conservation Foundation in? Everybody knows that, for many a year now, they and the Australian Labor Party have been working very closely together, which is why they have not been treated as a genuine conservation group, as opposed to a political lobby group, for some time now.
As senators have mentioned, this bill provides a discretionary legislative mechanism for the return of land that has been used as a radioactive waste storage facility to the land trust to which it belonged, removes the process of nominating a site for consideration for use as a Commonwealth radioactive waste storage facility from the application of the AD(JR) Act and also removes the mandatory nature of the requirements governing the process for making nomination. I support this bill because it addresses issues that have been raised by the Northern Land Council in relation to the sensitivities for Aboriginal groups that may be considering putting forward their land for nomination to accommodate a Commonwealth radioactive waste management facility.
This debate has ranged far and wide. The general approach from the Labor Party and from some of the other speakers indicates a head-in-the-sand attitude to Australia’s future energy needs. I note that some members of the Labor Party, such as the member for Batman, Mr Martin Ferguson, believe there should be a debate on nuclear energy, as those of us on this side do. I am not saying that is the be-all and end-all of our energy requirements and greenhouse gas questions; I am simply saying that nuclear energy should be part of the mix. It should also include hydro—I am always surprised about this—which the Greens seem to be opposed to. I invite the Greens, as I have previously done, to explain to me why hydro is bad. It would seem to me to be the best energy source that would have the least impact on greenhouse gas emissions. The Greens also seem to be opposed to biomass when it comes to helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I think they both need to be looked at and put in the mix. The Greens now say they are all in favour of wind power. However, it was not so long ago the Greens were opposing wind power because of what they class as visual and noise pollution.
This government believes that there should be a wide range of energy sources put into the mix. An interesting one that the member for O’Connor, Mr Wilson Tuckey, and many of his Western Australian colleagues, including Senator Eggleston and Senator Johnston, have long been advocating is the use tidal power in the north-west of Western Australia. I must congratulate those Western Australians who have put a hell of a lot of work into looking at tidal power in the north west. I do not claim any expertise on this but it seems to be a great initiative that deserves further consideration and so, too, the government’s clean coal initiatives.
While the Greens, the Labor Party and the Democrats seem to be totally opposed to nuclear power, they always laud France, Great Britain and Europe, with their greenhouse gas emissions. However, they always forget to mention that those European countries have ‘proportionately’ low greenhouse gas emissions because they have a substantial commitment to, and usage of, nuclear power. When I was in the United Kingdom with a delegation a few months ago, the United Kingdom government was renewing its commitment to the use of nuclear power as part of a mix. One of the reasons used was that nuclear power limited their greenhouse gas emissions. They are the sorts of facts that those opposed to even putting it on the table for debate think about when it comes to the question of whether or not nuclear power should be included in the debate on future energy needs not only for Australia but also for the world.
Time moves on. Issues in this debate have been widely canvassed by all speakers. I commend the bill to the Senate and urge its adoption.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,23,1,speech
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2006-12-05,"—I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate on the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Legislation Amendment Bill 2006. I must concur with my colleagues on this side about some of the hysteria that has been peddled in relation to this. Any piece of legislation that relates to nuclear energy seems to attract an extraordinary level of hysteria. I think it just goes to show that there is a maturity on one side of the Senate in being willing to debate these issues sensibly, which is lacking in some other places. I do thank honourable senators for their contributions.
The minority report of the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee’s inquiry into this bill contains much speculation as to the intent of the bill. I read that the bill is purportedly about overcoming opposition from traditional owners to the nomination of their land without weakening Aboriginal land rights and about denying legitimate challenges to land nomination. These alleged intentions of the government are just not supported by any sensible reading of the bill. The intent of this bill is clear: to allow an Indigenous community, if and only if it so desires, to nominate its land for a radioactive waste facility without interference from those ideologically opposed to the establishment of a facility.
The government is trying to facilitate a voluntary nomination of land that could be considered for a facility. The minister has repeatedly given assurances to the parliament that, should a nomination be made, she will only accept it if satisfied that the criteria listed in the act have been met. What the government will not accept are speculative legal challenges that are designed not to ensure that Aboriginal people’s wishes are respected but to frustrate and delay the establishment of the facility. The need for these provisions comes as a result of the numerous threats by the Northern Territory government to oppose this government’s actions by using any means available, including legal challenges. Anti-nuclear green groups have also demonstrated a track record of taking legal action against government activities involving nuclear materials.
None of these threats are based on any objective analysis of the safety of the planned waste facility. The safety and security of the facility is assured by the comprehensive and stringent Australian environmental and regulatory requirements that apply to it. Following completion of the scientific and technical works and the presentation of a detailed assessment of any chosen site, people with a genuine belief that there are unresolved safety issues will have the opportunity to formally put their case to the independent regulators. These threats of legal action are to stop the government commencing the proper process: selecting a site to undergo full, independent environmental and regulatory scrutiny. These threats are to stop Indigenous communities nominating their land for the facility if they so wish.
Under existing provisions of the act, a nomination may only be made by a land council or the Northern Territory Chief Minister. It is an entirely voluntary process. This bill does not alter that requirement in any way. The land councils have made it clear that they cannot and will not nominate Aboriginal land without the consent of the traditional owners concerned. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 lists the functions of a land council as including consultation with traditional owners of Aboriginal land with respect to any proposal relating to the use of that land. In fact the suggestion that a council would act against the express wishes of its constituents I find insulting to the councils concerned. As the chairman of the Northern Land Council told the Senate inquiry, he would be swinging from the nearest bloodwood tree if he nominated land contrary to the wishes of the traditional owners.
Of course, there is another important element of the bill which has been largely overlooked in this debate—that is, to ensure that, should a voluntary site be selected for the facility, there is a mechanism for the land to be returned to its original owners or successors when the site is no longer required for the facility. Again, this can only be done with the consent of those wishing to receive their land back. We have heard from the Northern Land Council that there is interest amongst Aboriginal groups within its area in nominating land. Further, they have indicated that it is concerning for groups to permanently give up their freehold title to that land. This government is responding to those concerns in a sensible and constructive way. These provisions are being made to protect the rights and interests of the traditional owners of Aboriginal land. That these provisions came after concerns were raised by the Northern Land Council indicates that the only thing the Northern Land Council is protecting is its constituents.
As to the Central Land Council’s outright objection to the bill, I would simply make the point that if there is no nomination of land within the CLC’s area then the bill will not have any impact whatsoever on Indigenous interests within their jurisdiction. As the CLC and the Northern Territory Chief Minister are vocal opponents of a facility, a nomination of land within the CLC’s area seems highly improbable, but it is entirely within their own control. The government is responsibly proceeding with the technical investigation of three potential sites on existing Commonwealth Defence land. If we do not receive a nomination, we will go ahead with one of those three sites. However, the government would welcome the opportunity to discuss the possible nomination of land with Indigenous communities who are prepared to take a mature and responsible approach to radioactive waste management and any opportunities it presents.
The Australian government has had to take responsibility for waste management due to the state government’s ideological and ‘not in my backyard’ approach to this issue. The states are happy to benefit from the medical radioisotopes produced by the Australian government’s premier nuclear science and research organisation, ANSTO. They are happy for their citizens to receive treatment for cancer and other life-threatening illnesses, but they refuse to take any responsibility for the disposal of the small volumes of waste that is a consequence of the Australian government’s production of nuclear medicines for the benefit of all Australians. In the interests of all Australians, and to protect the interests of Indigenous Australians in the Northern Territory who might be contemplating a land nomination, I commend this bill to the Senate.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Stephens’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,23,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2006-12-05,"—The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 is a further instalment in the government’s response to the report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee on the effectiveness of Australia’s military justice system. That report was tabled in June 2005, some 17 months ago. The government’s response came 13 months ago. That in itself is an indication of the lack of priority that the government has given this particular matter. And, I may add, it came after six other negative reports on military justice.
This bill makes three principle amendments to the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982. First, it creates the Australian Military Court; second, it creates military juries; and, third, it creates a power for the CDF—the Chief of the Defence Force—to set up a Chief of Defence Force commission of inquiry. It also provides for changed appeal provisions, categorises offences for the purposes of trials and makes a number of other consequential amendments, including transitional arrangements.
At the outset let me state the position of the opposition on this bill. It is one of general criticism. Fundamentally, there is a yawning chasm between the government’s response to the Senate committee report, as reflected in this bill, and the recommendations of that Senate committee. At the heart of this is a deep separation between the government’s acceptance of the military view that military justice should remain within the defence hierarchy and the Senate committee’s recommendation that it be removed to a civilian model. This is a deep philosophical divide marking the determination of the traditional defence establishment to remain a law unto itself, as it has been for many centuries.
Labor was critical of the government’s acceptance of the military review rejecting the committee’s recommendations and, to this date, we remain so. The unanimous, all-party committee view was that, on the damning evidence to that committee, radical reform was essential. Until the essential reform of making the military justice system truly independent, outside the chain of command, the system would remain compromised. It would remain biased and unfair and continue to fail those seeking justice.
This bill implementing the government’s response provides little remedy. In fact, this bill is more of another propaganda effort. The minimal change proposed is presented here as groundbreaking reform. That, by the way, is also the view of the Senate committee. The committee’s views, especially the dissenting views of Labor senators, ought to be noted. The amendments, as we have now seen, are limited. Whilst they have addressed some weaknesses, overall they fail to address our fundamental objection.
The simple reason for Labor’s opposition is that the so-called new system remains part of the military hierarchy. It is staffed by military personnel without any of the attributes which denote proper systems of justice in the modern world. The use of the word ‘independent’ by the minister to describe this new system is simply spin—nothing other than spin.
The presentation of the bill, in both the minister’s speech and the explanatory memorandum, is misleading. The bottom line is that the government wants no change to military justice and is happy to fudge it so that the dysfunctional system will effectively remain in place. As a result, Australia’s fine men and women in the ADF will continue to endure a system of justice that is less than the community standard. We believe they deserve much, much better.
The detail of the Labor argument critical of the bill as a whole has been set out by my colleagues in the House of Representatives chapter and verse. I will not repeat all of those arguments, but I do want to deal with the substance of the amendments. Our original criticism of the military court established by this bill was that it was not a court at all. The old system was prone to bias, compromise, unfairness and abuse of individual rights. The Senate committee recommended that a new military court be established of similar nature to that established under chapter III of the Australian Constitution. As such the court would be established outside the chain of command. It would operate in the same way as a civil court, with independently appointed judges in the standard manner considering all evidence fairly and with all due process. Judges would be drawn from experienced and well-qualified legal people in the community. Defence experience would be secondary to judicial qualifications. As such they would have similar security of tenure as other civil judges and would be appointed by the Governor-General. In short, the committee could see no reason for such a court to retain any trappings of the military.
The court proposed in this bill bears no resemblance to the committee’s model. It is to be comprised of serving military officers who are legally qualified but do not necessarily have judicial experience. Originally, they were to be appointed by the minister for five years only, ceasing automatically on retirement, and denied promotion during office. At least, however, the government has now conceded those weaknesses. The amendments, which we support, transfer the power of appointment and dismissal to the Governor-General. That is a clear win. They also extend the term of appointment to 10 years, though still terminating on retirement from the ADF. That provides for some greater certainty and for building continuity and expertise but it still retains the connection with the chain of command. That is a limited improvement and a minor win.
Retirement from the ADF ought not disqualify any judicial appointment. In fact, it contradicts the power of appointment and removal by the Governor-General alone—and, as we have seen, retirement from the ADF is pretty easy to secure. That attitude was previously expressed in the explanatory memorandum such that if a judge ‘no longer meets his or her individual service deployment requirements’ they may be dismissed. How that sits with the power of the Governor-General is not clear.
Promotion for judges, while still denied during office, is to be automatic after the first five years but to a ceiling rank of brigadier or the equivalent rank in the RAAF or the Navy. This concession at least might remove one small disincentive to becoming a judge. We also support that amendment.
Another amendment changes significantly the attitude to jury trials for category 1 offences—that is, offences of a serious criminal nature. Instead of the provision of six-man juries with majority decisions, the amendment provides for 12-man juries with unanimous verdicts. That is also a win and at least bears some resemblance to the modern civilian model of justice which the government seems hell-bent on denying ADF personnel.
Another amendment to jury trials alters the majority verdict for lesser classifications of offences from four out of six to five out of six. This may be minor but at least it is a concession heading in the right direction, in favour of civilian standards of fairness.
Finally, and most importantly, the amendments concede the point the committee made that this court, whatever its shortcomings, should be a court of record. In fact, it remains breathtaking that the government should have denied this elementary point of fairness and justice in the original bill. But, as always, there is a list of qualifications which potentially render this major concession useless. Clause 13B provides at the end of section 148 the following escape route for secrecy and cover-up—the bane of military justice:
… the Court may order that the whole or a specified part of a record under subsection (1) … is not to be published if the Court considers that such a publication would be inappropriate—
a wonderful word, inappropriate—
taking account of the interests of security or defence of Australia, the proper administration of justice, public morals or any other matter it considers relevant.
Think about that for a minute. Firstly, we have the most mealy-mouthed word possible that you use whenever you make a commitment but you want to enter a caveat to not deliver the commitment—that is, whatever is ‘appropriate’ in the circumstances. Then we say you can take into account the interests of ‘security or defence of Australia’. I am a reasonable man. There may well be a sound proposition that in a military court you should have proper regard to the interests of security or defence when trialling important matters. I believe there is probably an argument for that. But cop this: now the caveat not to have a record of proceeding is extended to ‘the proper administration of justice’. So we are in the situation where we have a tribunal, called a court, dispensing justice, but the ‘proper administration of justice’ can be used as a reason not to have a record of proceedings. If that is not Monty Pythonesque, what is?
But it gets even better. Whatever are ‘public morals’ in relation to the administration of military justice for serving personnel charged with civilian or other offences? If that is not good enough, if that is not wide enough—interests of security, defence, proper administration of justice, public morals—there is ‘any other matter it considers relevant’. That is the caveat that is entered into the creation of a court of record. So the extent to which the new court might be a court of record could easily become a fiction, as we have seen these smokescreens used time and time again to cover the truth. Putting it politely, we appreciate the concession but remain sceptical as to the honour of its intent.
There are various other amendments concerning terms and conditions of appointment from state jurisdictions and contempt of court matters which were clearly drafting oversights. Refinements have also been made to the process of jury deliberation. The opportunity has been taken to finetune those provisions as well as others in what seems to have been a pretty hasty drafting task in its first instance. The opposition supports those amendments. They go some way towards removing the committee’s objections to the bill, but stop well short of an ideal solution. It is a salutary experience to have dragged a stubborn government so far, but we know that the quality of military justice will improve, albeit not to optimum levels. On behalf of serving ADF personnel, we live in hope that the government’s attitude, denying them the standards of civil justice, might continue to mellow.
There remains, however, a significant issue with this proposed military court which is yet to be resolved. It concerns the status of the court as considered by the High Court. This particularly concerns the court’s jurisdiction over criminal matters, for which it is considered to be ill-equipped. In legal terms, there has long been a debate about the authority of military tribunals, which have been challenged in the High Court for their lack of judicial independence and impartiality. The view expressed by the Judge Advocate General is that, the closer such a tribunal can be aligned with arrangements for a court established along the lines of a chapter 3 court, the less likely a challenge might be. The pity is that, if the government had accepted the committee’s recommendations for a military court akin to those established under chapter 3 of the Constitution, this doubt could have been avoided. In fact, there is now a number of new applications before the High Court retesting this very issue with respect to existing military tribunal decisions.
These amendments do go some way to giving the court some enhanced status compared with the original draft. This especially concerns the court being made a court of record—though the qualifications, as I discussed before, are of ongoing concern. The court still looks like it is part of the chain of command, and the minister’s fine words change nothing. Indeed, as the Judge Advocate General of the ADF has stated in evidence to the Senate committee, this court looks like a tribunal. The consequences, however, are very serious. As the JAG pointed out in his evidence to the committee:
The AMC will have complete (and exclusive) Australian jurisdiction over members of the ADF outside Australia ... Given the present and likely future tempo of operations and exercises, it is entirely foreseeable, if not likely, that there will be charges of the most serious offences (such as rape or murder) against members of the ADF at some stage. The AMC would be the only Australian court which would have jurisdiction. The notion that such charges would be dealt with by a body described as a ‘tribunal’ ... is extraordinary.
The JAG went on to say that the bill represented a wasted opportunity to establish a military court with proper independent status.
Labor’s view is that, if this court is to remain, it should have its jurisdiction limited to service disciplinary matters. As a minimum, it should not preside over civilian criminal offences committed overseas. The Law Council of Australia is equally scathing in its criticism of the proposed court. This is not just for legal reasons but also for practical reasons of recruitment, retention, and the strong perception of a lack of independence.
In my few remaining minutes I will turn to the other main provision, that of the proposed Chief of Defence Force commission of inquiry. This does have something to recommend it in that such inquiries will be mandatory and the appointee to conduct it will be a civilian with judicial experience. This would appear to be somewhat of a contradiction to the hardline attitude to the military court on which only ADF personnel can serve. So what is it about a CDF commission which is so different with respect to real independence from the chain of command ? It would seem that, at last, the repeated tragic deaths by suicide of young people in particular have hit home. If this is a personal expression by the CDF of his commitment to fix the problem, we are all pleased. We support this proposal because it is a step in the right direction. Indeed, it is a great pity that the initiative was not taken many years ago. As I am advised, it is something which does not need legislation. In fact, there has been speculation that the process could have been used in lieu of the board of inquiry into the death of Private Kovco. It is a great pity that such an opportunity was not taken. As we have seen, the board of inquiry report has already been widely reported in the media as a whitewash. Regrettably, a comparison of the evidence taken, and the contents of the report, do lead to that conclusion.
In the last decade, 79 ADF personnel have taken their own lives. That is both distressing and appalling. Yet we know so little of the causes, except that bullying and harassment seem to be common elements. Having an improved system of investigation truly independent of the military is a good start. Beyond that, though, it is difficult to see any other change for the better. A culture of bullying and harassment is entrenched in the ADF and little has been seen to change. For example, of those 79 suicides, no disciplinary action was ever taken against a single person. This is perhaps further evidence of the link between a failed military justice system and failed discipline.
The government would like us to think that the evil of bullying has been exorcised. If we could believe recent media stories of the new world, such as the very rosy story that appeared on Four Corners a few weeks ago—and we would like to—we should all be pleased. Then again, it is not long since the death of Trooper Lawrence from heatstroke in the Northern Territory last year on which no action was taken. The coroner found that the death was the result of negligence and Comcare is suing Defence for the maximum penalty under Commonwealth occupational health and safety law. Yet, in answers to my questions on notice, the coroner’s opinion was dismissed and the evidence of a prior warning was denied. This is simply not credible, so we await the Federal Court decision on the appeal with great interest.
However, this proposal for CDF commissions is also subject to some serious criticism from the Law Council—again, unheeded. The Law Council’s view is that, if this provision is to be enacted through regulation, there may be undesirable consequences. The council believes that, given its seriousnessness, the essential provision should be in legislation, not in regulations, and subject to direct parliamentary scrutiny. Labor supports that proposition. The reason for this view is that there are many practical considerations which have been overlooked.
First, it is not considered practical to have such an inquiry into every death in the ADF, including road accidents. It is noted, though, that the council includes suicides in this category, with which we could not agree except to the extent that a CDF inquiry should not proceed until the coroner has determined cause of death. There is nothing more distressing than the suicide of a young person in particular, and we believe such occasions must be examined with the utmost care. The conflict with the powers and responsibilities of state coroners and the lack of suitable arrangements with some states is cited as another concern whereby the CDF inquiry could be unnecessarily complicated.
Finally, the Law Council is concerned at the availability of civilian judges to conduct what could be up to 40 inquiries a year, when the demands on the judiciary are already very high. The council’s suggestion that a wider pool of expertise be provided for, including retired judges, QCs and SCs, is a sensible recommendation which we support. The opposition supports the bill and its principal amendments.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,25,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-12-05,"—Senator Bishop has just gone quite thoroughly through all the provisions of the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 and the amendments that will be made to the act, so I will not go over the same ground again. I would like to reinforce some of the concerns that he raised and associate the Democrats with them. Being on the crossbenches with a lot of different areas I have to try to cover, I have not been able to follow this issue with the detail that I would like.
I was involved to a relatively small degree in the original Senate committee inquiry into the military justice system and I thought it was a very good report. I was pleased to be a part of it and I have been seeking to follow progress since that time. I share the concerns in regard to the inadequacy of some of the responses. I suppose I have to say, to be balanced, that compared with the way that many ministers respond to other Senate committee reports the government and the Defence Force are doing pretty well. It would not be hard to do well by comparison because most government responses to committee reports are abysmal. They are extremely slow for starters and often fairly dismissive as well when their response does finally come down. I would at least acknowledge again on the record there was a relatively prompt response by the then Minister for Defence, Minister Hill, which was accompanied by some action, and there is continuing action.
I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that, even so, I am not satisfied with all that has been done but it is also appropriate to acknowledge that there has been action, there continues to be and there will be further action. I know the committee, which I am no longer a member of due to time constraints, is continuing to follow through, to pressure the government and defence forces and also to monitor progress. That is very commendable because one area where committees sometimes fall down is in the follow-through when they have produced the report and urged everybody to take it on board but do not actually then follow through with the issues. The committee is doing that and I think it should be commended for that.
I have said a number of times in this place—I do not think it can be repeated often enough—that one of the core issues that affect recruitment and retention of personnel relates to how people in the ADF are treated, and the military justice system is a key part of that. When people get a raw deal then not only they but their families really sense that injustice and they let a lot of other people know about it as well. It is a very big signal to a lot of people who are thinking about joining the military that perhaps they might want to think again. If people do not think they will get a fair deal when they run into difficulty in any organisation, line of activity, pursuit or profession then, not surprisingly, they are far less likely to go into that line of activity. So it is very much in the national interest as well as just in the general interest of the people in the ADF that we continue to get positive reform in this area.
This legislation does go some way towards doing that. We saw today in reports of another internal investigation inquiry into the way the ADF deals with discipline and justice matters that there are still significant problems, and you cannot fix all of those by legislation or by changing structures. Those matters are important, but it is about the culture and that is something where significant improvement is still needed.
I have a lot of respect for the current head of the ADF and I believe there is a genuine desire to move things forward, but it is always a difficult job to make the sort of quite major changes that have been recommended and that I believe are still needed. I do not think any organisation has a history or role quite like the defence forces do, but in any group of that size and with that sort of history it is quite difficult to dramatically change cultures, attitudes and approaches in a short space of time. Structural reform is a key part of ensuring attitudinal change as well and that is why continued progress in this area is important. From the Democrats’ point of view that is really the key issue here.
I will not go into the fine print in the way that Senator Bishop has done but that broad principle is still important and I would also take the opportunity to link it to the equally important area, beyond the scope of this particular legislation, of how we treat service personnel, ex-service personnel and veterans when they have been injured, been wounded or run into other difficulties. I think we still have a lot of room for improvement there as well. That has some linkage to the military justice system but goes wider than that.
Whilst I always try to be balanced and to acknowledge positive moves forward when things are being done well—and I do acknowledge that you will never have everybody 100 per cent happy and have everything perfect—I think we still have significant room for improvement in the way ex-service personnel are treated and the support that needs to be provided to them when they run into difficulty. Although there have been improvements, I think there is still significant room for improvement in that area as well. On behalf of the Democrats I am keen to try to play a role in maintaining pressure and continuing to get the change that is needed.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,25,1,speech

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2006-12-05,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

The process by which this legislation has come about has been long and involved a great deal of exposition of the personal pain of many individuals formerly and currently serving in the ADF.
This bill is directly a response to the recommendations of the then Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee References Committee’s report into military justice in 2005.
I chaired that inquiry, and I, like other Senate colleagues also serving on that committee, heard from numerous witnesses who had been dealt with poorly by the military justice system.
Military justice in this country has been exposed to significant examination over the past 10 years, ostensibly stemming from a continual failure in its ability to deliver justice in a fair and independent way.
Three High Court challenges and another underway, as well as six separate coronial, judicial and Parliamentary inquiries have all challenged the legitimacy of the system of justice administered by the defence forces.
Notwithstanding the valid argument that the ADF at times has cases particular to it, it is not true to say that only the ADF is best disposed to handle those cases.
In fact, the evidence before us suggests the opposite. The evidence before us suggests that the ADF is incapable of properly investigating cases and prosecuting them in a fair and timely manner.
There was a litany of examples brought before the 2005 inquiry of just such inadequacies.
That inquiry found that the administration of complaints was not adequate, and this was reflected in many of the submissions. There is an unfortunate and obviously incompatible convergence of the principles of criminal law and the heaving machinery of Defence bureaucracy. This nexus has produced a system rife with untrained or inadequately trained investigators; delays of several years, in some cases, in the processing of complaints; and a general lack of independence.
This has led to complainants and witnesses receiving no protection from those higher in the chain of command, and in fact have fell victim to a culture that disproves of a ‘breaking of the ranks’.
None of this is news to the Government, and in fact the point has been made continually over the past decade, and most recently this week with the release of the ADF-commissioned audit into its investigative capabilities.
The audit showed a culture of obstructing investigations by commanding officers and a chronic lack of skilled military police whose enormous caseloads are leading to delays in the resolution of investigations.
Not surprisingly, a great chunk of complaints about military justice—one in six, as a matter of fact—are directed against the military police.
The consequences of the failings of the military justice system have a very human face. They are the individuals who have felt victimised and persecuted because they have spoken out against injustices they have witnessed in the ADF, but have not been afforded the appropriate protections by senior personnel. Some of these individuals have seen their career stall or lie in tatters after spending years defending themselves against what they see as a service-wide hostility towards them. In more extreme cases, those particular individuals have been driven to more desperate means and resorted to suicide.
Left behind are the families of these individuals who have seen their loved ones crumble under incredible pressure and never dealt the justice they were searching for.
This legislation is the Government’s response to the deficiencies in the system I have just outlined.
This response, however, is entirely inadequate.
At the centre of the Government’s approach to this issue is its belief that the military justice system should remain wholly within the hierarchy of Defence.
The situation that this perpetuates is that the military judges the military. The justice meted out by the military is steeped in the very culture that the dozens of people who came forward before the Senate inquiry complained of.
This is the culture that has also been blamed for obstruction in the ADF audit into the effectiveness of its military police.
We needed to see in this legislation a ground-up reform, where the military justice system was removed from the chain of command and made truly independent.
This bill claims to do that by allowing a fixed, 10-year tenure for military judges, who would be, according to the logic of this legislation, above and beyond the chain of command.
But those who are appointed military judges are still derived from the military itself.
They are required to have sufficient experience in the services, and equally sufficient judicial skills.
This will lead only to the selection of people who are products of the culture that has attracted so much criticism.
The bottom line is the Government is not supportive of systematic reform, they are content to fiddle at the edges and see the continuation of the injustices the system has produced thus far.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,25,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2006-12-05,"—by leave—I take the opportunity to sum up and acknowledge the opposition’s general support for the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2006. I also acknowledge the contribution that the shadow minister, Senator Bishop, made to this debate and his interest in this very important area of reform.
As the Senate will recall, in October 2005, in his speech tabling the government’s response to the 2005 Senate report into the effectiveness of Australia’s military justice system by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee, a committee that I was on—and I think you were too, Mr Acting Deputy President Hutchins—the previous Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Hill, commented that the Australian Defence Force does a truly magnificent job in defending this nation and its interests. Those words were very prescient, of course, as the last couple of years have certainly shown, as they continue to do a truly magnificent job in protecting our interests both at home and abroad.
He also added that the government was committed to providing the best equipment and conditions of service to ensure that the ADF is a modern fighting force and that hand in hand with this is a determination to provide a military justice system that is effective and as fair as possible. The government continues to express its admiration of defence personnel undertaking important and often dangerous activities in Australia and on overseas operations. The government is also committed to reforming the military justice system to address the concerns of defence personnel, the parliament and the community by continuing its commitment to the objectives outlined by Senator Hill at that time. This bill is designed to make a significant enhancement to the military justice system which, in turn, will facilitate a confidence in that system among those that it serves. I would say that if further reforms are necessary as time goes by, they will certainly be considered by the government.
There were a number of questions that Senator Bishop raised that I will respond to in a general sense. The first question he raised was: how will the Australian Military Court ensure its impartiality and judicial independence? He made that general reference. The AMC will be a statutorily established service tribunal which will be independent of the chain of command to enhance its impartiality. The AMC will report to the parliament, not the chain of command. Military judges will be statutorily appointed by the Governor-General and will have security of tenure and remuneration set by the Commonwealth Remuneration Tribunal, further enhancing this independence from the chain of command. The court will be provided with appropriate administrative support, led by the statutorily appointed registrar, so that it can function independent of the chain of command. The military judges will also not be subject to the DFDA in performance of their judicial function. Specialist legal advice from the Australian Government Solicitor was obtained to confirm these arrangements. The AMC will give members of the ADF an impartial, independent court.
A second question that Senator Bishop raised was: will the creation of the AMC provide the ADF with a best practice military trial system? The answer to that is yes. The AMC will contribute to the military justice system’s aims of impartial, rigorous and fair outcomes through enhanced oversight, greater transparency and improved timeliness. The provisions for the AMC include a limited jurisdiction, statutorily appointed military judges, a military jury for certain offences and a statutorily appointed registrar. Offences will be prosecuted only through the office of a statutory DMP. An accused will have defence counsel in all cases, and this would be a legal officer, at no expense to the accused. Provision of defence counsel will be managed by the Director of Defence Counsel Services. In combination, these provisions are world’s best practice for a military court.
Senator Bishop also raised some questions about the CDF commissions of inquiry. I will pose the question: why are those personnel with civilian judicial experience able to preside over a CDF COI and not as a military judge on the AMC? The response is that the AMC and a CDF commission of inquiry serve different legal purposes. The AMC tries service offences and may impose a conviction and punishment under the Defence Force Discipline Act. A CDF commission of inquiry is a fact-finding administrative inquiry. The AMC is deployable and must be able to try service offences on overseas operations. Accordingly, it is necessary for a military judge to be a member of the ADF, who meets military standards for deployments.
A civilian with judicial experience who is a president of a CDF commission of inquiry conducts a fact-finding administrative inquiry. The procedures for a CDF commission of inquiry are set out in the Defence (Inquiry) Regulations 1985. This form of inquiry is similar to a general court of inquiry appointed by the minister, a combined court of inquiry appointed by the minister, and a board of inquiry appointed by the CDF and the secretary, the CDF or service chief or other delegated officers. These inquiries do not apportion blame, and there is no determination of criminal liability for an offence. A panel of suitably qualified civilians has been identified and is now available to participate in both the interim and final arrangements for the CDF COI. Other members of the BOI-COI may be either civilian or military and are selected on the basis of their expertise relative to the nature of the incident under inquiry.
Why are the provisions relating to the Chief of Defence Force commission of inquiry contained in the regulations and not in the act? The bill provides for amendments to section 124 of the Defence Act 1903 to create a CDF commission of inquiry, which will be presided over by a civilian with judicial experience. The detailed provisions relating to the procedures for a CDF commission of inquiry are being developed for inclusion in regulations. The Senate report provides no rationale for including the procedures for a CDF commission of inquiry in the act rather than in regulations.
The provisions relating to the appointment and procedures for a general court of inquiry by the Minister of Defence; a combined board of inquiry by the minister; a board of inquiry by the Secretary of Defence and the CDF, the CDF, the service chiefs or other designated persons; an investigating officer inquiry by the CDF, service chiefs and other commanders; and investigations by the Inspector General ADF are all set out in the Defence (Inquiry) Regulations 1985. Consistent with this arrangement, the essential provisions relating to a CDF commission of inquiry are being included in the regulations rather than in the act.
The placement of legislative provisions concerning the appointment and procedures for a CDF commission of inquiry in the regulations will ensure consistency with all other ADF inquiries legislation. Additionally, in order to clarify the role of coroners and the ADF, in the event of a service death, the ADF and state/territory coroners have been negotiating a form of understanding governing the relationship and operating procedures between the various parties concerning deaths of service personnel and coronial jurisdiction. It was agreed that each coroner would write separately to the CDF outlining the protocols to be observed between the two parties with regard to that particular coronial jurisdiction. To date both Victoria and Tasmania have provided such protocols. The remaining coroners are engaged with Defence with a view to agreeing on similar protocols.
Finally, do members of the ADF give up their rights as an Australian once they have joined the ADF? Clearly, no; Defence Force personnel are subject to the same laws and rights as apply to other Australians in addition to the Defence Force Discipline Act. However, the ADF applies a far greater level of additional regulation than that encountered in other forms of employment and demands behaviour which is consistent with its roles as an armed force. In that regard it is a unique employer.
Proscribed behaviour under the DFDA includes not only matters of a criminal nature applicable to the general community but a range of service disciplinary matters which constitute significant failings in the context of a disciplined armed force frequently serving overseas. While discipline is clearly fundamental to an effective military force, it must be tempered with a concern for individuals and their rights. Finding the balance between discipline and the rights of individuals is the key to achieving operational effectiveness and success.
The ADF has been praised for exemplary performance in operations. The military justice system, in providing the balance between discipline and individual rights, has underpinned the operational success of the ADF over recent years. An effective military justice system, as a core function of command, is necessary in addition to the civil code of justice.
I think that covers the points that I wish to take up as to Senator Bishop’s contribution. This is an important piece of legislation. It has been a long time coming. It was a pleasure—with you, Mr Acting Deputy President Hutchins, and other members of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee—to be part of the nurturing process of this particular piece of legislation. I know, Mr Acting Deputy President, that you took a particular interest in it. We heard some terrible stories, but in the scheme of things I think there was recognition by all of us involved in the inquiry that the ADF, for their part, did not approach it with the point of view of a lack of goodwill to finding a suitable solution and bringing the military justice system into the 21st century, which this legislation substantially does. A modern and professional ADF deserves a modern and effective system of military justice. With the reforms contained in this bill the government will provide a system that will better ensure impartial and fair outcomes and will strike a balance. The most important thing is to strike a balance between the need to ensure effective discipline within the Australian Defence Force and the need to protect individuals and their rights.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2006-12-05,"—by leave—I wish to respond briefly to the remarks of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence. While I had not asked any questions, the parliamentary secretary correctly identified the half a dozen issues that the opposition had been pursuing at the committee level, in contributions this evening on the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 and, I suspect, in contributions on the bill in the other house the other month. I thank him and his advisers for having taken the trouble to prepare notes to put on the record some responses to those half a dozen issues of interest. I undertake to give consideration to those responses over the next few days.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2006-12-05,"—I asked a question in our discussion of this legislation on 1 December about the line of argument that if we make climate change a trigger, the minister will have to say no. I asked:
Does that mean that we can expect him to say no from now on to all the other actions that are considered under the current triggers?
I was interested in whether the minister’s opposition to the climate change trigger meant that he would have to say no to a whole lot of coalmining proposals and whether that in fact extended to other developments—for example, on Christmas Island. He did not answer the question. In fact, he turned it around to ask the ALP. I am quite happy to ask the ALP that question at some stage in the future, but I actually wanted to know what the government thought about it. I also wanted to find out whether that means that the answer on anything related to matters of national environmental significance will be no. And, specifically, I ask: does that mean the minister will be saying no to mining on Christmas Island?",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,27,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2006-12-05,"—I may well say no to mining on Christmas Island when I read the assessment. But we are making an assessment, so I can say either yes or no. I have a question to those who want to say, ‘Let’s put an assessment requirement into the act which will require every coalmine in Australia to be subjected to an assessment based on greenhouse impact’.
You can already accurately assess the greenhouse contribution of a coalmine, based on—as Senator Siewert would understand quite well—a fairly simple calculation about the greenhouse gas emissions from each tonne of coal. Depending on the quality of the coal, you will know exactly—give or take a small percentage error—what the greenhouse gas emissions will be for a coalmine when the coal is burnt. That is quite easy.
I do not think it is so much a question for the Greens to answer, because I think Senator Milne very explicitly and very honestly said that—I do not want to verbal her on this but I think she said—‘On a moral and ethical basis we would say no to coalmines, knowing that the coal will be burnt and will create greenhouse gases.’ The real question—I think I said last week—is one for either Beazley Labor or, potentially as it was then, Rudd Labor. I made the point that we do not take any joy out of leadership fights; we have been through a lot ourselves on this side. But there is an issue for Rudd Labor if they are proposing to apply a Commonwealth assessment for greenhouse gas emissions to coalmines. And this is even more interesting because Mr Rudd is from Queensland and he is pushing the idea of cooperative federalism. He needs to now tell Mr Beattie why he would put a new layer of Commonwealth assessment process across every potential coalmine in Queensland, if, in fact, a future environment minister—say, Peter Garrett in a Rudd Labor government—were not going to say no to opening a new coalmine in Queensland. I think it is a very important question for Labor to answer. I repeat the view that—and I do not want to go on ad nauseam; I would like to keep my answers shorter today—
—You’re not doing a very good job then, are you!
—I think I am doing pretty well so far; in 2½ minutes I have covered a few fairly crucial issues.
—Waffle! You haven’t answered the question.
—I actually answered it in the opening sentence—
—Then sit down!
—but you wouldn’t understand.

Senator Ferris interjecting—

—He is an obnoxious character, isn’t he! The biggest greenhouse gas producer on the Senate floor is Senator Carr. But the real question then becomes—and it is a very awkward question; you do not wonder why Senator Carr would get obstreperous and short-tempered, because it is a big issue for Rudd Labor now—
—You’re talking drivel now—absolute drivel.
—We know that you get upset, Senator Carr. But you have got away now for about three years with having no policy on greenhouse except signing Kyoto—when the whole world is moving beyond Kyoto—and having a national emissions trading scheme to which the two big growth states in Australia have said, ‘No; we are not going to be part of it.’
So you have actually got to do some hard work. You have got to come up with some practical policies which will actually reduce greenhouse gases. Even putting a trigger into the EPBC is irrelevant unless you answer the question that the Greens have answered honestly. And the Greens and the coalition, from different perspectives, are sick and tired of the Labor Party getting a free ride on the environment. You cannot send Peter Garrett off to the Greens to say, ‘We’re anti coal,’ and then send Martin Ferguson off to say, ‘We’re pro coal.’ You can’t have Martin Ferguson going off to the uranium mining industry and saying, ‘We’re pro uranium,’ and then have Peter Garrett saying, ‘We’re anti it.’ You cannot get away with that for very long. The Greens are shining a light on your hypocrisy and your duplicity and so am I.
I have answered Senator Siewert’s question. I will get an assessment about mining on Christmas Island, I will look at that assessment, I will make a decision based on the science in the assessment and I will say yea or nay to mining on Christmas Island. I may say no, or I may say, ‘Yes, subject to a whole load of different changes.’ They are the sorts of parameters I would have on any environmental assessment.
Labor are proposing an amendment. They want to put a new assessment requirement on every coalmine—in fact, every industrial facility—in Australia. If a Rudd government gets an assessment on a coalmine in Queensland or the Hunter Valley—a Sonoma mine or an Anvil mine—and it tells them it is going to produce millions of tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions when they burn that coal overseas, will the environment minister, be it Peter Garrett or Kim Carr—

Senator Carr interjecting—

—I do not think Kevin Rudd would appoint a member of the Liberal Party as his environment minister—even though each of the Howard government environment ministers has done far more for the environment than any Labor environment minister has ever done. This government has been the best friend the environment has ever had; that is just a matter of fact. But, as Senator Siewert asked: when Labor puts the anti coalmining trigger into the federal environment law, the EPBC Act, will Rudd Labor pull it? Senator Carr wants to bring this to a vote as soon as he can. I think he owes it to Australia to tell us whether he, Kevin Rudd or Peter Garrett—or whoever the environment minister is—will pull that trigger. Otherwise, why have the trigger? It is a fair question.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,27,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2006-12-05,"—And that was the minister ‘for’ the environment! The minister says that you can work out on the back of an envelope the amount of greenhouse gas that any coalmine in Australia is going to produce—whether or not it is exported overseas. But then he says he is opposed to a trigger. He argues himself into a corner. If it is such a simple matter to do an assessment of the greenhouse gas impact of coalmines—or thermal power stations or any other entity—then why not do it? One can only be left with the glaringly obvious conclusion that this minister for the environment does not want an assessment of how much greenhouse gas his action and his dereliction of duty will lead to in an age where climate change, as Senator Milne says, is at a tipping point.
If it is so easy to assess the greenhouse gas production from any coalmine—whether or not the coal is exported—why not do it? That is plain, clear information. The answer is that the minister would then have to act on that information. At the moment, he can fail to act in defence of the environment—as he so often does—whether it be the global environment or the environment of this great country of ours.
What is the minister’s assessment of reports that climate change is leading to the unhinging of the Ross icesheet in Antarctica and that, in coming years, this could rapidly lead to a sea level rise of between five and 17 metres around the world? Does the minister give any credence to these scientific reports coming from New Zealand? Which of the measurements—five metres or 17 metres—is true, or does the minister have some other assessment? What is the minister’s action plan for this nation in the event of that catastrophe? As the scientists are linking this to greenhouse gas production, does the minister not think it reasonable that we measure greenhouse gas production and expect action to prevent it so that such catastrophes can, in turn, be prevented down the line?",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,27,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2006-12-05,"—I take this opportunity to canvass some of these matters. The Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell, is a former Manager of Government Business in the Senate. He spent a considerable amount of time in that job—in fact, some say he spent far too long in that job because the government did not have the confidence to move him from that job. I think he was in that job for six or seven years, so he would surely understand the importance of seeking to progress legislation in an orderly and timely manner at this time of year. I have no doubt that the government strategists—or what passes for strategy within this government—understand that principle. They would not have brought on at this particular time of year such a highly controversial piece of legislation, which has had so little public debate and consultation with the community, unless they understood that these are the circumstances in which governments seek to have legislation passed without proper consideration.
I am in fact quite grateful that the minister at the table is able to draw our attention to some of these questions. It is quite clear that he wants a protracted debate. It is quite clear that he wants these matters canvassed thoroughly and completely—and, if necessary, for some days—and I am only too happy to help them in that regard. It is quite clear that the minister wishes not to pursue the issues properly but to make tendentious points—which forces me to point out that the minister’s contributions are totally spurious. He makes the claim that the opposition is in the business of closing down mines. The minister understands that, in terms of the climate change trigger, we take the view that legislation of this type—409 pages of it—at this point in the 21st century ought to at least mention climate change as an issue. You would think that the government’s thinking would have advanced to a stage where the question of climate change had sufficiently registered with the geniuses who populate the government benches to be included in this legislation.
The government has failed to do what everyone else in the country is talking about, and that is to address the issue of climate change. That is what these amendments do. The government seeks to cover up its negligence and its incompetence by trying to misrepresent the opposition’s position by suggesting that, in a country which has 300 years of secure fuel supplies from coal, we would turn our back on the coal industry. The minister must think we are as stupid as he is to buy such a notion—300 years of fuel supply—that the coal industry is going to be closed down overnight, when he knows full well the opposition’s views on the question of clean coal and when he knows only too well my personal views on the work that CSIRO is undertaking and on other substantial research efforts being made within the scientific community in this country in terms of improving the efficiency and the capacity of our coal industry to respond to the whole question of the greenhouse gas challenge.
Senator Campbell has sought to propagate his ignorant and buffoonish attitudes up and down this country as if people were not awake to the sheer hypocrisy of this government and as if the public were not fully aware of the way in which this government has ducked and weaved on this issue over the last 10 years. This government has gone on its guts to the United States on these questions and moved its position according to the changes within US policy. This government has denigrated its own public servants, who as I have said on many occasions are some of the leading public servants in the world on these matters, and has vilified their work by suggesting that the whole Kyoto process is essentially a waste of space.
We know that the former environment minister did not share the current minister’s view, because Senator Hill understood the need for a climate change trigger. If Senator Campbell were to be consistent with the position taken by this government in 1999, he would be supporting these Labor amendments. On 10 December 1999 Robert Hill released a consultation paper on the possible application of a greenhouse trigger under the EPBC Act. At that time Senator Hill said that ‘introducing a greenhouse trigger would provide another measure for addressing our international responsibilities in relation to climate change and ensuring Australia meets its Kyoto target’. But this minister tries to hoodwink the public into presuming that this was never the position of the Howard government. People who know something about the issue know what complete nonsense Senator Campbell is saying. We used to have an environment minister who actually cared about the environment; we now have an environment minister strutting around the country preoccupied with playing political games with parrots and whatever device he can come up with to protect the political interests of the Liberal Party. He is not about protecting the interests of the environment.
When Senator Campbell was a Democrat, when he learnt his basic politics as a member of the Democrats, he understood the importance of these issues. But since that time he has moved somewhat across the political spectrum to the point now where he is on the extreme right of the Liberal Party. I understand that he has had some problems with Noel Crichton-Browne and a few others in the ugly faction of the right in Western Australia. He now feels he has to mouth these platitudes to try to recapture the ground they once held and thus sees the need to denigrate the work of the moderates within the Liberal Party—and, of course, Senator Hill was one of those moderates. Under the policies that are being pursued by this minister the reputation of those moderates is being destroyed.
We have an extremist government with an extremist minister pandering to the most reactionary elements of the business community in this country with the view to pretending that he has an interest in environmental questions. We have seen the appalling sight of the environment minister seeking to push the line in various committees of this parliament that somehow or another Labor is advancing a position which is anti coal because we are proposing that there should be environment protection measures—in this particular bill it is a proposal for a climate change trigger. No-one ever accused Senator Hill of being anti coal when he put up a position very similar to the one that the Labor Party is proposing now. I do not think anyone with any real understanding of the politics of this country would buy for a moment the minister’s slurs, the minister’s contemptible defamations, in terms of the Australian Labor Party’s attitude towards the coal industry; nor would anyone for a moment take the view that the Labor Party was not interested in ensuring the advancement of the coal industry to the development of clean coal. What Labor Party leaders have said time and time again is that the Labor Party, if elected, will go down the path of clean coal and renewables. It is as simple as that. The minister knows that but he is seeking to completely misrepresent Labor’s position, as he has done here tonight.
I say to the minister that, if he wants to continue this discussion, I am only too happy to oblige him. We will go round for round, pound for pound, for as long as it takes. But as a former Manager of Government Business in the Senate, the minister would understand the consequences of the actions he has taken. I am sure his colleagues, some of whom might occasionally glance at the television screen tonight while enjoying the Christmas cheer, would be very impressed with his performance. I am sure Senator Minchin would be very impressed with the sort of nonsensical, provocative and dilettante attitudes this minister is expressing.
In conclusion, we simply say that, when it comes to these matters, it is appropriate, reasonable and entirely in keeping with public sentiment that there be a simple measure included in legislation of this type that the minister should undertake an examination of projects on the basis of the merits of a particular project and should undertake an assessment in terms of the effect of climate change.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,27,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2006-12-05,"—I would like to make a couple of points. Senator Brown asked an entirely reasonable question. I think the last 11 minutes that Senator Carr blustered and filibustered for did not raise a single question. He needs to answer the question: what will he do when he has an assessment that says the Sonoma coalmine in Queensland will produce X million tonnes when the coal is burnt somewhere? He needs to answer the question: what will happen when a future Labor minister is given an assessment that says that the Anvil Hill mine will create 10 million tonnes? He just blustered on and wasted 10 minutes. He did not answer that question. What he failed to address was the fact that many members of the Australian Labor Party, mostly in his own diminishing faction or mini faction, have gone on the record making it quite clear that they oppose coal. Mr Beazley was unable to do this in his time as leader, but it is time that the Leader of the Opposition made a clear statement in relation to coal.
A Labor Party member of the House of Representatives has written to me. Her letter, above her own signature, states quite clearly, and I quote:
The Hunter is one of the world’s carbon capitals and is home to a rapacious coal-mining industry. Anvil Hill is a key part of the Hunter Valley coal export expansion which needs to be stopped if the world is to avoid climate change.
I would say that Senator Milne and Kelly Hoare are of like mind on that statement. The Newcastle Council, the Waverly Council and Labor Party members have all said that we cannot have coal if we are to save the climate, when in fact sensible people know that coal, whether we like it or not, will form a substantial part of the baseload power provision for the planet over the next 25 or 30 years at the very least. There will be an expansion from about 4½ million tonnes of coal to 7½ million tonnes of coal—I might have that figure wrong; I might have about two noughts missing there. There will be an expansion of about 30 or 40 per cent in the extraction and use of coal for baseload power across the planet in that time. So the real challenge, if you are serious about addressing climate change, is in fact to realise that.
This government is putting hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars into renewables. Labor are not promising any money; they are just mouthing platitudes as usual. This is a big challenge for Kevin Rudd and his team. Rather than just saying, ‘Oh, we like renewables and we like clean coal,’ they should put up a budget for clean coal. Let us put a price on it and make a choice. He should say to the Australian people: ‘We’ll spend this much on education. We’ll spend this much on clean coal.’ Do not just say, ‘Oh, we like clean coal,’ or ‘We like renewables,’ put a budget on it. We have put up over $2 billion. We are spending that money. We are rolling out programs. We can be judged on our performance. I will be very happy to be judged on our performance of delivering practical programs to abate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases such as methane.
There is one other point I need to respond to from Senator Carr. Senator Hill did put out a discussion paper as promised in relation to the desirability of a greenhouse trigger. I think it needs to be put on the Senate record that every single state Labor government responded to that discussion paper, as did the two territory governments. Every single state Labor government opposed the greenhouse trigger. Senator Carr, being an active member of a faction in Victoria—as I said, a diminishing faction—talked about my factional allegiances and my role as Manager of Government Business. We know that Senator Carr’s record will show that he was the shortest-serving Manager of Opposition Business, probably for good reason.
—That’s not quite true.
—I am happy for you to correct the record, but you were opposition manager for a very short period of time.
—Is that right? Check that again.
—It seemed that way to me anyway. Maybe I was manager for too long. Maybe you are right and it is all comparative. But you were manager for a very short and ineffective time. I think the person who took over from you is doing a good job, as the person who has taken over from me, I suspect, is doing a better job than I did. I am happy to congratulate Senator Ellison and Senator Ludwig because I think they are managing the affairs of the chamber well.
Of course you will always get an interjection when a fact lands on the table that Senator Carr does not like. But every state Labor government says that they do not want this trigger. There was one government that said they did not mind the trigger. We could play the Senator Abetz game of ‘who said it’ but of course it was in fact Jon Stanhope. I think the mining and industrial activities within the ACT might lead you to wonder why that was. All of the other states said no. So the Labor Party, root and branch, rank and file, right across the country said no to this—and for good reason.
Senator Brown asked a serious question about the science. I accept the consensus of the science. We spent about $32 million of Australian taxpayers’ money on developing the best quality science across the country on a whole range of greenhouse gas and climate change issues. One of the most important reports was one by Professor Will Steffen that we commissioned from the ANU. We asked Professor Steffen to analyse all of the best research across the world to I guess, in a way, give us a lead towards which will be in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report that we will see next year.
His predictions are that generally the last IPCC report’s predictions were more likely to come in on the earlier range rather than the later range in terms of warming. Professor Steffen made the point—and I do not have the report at hand—that, yes, you could get sea level rises of some metres if you see, for example, the Greenland ice shelf melt. I think the prediction is for something like 7 metres. But, when he was questioned on that, he said that sea level rise would occur over a period of 1,000 years. When questioned about sea level rises in this century, I think his report said that the consensus is around about half a metre over the next 100 years. From the preliminary briefings I have had about the intergovernmental panel, they would coalesce around that figure as well. I accept those figures.
I think that practical, sensible action domestically, tied with international agreements, processes and policies that deliver real outcomes, are a matter of vital significance for Australia and the world—contrary to what Senator Carr says when he verbals us as saying that the Kyoto process is a waste of space. Regardless of what he may think, perhaps he should sit down with Anthony Albanese one night and talk about what the Australian delegation did at the Nairobi conference. Mr Albanese was a member of the Australian delegation, and he saw what we did over there. If there were any parallel between what he said to me and what he says to his Labor Party comrades on the performance of the Australian delegation, Senator Carr could not possibly say that we were not deeply involved in the UN FCCC processes. The processes, contrary to what Senator Milne said on Friday, where we were deeply involved—
—As observers!
—No, we weren’t observers.
—You were—you were watching the traffic!
 (Senator Brandis)—Senator Carr, order!
—One day, if Senator Carr ever—and God help the Labor Party if it happens—becomes environment spokesperson, maybe he will go on a delegation to the UN FCCC. He will realise that, in saying that, he is denigrating and reducing the efforts—I am happy to put my efforts aside—of a very dedicated, highly respected Australian delegation who worked in all of the processes of the United Nations framework convention over a period of two weeks and achieved all of the outcomes we set out to achieve. The core one was to get a robust and timely review of the Kyoto protocol, working shoulder to shoulder with European and other friends who are trying to get a global and comprehensive agreement on climate change action.
It saddens me that I would extend an invitation to a Labor Party spokesman to attend as a member of the delegation and that you either do not talk to Mr Albanese or that, if you do speak to him, he would say one thing to me and another thing to you. But I do not think that is the case: I respect the role that Mr Albanese played on that delegation, and he would tell you that Australia played a significant role in all of the forums of the UN FCCC. To describe our role as that of an observer is absolutely inaccurate, fictitious and a deep insult to the dedicated—
—But true!

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2006-12-05,"—I wish to check: the minister said he accepted the science of the reports coming out this year. I asked specifically about the reports from New Zealand scientists about the Ross icesheet and the prospect of it melting and delivering a five- to 17-metre sea level rise around the world, with the West Antarctic icecap. I wondered if the minister could say whether he accepts that science.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,27,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2006-12-05,"—My preliminary advice is that that science is not accepted by the intergovernmental panel or by scientists around the world. It certainly would be a risk, but I think that has come from one scientist. It has certainly come from New Zealand. I think there is enormous value—and I am someone who sees enormous value, as the government does, because we make a major contribution to it—in the concept of having a very good panel across the globe of the best scientists available from all of the different parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. I think that one of the great achievements of the framework convention is that it has established the intergovernmental panel, and it ensures that any piece of science, such as that which has come out of New Zealand on the Ross iceshelf, can be peer reviewed, can be evaluated and can feed into sensible policy. As I understand it, that is not what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will accept as being the sort of science that we should base policy on.
My understanding from preliminary briefings on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is that—if you want to get a window on what is likely to come out of that—the work of Professor Will Steffen from the ANU, in the document that I published and that we commissioned on the best available science on the planet, is the best guidance. I would commend it to Senator Brown if he has not read it. That, from my point of view as environment minister, is the science that I would most recommend to people and take forward in any of my discussions within the government or internationally. It does say that the assessments made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its last report were more likely to come in earlier rather than later. The science is coalescing around the fact that the planet is warming more quickly than the last intergovernmental panel said, at around 0.6 to 0.7 degrees of warming over the last 100 years and double that rate at the poles. So there is a high risk, if there is no action taken or if it is business as usual, of the Greenland icesheet melting. I know there is consensus on that. That is why the world needs practical, real, effective actions, and that is why the world needs an agreement that involves all of the major economies.
If we want to be serious about this, we need to recognise that the old Kyoto protocol, the existing protocol, does not have a pathway towards involvement in commitments by the most rapidly industrialising countries, and we do need that. You cannot have a new Kyoto agreement, a post-Kyoto agreement or a beyond Kyoto agreement—whatever you want to call it—that does not have a pathway towards commitments by rapidly industrialising economies such as China and India. That is not an excuse for not taking action domestically anywhere in the world. It is not an excuse for avoiding concerted international action. What it is, in fact, is an opportunity for a country like Australia to get deeply involved in finding a pathway towards those major rapidly industrialising economies getting involved.
Although Senator Carr and I think to a lesser extent Senator Milne seek to disparage the Australian government’s role, we have worked very hard over the last two years in particular to play a constructive role, and what I might call a bridging role, between the interests in Europe and the interests in our own region finding a way to get commitments from those rapidly industrialising countries. That is very much the focus of what we must do. Just having 35 or 40 per cent of the world’s economies involved in an agreement, and ignoring 60 or 70 per cent of the world’s emitters or economies, and particularly ignoring the rapidly growing ones, is to seek to ignore what can only be seen, by anyone who sits down for an hour or so and looks at the size and scope of the problem, as the real solution.
If you do care deeply about our planet, about our ecosystems and about mankind, that is the approach that we have to take. I think it is a sound approach and I think the Australian delegations at the last two conferences of the parties, the last two UNFCCC conferences and all of the associated inter-sessional forums have done well. I have been very proud to lead both those delegations and to be associated with people like Ambassador Adams and former Ambassador Bamsey, now the head of the dialogue on future action and playing on the international stage. They are great Australians who are working very hard not only for the Australian interest but also for the global interest.
Australia’s interests are intimately tied up with finding this international solution. You do not get the solution for Australia—you do not save the Barrier Reef from coral bleaching, you do not save our alpine regions from losing their snow cover and you do not save our river systems from losing their water inflows—unless you have a robust agreement internationally that delivers you reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. If you do not work hard to bring about that sort of agreement then you will not get that result. That is what Australia is doing and, judging by our results at the Montreal conference and our results at Nairobi, I think we have played a very significant and important role at both of those meetings.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,27,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2006-12-05,"—I want to ask the minister: what is the Australian government’s policy position on the appropriate level for atmospheric concentration of CO by 2100? I have asked the minister this before, and he has never given me an answer. I would really like to know because, in the absence of a greenhouse trigger, which he is not going to support, and in the absence of a national target other than our Kyoto target, which everybody agrees is inadequate, I think we need to know what the government’s position is in relation to the appropriate level for the atmospheric concentration of CO by 2100.
The British government made a judgement about this. It decided that it had to go for something significantly less than 550 parts per million because at that level of concentration you would get more than two degrees of warming, which everybody agrees—I think there is now a consensus—is dangerous climate change. I was rather horrified to see today in the report brought out in a collaboration between ABARE and the CSIRO, The heat is on: the future of energy in Australia, that their base level scenario is looking at 575 parts per million by 2100. That is more than two degrees of warming. That is the Barrier Reef dead. As I said last week, I think it is already too late for coral reefs around the world; they have passed the threshold of dangerous climate change.
I think the Australian people and the community need to know what decision the government has made about what level of concentration of CO in the atmosphere it believes is appropriate. If you say you want to stabilise greenhouse gases in such a way that you get less than two degrees of warming then that means that you are accepting a policy position of substantial cuts by 2050—more than 60 per cent. The figure of 60 per cent was an original estimate by the Blair government. The science is now coming in showing that global warming is accelerating at a faster rate, and people are now looking at upping that figure. There are calls for policy positions that take us to substantially more than that. The Greens have moved for a policy position of an 80 per cent reduction on 1990 levels by 2015. I would like to know what level of atmospheric concentration the government has decided is the level it intends to aim for and produce policies to deliver.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,27,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2006-12-05,"—That is the sort of question that you could speak about for at least an hour. I have been heavied by the opposition saying that by giving answers of three or four minutes I am somehow filibustering this debate, so I will be as succinct as I possibly can. The Stern report says, and I think it is right, that 550 parts per million is getting very risky. I agree with that. I think any national government, whether it be of the UK, which makes up around just over two per cent of global emissions, or of Australia, which makes up just over 1.46 per cent of world emissions, can have a legitimate debate about whether it is 450 parts or 550 parts. It is an important debate.
The reason we have the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is to help resolve those issues. When you have some of the best scientists from around the world, from all the participating members of the UN framework convention—Australia has very high quality representation within that panel—it is an issue best dealt with by that panel.
I am not trying to say that I do not think the Australian government should have a position or a target. I want to engage on this issue in a productive way but every time I speak for longer than a few minutes I get a lecture from the Labor Party saying that somehow I am trying to expand debate. They are a party that has a two-line policy on climate change; we are a government that have written hundreds of pages and spent billions of dollars on climate change, so we take it very seriously.
Let us consider what would happen if I were to say tonight, ‘We think you should see the world’s concentrations limited to 400 parts per million’—or go even lower if you want to be more extreme about it—‘and then adjust domestic greenhouse policy to a global target.’ The reality is that, if you set the target low enough, you could say, ‘To achieve that, Australia would have to make a contribution of, as you have said, an 80 per cent reduction.’ There are figures of between 60 per cent and 80 per cent. If you want to be seriously radical—and obviously this is not the real world—to make the case you could say: ‘Let’s have 100 per cent reduction in Australia. Let’s close down the whole of Australia.’
Quite frankly, when you start talking about 60 per cent or 80 per cent reductions, it is not a huge leap to go to 100 per cent. It illustrates the point—and it is a point that I made to Mr Blair when he was here in Australia a few months ago—that if you shut down the whole of Australia the expansion in energy production and consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from China alone would entirely wipe out the global greenhouse benefits of closing down the whole of Australia, within 10½ months. That is a scientific fact, because they are a building a new power station every six weeks in China. They are urbanising at the rate of a city the size of Brisbane every month. That is a fact that you have to deal with.
Mr Blair makes the point now in his speeches in Great Britain that, if he closed down the whole of the United Kingdom, the expansion of China’s greenhouse gas emissions would entirely neutralise the benefit of that decision within two years. I think that makes the point that it is incredibly important to have a thorough understanding at the national policy level of the impact of a certain level of carbon concentration in the atmosphere.
The fact is that the level of concentration of carbon dioxide in particular has been incredibly stable for some many thousands of years and it is now at a level that is substantially above that long-term average. My strong belief, and the government’s strong belief, is that the massive increase in the carbon concentrations in the atmosphere is contributing substantially to the warming of the atmosphere, that we must stabilise and then reduce greenhouse concentrations and that we must do that through sound domestic policy and by playing a constructive leadership role within the international community. I accept that 550 parts per million is very risky. Further to that, I look forward to the further advice of the intergovernmental panel, which we will receive very shortly.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,27,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2006-12-05,"—I appreciate the minister’s remarks in that regard. The point is that when the United Kingdom made the decision to look at what they thought would be an unacceptable level of concentration they made it a 60 per cent reduction on 2050 levels to take into account emissions from developing countries. So they looked at the total global emissions and the total concentrations to see what the developed world would have to reduce their emissions by to take that into account. That is how they got to the 60 per cent by 2050. That is why I am asking about Australia’s position.
My greater concern here tonight is that we do not have a stated desired concentration level, because everything flows from that in terms of targets and how you get there. I particularly wanted to comment on it in relation to the adequacy of Australian government policy advice. I refer to this report, The Heat is on: the future of energy in Australia, by CSIRO and ABARE. I believe ABARE do the Australian people a complete and utter disservice when it comes to climate change. They do not believe that climate change is real. They do not factor it into any of their policy recommendations.
In fact, they are slowing down the capacity of the country to respond to climate change through their advice to government on issues like the differentiation between road and rail transport, their projections of oil prices and their suggestion that you can go to coal to liquids. They suggest that you can put climate change to one side. They actively say, ‘Put climate change to one side.’ They actively talk about carbon dioxide emissions as externalities. When the whole world is trying to come to terms with how you internalise the cost of carbon, ABARE are still fixed in some economic past and are giving the country bad advice.
So I would like to just put on record here that this report—this collaboration between CSIRO and ABARE—says:
A target for the stabilisation of atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO) of 570 parts per million (ppm) by 2100 is investigated based on the A1T scenario from the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) (IPCC, 2000). In establishing this anchor point, the EFF does not endorse it or suggest that it would represent on acceptable level of emissions or consequent climate change. The choice represents a compromise between the desire to explore significant global emission reduction and the need to work within the constraints of ABARE’s economic models.
So this whole report is based on a base level scenario of 575 parts per million, which everybody accepts is dangerous for climate change and is unacceptable. So what is the point in a whole body of work simply made on a compromise because ABARE’s models are so constrained, out of date and unable to cope with the whole climate change scenarios that CSIRO has to allow for ABARE’s inadequacies and write a report based on a concentration which we all know is totally unacceptable?
I do not expect the minister to be critical of ABARE in the same way that I am but, frankly, I think they are holding back Treasury’s capacity to respond to climate change. The fact is that the Treasurer has never mentioned climate change as a risk to the Australian economy in all his years as Treasurer, including in this year’s budget speech, and he has never mentioned oil depletion as a significant risk to the Australian current account—because, apart from anything else, whether or not you believe in peak oil, the fact is Australia is losing its self-sufficiency in oil and the import bills are going to blow out the trade deficit substantially in years to come, and are already doing so. Yet ABARE blithely advises Treasury: ‘Put climate change to one side. No problem with oil prices—we’ll just go to coal to liquids as a transport fuel.’ Frankly, they are so out of date they are an embarrassment.
I am frustrated that the policy advice that comes out of the Australian Greenhouse Office is somehow sidelined by a group of economists who have absolutely no relevance in global changed circumstances. I do not expect the minister to comment particularly but I would like him to take it on notice that this report is doing the Australian people a disservice. I do not disagree with a lot of its conclusions. It is basically agreeing with Stern that the cost of action now is nothing compared with the cost of not acting by 2100. They go through the kinds of things that we have all been saying. But I am horrified by the fact that they go through an exercise talking about 575 parts per million and then have to have a disclaimer saying that the authors do not endorse or suggest that it would represent an acceptable level of emissions or consequent climate change.
I encourage the minister to actually get from the government sources of advice something of a consensus about what they have determined is an appropriate level of atmospheric concentrations of CO and tell the Australian people now what that is. We have the latest IPCC report coming out in May next year. Each year that this goes on assumes that we have time to deal with it. I accept what the minister says about the fact that, if the Greenland iceshelf just melts, you might have 100 years or you might have 50 years, but if it slides off you do not have very much time at all. Those of us who remember defrosting fridges in our youth, before they had those new fridges, remember that all you need to do is get a bit of a vacuum going under loads of ice and the lot comes off at once. That is the fear about rapid sea level rise—so-called ‘climate accidents’.
We already have ravines being formed in the Greenland iceshelf with the water going right down underneath and starting to form that kind of vacuum underneath. If that occurs, and it slides off, just like those of us who have defrosted fridges in the past where you open the door and the whole ice sheet comes off the box, you know that that is the scenario that could well occur. That is what we are talking about with severe climate accidents in the short term and huge sea level rises overnight, which would be a global catastrophe of unimaginable consequence. We are talking about 43 small island developing states disappearing, given their low level. If you look at Bangladesh you see the security ramifications as millions of refugees try to get out of the way. Manhattan would be gone.
The whole lot is an incredible scenario. It is not a scenario that should be discounted, especially when you look at the science, with what they are saying about the west Antarctic icesheet, with what they are seeing when they are looking at the Ross icesheet and the fact that it collapsed rapidly, within a decade, once before in geological time. That is why I think it is really important that we start to get to some sort of consensus in Australia about a level of concentration that we should aim for, taking into account the growing emissions from developing countries. I do not disagree that China, India and South Africa have to be taken into account, but that is why the British overestimated the extent of the cuts that would need to be made in developed economies.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,27,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2006-12-05,"—I think it is a good point that Senator Milne makes about the policy processes within the government of the United Kingdom led by Prime Minister Blair. They have done some substantial work on global impacts, both on ecosystems and, importantly, under the Stern review, on the economics of responding to climate change and the costs and benefits over the next 100 years. On receiving that information the Blair government and their new Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, David Miliband, both came out and changed their policy—for example, in relation to the role of nuclear energy in Great Britain.
As Professor Socolo has said with his Princeton University study, he believes that, of the seven billion tonnes of abatement you need to find over the next 35-odd years, about one billion needs to be from an expansion of the nuclear industry. It is to the credit of the Blair government and to the credit of the Howard government in Australia that they have looked at the science and there will be a debate about what is a dangerous level of carbon concentrations in the atmosphere that will go on for some time.
But I broadly accept what Nicholas Stern has said. I believe that the stabilisation range needs to be somewhere between 450 and 550 parts per million and that you need to be sensible and diligent when you know that you are playing with the potential scenarios that Senator Milne has outlined, that you could and are likely to get events that I think were dramatically exposed in parts of Al Gore’s movie and that the climate is not likely to be in a steady state—it is not likely to get a little bit worse, a little bit worse, a little bit worse; it is more likely that we will see some major weather events that could cause substantial actions. People call that the tipping point or they refer to what Senator Milne has said. So it is far better to be risk averse.
Again, to make the point, Mr Blair and David Miliband and the cabinet of the government of the United Kingdom have looked at all of that information and they have realised, although it is politically tough for them to do so, that part of their response must be to overturn the policy of turning away from nuclear. They have made the politically tough call for a party of the Left or Centre Left that they will move towards an expansion of nuclear power in Great Britain. I think they are to be commended for having a practical approach.
The problem for the Labor Party and the Greens in Australia is that they will quote all of the same figures and science that Mr Blair relies upon to make his decisions within his cabinet—the same decisions that many other governments around the world are making—but they will say no to one of the technologies that we need to at least stabilise greenhouse gas emissions. They will stand in the way of a liquefied natural gas project on the North West Shelf which can help stabilise greenhouse gas emissions. A senior member of the Labor opposition, Carmen Lawrence, the member for Fremantle, is now opposing the export of natural gas from the Burrup Peninsula and wants to close down that project which will make a substantial contribution. The Greens and some elements of the Labor Party are opposing carbon geosequestration. The Princeton University study looks at seven different technologies, each of which can contribute about a billion tonnes of abatement annually. The Greens and the Labor Party are saying no to about three of seven billion tonnes a year of abatement because of ideological problems with abatement methods.
I say ‘hear, hear’ to Mr Blair’s government. It has looked at the science and said, ‘Let’s take practical action.’ If you look at the policies of the Howard government, you will see that we are doing the same thing. We have brought on a debate about what will supply baseload power in Australia and the world in the future that is politically very tough for us. The Labor Party and other parties are creating a scare campaign around the location of a facility for low-level nuclear waste that fundamentally comes from the use of radioactive isotopes to save human lives through radiation therapy. When they are trying to score cheap political points on the location of a low-level nuclear waste facility with material that is primarily used for the treatment of life-threatening cancers in this country, you realise that the Left in Australia is ideologically bereft or ideologically handcuffed to a position that will not allow it to come to a practical and sensible position on climate change. If that is how they deal with low-level waste from the treatment of life-threatening cancers in this country, no wonder they cannot come to a sensible policy on Australia’s environment.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,27,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2006-12-05,"—I am glad the minister raised the issue of Burrup because it allows me to tell him this directly in the chamber while he is listening and to set the record straight. The Greens and, I am fairly certain, Dr Lawrence and Peter Andren, because I heard them say it at the media conference today, do not oppose the development that is proposed in the north-west of WA. We oppose the development going ahead on that particular site. We have asked the minister to facilitate that development moving onto the North West Shelf joint venture site so that the development can go ahead and address the issues that he has been talking about to do with reducing greenhouse gas emissions and also so that we can save the rock carvings. I would like to firmly put that on the record while the minister is in the chamber so that he will no longer repeat the fallacy that we are opposed to that development and to exporting that gas to China. If the minister could take that on board, it would be very much appreciated.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,27,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2006-12-05,"—I want to make it quite clear that the current leader of the Greens, Senator Brown—I believe his position may be under some threat in the party room ballot—has made it quite clear that the alternative site would be at the Maitland Estate. I do not know if Senator Siewert can say where she wants to shift it to, but shifting it to Maitland requires the construction of a new port at West Intercourse Island. What is on West Intercourse Island? Hundreds and hundreds of pieces of rock art. The Greens and Dr Lawrence, a senior member of the Labor opposition, say that they can take this action and it will have no consequences. The consequences of saying, ‘No, you cannot build it there,’ is that the project will not go ahead. It is not a cost-free action. It is not cost free for rock art because rock art extends over 27,000 hectares of the Dampier Archipelago and Burrup. They went to Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney to talk to the elites and pretended that building something in the north-west was going to destroy a lot of rock art. The reality is that, yes, some rock art will have to be shifted and disturbed, but it is 0.02 of one per cent of all the rock art throughout that entire province of 27,000 hectares where there is rock art everywhere. There are in excess of one million pieces of art and the Pluto proposal disturbs 164 pieces of it. They are trying to say that stopping the development from going there will still allow gas exports. All it will do is put up the sovereign risk for the entire industry, extend the approvals process, put another risk in place, put at risk people wanting to come to Australia to develop natural gas resources and put at risk the 80,000 people employed in an industry that creates $10 billion in foreign income.
Labor under Mr Rudd wants to take this sort of action and bring in an emergency listing when there is already a sensible heritage process in place supported by the Western Australian government—a cooperative federalist approach. Mr Rudd says that he wants cooperative federalism. The WA state Labor government and the federal coalition government are working together on an agreed process to handle the Burrup Peninsula to ensure natural gas exports can continue and that the rock art is managed properly in the future. This is something that Dr Lawrence did not come anywhere near to doing when she was premier of the state. She could not have cared less about the Burrup Peninsula when she was premier, but she comes here and wants to appeal to the cafe latte set in the inner suburbs of Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra and so suddenly takes an interest.
The Labor Party will be condemned as hypocrites on this issue unless Mr Rudd comes out and says, ‘I will have no bar of a federal Labor Party putting yet another spoke in the wheel of natural gas exports.’ You cannot say, ‘I’m in favour of natural gas exports,’ and then try and close down the biggest project that is on the drawing board at the moment. You cannot take yourselves seriously. What you are trying to do is stop that project. It has taken years and years of work by hundreds of people to design this project and you say, ‘We’re just going to try and close it down but we can still have the gas industry.’ You think we can still have investment in the highly risky business of exploring for gas, developing it and trying to get the multibillion dollar investment in it. You say, ‘We still like exporting gas.’ Get serious, please; you cannot be taken seriously.
You are demanding that I take action to say, ‘Halt the development of this project.’ You are saying to me as minister that I have 10 days to decide whether I halt the development of the Pluto project and say, ‘No, you cannot continue.’ That is what Dr Lawrence has signed up for me to do—alongside you, Senator Siewert. You want me to say no to the project going ahead. But then on the other hand you say, ‘No, we like the gas industry.’ It is an absolutely absurd proposition.
I really hope if there is going to be a change between Beazley Labor and Rudd Labor, that Mr Rudd says to Dr Lawrence, ‘Get your name off that application.’ This is what Mr Rudd should say: ‘If I believe in cooperative federalism, if I believe in economic development and the benefits of economic development, you, Dr Lawrence, will withdraw federal Labor’s name from that application.’ That is the challenge for Labor. That is the challenge for Mr Rudd on his first day in the job. Please, for Australia’s sake detach the Labor Party from this idiocy that the Greens are progressing with. There is no need for Rudd Labor to be associated with the idiocy of the Greens in trying to stop the gas industry in Western Australia. It is a big test for Mr Rudd and I hope he meets the challenge; I really do for Australia’s sake.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,27,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2006-12-05,"—I have never heard in recent times such a case of selective deafness. Did anybody else in this chamber hear me say, ‘We want that proposal to be moved; it is only a couple of hundred metres up to the joint venture site’? I have written—I did not say this just then but I said it earlier in the chamber—to each of the joint venturers asking them whether they agree to their site, that project, being co-located. I have received responses saying, ‘Yes, they’d be prepared to negotiate.’ Woodside have told me that they would be prepared to negotiate. I have written to the minister to ask him to facilitate that development. I called again in this chamber today for that compromise to be negotiated. I have not received an answer.
What I just heard was the minister saying that I am trying to close down that development. I am not. The Greens are not; we want it moved. Maitland may not be the answer. And by the way, Minister, you do not have to develop Maitland off West Intercourse Island; you can do it another way, and I have had other proponents tell me that. You can go to Onslow. But the most sensible place is 200 or 300 metres up from the current site—they want to develop it there. So please do not repeat that misconception that we are trying to stop this development. You have not answered my question. Perhaps I should pose the question: have you approached the joint venturers or sought to facilitate a meeting between Woodside and the North West Shelf joint venturers so that that plant can be co-located on that site and there would be a true win-win situation for rock art and for development?",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,27,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2006-12-05,"—I might draw to your attention, Mr Temporary Chairman Hutchins, because it may have escaped your notice, that we have now been debating this particular amendment for four hours. The minister at the table has managed to proceed, in the manner that he has adopted during that period, not one millimetre in four hours. As I have said before, as a former manager of government business, you would have thought he would know a little bit more about how to deal with legislation of this type. But he fails to appreciate the lessons—
—What’s your suggestion?
—I would suggest to you, Minister, that you actually address the legislation instead of behaving as the dilettante that you are and demonstrating to this Senate on a regular basis your complete ignorance of how to proceed to get legislation of this type through and debated properly. All we have heard from you—
—This is your amendment.
—That is exactly right. This is my amendment, and you have had the opportunity—
—Why don’t you address your amendment? I’ll take a point of order.
—Take as many points of order as you like.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order going to relevance. The shadow minister responsible for something needs to address his remarks to his amendment. He is not doing so.

(Senator Hutchins)—If you could address the amendment, Senator Carr.
—Thank you, Mr Temporary Chairman. What I have here is an amendment which, as I have said, has been before this chamber for four hours. We have a minister at the table who has had the opportunity to actually canvass the question that has been presented and to explain why the government is opposing this amendment. All we have heard from him is abuse of other senators, gross misrepresentations, defamations of other senators and slurs on other political parties in a manner which is clearly indicative of the fact that he does not want to face up to the fact that this government has failed to address the issue of climate change with this particular legislation. There are 409 pages of legislation and you have failed to deal with this question. You have yet to explain why the government is not supporting these amendments.
What we have heard in its place is a bizarre journey about the minister’s recollections of his world travels as an observer to world events, as a spectator on the question of Kyoto. We have seen the minister try to explain his abysmal performance in regard to changing tack three or four times on the question of greenhouse, where he has come from being a greenhouse gas sceptic and a climate change sceptic to a man who now claims to have been a born-again convert, to a position where he says: ‘Nonetheless, despite that we won’t sign up to Kyoto. We won’t sign up to any commitments on an international basis. We’ll wait for the next phase of international treaty development. We will say, “Yes, there are some very interesting films on this issue.”’
This is the contribution we are hearing from this minister. His own colleague Mr Ian Macfarlane made the point that Al Gore’s movie, An Inconvenient Truth, was just entertainment. That was the position the government took shortly before the United States elections and shortly before the government’s receipt of their latest polling information with the change in the direction it has taken. Their focus group’s research came back and explained that the government’s attitudes on these questions were all wrong, that the Australian community was not going to tolerate the contempt that this government were going to show.
What the Prime Minister sought to do in dealing with this position was to suggest, ‘The government have new directions to follow and new ideas to explore. We haven’t really exhausted our agenda; we have this new notion of nuclear power.’ So the government commissioned their old friend Dr Switkowski to report on the matter of nuclear reactors. Dr Switkowski brought back a report that says there will be 25 nuclear reactors across eastern Australia. If I recall rightly, the report pointed out that these new reactors will not actually reduce the level of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions but will in fact increase them by 29 per cent by 2050. So, Minister, my question to you, given that you have this sudden conversion to nuclear power and despite the fact that—
—Mr Temporary Chairman Hutchins, on a point of order: you called the opposition senator to order for not addressing his amendment. He is still not addressing it. He needs to do so, even though he cares so little about climate change that he calls Kyoto ‘Kie-oto’ and he cannot pronounce the name of the chairman of the nuclear inquiry, Dr Switkowski. He must address his amendment. He has to explain why Labor is proposing to put a new trigger into the environment law of Australia against the wishes of all his Labor comrades in the states. He is proposing a whole new layer of regulation. He has failed to do so and he needs to be brought to order once again.
—Order! Minister, you have an opportunity to reply at some point.
—I am taking a point of order.
—I did not see that it was a point of order. Continue, please, Senator Carr.
—The minister has told us that he suddenly has a new interest in dealing with this whole issue of greenhouse gas emissions. We are now going to embark upon the magical mystery tour of nuclear power for Australia. This is in the context of what the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, Mr Macfarlane, said when he said, ‘We could do this in 10 to 15 years.’ The Minister for Finance and Administration has indicated to this chamber that, given his extensive ministerial experience and his understanding of the Australian economy, particularly given his experience in the resources sector, he is an expert on the whole issue of nuclear power. He said that it would take 100 years to have viable nuclear power in this country as an alternative source of baseload supply.
At the estimates hearings I asked the minister some simple questions, given his commitment to these new issues, as this is the answer to the government’s problem, its failure to deal with the whole issue of greenhouse emissions and its failure to develop a climate change trigger within its legislation. I was thinking of proposing these amendments, and I asked the government: if this is the new answer to our problems, what advice has the government sought from its own greenhouse gas office in regard to the questions on nuclear power? Minister, perhaps you could tell me now: what advice have you sought? I acknowledge that the minister may well have had an opportunity to get advice since that time, but when he was asked this question at the estimates hearings he advised the estimates committee that he had not sought the advice of his own greenhouse gas office experts on the question of nuclear power. In fact, he went on to advise us that he had not even sought to have advice from his department on the environmental impacts of nuclear power. My recollection is that the department had not made a formal submission to Dr Switkowski’s inquiry. It had made some statements about the formal processes of approvals but no other statement.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, on a point of order: it would be quite appropriate if we get to section 140A of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, which deals with nuclear matters, to discuss these issues, but they have absolutely nothing to do with Senator Carr’s amendment. He is proposing an amendment to the Senate to put a new provision, a new section, into the law. He is being irrelevant. The Greens have been asking serious questions. He needs to address his amendment.
—Order! Minister, would you please sit down. You are not relevant there.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I will raise a new point of order: the issues that Senator Carr is raising are to do with environmental approvals in relation to nuclear facilities. He is asking whether I have received advice from my department. Those questions can be addressed if we are addressing section 140 of the act. That is where nuclear issues are dealt with. He is not being relevant to his own—
—Order! Minister, you will have an opportunity to reply. Please sit down. If you do not like my ruling, move against it, but please sit down and let Senator Carr complete his remarks.
—The matters I raise are in response to the very matters that the minister himself has raised. What this minister has done is sought to canvass these issues far and wide, to slander his political opponents, to defame people and to make very crude and grossly inaccurate suggestions about the motivations of members of the opposition. He has raised these questions of nuclear power. He has raised allegations about what he claims to be Labor’s hostility to green coal. He has made a number of wild and woolly accusations, which he does on a regular basis, but he does not like it when someone comes back to him and says, ‘Minister, you are wasting the time of the Senate.’ You are grossly abusing your privileges as a minister of the Crown in this place. On behalf of this government, we now have a situation where four hours have proceeded on these issues and we have not moved one millimetre. We are going around and around with your puerile, offensive remarks, and you will be responded to blow for blow. That is a choice you make, but be under no illusions that, as far as we are concerned, we are not going to put up with these slanders.
—Let’s have a vote then. Sit down and let’s have a vote.
—You had that option when these matters were brought on but what you sought to do was to waste the time of the chamber.

Senator Ian Campbell interjecting—


(Senator Hutchins)—Order! Minister, I would ask you to withdraw that comment.
—I withdraw that he is a hypocrite.
—No, you should—
—I withdraw it.
—Thank you.
—Let’s have the vote. Let’s put the question.
—Minister, please let Senator Carr make his contribution without any interjections.
—Let’s have a vote.
—Is this a point of order?
—Yes, Mr Temporary Chairman. Senator Carr is saying that we are wasting time and that we have not moved very far. Now is the time for him to not seek the call and—
—That is not a point of order. Sit down please, Minister.
—move that—
—Minister, please sit down. The more you interject the longer this debate is going to go.
—I have stopped. Let’s have a vote.
—So the minister has now got to the point where he says he wants a vote. He had that option at eight o’clock.
—That is not—
—You had that option at eight o’clock but you were such a clever man that you thought you would come in here and provoke, abuse, distort, slander, defame and behave as you might have done when you were in the Democrats.
—Come on! So it’s blame the Democrats now.
—I am sorry, Senator Bartlett; I understand you might find that offensive, but you have been a very poor tutor to this right-wing extremist. You have been a very poor student of Democrat behaviour, Minister. Clearly, that is where he learnt this level of infantile debate.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. How is this relevant to the amendments? I ask you, as to relevance, how this can possibly be relevant. Please bring this guy to order.
—Thank you, Minister. Senator Carr, go back to relevance, please.
—I notice that parliamentary language is not being followed here. I am surprised by the bad manners of this senator. I simply say to the minister: if you raise these questions, we are entitled to ask questions. I think it is a simple and logical process. At eight o’clock you had the option, after two hours of debate, to put these questions. Now we have a situation, as a direct result of your provocative and inane comments, where you have stirred up a bit of interest in your performance. I can go on for some time about the question of your performance if that is the way you wish to proceed, and we have many other amendments to deal with before the end of this session. As a former manager of opposition business you would have understood this.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. Once again the opposition spokesman cannot bring himself to discuss the Labor amendments which deal with putting a new trigger into the federal environment law. He has been on his feet for 11 minutes and has not addressed the amendments.
—That is not a point of order, Minister.
—He needs to be relevant.
—Thank you, Minister, but there is no point of order.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I was explaining why these were valid amendments which the government should support. I was explaining that the government’s reaction to them was hysterical. It was based on the government’s gross insecurities about the fact that people were examining the record of this government and the hypocrisy of this government when it came to the issue of climate change and how, in the beginning of the life of this government, the government found it was popular to talk about the issue of climate change, to examine the issue of climate change itself and to even propose in this discussion paper that there be a climate change trigger. Of course at that time the government was even contemplating signing up to the Kyoto protocol. But of course there was a change of government in the United States—and this government is not a leader but a follower; this government is essentially a derivative of the more conservative elements of United States politics—so this government felt that, as a consequence of the change of government in the United States, it would change its policies as well.
Ever since, we have seen a series of global change sceptics propagate their somewhat old-fashioned views, until this year, until very recently when the opinion poll research came in, when the government of the United Kingdom produced a report which achieved some considerable public attention and when the United States elections highlighted that there was a change in attitude even within the United States government. So this government felt it had to change its position again, but not in reality; it had to change its position only in terms of the language it was using. So we heard this minister, who had been relegated to observer status on the margins of various international conferences, trying to claim before the Australian public that he was doing much more than he was. He followed a pattern, as we saw from various examples such as the orange-bellied parrot issue and other appalling acts of stupidity, as the government tried to pretend it was doing one thing when in fact it was doing something entirely different.
So, Minister, we now have the situation where I have an opportunity to explain exactly why you have been such an appalling failure and, as we run into the break, question why you should in fact stay in the job that you are currently in. As I understand the matter, it is only a question of time—and I presume you do want this legislation passed before you are moved from the portfolio—before your appalling record catches up with you in the Prime Minister’s office. Minister, you asked me the question of why it was taking so long. I answer you now: you are the problem. You have had four hours and you have chosen to provoke the situation in this manner. As a consequence, after four hours not one millimetre of progress has been made. You know exactly why that is, and you are entirely responsible.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,27,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2006-12-05,"—I have a couple of matters that I would like to clarify. I note with interest that the minister made the leap from Britain, having made a decision that two degrees of warming was too much—and therefore it would set a target of a reduction of 60 per cent in greenhouse gas emissions on 1990 levels by 2050—to say that is why the Blair government had adopted nuclear power. I believe that is not in fact the case.
Britain’s move to nuclear power is in fact about upgrading existing nuclear power plants. It would cost ₤70 billion to decommission existing plants—a substantial cost. But the reason for Britain’s move to nuclear power is energy security for the UK rather than the greenhouse effect. The whole of Europe is traumatised by Russia having turned off the gas. I think it is fairly clear to everyone that Australia has very different policy positions and opportunities because we are blessed with abundant energy—particularly solar energy—and a whole range of energy options. Britain does not have those options; neither do other European countries. They are completely traumatised by the Russians turning off the gas, and that is why the focus has switched heavily onto energy security at the same time as people are trying to address climate change. Britain has decided to invest vast amounts in nuclear energy—against the advice of its sustainability commission, which recommended against it. But I would argue that the British imperative is as much about fear of the Russians turning off the gas as it is about anything else.
I would like to point out again, in relation to ABARE and nuclear energy in Australia—and the minister is now talking up nuclear—that ABARE tried their level best with this report to put the best possible spin on nuclear. They had to try very hard, but the best they could come up with was one or two nuclear plants operating by 2050, not the 25 that have been talked about. But the report rightly says that, had ABARE assumed nuclear power costs to be in the upper half of the estimated cost range from international literature and not in the lower half—which is what they did to come up with their one or two power plants—some or all of the contribution of nuclear power would have been displaced by other technologies.
So the economic reality is: if you price carbon, nuclear is still not going to stand up against renewables without a huge government subsidy. And the government cannot give us a price, right now, on the decommissioning of Lucas Heights. We cannot even get a price on the one single facility that we have, let alone an estimate of what you would pay for your power. The Switkowski report proposed that the costs of decommissioning be put onto the consumer in the price of energy from any nuclear facility. We have got no idea what that would be. So you are stuck in this situation where, if you put a price on carbon to try and make nuclear viable, you still have to subsidise it to the hilt, and the cost will be even greater because you have to incorporate into the cost the decommissioning costs.
The realities are, in that situation, that the renewables will absolutely be the most cost-effective scenario in terms of energy supply. But, once again, Minister, I put on the record here that ABARE tried its best for you, as it constantly does; it tried to assume that nuclear would be in the lower-cost half of the estimated cost range, even though international literature shows to the contrary.
In fact, they say in the report that you would only get a higher uptake of nuclear power if you had early confirmation that carbon capture and storage was not going to work, and that would not suit the government’s analysis, even though we have no proven carbon capture and storage. They go on to say that there would have to be significant improvements in nuclear waste disposal capability. We do not have that. They do not have that at Yucca Mountain either. You would have to have technical breakthroughs in the ability of nuclear power to co-produce hydrogen and desalinated water, and a higher demand for these by-products, plus a reinvigorated UN supporting both a global treaty on nuclear materials proliferation and a new terrorism task force. I would suggest to you that the likelihood of those things coming together is remote. ABARE might be able to dream up scenarios in which all that occurs. Good luck to them, because it is not going to happen.
The reality is that, as the Switkowski report acknowledges, you are not going to have nuclear power in Australia. The private sector is not going to invest in it without bipartisan support. You have not got it. There is huge community opposition. And even if you brought all of those things on stream, the Achilles heel you have on climate change is that we have only 10 or 15 years to significantly reduce greenhouse gases, and nuclear will not be on-stream within that time frame.
By the time you built any reactor in Australia—given that all those issues were out of the way—you would be at the stage of locking in dangerous climate change, at least for 2100, within the next 10 or 15 years. And that is the big problem you have on nuclear: it cannot go anywhere near solving—it cannot even begin to solve—the greenhouse gas reduction issues in the 10 to 15 year time frame we have.
So I support the Labor amendment, but I would like to hear from Senator Carr about how, if the Labor trigger were in place—and, as the senator would be aware, ours is a much more stringent trigger, but let us assume the 500,000 tonne trigger was in place—this amendment would work in practice. If it were passed into law, how would an environment minister—having called in a project such as the Anvil Hill coalmine, which would generate 12½ million tonnes of carbon dioxide, an amount well over the trigger, by seven times or whatever—operate under the act if this trigger were in place? It obviously would be triggered by a development such as Anvil Hill. What would then happen? What would the minister do in relation to that information?",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,27,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2006-12-05,"—The whole question of the Anvil Hill decision has been a matter of some considerable discussion and speculation. The Labor Party does not share the Greens’ interpretation of the nature of that decision. The question is: what is a reasonable level of threshold in terms of emissions? We take the view that the threshold should be 500,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. The Greens have the view that it should be 100,000 tonnes. We say that the Greens’ position is, in effect, too harsh. We are seeking a higher target. That is essentially the difference in our political positions. We will look at each proposal on its merits. The minister alleges we are in the business of closing down all the coalmines in this country. We are not.
—You’ll have a trigger, but you won’t use it.
—We will look at the proposals and do a proper assessment.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2006-12-05,"—The Nature Conservation Amendment (Threatened Native Vegetation Communities) Bill 2006 recently passed both houses of the Tasmanian parliament. The bill seeks, by regulation of the state, to conserve native vegetation on private lands. The details of this legislation, and the way in which it was pushed through the Tasmanian upper house, quite rightly caused concern among many people in rural communities in Tasmania.
Regrettably, the Tasmanian government told stakeholders, most notably farmers and landholders, that the Australian government was forcing this legislation to be passed—under threat. The alleged threat was that, if the Tasmanian government did not put in place its own legislation to cover the issue of non-forest vegetation, the Australian government would come in over the top of the state government with legislation that would be far more draconian and, therefore, even more detrimental to our farmers. This is categorically wrong.
It was up to the Tasmanian government to draft the legislation and to implement the Tasmanian Community Forest Agreement on non-forest vegetation. There was no pressure from Canberra as to the exact form of this legislation and as to which native vegetation communities were to be protected. In addition, there was an assertion made that the Australian government was insisting on the inclusion of certain grass species on the list of vegetation protected by this legislation. Again, this is categorically wrong.
My federal Tasmanian colleagues and I take this matter extremely seriously. On their behalf, I have spoken with my colleagues the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell, and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Hon. Peter McGauran, to confirm the Australian government’s position. On 23 November, I received a letter from Senator Campbell which clearly outlines the position of the Australian government in relation to this land management issue. Senator Campbell’s letter reads, in part:
In May 2005, the Prime Minister and the Premier of Tasmania signed the Tasmanian Community Forest Agreement. Since then, the implementation of the non-forest vegetation legislation has been entirely an issue for the Tasmanian government ...
And it is clear that the Tasmanian government has full jurisdiction on this matter. The letter goes on:
... there has been no role for the Australian government in that legislation, nor has any pressure been placed upon the Tasmanian Government as to how they should or should not implement their legislation or the particulars of what must or must not be included.
Given this clear and unequivocal position, it is regrettable that the state government has attempted to blame Canberra for its legislation. There are no two ways about it—the process is straightforward: the Tasmanian government has jurisdiction here, and it bears the responsibility.
The new Leader of the Opposition, Kevin Rudd—or, as we call him, Kevin Cliche—has muttered about the need for a better system of federalism in Australia. His first ‘fork in the road’ or ‘bridge’ might be to travel to Tasmania to let them know that state governments have responsibilities and need to act honestly with their constituents. They cannot hide behind the Australian government.
I recall a similar circumstance in my home state of Tasmania when an exceptional circumstances application made by the Central Highlands community was being considered. A devastating drought had gripped their region—in fact, I came off leave to help deal with the matter. When the extent of the support by the federal government was announced, some farmers complained about its lack of reach. True to form, the state Labor government immediately blamed Canberra. Fortunately, I was able to locate the letter in which the Tasmanian government requested the degree and type of assistance sought—on which this government fully acted and delivered. There was no sense of responsibility and no apology; it was just a case of ‘blame Canberra’. At the time, the circulation of that letter from the Tasmanian government to the Australian government did put an end to this dishonest nonsense from the state government. I similarly trust that the letter from Senator Campbell on this occasion will put an end to the current dishonest nonsense that is being peddled.
I now return to the issue of certain grass species that have been nominated for the list of protected vegetation. A public nomination has been made to have two grass species listed on the EPBC. Contrary to assertions made by the Tasmanian government, this nomination is not being driven by Canberra. This nomination, received from the public, is part of an independent process which is subject to the usual scientific rigours and due process of any such nomination.
I trust that my contribution this evening clears up the issue. I call yet again on the Lennon Labor government in Tasmania to take responsibility for their legislation and explain it to those upon whom it will have an impact. Above all, I call on the Tasmanian government to desist from misleading Tasmanian landholders about the impact of their legislation.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Tasmanian Legislative Jurisdiction</title>,ADJOURNMENT,28,1,speech
