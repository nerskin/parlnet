"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-02-04,"—I move:
Before subparagraph (b)(i), insert:
“(ia)	at 2 pm, questions”.
I will not delay the House, but I believe we should be having question time. There are enormous issues of concern to the Australian public which we need to debate and will debate, but it is my belief that the government should be questioned on those issues before that debate, and now is the time to do that. I know the numbers are not here for that, but I register the Greens' objection to question time not being on today and that we cannot question the government on the issues we are going to debate.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-02-04,"—The opposition will support the motion before the chair moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I want to say, very briefly, that no opposition—and I do not think any party represented in this place—lightly forgoes an opportunity to have question time. This opposition certainly regards question time as one of the most important accountability mechanisms that we have in our system of government. But I think we need to be very frank about the situation we face here. We are confronting dramatic circumstances, with Australian troops having been deployed to a potential theatre of war by a government which has yet to fully explain the reasons for this deployment and the commitments that underpin it. But the opposition is prepared, in these unique circumstances, to give priority to the fullest possible parliamentary debate on this vital issue. 
As I said, it is a matter of being frank. I can make that comment and it might sound, I hope at least to some, a statement of high principle. If people do not accept the statement of principle, then let us deal with the real politics here. The real politics are this: that the opposition would have, if there had been a question time today, asked every question of the government on this issue of Iraq. And I know what the government would have responded if we were to have done this at two o'clock today, as Senator Brown suggested in, I think, a principled way. I know what the government would have said. They would have said, `We wanted to make a statement in this place. The answers to your questions are contained in the statement.' They may not necessarily have been the truth, as you know, Senator Brown, but they would have said in each and every case, `Wait for the statement.'
That is the problem we face, particularly in the situation where the House of Representatives is dealing briefly with the issue of bushfires and then moving to the Prime Minister's statement on Iraq. There is a principle here. There is an issue of balance to address, and it is a question for which arguments can be made on both sides. I can make an argument that I think is strong in terms of principle, but I think I can also say to the Senate that, as every senator knows, if we proceeded with a question time right now, Senator Hill or other senators answering questions would say, `Wait for the Prime Minister's statement.' I think we are better off getting on with the debate around the Prime Minister's statement and, of course, dealing with the other important issue of bushfires. There will be plenty of opportunity for us to hold this government accountable on those and other issues. I think this is not only an issue of principle but also an issue of good sense. Frankly, it is also politics. On balance I believe that, in this circumstance, while we do not lightly forgo question time, there is no alternative today.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-02-04,"—It is appropriate to briefly put the Democrats' views on record, given that the issue has been raised. I think a lot of the comments that Senator Faulkner has made are appropriate. This debate we are having now highlights that the debate on Iraq will be commencing in the House of Representatives before it does in the Senate. If we had had question time first, we would have had the strange situation of the House of Representatives being an hour into its debate on Iraq while we were still waiting to get to it. This would have made it even more difficult for the very important and separate contribution that this house will make to that debate to be noticed and given the attention it deserves. Given that the Democrats were the first to ask for a full parliamentary debate on this issue as long ago as May last year, I think that, now that we are finally getting the Prime Minister to make a statement, to delay consideration of it in the Senate would be rather contradictory to the position we have taken for many months.
We do believe, however, that it is very unfortunate that the government has chosen to forgo question time. The fact that it has done that in the House of Representatives makes it very difficult and problematic for us to continue with it in the Senate whilst the House starts debating the Iraq statement. An alternative might have been for question time to occur later this evening and for questions to be put up consequent to the statement occurring so that the questions could be informed by the Prime Minister's statement. I think that would be preferable, and if there was possible support from others in the chamber for that approach then certainly the Democrats would move that way, even if it meant it was late in the evening.
The other point that does briefly need to be made is that, because of this government's atrocious scheduling of the parliamentary sittings, which we criticised last year and which we attempted unsuccessfully to alter last year, we have only two more sitting days of the Senate this week, and that is it until March. That is ridiculous at a time like this. We will now have only two days with a question time in the Senate until March, by which time, quite feasibly, war could well be under way. It is a very inappropriate and unfortunate dodging of scrutiny and accountability on the part of this government. I think other issues and other options, such as possibly extending question time tomorrow, should be explored. The Democrats, again, are happy to work constructively with other parties to see if we can extend a question time or to see if we can have a question time later on this evening after the statement has been released and debated, to at least get some extra scrutiny of the government. But we do believe that having question time before the statement—and we have been calling for the Prime Minister to make a statement and have a debate on this issue for nine months now—would be inappropriate, given that question time has been forgone in the House of Representatives. For that reason we do not support the Greens' motion. We obviously support the government's motion to bring on this statement now. Given the importance of bringing it on, I will curtail my remarks here. ",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-02-04,"—In rising to speak in support of the Greens' amendment to this motion I believe we should use every single opportunity we can in this parliament to question the government on the decision that they have made. We should use question time and we should use the opportunity to take note of the ministerial statement that is made. To argue that, because the House of Representatives is forgoing question time and forgoing the opportunity to question John Howard on this very important issue, this house should also do so is simply not to recognise the importance of this house. The Greens will continue, on a range of opportunities that we get, to express not only the importance of this house but also the importance of using every opportunity that we can to question this government on the decisions that they have made regarding military invasion of Iraq.
Question negatived.
Original question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-02-04,"—Mr President, my purpose today is to explain to the Senate and through it to the Australian people the government's belief that the world community must deal decisively with Iraq; why Iraq's continued defiance of the United Nations and its possession of chemical and biological weapons and its pursuit of a nuclear capability pose a real and unacceptable threat to the stability and security of our world; why the matters at stake go to the very credibility of the United Nations itself; why the issue is of direct concern to Australia and why, therefore, the Australian government has authorised the forward positioning of elements of the Australian Defence Force in the Persian Gulf.
Although there is considerable debate about the best course of action to resolve this crisis I want, for a moment, to focus on the one thing that unites us all—and that is a common abhorrence of war.
I know that in this I speak for every senator, every Australian. We, all of us, hope that it will still be possible to find an outcome acceptable to the international community without military force being used. The government will not make a final decision to commit to military conflict unless and until it is satisfied that all achievable options for a peaceful resolution have been explored. 
The other point of agreement shared by senators, by our community and by the community of nations is that Iraq must not be allowed to possess weapons of mass destruction—for the security and stability of our world, it must be disarmed.
For years the nations of the world have sought to persuade Iraq to abandon these most offensive of weapons. The Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, has refused to comply and now the weight of the world's attention has fallen on him.
Only one nation can determine whether force will be necessary or not. Only one nation, acting alone, can make the choice for peace. That nation is Iraq.
Full disclosure by Iraq of its chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs and immediate and total cooperation by Iraq with the provisions of resolution 1441 of the Security Council will remove the need for military action.
In his report to the Security Council, Dr Hans Blix, the head of the United Nations weapons inspection body for Iraq, made it clear where he believed that the responsibility for the current terrible impasse lay, and I quote:
Iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance—not even today—of the disarmament, which was demanded of it and which it needs to carry out to win the confidence of the world and to live in peace.
Of at least one thing we can all be absolutely certain—if the world turns its back on the threat posed by Iraq, if the community of nations gives up because it is all too hard, then Saddam Hussein will not reward us with benign behaviour.
Such weakness, such an abject failure of international will, will—as in the past—be treated with contempt.
Iraq will not only keep her current weapons but will add to them. Saddam Hussein will not abandon his chemical and biological weapons programs. He will keep striving to build a nuclear capacity. And he will almost certainly, at some time in the future, use these weapons to fulfil his ambition to dominate his region.
Given his aggressive history, who could blame his neighbours, when faced with an Iraq allowed to keep, through the default of the international community, weapons of mass destruction, if they decided that their own security necessitated a corresponding arsenal.
Worse still, other rogue states observing the world community's failure to deal with Iraq will be encouraged to flout the international conventions on arms control and develop their own chemical, biological and even nuclear weapons.
We should all be deeply concerned about a world in which weapons of mass destruction become the norm. The more nations that possess these weapons the greater the risk that they will be used. The likelihood of them falling into the hands of terrorists multiplies as their numbers proliferate. Proliferation of these weapons will make the world a much more dangerous place for all of us.
Through failure to deal once and for all with Iraq, the world will have effectively given a green light to the further spread of these weapons and have further undermined the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty and the conventions on chemical and biological weapons which the world—and not least Australia—has worked so hard to build over the last 30 or more years.
At the heart of this debate must be a recognition of the threat posed to the security of the world through the progressive breakdown of the international covenants against proliferation of nuclear weapons and the spread of chemical and biological weapons.
The world has developed over time a series of treaties, conventions, protocols and control regimes both to prevent the proliferation of chemical, nuclear and biological weapons and, where possible, to eliminate such of those weapons as may exist.
Australia is vehemently opposed to the proliferation of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. We do not possess these weapons and we wish to ensure that they do not become an acceptable part of every nation's arsenal. They are too dangerous. Their destructive power is hundreds of times greater than conventional weapons—terrible as they may be. Their destructive force is not easily contained or controlled and their effects can span the generations. These are no ordinary weapons. 
Every time a nation is allowed to undermine the international treaties and agreements put in place to restrict or prohibit the spread of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons, the world becomes more dangerous for all nations.
Australia—under both coalition and Labor governments—has been a staunch supporter and active proponent of multilateral action to stop the spread of these weapons.
We, therefore, have a direct and lively interest in ensuring that the international order against the spread of such weapons is not eroded but rather reinforced.
It is true that too many nations already include weapons of mass destruction in their armouries. Other nations have developed nuclear weapons—but only two stand accused of breaching the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty: Iraq and North Korea.
Iraq has been thumbing its nose at the United Nations persistently and publicly for 12 years. In North Korea's case the extent of its breach of international commitments has only recently become apparent.
The international community, with Australia playing a leading role, has begun to deal with North Korea. The security of our region and that of the broader world demands that North Korea be brought back into compliance with the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty.
It is ludicrous to suggest, as some have, that because Australia wants the Iraqi issue resolved then we are passive or indifferent about North Korea. Both pose great threats to world security. Both are of intense interest to Australia. It is not a question of choice— both must be dealt with.
I pose the simple question. What hope does the world have of dealing peacefully and effectively with North Korea if the Security Council is seen to deal weakly with Iraq?
Just as we accept without reservation that stability in North Asia is crucial to our economy and our security, we must recognise that the Middle East is not remote or irrelevant to Australia.
Australia is home to several hundred thousand people of Middle Eastern background. We welcomed them, some of them refugees from Saddam Hussein's brutal regime, and we appreciate their contribution to our nation. Many of them could be torn between seeing Saddam brought to account and the possible dangers facing their families back in Iraq. During this time, they will need our compassion and our support. All Australians should ensure that this is offered.
For almost 20 years Iraq has been a constant threat to its neighbours. If Iraq emerges from its current confrontation with world opinion with its arsenal of chemical and biological weapons intact, the potential for Saddam Hussein's aggression against his neighbours to be renewed will be greatly enhanced. Iraq will again feel free to coerce and intimidate countries in the region.
The old policy of containment is eroding. Saddam Hussein has increasingly been able to subvert the sanctions. Smuggling of oil from Iraq and the illegal importation of proscribed goods into Iraq have increased dramatically in the last few years.
Despite the valiant efforts of the weapons inspectors—who destroyed far more of Iraq's weapons programs than Saddam Hussein ever expected—Iraq has still been able to hang on to most of the knowledge and equipment it needs.
Inspectors have never been able to eradicate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs—at best they slowed their development.
There will be no stability—no security— for the nations of the Gulf until Iraq is disarmed of its weapons of mass destruction— totally and permanently.
Disarming Iraq will bring enormous benefits to the Middle East and will be widely welcomed. 
Clearly, however, the international community must redouble its efforts to resolve the seemingly intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
I again call on both sides to bring an end to the violence affecting Israelis and Palestinians. Neither side should make the mistake of alienating, through violence, those who are willing and ready to negotiate a settlement.
Israel has no stauncher ally than Australia in its pursuit of the right to exist within secure and internationally recognised borders.
Australia strongly supports the creation of a viable independent Palestinian state.
It remains a great tragedy that the courageous efforts of Ehud Barak, the former Prime Minister of Israel, who offered the Palestinians the great bulk of their demands, were ultimately repudiated by the Palestinian Chairman Yasser Arafat.
As a genuine friend of Israel's, I urge Ariel Sharon to use the authority of his re-election to take whatever opportunity might reasonably arise to engage the Palestinian Authority in constructive peace discussions.
He should facilitate all bona fide international attempts to bring the parties together.
Can I, however, Mr President, say this to the members of the Palestinian Authority.
How can the Prime Minister of Israel be expected to do these things while ever the murderous pattern of suicide bombing continues to be inflicted on the Israelis?
In the end result, however, any action taken against Iraq must be justified on its own merits. It will not and cannot be predicated on whether or not other challenges to world security have been addressed.
The overriding concern about Iraq is its record of aggression and willingness to use weapons of mass destruction. Saddam Hussein clearly does not see them as weapons of last resort. He has used them against his neighbours. He has used them against his own people.
This is a doleful distinction, which Iraq shares with no other country.
Iraq has form. Saddam Hussein has without provocation invaded Iran and Kuwait. He has fired missiles at Saudi Arabia, Israel, Bahrain and Qatar. He has bullied, threatened and extorted Syria, Jordan and the Gulf States.
Who knows what other horrors he might have perpetrated on the Kurds or the Shiah Muslims if not for the no-fly zones which Britain and the United States have enforced for these last 12 years.
Iraq also has a long history of training and supporting regional terrorist groups. It supports Palestinian suicide bombers who have caused such death and destruction in Israel.
Iraq's history of relationships with and support for terrorist organisations magnify our concerns. The rise of international terrorism adds a new and frightening dimension to the threat posed by the proliferation of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.
The ultimate nightmare for us all must be that weapons of mass destruction fall into the hands of terrorists. The more the world leaves unchecked either the possession of such weapons by rogue states or the spread of those weapons, the more likely it becomes that terrorists will acquire and use them.
It cannot be stressed too strongly, Mr President, that all of this is added to the fact that Iraq has flouted with impunity the resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations.
The Australian government knows that Iraq still has chemical and biological weapons and that Iraq wants to develop nuclear weapons.
We share the view of many that, unless checked, Iraq could, even without outside help, develop nuclear weapons in about five years.
Even before the report of the head of the United Nations weapons inspection body there was compelling evidence to support these beliefs within the published detailed dossiers of British and American intelligence.
On the basis of the intelligence available, the British Joint Intelligence Committee judged that: 
·	Iraq has a useable chemical and biological weapons capability, which has included recent production of chemical and biological agents.
·	Iraq continues to work on developing nuclear weapons—uranium has been sought from Africa that has no civil nuclear application in Iraq.
·	Iraq possesses extended range versions of the Scud ballistic missile in breach of Security Council resolutions, which are capable of reaching Cyprus, Turkey, Tehran and Israel.
·	Iraq's current military planning specifically envisages the use of chemical and biological weapons. In its view, Saddam Hussein is determined to retain these capabilities.
The analysis provided by the Director of the US Central Intelligence Agency reached similar conclusions; that is:
·	Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program.
·	It has begun renewed production of chemical warfare agents, probably including mustard, sarin, cyclosarin and VX.
·	All key aspects—R&D, production, and weaponisation—of Iraq's offensive biological weapons program are active and most elements are larger and more advanced than they were before the Gulf War.
The intelligence material collected over recent times, to which Australia has contributed, points overwhelmingly to Saddam Hussein having acted in systematic defiance of the resolutions of the Security Council, maintained his stockpile of chemical and biological weapons and sought to reconstitute a nuclear weapons program. 
Given the strong and critical language of the Blix report, the nations which comprise the Security Council face a stark and difficult choice.
The council must either act to ensure full compliance by Iraq with resolution 1441 or, through either excessive delay or indifference, risk crippling its own authority.
To emphasise the weight of responsibility, which rests upon the current members of the Security Council, it is worth recalling to the Senate some brief history of this matter.
In 1991, the United Nations Security Council wanted to ensure that the Iraqi President was no longer in a position to launch any more unprovoked attacks on his neighbours. It resolved that Iraq must declare and then destroy all of its chemical and biological weapons and any materials or facilities connected with Saddam's attempts to achieve nuclear capability—his weapons of mass destruction. Iraq was prohibited from ever again possessing such weapons.
When an aggressor is defeated it is a normal and wise practice for the world to seek greater security by demanding the destruction of its offensive weapons—both Germany and Japan were required to disarm after World War II. Both did so and have maintained their commitment to, and championed the cause of, peace.
Saddam Hussein too agreed to disarmament—to allow the United Nations to supervise and record the destruction of his arsenal of chemical and biological weapons and his nuclear capacity.
On this basis, and this basis alone, the world community agreed to cease hostilities against Iraq in April of 1991. Iraq was allowed to maintain a conventional force—no-one questions Iraq's right as a sovereign nation to protect itself by maintaining conventional defensive weapons.
The cease-fire effectively was conditional on Iraq continuing to comply with the terms laid down by the Security Council—including, and importantly, the commitment to renounce weapons of mass destruction. To ensure compliance, the UN determined to continue economic sanctions against Iraq.
For 12 years the community of nations has tried to cajole and encourage Iraq to honour the Security Council resolutions.
For 12 years the international community has tried to contain his ambitions and limit his capacity to keep or manufacture weapons of mass destruction.
For 12 years Australian Navy personnel have supported the multinational interception force in the Persian Gulf, which enforces sanctions against Iraq—the crew of HMAS Kanimbla, which was farewelled on 23 January last, are our most recent contribution to this important operation. 
For eight years the Iraqi President obstructed the weapons inspection teams, who were charged with verifying his compliance with the UN resolutions. And for the last four years, until last December, he refused them entry to Iraq.
Iraq has not complied with 24 out of the 27 provisions contained in successive Security Council resolutions. Over the last 12 years the Security Council has passed no fewer than nine resolutions condemning Iraq's non-cooperation with weapons inspectors. Iraq has had a lot of time and plenty of opportunities to get it right.
The government has consistently argued that the United Nations needs to deal with Saddam Hussein's continued defiance of the Security Council's authority.
This was the view that I put to President Bush shortly before his address to the General Assembly of the United Nations, in September last year. I then argued to him the merits of working through the United Nations.
That has been the steady theme of a strong diplomatic effort by Australia, ably led by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.
He has supported a leading role for the United Nations in addressing this threat. Our close relationship and our ready access to the US administration has meant that our views are heard and respected.
We approached Security Council members in capitals and in New York to encourage a constructive resolution. We recently sent an envoy to South-East Asia to consult key partners in the region and inform them of Australia's position.
The foreign minister's consultations in Europe last week demonstrated we are not alone, neither in our concern, nor in our preparedness, ultimately to act if necessary.
On 8 November last year, the Security Council passed resolution 1441. The nations which comprise the council, large and small, from all the regions of the world, of almost every faith and political persuasion decided, unanimously, that Iraq had been, and remained, in breach of its obligations. In particular they drew attention to Iraq's failure to cooperate with United Nations weapons inspectors and to complete the required disarmament actions.
The resolution puts Iraq on notice—the consequences of non-compliance will be serious.
If the compelling terms of this last resolution are not enforced, then the Security Council's deeds will have failed to match its rhetoric and serious long-term damage will have been done to the United Nations.
In hindsight the world has been too trusting—not careful enough in our dealings with the Iraqi President. But the situation is different now. Iraq has not changed—but we have. We now understand, after the events in Bali and those of 11 September 2001, that we are living in a world where unexpected and devastating terrorist attacks on free and open societies can occur in ways that we have never imagined possible.
There is a new dimension to international relations and we cannot ignore it. The atrocity in Bali demonstrated something Australia had never fully understood until then—that we are truly vulnerable. In light of this we have reappraised the way we view and deal with the threat of terrorism. We understand the danger of leaving threats unaddressed.
As the British Prime Minister, Mr Tony Blair, said last Saturday there are two grave issues the world must now confront: the problem of weapons of mass destruction and the challenge of international terrorism. 
He said that if both were not dealt with, they would sooner or later come together with terrifying consequences for the world.
On 8 November, the Security Council decided to—and I will use the words of resolution 1441—`afford Iraq a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations'. 
The Security Council has given the Iraqi President one last opportunity to demonstrate his willingness to fulfil the commitments he gave in 1991. The terms of the resolution are explicit and prescriptive. Iraq is required to demonstrate compliance. The onus is not on the inspectors to find prohibited weapons or programmes. It is on Iraq to prove that it has destroyed its weapons and dismantled its programmes. 
And how has Iraq responded? 
The weapons inspectors have given their first comprehensive report. They have been very critical of Iraq's attitude—in Dr Blix's view Iraq has cooperated on process but not on substance. The studied impudence of Iraq to the rest of the world has again been on display.
Without Iraq's active and sincere cooperation the weapons inspectors are wasting their time. Inspectors can assist Iraq disarm, they can verify to the world community that Iraq is disarming—they cannot, simply by their presence, achieve disarmament.
Dr Blix did not expressly ask for more time. He did, however, ask for more cooperation. Those who argue that the key issue is to give the inspectors more time have missed the point. 
The inspectors don't need time. They need Iraq's cooperation. If Iraq was demonstrating full compliance, I would argue they be given all the time in the world. But this is demonstrably not the case. 
At the end of last month, Dr Blix reported to the Security Council that all the questions concerning disarmament of Iraq remain outstanding.
The resolution had posed two important tests by which Iraq could demonstrate compliance—the provision of a full and accurate declaration of the regime's weapons of mass destruction and active cooperation with the inspection process. 
Dr Blix reported that Iraq had failed both tests.
The point must clearly be understood that, following its defeat in the Gulf War, Iraq admitted to possessing chemical and biological weapons and to developing a nuclear programme. In those circumstances the overwhelming imperative is that Iraq demonstrates to the world that it has destroyed those weapons and disbanded those programmes. That, in fact, is what this debate is all about.
The world demands to know precisely what happened to Iraq's pre-1998 weapons and material. Iraq claims to have destroyed them—but Dr Blix is right to demand proof.
There are 6,500 chemical bombs—including 550 shells filled with mustard gas, 360 tonnes of bulk chemical warfare agent— including 1.5 tonnes of the deadly nerve agent VX, 3,000 tonnes of precursor chemicals—300 tonnes of which could only be used for the production of VX, and over 30,000 special munitions for the delivery of chemical and biological agents—all unaccounted for.
In 1995, the international community was confronted by Iraq's massive programme for developing offensive biological weapons— one of the largest and most advanced in the world. 
Despite four years of intensive inquiries and searches, the weapons inspectors did not even know of its existence until Saddam's son-in-law, Hussein Kamal, defected. Faced with its duplicity Iraq finally admitted to producing aflatoxin—which causes cancers, the paralysing poison botulinum and anthrax bacteria.
It admitted to manufacturing 8,500 litres of anthrax. A single gram is enough for millions of fatal doses. Dr Blix wants proof that the anthrax has been destroyed—and so do we.
Iraq must account for the large quantity of its undeclared growth media for biological weapons and for all its Scud B ballistic missiles. It must explain why it has rebuilt equipment and facilities destroyed by previous inspection teams. 
It must allow the unfettered, unrestricted reconnaissance flights so relevant data can be collected and analysed. And it must allow the inspectors unsupervised access to relevant members of the Iraqi science community.
Other countries have, in recent years, volunteered to undertake a disarmament process—South Africa, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. Disarmament can involve complex technical checks and processes—but it is still relatively simple provided there is a high-level political commitment to disarm, sound planning and most importantly full cooperation and transparency with weapons inspection teams. 
The transparent, openly cooperative, behaviour of those three countries in disarming could not present a more vivid contrast with the stubborn, deceitful behaviour of Iraq, which has all the hallmarks of a nation which is hiding something.
The world community is not asking the Iraqi regime to prove the impossible. It is asking for straightforward answers to a series of very serious questions.
Now is not the time to relieve the pressure on Iraq.
And there is only one form of pressure that Saddam Hussein understands—the threat of military force. 
We have tried sanctions and containment. Sanctions can be a very powerful instrument of persuasion but have little influence over a dictator who cares nothing for the wellbeing of his people.
The brutal treatment by Saddam Hussein of his own people can be seen through his cruel and cynical manipulation of the oil for food program developed by the United Nations.
For the last 12 years Iraq has been able to trade its oil for humanitarian goods—food and medicines—under United Nations supervision.
Tragically for the Iraqi people, Saddam Hussein has rorted the program, violated its provisions and evaded its constraints. A significant portion of the humanitarian goods are re-exported from Iraq for cash and oil is routinely smuggled out and sold illegally so that Saddam Hussein can finance his weapons programs.
It is the threat of military action which has proved to be the most effective, and perhaps the only, means of attracting President Hussein's attention.
The Secretary General of the United Nations has recognised the value of this strategy. Kofi Annan has stated publicly that in his opinion if the Americans had not applied military pressure through the build-up of forces in the Gulf, the weapons inspectors would not now be in Iraq. There can be no stronger statement of the diplomatic value of the military deployment. There could be no more explicit rejection of America's critics.
The Australian government has the same view. Like the Secretary General, we recognise the value of this strategy and do not consider that the burden of it should fall to the United States and the United Kingdom alone.
That is one of the reasons why elements of the ADF are being pre-positioned in the Persian Gulf.
Mr President, this is not the first time that Australia has pre-positioned forces in the Gulf, both to apply diplomatic pressure against Saddam Hussein and in anticipation of possible military action against Iraq.
In 1998, in the lead up to Operation Desert Fox the government pre-positioned Special Air Service forces and two refuelling aircraft with British and American forces in the Gulf. We did so in the absence of any new, specific, Security Council authorisation and on the understanding that a final decision to commit to military action had not been taken at the time of deployment. The aim then, as now, was to put pressure on Saddam Hussein. The circumstances of the pre-positioning of Australian forces in 1998 are so similar as to be nearly identical. 
In 1998, the then Leader of the Opposition, the Member for Brand—a former defence minister—recognised the value of the strategy, when he said and I quote:
... part of the reason why we have supported the government in giving our approval to the steps that they've taken thus far, has been to assist in putting pressure on Saddam Hussein. And there's no doubt in my mind if there had not been pressure coming in from those who are prepared to be part of a coalition, the energising of the United Nations Security Council and the energising of a couple of members of the United Nations Security Council—Russia and France—to try and find solutions, simply wouldn't have occurred.
In deciding to pre-position our troops, we were also responding to advice from the Australian Defence Force that if, at some time in the near future, we wish to participate in military action our troops would be advantaged by having the opportunity to prepare and acclimatise. 
Mr President, over the past few months there has been sustained criticism from some quarters, both here and abroad, regarding the role of the United States on this whole issue.
So much of that criticism has been either wrong, unfair or downright prejudiced.
No criticism is more outrageous than the claim that US behaviour is driven by a wish to take control of Iraq's oil reserves. Self-evidently, if cheap oil supplies were America's dominant motive, then years before now the United States would have done a deal with Iraq to lift the sanctions in return for plentiful supplies of low-priced oil.
I have no doubt that the driving force behind American policy towards Iraq now is that, in the wake of the events of 11 September, they have a justifiable concern that the twin evils of weapons of mass destruction, in the hands of rogue states, and international terrorism come together with horrific consequences.
The United States has also been falsely accused of acting unilaterally and thus in contemptuous disregard for the role of the United Nations.
The issue of Iraq is now before the Security Council precisely because of the actions and pressure of the United States.
For almost four years the Security Council had left Iraq in the too-hard basket. On 12 September 2002, President Bush addressed the General Assembly and reminded the United Nations of its responsibility to deal with Iraq's repeated defiance of Security Council resolutions. 
Unless, therefore, it is regarded as provocative and contemptuous of the United States to charge the United Nations with the obligation of enforcing its own decisions, this allegation against the United States is without any substance.
—What about Israel?
—I dealt with Israel earlier; I am sorry you were not here. The issue of Iraq will again be before the Security Council tomorrow, 5 February, at the express request of the United States. And its Secretary of State, Colin Powell, will present some new material to council members.
I have authorised the use of some Australian-sourced material in that presentation, which will include material from a number of countries. So as to protect sources, it is not possible for me to be specific as to what material has been sourced in Australia. I am sure that the Senate will understand this.
It can barely be denied by anyone that all the actions of the United States, at present, are designed to ensure that the Security Council acts to compel compliance with its own unanimously adopted resolution 1441.
Australia is a close ally of the United States. No nation is more important to our long-term security. Australians will never forget the vital assistance we received from the United States during World War II.
Our value systems while far from identical are nonetheless similar. We share common democratic values. We have made common cause in the fight against terrorism.
Australia and the United States have a common interest in preventing the spread of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.
Australia's alliance with the United States has been and will remain an important element in the government's decision making process on Iraq.
The crucial long-term value of the US alliance should always be a factor in major national security decisions taken by Australia.
In an increasingly globalised and borderless world, the relationship between Australia and the United States will become more, not less, important.
The most intense desire of us all is that this challenging issue is resolved without war. No-one wants war. We all hope it can be avoided.
Given the past intransigent attitude of Iraq, it is very difficult to conceive that even the full weight of Security Council opinion, unanimously expressed and threatening imminent military action, will induce Saddam Hussein to comply with his international obligations. 
The only hope of a peaceful solution will be if the Security Council acts clearly, decisively and unambiguously.
The greater the hesitancy, the greater the blurring at the edges, the more likely it is that Iraq will again dismiss world opinion.
These are some of the views the Prime Minister will put next week in his discussions with President Bush, the British Prime Minister, Mr Blair, the Secretary-General of the United Nations and others.
The Prime Minister will make it clear that, if military action does become necessary, Australia's strong preference is that it takes place pursuant to a new Security Council resolution.
This is not because Australia believes, as a matter of international law, that a new resolution is required.
It is because the passage of a new resolution, authorising the use of force, will bring forth the greatest level of international support for, and involvement in, military action against Iraq.
There is a strong argument that the terms of 1441, when coupled with all the previous resolutions passed by the Security Council about Iraq, provide a sufficient legal basis for military action, without the express need for a further resolution. 
In fact in 1998, the government agreed to the deployment mentioned earlier—with the support of the then opposition—in the clear knowledge that those personnel deployed could be involved in action against Iraq, believing that adequate legal authority existed for that deployment and any subsequent military action under then existing resolutions of the Security Council.
The Prime Minister has said frequently that the outcome from the Security Council may not be a black or white one.
The sense of the Security Council could be that it acquiesces in, or acknowledges the need for, military action without giving it direct sanction.
It is possible that the majority of the council members could vote for military action but the resolution could be subsequently vetoed by a permanent member.
That proposition clearly was in the mind of the now Leader of the Opposition, when on 15 January he said:
We won't support any military action outside the authority of the UN ... The exception to this position might occur in the case of overwhelming UN Security Council support for military action, but where support for such action was subject to veto. In other words, we might need to assess such a situation in light of the circumstances of the veto.
If the Security Council produces a grey rather than a black or white outcome, choices on final action and commitments will need to be made by many nations, including Australia.
In reaching its final decision the Australian government will be influenced not only by our powerful desire to stop the spread of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and our alliance with the United States, but also importantly by the past practices of nations which have taken collective military action in the interests of world or regional security.
For example, NATO countries conducted bombing attacks against Serbia in 1999 without any kind of direct Security Council authorisation. That authority was never sought because of an apprehended Russian veto.
A subsequent joint Sino-Russian motion condemning the NATO action was defeated. There the matter rested. The Security Council was taken to have acquiesced in the NATO action.
Our goal is disarmament. We want to see a renewed commitment to the principle of nonproliferation. We want to see Iraq free of weapons of mass destruction. We want to see the sanctions lifted. We want Iraq back in the community of nations—because it would be good for the world, good for Australia, and good for the people of Iraq. Most of all we want the conflict resolved without resort to military force.
If the international community does not act now to disarm Iraq, it will have made a mockery of years of effort to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction. It will have encouraged others to mimic Iraq. It will make dealing with North Korea almost impossible. And, most importantly, failure to act will gravely compromise the authority of the United Nations. 
Clearly the pre-positioning of Australian forces and the contingency planning with the US military—to which ministers and the Prime Minister have referred frequently over recent months—have put Australia in a position where it can effectively, and in circumstances providing the best assurances of safety for our forces, contribute to a military operation against Iraq, should a final decision be taken for this to occur.
The moment for that final decision has yet to arrive. That decision ultimately will be guided by the judgment which the government makes as to where Australia's national interest lies. 
This issue poses great and difficult choices for Australia. We all hate the very thought of war in any form. Our natural instinct is to recoil from it. The temptation to turn our backs on the problem and hope it will go away is great.
Yet the realities of the world in which we now live do not permit us that luxury.
We all know that history is replete with examples of the community of nations retreating from difficult decisions through fear of the immediate consequences only to find that those difficult decisions must ultimately be addressed and at an infinitely greater cost.
Finally, Mr President, our thoughts must turn to the men and women of the Australian Defence Force on deployment doing their duty and maintaining a long tradition of courage and professionalism in the service of Australia.
Whatever may be their role in the weeks and months ahead, we admire them and we wish them well. We are united in our prayers and hopes for their safety and wellbeing.
I commend the statement to the Senate. I move:
That the Senate take note of the statement.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,2,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-02-04,"—I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
		“and:
	(a)	censures the Government for forward-deploying Australian troops to a potential theatre of war with Iraq in the absence of any United Nations authorisation and without revealing to the Australian people the commitments on which that deployment was based;
	(b)	declares its opposition to a unilateral military attack on Iraq by the United States;
	(c)	insists that the disarmament of Iraq proceed under the authority of the United Nations; 
	(d)	expresses its full support and confidence in our servicemen and women, while expressing its opposition to the Government's decision to forward-deploy them;
	(e)	expresses its total opposition to any use of nuclear arms and that Australian support should not be provided to any operation where such weaponry may be used; and
	(f)	declares that it has no confidence in the Prime Minister's handling of this grave matter for the nation”.
The Prime Minister has made a unilateral decision and sent 2,000 of our defence personnel off to a war undeclared in the Northern Hemisphere without any cogent explanation of his actions. Yesterday at a press conference the Prime Minister said of the deployment:
... what I owe to the Australian people is the honest prosecution and commitment to what I believe ...
They are the Prime Minister's words. Maybe he is being honest with himself, but he is not being honest with the rest of Australia. Mr Howard's conduct in committing our young people to war, but then saying that he is off to Washington on a peace mission, is doublespeak. His failure to explain to our defence personnel whom he is committing to war why they should go and what proof he has of Saddam Hussein's stockpile of weapons is even worse. The fact that Mr Howard has spent the last few months gearing up for war in cahoots with President Bush but without telling Australians is reprehensible. Australians deserve an explanation. They deserve answers. 
We need to know what deals have been struck. We need to know about the contingencies. We need to know who is in command of our troops. Are they under Australian or US command? So far, Mr Howard has failed to come clean to the Australian people. The Prime Minister has breached the trust that exists between a nation and its leader. Mr Howard claims that he has deployed our troops to bring the maximum pressure to bear on Iraq to dispose of its weapons of mass destruction. He claims that if there is no UN mandate for military action he can bring the troops back even if the US decides to go it alone. The Prime Minister has said that he would withdraw Australian forces if there were a possibility that nuclear weapons could be used. But how could this be done? How does he propose to achieve this? What, if any, assurances has Prime Minister Howard personally sought from the Bush administration?
The Prime Minister had the chance today—perhaps his last chance—to tell the Australian people the truth on these crucial aspects of the deployment that he has already set in train. But he has chosen again not to bring the Australian people into his confidence. We in the opposition believe, and the majority of Australians believe, that Mr Howard has already made the commitment to war. We believe that the grounds are strong for the Senate to censure the government for undertaking the deployment of Australian troops to a potential theatre of war in the absence of any United Nations authorisation and without revealing to the Australian people the commitments on which that deployment is based.
President Bush's State of the Union address last week made it crystal clear that he is prepared to undertake military action against Iraq with or without authorisation from the United Nations. This is precisely the sort of unilateral adventurism that was consigned to the past by the establishment of the United Nations, in particular the United Nations Security Council. But in contrast to President Bush setting out his intentions clearly before the American people, Prime Minister Howard still refuses to tell the Australian people whether he will remain in lock step with President Bush in bombing Iraq even if the UN does not authorise military action at that stage. 
Labor believes that Australian troops should not have been sent before the UN processes were concluded. We believe that the weapons inspectors are still doing their job and they ought to be given the chance to finish it. We believe in the authority of the United Nations Security Council to deal with the issue of disarming Iraq, and we have said that since April last year. The Prime Minister has not consulted the Australian people. He has not consulted the Australian parliament. But he has consulted President Bush—or at least President Bush may have talked to him. He said he was sending the troops because it was in the national interest. We want to know in whose national interest.
Let us not understate the size of the confidence trick that is being played on the Australian people. We are sending more than 2,000 troops. For a nation with a defence force the size of ours it is a huge commitment. It is twice what we have committed to Afghanistan. It is three times what we committed to the Gulf in 1991. This is the largest single commitment of combat troops since Vietnam. Such a decision should only be taken once a just cause has been established, and this has not happened. No evidence has yet been produced of a link between Iraq and al-Qaeda. The weapons inspectors have not been given the chance to complete their job. Military action has not been authorised by the United Nations. 
The Prime Minister said yesterday that he was going to Washington to inform President Bush of the views of the Australian people. I think we can assist the Prime Minister to say what those views are. The Australian people do not want a war. They do not want John Howard's war. They do not want George Bush's war. The majority of the Australian people certainly want to see Iraq disarmed but they want it done under the mandate of the United Nations and they want it done with the authority of international law. That is the position that the Australian Labor Party has consistently argued since April of last year. The Prime Minister is not going to the United States to tell President Bush what the views of the Australian people are. 
—How do you know what he is going to tell him?
—I know he is going to get his riding instructions. That is what he is going for. Everybody knows he is going to get his riding instructions. Let us look at the Howard government's flip-flopping on this issue. Last year when the Labor Party released its detailed policy statement on Iraq the foreign minister and the Treasurer accused us of being appeasers and said that we were `talking like Saddam Hussein' because we wanted the issue to go back to the United Nations Security Council. But in September when President Bush decided to address the General Assembly these ministers in the Australian government changed their tune. The government's rhetoric to some extent has come into accord with what Labor has been saying since April but now we await the government's actions actually matching that rhetoric.
The clear difference between the government and the opposition on this issue, I suppose, does come from a fundamental divergence of principle. Labor has supported the United Nations and the rule of international law. We helped create the United Nations from the ashes of the Second World War. Those efforts to settle international disputes through peaceful means were a proud achievement, and the forging of our strong relationship with the United States has also been a proud achievement. 
I want to be clear about this: the Labor Party supports the US alliance. But we want a mature one. We do not want a toadying one. This alliance has existed for over 50 years. In Australian politics it has always had bipartisan support. It does not mean that we have to agree with every policy position of every US administration. We have had our differences in the past. But the alliance has endured because, fundamentally, Americans and Australians believe in the same things. They believe in democracy. They believe in freedom, and they believe in respect for the rule of law. But if the US flouts decisions of the United Nations it sends a signal to other nations not to be bound by those decisions. 
It is in the interests of nations like Australia for the rule of law to be strong. A strong UN can ensure that nations disarm and can stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction, particularly in our region. The Prime Minister says that his main reason for deploying Australian troops to Iraq is to stop the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. But ask yourself this question: what has the Howard government done in the last seven years to strengthen UN arms control? Nothing that I can see. The Prime Minister has remained silent on the Canberra Commission report. The Canberra Commission clearly said:
The possession of nuclear weapons by any state is a constant stimulus to other states to acquire them.
Where is Mr Howard's brave new initiative to push forward on nuclear arms control? Labor has called for the Canberra Commission to be reconvened with a new mandate to decide what steps are needed to prevent the further proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, and ballistic missiles. The Prime Minister has been unable to convince the US government to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, which even Foreign Minister Downer described as a major milestone which will bring the nuclear arms race to a definite end. Mr Howard said nothing when, last year, the US government walked away from negotiations towards a verification protocol to the Biological Weapons Convention which could have provided the transparency and confidence that all countries were working towards eliminating these terrible weapons. Mr Howard says he has been told that nothing in the US preparations for war with Iraq includes the possible use of nuclear weapons, but a White House spokesman admitted that `all options are on the table'. The Bush administration has made it clear that it reserves the right to respond with overwhelming force, including through the use of nuclear weapons. So the question remains: what action will Mr Howard take in relation to the deployment of Australian troops, should the US make plans to or indeed actually use nuclear weapons? 
Today the Senate is considering the unusual action of expressing no confidence in the Prime Minister's handling of matters relating to military action in Iraq. The opposition do not move this motion lightly. We have carefully considered all the issues involved. We have expressed our unequivocal support for the members of the Australian Defence Force who have, through the process of decisions made by the government of the day, been deployed overseas in readiness for military action in the near future. Those ADF personnel will certainly continue to have the full support of the Labor Party and of the Senate if this motion is passed. The opposition have no quarrel with the ADF; our quarrel is with the government. The Australian Defence Force takes its instructions from the government, and that is how it should be in a democracy. We will never condemn our defence forces for following those instructions, as they are obliged to do. So, even though Labor disagree with the government's political decision, we will not turn our backs on the young people of the Australian Defence Force. We believe that those personnel, their families and the entire Australian community deserve to be brought into the confidence of the government about why the deployments are proposed, what action will be undertaken during those deployments and how the deployments are authorised by the world community through the United Nations.
The Prime Minister has deliberately chosen to keep these ADF personnel, their families and the Australian community in the dark over recent months. I think he has continued that deception today. We are no closer to knowing what commitments he has given to George W. Bush, what joint plans are agreed for military action on the other side of the world or what UN authorisation would be necessary for Australian troops to undertake warlike action. We do not know what price Mr Howard is prepared to pay in his support for President Bush. We do not know how Mr Howard can justify the massive use of military force, including the possible use of weapons of mass destruction, in pursuit of removing weapons of mass destruction from the hands of the dictator of Iraq. We do not know whether Mr Howard backs President Bush's stated aim of regime change in Iraq. We do not know if or why Mr Howard accepts US statements about links between al-Qaeda and Iraq. We do not know any of these things, because Mr Howard refuses to bring the Australian people into his confidence about one of the most serious decisions that any Australian Prime Minister, any government, can make. Is there a more serious decision than one to send Australian troops to war? It is for these reasons, for this fundamental failure of basic responsibilities on behalf of the Australian people, that we believe that Prime Minister Howard deserves the strongest possible censure by this house of the Australian parliament, the Senate. I urge the Senate to support Labor's amendment to the motion before the chair.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,2,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-02-04,"—The Democrats welcome the Prime Minister finally giving us a statement on this crucial issue affecting our nation. We welcome the amendment moved by Senator Faulkner in relation to this matter. As early as March last year, it was reported that the Prime Minister, while in London, had stated his belief that the Australian public would support extending our involvement in the war on terrorism to other theatres such as Iraq. It has taken this long for the Prime Minister to share his rationale with the parliament and the Australian people. We all know that the Australian public do not support extending our involvement to theatres such as Iraq. 
The Democrats first questioned the Minister for Defence in March of last year about Australia's potential involvement in a war on Iraq. We called as long ago as May and June of last year for full parliamentary debates on this issue. It has taken a long time for the Prime Minister to step forward and make a statement to the parliament and to enable a parliamentary debate at this level. But, unfortunately, the statement he has made does not make the case for the extreme action of putting Australia at war. Perhaps, in a sense, it is fortunate that he has not made that case. But it is also unfortunate that he has not made an attempt to outline a pathway to peace. This is a great hole in the entire content of the Prime Minister's very long statement. 
We still have a significant threat, not just of Australia being involved in a war that should not occur but that of a war that may involve nuclear weapons. Neither the US nor the UK governments have categorically ruled out using nuclear weapons against Iraq. The Democrats urge the Prime Minister, while he is overseas next week, to seek absolute guarantees from the US and UK leaders that nuclear weapons will not be used under any circumstances. If those guarantees are not available, the Prime Minister should honour his previous statements to the Australian people that our nation will not be involved in a war if there is a prospect of nuclear weapons being used, and he should withdraw Australia's support forthwith. We welcome that aspect of the amendment that has been moved by Senator Faulkner. We acknowledge and thank the opposition for their cooperation in drawing up an important motion that I hope and believe will be adopted by the Senate. In his statement, the Prime Minister said:
Our close relationship and our ready access to the US administration has meant that our views are heard and respected.
That being the case, the Democrats urge the Prime Minister to use Australia's relationship with the US to ensure that this conflict does not escalate into war and that the views of the Australian people are heard and respected by the United States of America. In March of last year, the Democrats asked for assurance that Australia would not make any further military commitment without the full approval of the UN Security Council and of the Australian parliament. Instead, we have seen the Prime Minister commit Australian troops despite not getting ratification by the parliament or having the approval of the UN Security Council.
The Democrats welcome and support the motion before the chamber censuring the government for forward deployment of Australian troops to a potential theatre of war without the authorisation of the UN, without revealing to the Australian people the commitments undertaken and without any mandate from or even ratification by the Australian parliament. The Democrats have called, and continue to call, for a conscience vote for parliamentarians on Australia's involvement in a war against Iraq. We have had conscience votes on issues defined as moral issues in the past in this chamber, a principle the Democrats strongly support. It is hard to think of a more fundamental moral issue than whether or not our nation should commit itself to war. It is a disgrace that our parliamentarians are not able to have—
—That is a dumb statement.
—Senator Boswell apparently thinks that is a dumb statement. I am happy for that interjection to be acknowledged. I suggest you pay attention to having your National Party colleagues stay awake during your leader's speeches rather than worrying about what others are saying. It is hard to think of a more moral issue than whether or not a nation should commit itself to war. It is astonishing to the Democrats that parliamentarians in other parties are not able to have a free vote on questions relating to that matter.
Over the past 11 months, the Democrats have asked many questions of the government, particularly of the Minister for Defence, and have moved many motions calling on the government to listen to the Australian people. It is a tragedy we have only a couple of sitting days for the Senate this month to further pursue those issues. We proposed that a Senate inquiry be conducted by the defence and foreign affairs committee to examine the very issues we are trying to extract information on from the government today. If that proposal had been adopted at the time—I think it was in August last year—then we would have been able to get many of these answers put on the table. Unfortunately, that proposal was defeated by the government and the opposition.
As well as the debate in parliament, it is crucial to emphasise the ongoing campaigns out in the community. It is at that level where I believe this issue can still be won. I urge everybody in the Australian community who has concerns about the prospect of Australia being drawn into a war on Iraq or of any country being drawn into an attack on Iraq to make their views known now. It is clear we do not have much time. It is clear from every survey that the majority of Australian people do not support war. The Gallup International survey released today found that just 12 per cent of Australians supported unilateral action by the United States and its allies. I am pleased that the motion before the Senate at the moment rules out support for any such action. 
There has been any number of comments and expressions of concern by people across the political spectrum. This is not some extremist, left-wing, fundamentalist, anti-American position. It is not risky politics; it is common sense and it is as mainstream as you get. It is a position that the vast majority of the Australian public support in terms of trying to prevent involvement in war. We have seen comments from many former veterans—probably they are the people who know better than anybody else the absolute horror of being involved in war—expressing concern for, and opposition to, the government's approach. We have seen organisations such as the RSL, at state level and nationally, expressing concern and opposition to the government's decision to predeploy troops. We have seen former prime ministers, key ranking people in the Liberal Party and former high-ranking Defence officials all expressing strong opposition to what this government has done. That is despite nearly 12 months of the Prime Minister's long campaign to try to convince Australians that this is a just war, a necessary war and a war which Australia should be involved in. The Australian people are not convinced, and nor should they be convinced, because there has been no case made and there are no good arguments for a war to occur in this context.
It is worth putting on record the Democrats' position in a bit more detail. If the United Nations does mandate military force against Iraq down the track, the Democrats will not automatically support Australia's involvement in a war. We support the amendment to the motion that has been put forward today requiring any activity to be through the United Nations. That is a necessary condition but it is not a sufficient condition as far as the Democrats are concerned. War must always be an absolutely last resort. It should be in response to a clear and imminent threat or invasion. A strong, clear case has to be made that there is no other option in avoiding significant bloodshed. Such a case has not been made before, and it certainly has not been made today, by the Prime Minister. Without a UN mandate, the Democrats believe that any military action would be not only highly dangerous and damaging but also illegal under international law.
I emphasise that in my view this would not make Australian soldiers war criminals. Whilst there is no doubt that a non-UN sanctioned attack would breach international law, the Australian government would be guilty of that breach. However, war crimes equate to major atrocities—genocide and activities like that. I am certainly not going to be party to giving weight to an argument that suggests that Australia's personnel that are sent to this war are automatically guilty of war crimes. It is worth emphasising the reference in the amendment to the motion before the chamber to the support for our Australian service men and women. The Democrats certainly support our Australian service men and women. Whilst we oppose the fact that the government has chosen to deploy them, nonetheless we still send our best wishes to them and hope they do not come to harm. We hope they are able to avoid being involved in any military action. The opposition to the war by the Australian community should be directed at the government, not at our service men and women.
As well as the uncertainty about whether or not the US and the UK will use nuclear weapons, there is ongoing concern about the fact that many weapons use depleted uranium. Major health consequences have been alleged as a result of those weapons being used in the last Gulf War. The Democrats believe that such weapons should not be used in any conflict in Iraq or, indeed, anywhere.
There have been many reports that the plans that are being developed for the attack by the United States and others involve massive bombing of infrastructure and targets in Baghdad, including civilians. There is no doubt that this would lead to widespread civilian deaths. We should not forget the thousands of Iraqi civilians who were killed during the 1991 Gulf War and the estimated 110,000 Iraqi civilians who died later due to infrastructure damage and the collapse of the health system. In Iraq, war would result in civilian deaths not just from military attack but also from starvation, exposure and disease, as infrastructure such as electricity, sewerage, water and food supplies is likely to be severely damaged. The United Nations oil for food program, which currently feeds around 24 million Iraqis, is likely to be suspended during any military action, creating an even greater probability of starvation or reliance on a completely inadequate emergency food supply. Any long-term interruption of this distribution system would create a monumental humanitarian disaster.  
It is worth making the point, when we note and mourn appropriately the deaths of comparatively very small numbers of people in bushfires and accidents, and having regard to the almost deification of seven US astronauts after their accident, that what we are talking about here with this potential war is hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians being killed. These are the same people who President Bush, in his address to the nation, said were `our friends'. President Bush said, `We are here to liberate you from the dictator Hussein.' But every reported action likely in terms of the milliary action that would occur would involve the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians. That is some way to treat your friends!
It is also worth noting that we as a nation operate in terms of international law not just via the UN Security Council but via many other conventions that have been put together, born of bitter experience, not least of which are the Geneva convention and protocols. Article 48 of the 1977 protocol, under `basic rules', states: 
In order to ensure respect for and protection of the civilian population and civilian objects, the Parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives.
Clearly, from every piece of information about the likelihood of how any attack on Iraq would be conducted, there will be a deliberate strategy of targeting civilian objects such as infrastructure, electricity supplies, water, sewerage, roads and bridges. It will have a massive impact on the civilian population. If the reports are true—again, they have not been denied—of absolutely enormous numbers of cruise missiles blanket bombing Baghdad over the first two days of any invasion, inevitably there will be immeasurable numbers of civilian casualties. 
It is beyond doubt that such an approach would blatantly breach the contents of the Geneva convention and protocols. It would be a deliberate disregard at best for the wellbeing of the civilian population. Australia as a nation should not even be seen to be giving consideration to lending its support to such a method of military attack. The Democrats call on the Prime Minister, when he is in Washington, New York and London next week, to make certain points clear regarding any combat that occurs—and we all hope that it will not occur; the Democrats will continue to oppose such combat occurring. If the Australian government go down this path, they must as a minimum get guarantees that we will support it militarily or in any other way—even politically—if it is conducted in accordance with basic international law and basic human rights principles and conventions. So far it seems clear to the Democrats that it will not be so conducted. 
The Prime Minister should use his good relationship with the US and the UK to ensure that any combat that occurs does not go down those lines, not just for the sake of those many thousands of Iraqi civilians but for all our sakes. If we do not stick to accepted conventions and international law on this occasion, we will have no grounds in the future to request any other nation to do the same. That will put all Australians at much greater risk and make us all far more insecure in the future, as would be the case with anybody else in the world.
It is sometimes difficult to recognise and fully address the horrors of war. I do not want to be a scaremonger or cause distress to the families and friends of our troops, but the reality must be faced that there are likely to be Australian casualties of a war, even if it is as quick and sharp as some people suggest it will be. It will certainly be very bloody from the Iraqi side of things. But even if it is a re-run of the Gulf War, in that war there were 750 Australians involved just in that one-month or six-week period in 1991. Of those, around 164 Gulf War veterans are receiving a disability pension—a compensation pension—for disabilities which are causally related to that war. Nineteen of them have been assessed as totally and permanently incapacitated. That is around one in five veterans of the Gulf War—a war where we were obviously not involved in ground activities or anything like that.  
I note that the health survey of the 1991 Gulf War veterans is still not publicly available, despite the minister saying in October last year that it would be available in late 2002 or early 2003. You have to wonder if we will be waiting for the finish of this war in Iraq before we find out the health costs to our personnel from the last war in Iraq. Our personnel should not be put in such a dangerous environment simply to satisfy the political imperatives of the USA and the UK. Australia is already inadequate in how it treats many of its veterans. We should not be creating a new generation of veterans on such a flimsy pretext. 
With regard to the Prime Minister's long statement on the evils of Saddam Hussein— and no person, certainly not the Democrats, could argue against the evil that is Saddam Hussein—ironically, in Australia we still have asylum seekers who are detained in detention centres, most of them for two years or more, and this Prime Minister and this government at this moment are still trying to pressure them to return to Iraq to face the monumental evil of this man of whom the Prime Minister has spoken so long about today. The hypocrisy of that is breathtaking.
We still have no details about the actual costs of war to Australia. The government have prepared documents relating to increased defence expenditure for a war on Iraq, but they have not released those documents when they have been requested. They have consistently said that no decision has been made about our involvement in a war with Iraq, but they are already creating a budget for such an involvement. Australians are entitled to know how much the government are intending to increase funding on defence, how much extra this will cost us, how much more funding this will drain out of our education and health systems and out of assistance for our drought-stricken farmers, and how much it is going to distort the operational effectiveness of our armed forces. At a time when the armed forces are stretched beyond belief already, when there is so much need for them in our own region and when the government are drawing attention, through their own mail-outs, to some of the threats to the security of Australians in our own region, the government are deploying massive numbers, by Australian standards, of our overstretched defence personnel to the other side of the world. We should be investing those sorts of resources in peace, through increased foreign aid and cooperation in the region—not putting more money into a bloody war that will lead to long-term consequences for the globe as a whole. As well, if we are going to be involved, we should be responsible for helping clean up the aftermath, yet last week in the Australian the Prime Minister disgracefully indicated that Australia would not be involved in any long-term way if we did go into a war, that we would leave that job to others. Senator Faulkner's excellent motion should be given added weight by being communicated to the governments of all members of the United Nations Security Council. I move:
At the end of the amendment, add:

"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2003-02-04,"—In life, I suppose the easiest option of all is to do nothing. But this path leads to problems which become bigger and bigger problems. The world is now faced with certain facts. All intelligence—American, English and our own—and Dr Blix's report have clearly identified that Iraq does have weapons of chemical and biological origin, and other weapons of mass destruction. According to the polls, 75 per cent of Australian people believe that Hussein is hiding weapons of mass destruction, and 65 per cent believe he is a threat to global security. There is not a lot of sympathy out there for Saddam Hussein's position.  
The UN Security Council passed resolution 1441 on 8 November 2002 enabling weapons inspectors to go back into Iraq. The weapons inspectors have reported that there are sizeable discrepancies between the actual figures: 6,500 chemical warfare bombs are unaccounted for and 300 rocket engines and anthrax supplies have mysteriously disappeared. The Blix report says that there are clearly weapons that have not been disclosed. This clearly points out that the Hussein regime in Iraq has not complied with resolution 1441. The United Nations Security Council will meet on 5 February to hear more evidence, and it is hoped that the Security Council will put up other resolutions to clarify and resolve the matter of compliance with resolution 1441. We trust that that resolution will come forward. We hope it will be clear and will give a signal that the United Nations is willing to accept its responsibilities and act. If it does not act, it risks becoming irrelevant. 
Not only do the leaders of the USA, Australia and Britain want United Nations Security Council action to force Baghdad to disarm but also the smaller states of Spain, Italy, Portugal, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland and Denmark have expressed their support and asked the United Nations to take the necessary action—and many other countries, including Canada, will be urging UN action. It is hoped that the Security Council will listen to evidence to be presented by Colin Powell on 5 February and take the necessary action to ensure Iraq's disarmament. I am pleased that the Prime Minister is going over to America to ensure that Australia's interests and points of view are represented and listened to.
In August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait. The coalition of forces that repelled the invasion and defeated Iraq could have forced a regime change at that time. Due to commitments given by the Iraqi government, the coalition agreed to suspend further attacks on Iraq. These commitments are outlined in United Nations resolutions 686 through to 688 put forward in 1991. The Gulf War cease-fire was negotiated based on the acceptance by Iraq of the provisions in those resolutions, including full disarmament and inspection of that disarmament.
For 12 years, Saddam Hussein has defied the resolutions, thumbed his nose at the rest of the world and played a game of denial. It is only due to the forward deployment of troops that there has been any movement. That is the only reason for which weapons inspectors have been able to gain entry into Iraq. This is very clear.
The Labor Party seems to have shifted positions on disarming Iraq. There is a significant difference between Mr Crean, who does not believe our armed forces should be forward deployed in the Gulf, and the previous leader. Mr Crean told troops on the docks:
I don't want to mince my words, because I don't believe that you should be going. I don't think that there should be a deployment of troops to Iraq ahead of the United Nations determining it.
I do, however, recognise that in the past the Labor Party have acknowledged the lack of movement in Iraq and supported pressure through forward deployment. In fact, in 1998, under Mr Beazley, Labor supported an ADF forward deployment of 150 Australian special forces soldiers and two midair refuelling planes in response to a request from the United States to apply further pressure on Saddam Hussein. This was without any specific UN direction. In direct contrast with Mr Crean, Mr Beazley said:
And part of the reason why we have supported the Government in giving our approval to the steps that they've taken thus far, has been to assist in putting pressure on Saddam Hussein. And there's no doubt in my mind if there had not been pressure coming in from those who are prepared to be part of a coalition, the energising of the UN Security Council and the energising of a couple of members of the UN Security Council—Russia and France—to try and find solutions, simply wouldn't have occurred. 
I want to point out that there are a lot of red herrings being put up about the possibility of a conflict in Iraq. One is that America is only in it for the oil. I have had the unpleasant experience of exposure to many conspiracy theories, but this one has got to take the cake. It defies belief that America would go to war solely for the purpose of gaining access to oil. I do not think this opinion should even be considered in this debate. It should be totally disregarded, put in the conspiracy bin and thrown out along with all of the other conspiracy theories that float around.
Iraq does have a lot of oil. In fact, it is one of the largest producers of oil in the world. It has huge areas of fertile country to be farmed to provide food for its citizens and to provide fodder. Iraq could be one of the wealthiest countries in the region, but Iraq under Saddam Hussein unfortunately has not provided wealth, security and a stable way of life for many of its citizens. Saddam has oppressed the minorities of the area—the Kurds and the marsh people. He has run a regime of terror and fear and has used nerve gas on his own people. He has invaded his neighbours in Kuwait and other areas. We are dealing here with not a rational person but a person who has made terror into an art form. The world has tried for over 12 years to peacefully negotiate settlements with Saddam Hussein, but we have not been able to do it. Unfortunately, it has not been achieved—and it never will be as long as Saddam refuses to take part in regional dialogue.
I want to make it clear that the National Party does not take lightly the question of our nation's commitment to deploy troops. However, we remain strongly in support of the government's position on Iraq. Not unlike other parties, we of course have people who are understandably concerned. Some of them ask questions, but on this issue support for the government is firm in National Party circles.
As I said, we do not make these commitments lightly. The government announced on the weekend that there will be forward deployment of Royal Australian Air Force elements to the Middle East, joining the 350 ADF personnel pre-positioned on the Kanimbla to provide support and prepare for a potential military campaign against Iraq, in case such action should become necessary. Fourteen FA18 Hornet fighter aircraft, three Hercules transport planes and their forward command element will leave Australia in the coming weeks.
Without question, the one person who can avert a conflict and end this situation peacefully is Saddam Hussein. The lesson that Australia has learned from the September 11 terrorist attack and the Bali bombings is that we now live in a different world. Ignoring the problem of Iraq will not make it go away. We now have to face the evils of terrorism. The sad fact is that we have been blooded by the deaths of so many Australians in Bali.
The National and Liberal parties are facing the realities of the world as it is today. Currently, there is a problem of concealment of weapons of mass destruction. Unless we address this problem we will send a signal to other rogue nations that harbouring these weapons is an option that will be tolerated. The coalition knows there is a problem and that it has to be resolved, but walking away has never been the solution to any problem.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,2,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2003-02-04,"—I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate. To begin I would ask senators to imagine for a moment that they have been stranded on a desert island for the last couple of years and have missed developments in Australia over that period. On returning to Australia you are met with the news that John Howard has deployed 2,000 troops overseas. He has despatched fighter aircraft, crack SAS troops and naval ships—the cream of Australia's armed forces has been despatched to a possible conflict more than 13,000 kilometres from Australia. It is an attack force of Australian military power in size and weaponry not seen since the Vietnam War.
What imminent threat could exist that would warrant this urgent mobilisation of Australia's armed forces? What could be so threatening to our national security and our national interests that would prompt this action? Is it related to the terrible attack of 11 September 2001? No. No link between al-Quaeda, that terrorist attack and this deployment has been established. Is it related to the horrific Bali bombing blast of 12 October 2002, which killed so many Australians? No. No link between that terrorist attack and this mobilisation has been established. What could be so urgent, so threatening to Australian and world safety that would cause John Howard and his government to dispatch a military force of this magnitude? 
Consider your incredulity when you learn that the mobilisation of Australian forces is in support of the 1991 United Nations decision to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, that it is the threat posed by Iraq's failure over the past 12 years to comply with United Nations demands that has allegedly necessitated the deployment of Australia's largest combat force in over 30 years. And not only that, consider that those forces have been deployed without the support of any decision by the United Nations to endorse military action. That is the incredible reality confronting all Australians today: Australia's Prime Minister, John Howard, has committed our largest combat force in 30 years to join an invasion of Iraq, led by the United States and the United Kingdom. The lives of 2,000 Australian Defence Force personnel have now been put at risk. What is so inimical to Australia's national interests that could justify that momentous decision? Senators, there is no threat to Australia's national interests to warrant this massive military deployment. The real reason for the deployment is found in John Howard's own words:
America, in the end, is acountry that means more to our securitythan any other nation.
	...	...	...
... we'd be a very foolish nation if we lightly discounted the centrality of the American alliance to this country.
In a world of one superpower, John Howard has determined that America's foreign policy should be our foreign policy. Labor has a very different view. Labor seeks to promote and articulate Australia's national interests, not the interests of any other nation. We value our alliance with the United States but we first seek to advance Australia's national interests. Australia's national interest is not well served by this deployment. Labor opposes this deployment and what it represents. It poses a threat to our troops and a threat to relations with our neighbours, and it undermines support for international law. There is no doubt that Iraq must be disarmed of its weapons of mass destruction. Saddam Hussein is an evil, dangerous dictator who poses a serious risk to regional and international security.
Since 1991, the Australian Labor Party has consistently supported UN efforts to disarm Iraq. Our policy has been consistent and directed at supporting UN resolution of the issue. We have opposed any unilateral military action by the United States and have expressed concern at the government's flirtation with theories of pre-emptive action. We have argued that the UN should be given a reasonable time to enforce its mandate in Iraq and that weapons inspectors should be given the time they require to do their jobs. We have maintained that any use of force must be authorised explicitly by a second resolution of the United Nations Security Council, following on from resolution 1441.
Significantly, Hans Blix's report to the United Nations Security Council last week establishes that the Iraqi government is not complying with resolution 1441. Unless Iraq significantly changes its approach, it will remain in breach of this resolution. That is not a matter of contention. The key issue distinguishing the government from the Labor Party is what the appropriate action should be in the face of Iraq's continuing refusal to disarm its weapons of mass destruction. Labor argues for UN processes to run their course, while the government has committed to a US invasion of Iraq regardless of the outcome at the UN.
Ours is not a pacifist position. It is not a position that rejects military intervention at any time. The logic of Labor's position is that it may be necessary to support military involvement in Iraq if Iraq fails to comply and if other measures fail to bring it to compliance. Labor has urged the government for nine months now to galvanise the combined political might of the Security Council rather than support any unilateral actions of the United States and the United Kingdom. This is because the United Nations is the best expression of collective will that the world possesses. That is not to say that the United Nations is perfect, because its processes and decisions are obviously constrained by national and sectional interests. It is in Australia's national interest that the UN's exclusive legal authority to determine when a security threat should be met by military force is respected. If legal restraints against unilateral military action are removed, global security risks increase. As the man who was Chief of Australia's Defence Force at the time of the UN authorised Gulf War, General Peter Gration, stated recently: 
The best hope for global security and the war on terror is to pursue a rules-based international order based on the UN.
If the United Nations were to launch war against Iraq without Security Council authorisation, international law and the UN would be undermined. Equally, if properly arrived at decisions of the United Nations are not supported by its members, United Nations authority and international law are also undermined. The government seems to have taken a decision that in a world of one superpower, our relationship with that power is the most important consideration. Labor believes that you can be a good international citizen, support the rule of law and be a good ally.
It is worth commenting on the size and nature of the forces that John Howard committed to the Gulf on 10 January this year. The Prime Minister forward deployed the HMAS Kanimbla, key elements of a special forces task group, PC3 Orion planes, a Sea King helicopter, Army landing craft, an Air Force air defence attachment and an explosives ordnance team. They join two other Australian frigates already in the Gulf and 14 FA18 Hornets. Troops from the Incident Response Regiment, troop-lift helicopters, C130 aircraft and elements of the 4RAR Commando Unit have also been put on alert for deployment.
This is a significant contribution of combat forces. The Prime Minister committed the FA18 aircraft, which the government has indicated would contribute to the bombing of Iraq. This would be the first Australian combat aircraft deployed since the Vietnam War to participate in such attacks. The fleet of FA18s deployed has the capacity to drop over 100 tonnes of bombs. To put this into an historical context, Australia deployed a squadron of Canberra bombers to Vietnam that carried just over 21 tonnes of bombs— in other words, one fifth of the tonnage capacity that the government is committing to deployment on Iraqi targets.
After the invasion of Kuwait and UN support for the Gulf War in 1991, Australia deployed a frigate, a destroyer and a supply ship. No combat forces were committed to that campaign. No-one argued that we had not played our part. The Prime Minister has also committed to send more than 250 ground troops, the SAS and commandos who are likely to be sent into Iraq and confront its forces. If war breaks out, we are likely to see our troops shooting at and being shot at by Iraqi soldiers. This will be occurring more than 13,000 kilometres from Australia's shores.
Australia has already deployed its largest combat force since Vietnam to the other side of the world. We should be clear that this deployment is about war, not peace. This is not another East Timor, where Australians were deployed under the UN flag in a security and peacekeeping mission to help in the rebuilding of that country. This is not like Rwanda or Somalia, where personnel were sent under UN auspices to provide medical assistance and humanitarian aid. This is about Australia sending a combat force to Iraq to help destroy targets and to be involved in actions that will, inevitably, see the deaths of citizens of Iraq.
The question that John Howard has been unable to answer is: why has he committed more than 2,000 Australians to a potential war more than 13,000 kilometres from our shores? Why has he sent the largest Australian combat force since the Vietnam War to the other side of the world to fight Iraq without UN backing? Does Iraq pose such an immediate and present danger to Australia's national interests that we must commit such a large force? What is the government's case for this massive deployment of combat troops? No convincing case has been made, and nothing said today has changed that. 
Iraq has been in breach of the UN's resolution since late 1998 when weapons inspectors were withdrawn in the face of noncompliance from Saddam Hussein. The Prime Minister did not utter a word when the inspectors were withdrawn. In fact, he did not say a word on Iraq in parliament until August last year; that is how pressing it was for this Prime Minister. He did not say a word on Iraq in parliament until four years after the inspectors were withdrawn, and then only in response to questions from Labor.
—It's called September 11.
—I would like to hear the senator make a case for the link between September 11 and the invasion of Iraq; I will listen to his speech with interest. Clearly, Iraq's noncompliance with the UN did not rate too highly in terms of our national interest in the Prime Minister's eyes over the last five years. So why the change of heart now? As the senator says, September 11 is sometimes cited as the reason. The argument George Bush has been trying to make, in his attempt to expand the war on terror and incorporate the unrelated objective of overthrowing Saddam within it, is that we now realise that Saddam's weapons of mass destruction could be passed to terrorists and used against us. But do Iraq's weapons of mass destruction really pose a threat to us? With UN inspectors on the ground in Iraq and no evidence of active weapons programs found to date, it is difficult to argue that Iraq poses an immediate or unmanageable threat.
Prior to the inspectors going into Iraq, the government was keen to highlight the danger of Iraq obtaining a nuclear bomb, but the IAEA has found no evidence, yet, of an active nuclear program. Is there a threat that Iraq would pass on whatever weapons it possesses to terrorists who might target Australia? No credible evidence has been made public to link the Iraqi government with those terrorists. Many analysts highlight that historically no such links have existed between them because they are not in support of Saddam's interests or ambitions. The UN must assess the risk posed by the Iraqi regime following Dr Blix's final report. It must weigh up the evidence and consider carefully the available options. Australia should make its voice heard in that debate.
I hope that the alternatives to regime change through total war are seriously considered by the UN. Other viable options to contain and restrict Iraq's WMD may still be available to us. The government's position on Iraq has highlighted its confusion surrounding Australia's defence and security policies. Senator Hill has made little progress in reshaping the priorities of our strategic defence following the terrorist attacks in the United States and Indonesia.
—Why do you say that?
—Well, the strategic review of the 2000 white paper, which sets out Australia's national interests and priorities, has been delayed time and time again. The minister's battles with cabinet and his department on this issue are well known. Indeed, who could possibly write a policy that incorporated John Howard's commitments to George Bush as if it represented a strategic vision of Australia's national interests? The government's commitment can only be understood in terms of its desire to put support for the US alliance as Australia's primary strategic priority. How else can we explain John Howard's startling decision to dispatch the largest combat force in over 30 years to a distant conflict in support of a 1991 UN decision?
The defence white paper, formulated by this government only two years ago, laid out our country's strategic priorities. They received broad endorsement. This deployment flies in the face of those priorities. The decision to commit combat troops has nothing to do with the defence of Australia, allegedly our first strategic priority; nor will it foster the security of our immediate neighbourhood, the second priority; nor does it promote stability, security and cooperation in South-East Asia, which is the third priority; nor does it the fourth objective, which is to contribute to the stability of the wider Asia-Pacific region.
This deployment is arguably about the fifth order priority of Australia's defence strategy, which is to support global security. Putting aside whether it supports or detracts from global security, if this mobilisation were seriously about that fifth priority of Australia, wouldn't we be making only a modest contribution? We certainly would not be committing a combat force of this magnitude. But then, it is clear that this commitment has nothing to do with our defined strategic interests. It certainly is not about Australia's national interest. 
This deployment—the deployment of the largest combat force in over 30 years—represents John Howard's commitment to George Bush's war. Through his actions, John Howard has made it clear that the new No. 1 strategic priority for Australia is its alliance with the US. No wonder the minister has been unable to produce a strategic review paper that reflects that reality. The government's actions have undermined UN authority, rejected regional priorities, torn up the assumptions of its own white paper and given practical effect to its support for the first-strike doctrine. While it does not actually have the courage to say so, the government's actions show that it will support an attack with or without UN authorisation. While the Howard government has paid lip-service to supporting the UN process of disarmament, it has committed itself to the US administration's plans. It has committed our troops to their battle plan. Our officers are part of General Tommy Franks's command structure. Our forces are there specifically to meet niche needs in a combined USA-UK-Australia force.
In order to imbue the current impasse with Iraq with the sense of urgency that the US war plans need, the Howard government has had to repeat the US claims that Iraq poses an immediate threat and that time is running out. The claim is based on the claims, firstly, that Iraq could potentially have a WMD program and could be manufacturing a nuclear bomb and, secondly, that it might pass weapons of mass destruction to terrorists. Yet there is little public evidence that either of these claims can be supported. Weapons inspectors in Iraq have not found any evidence of large-scale WMD production or of significant stockpiles of weapons. They have found no evidence of any nuclear weapons program or plans for such a program. The Howard government has presented no evidence of the Iraqi government sponsoring al-Qaeda or other terrorist organisations. If there is evidence to support any of these claims, let it be presented. Labor and the Australian community would be happy to examine that evidence and consider an appropriate response.
This debate is long overdue. I think it has been forced on the Prime Minister by the weight of public concern. The PM's failure to debate the commitment to Iraq has disturbed the Australian electorate. Unfortunately, all Australians know that the PM has taken the decisions that effectively put us at war when George Bush calls. Labor supports the disarmament of Saddam Hussein. Labor also supports the rule of international law and the authority of the United Nations. Labor does not support a USA-led strike against Iraq without UN authorisation. Labor does not support the deployment of Australian forces to join a USA-UK led invasion of Iraq without that UN authority.
Australians deserve a much better argument for the deployment of this invasion force than that which the government has provided. The families of the ADF personnel deserve a much better rationale to justify the risks their loved ones have been subjected to. The ADF personnel deserve much better than to be placed at such risk without the legitimacy of UN authorisation for their actions. The government should pull back and formulate a new response based on Australia's national interests, the rule of law and support for the United Nations.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,2,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-02-04,"—The Australian Greens absolutely oppose the deployment of Australia's defence personnel, its men and women, to the theatre of war in Iraq and call on the Prime Minister to reverse that decision and bring those men and women home. Moreover, we condemn the Prime Minister for making that decision without reference to the Australian parliament, without the backing of the Australian people and without a call, request or authorisation from the United Nations. This is a gross mishandling of the interests of this nation. The Prime Minister is to be condemned and censured. He does not have the confidence of this member of parliament and I support this amendment. To that end, I will move the following further amendment: 
Omit, paragraphs (e) and (f), substitute:
	(e)	expresses its total opposition to any use of nuclear arms;
	(f)	opposes Australian involvement in an attack on Iraq; and
	(g)	declares that it has no confidence in the Prime Minister because of his handling of this grave matter for the nation.
 (Senator Chapman)—Senator Brown, I might just point out that that is a foreshadowed amendment, because Senator Bartlett's amendment has to be dealt with first.
—Of course—I foreshadow the amendment. This morning at church the Prime Minister called on Australians not to kill but to love their neighbours. That sits mightily incongruously with his involvement of 2,000 Australians in a forthcoming attack on Iraq at the behest of the Bush government, which will have massive casualties, death, destruction and misery—all of which is unnecessary. Saddam Hussein is no doubt a brutish dictator, but he should be contained—as he has been contained for the last 11 years—without the massive invasion of that country which is now being contemplated.
—Ask the people who live there! Ask the women!
—Ask those who have had their hands cut off—or their feet cut off!
—If members opposite want a full list of the dictators who should be removed from office around the world then they can look to their history and current affairs books and find that. I would ask them what they are going to do about the Mugabes of the world, or the leaders of North Korea and other countries, about whom they remain very strangely silent.
We read in the papers that the Bush-led attack will begin with a blitz on the 26 million people of Iraq, which in the first 48 hours will include bombing with some 3,000 missiles carrying what are called `smart bombs'—this obscenely named weapon— which will lead to enormous death and destruction in that country. United Nations reports predict that the attack—leave aside the military death and destruction—will lead to hapless civilians caught between President Hussein and President Bush being delivered the following destruction: it is estimated that some 100,000 people will be killed. Another 400,000 Iraqi men, women and children will die or become casualties as an indirect result of that attack.
—Your green mates.
—The honourable member opposite says the United Nations reporters are our green mates. Let that be on the record. Altogether more than 100,000 children under the age of five are expected to die—that is double the number who died following the 1991 attack on Iraq. Another 950,000 Iraqis will become refugees, most of those crossing into Iran and some 50,000 going to Saudi Arabia. In a country of 27 million people there will be 1,230,000 left highly vulnerable to illness, including a possible pandemic, and needing urgent health services and supplies.
The prediction is that there will be two million internally displaced Iraqis—that is, people who are refugees in their own country. There will be three million Iraqis, including two million children and a million nursing mothers, who will be in urgent need of food aid. The reports say that there will be 3.6 million Iraqis—that is the population of Melbourne—in urgent need of shelter. If the proposed attack goes ahead, it is estimated there will be 5,400,000—that is much greater than the population of Sydney—in urgent need of supplies, including food. The majority of Iraqis—some 18 million—will urgently need water treatment, sewage treatment and equipment to be provided to protect their health. That is all providing that there is not the use of nuclear weapons.
Yet the Prime Minister says to us in sending Australians to this unnecessary attack on Baghdad, `Let us not kill,' and, `Let us love our neighbours.' These are innocent Iraqis I am talking about, caught between Hussein and Bush, terrified in the streets of Baghdad and elsewhere now, just as Australians would be if they were caught between two forces over which they had no power whatever in an inevitable carnage in which they were to pay the price. This is not Australia's war. This is an oil war. This is the United States recognising that as the economic empire of the age it needs oil to maintain its pre-eminence. Two-thirds of that oil is in the Middle East, and yet one-third of the oil currently fuelling the world's economy is coming out of the Middle East, so it has the stores which are going to be essential as the United States runs down on oil supplies in the coming years. The chair of the White House National Economic Council, Dr Larry Lindsay, who was interviewed in the Wall Street Journal, quoted in the Australian Financial Review on 9 September, said: 
When there is regime change in Iraq, you could add 3 million to 5 million barrels of oil production to world supply daily ... The successful prosecution of the war would be good for the economy.
Those of us who read about this matter have seen the quotes from Vice-President Cheney and others, coming well before even the September 11 attack in the United States, indicating that we have to find a means of getting hold of the vital Iraqi oil supplies, which account for 11 per cent of the supplies in the world at the moment. This is not Australia's war. This is a war deliberated upon by the oil barons in the United States, who largely financed the Bush campaign, who have enormous connections and interoffice placements with the White House staff and who are aware that a key to the future prosperity of the economy of the United States— five per cent of the world's people—depends on who controls that 65 per cent of the world's oil resource.
Yet President Bush is determined, relentlessly indicating that he is going to prosecute an attack on Saddam Hussein—which means the 27 million Iraqis—regardless of whether the United Nations gives its imprimatur to that attack. Prime Minister Blair in Britain is also following suit against public opinion. In this country we have a very third-rate leader of state trying to join that duo to make a triumvirate for this attack on Iraq in which Australia has no real business.
Who gave Saddam Hussein the weapons of mass destruction? Where did they come from? They came from the American, French, German and Russian corporate sectors. I do not know Mr Scott Burchill, the Lecturer in International Relations at the School of Social and International Studies at Deakin University in Melbourne, but I have read his material. On his behalf I ask these questions of the Prime Minister:
(1) You have said that “Australia doesn't have chemical or biological or nuclear weapons and we don't want them, we don't have them. And we don't think other countries, other than those authorised by international agreement should have them” (Radio 6PR, 30 January, 2003).
Israel has chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. It was able to acquire them because of technology proliferation by France and the US. It has refused to declare that it has such weapons. It has refused to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. It has not signed any international agreements which authorise it to stockpile these weapons.
What steps will the Australian Government take to disarm Israel of its weapons of mass destruction?
Could you outline the international agreements which permit Pakistan and India to possess nuclear weapons and, if not, the steps you are taking to disarm them?
The second question to the Prime Minister from Mr Burchill is:
You have said that it is “in Australia's interests to prevent the spread of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons to more states than now have them and particularly the states that are rogue states..”(Radio 6PR, 30 January, 2003).
Will you be telling Washington and London to ensure that they do not return to their policies of the recent past that provided Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction?
What steps are you taking against more than 150 Western companies—listed in Iraq's weapons declaration to the UN last December—which sold Iraq the technologies to develop weapons of mass destruction?
What steps are you taking against France for assisting Israel to develop nuclear weapons?
What steps are you taking against Pakistan for assisting North Korea to develop nuclear weapons? 
Those questions hang in the air unanswered but are fuelling the worldwide recognition by people—and the world public has enormous commonsense—
—Members opposite might laugh but let me repeat: the world's peoples have enormous commonsense. And they recognise that this is an absurdity, if not a madness, whereby weapons of mass destruction are distributed around the world for money and then we are put in this position where the world goes to war to prevent the mooted use or deployment of those very same weapons.
At this point I ask: where in this debate is the move by any political leader to tackle the global problem, which is going to grow as technologies grow, of the invention of further weapons of mass destruction? Who is going to put the lid on that? Who is going to contain those weapons already spread? Where is the precautionary principle that is going to be brought into international affairs to stop this dangerous spectre which is coming out of the laboratories of the wealthy and which is hanging over the future of all humanity and all life on this planet? Who will tackle that? We Greens will do our best. But does it await leadership of a totally different order before the commonsense, decency and far-sightedness that humanity as a whole and as a community can express get through to the leadership, which is so tainted and influenced by materialism, big money and those who are making a fortune out of technologies and weapons of mass destruction? This question must be on our agenda. This question must be tackled. This issue must be resolved if we are to bring confidence and security back into the future of everybody on this planet.
I will finish as I began by saying this: this Prime Minister has let this country down. John Howard has acted without the authority of this parliament, without the backing of the Australian people and without the request of the United Nations in sending 2,000 Australians good and true to the theatre of war in Iraq, where they will be deployed at the behest of the Pentagon and the White House if present circumstances continue and the war begins in the coming weeks. The Prime Minister has done the wrong thing by our defence personnel and he has done the wrong thing by this nation. Instead of sending out kits or requests for people to get kits to protect themselves from the threat, the fear and the potential of terror, this Prime Minister should reduce the fear and the threat of terrorism in this country by bringing our defence personnel home. This is not Australia's war, Prime Minister Howard. This is not Australia's war and Australians do not want you to prosecute this war for them. The best thing the Prime Minister can do to get the good wishes of Australia and to lessen the feelings of threat, terror, helplessness and anger in the Australian community is bring the 2,000 Australians home.
 (Senator Cook)—I understand that for the rest of this debate informal arrangements have been made between the parties that the speeches from now on will be limited to 10 minutes each. I therefore ask the clerks to set the clocks accordingly.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,2,1,speech
"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2003-02-04,"—Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President Cook, I would like to inform Senator Brown that the best thing the Prime Minister can do is continue in that role for a long time, for the sake of Australians— those Australians who have re-elected him on three separate occasions. Even in light of the current discussion in relation to any potential conflict in Iraq, more than half of the Australian people still prefer him as their Prime Minister. I do not think Senator Brown would poll very highly amongst the Australian people if his name were to be put forward as a leader for the Australian people.
—About two per cent.
—About two per cent if we are lucky; you are right, Senator Eggleston.
Senator Brown, in his usual scaremongering way, quotes some very unusual, unsubstantiated figures that may come from a United Nations source, which he did not care to name. In fact, these figures are talking about enormous casualties that may take place in the war. But there is no war, as far as I know. I have seen no reports of any wars that have started today. He keeps talking about war, and I just wonder how many Iraqis will die if we allow the current situation that exists in Iraq to continue. 
Senator Brown also mentioned other countries having weapons of mass destruction. Of course there are other countries that possess weapons of mass destruction, but the question we should really be asking is: how many of those have used them or have threatened to use them? The only country outside of those four who have weapons of mass destruction under international agreements that has used them in recent times has been Iraq.
I listened intently to what Senator Evans had to say. It is interesting to note that, amongst the list of speakers on the opposition side, the one name missing is that of Senator Ray, the Minister for Defence at the time of the last conflict in Iraq. I would have thought that he would have some very pertinent comments to make about what should happen in the current situation. I notice that on the front page, apart from Senator Cook, who has just made it down near the bottom, every speaker on the opposition side is a member of the Left of the Labor Party. I wonder just who is controlling the agenda in the Labor Party in relation to any decision that they might take on their attitude towards a possible conflict in Iraq. You may correct me, Senator Sherry, if I am wrong, but I am pretty sure that on the front page, amongst the first five speakers, only members of the Labor Left are speaking. It included Senator Evans, who did say that we are committed—
—You are wrong.
—Am I wrong? I do apologise if I am wrong. Perhaps you could correct me where I am wrong, Senator Sherry.
—It's disorderly. Senator Cook is looking at me menacingly.
—I did say Senator Cook, who is not a member of the Left, was on the bottom of the page. Senator Evans said that we were committed to an invasion of Iraq. Nothing is further from the truth. We are not committed to an invasion of Iraq. We are committed to trying every possible solution to disarm Iraq prior to using any force. We are supportive of any commitment of force being used in Iraq. `Iraq must be disarmed,' said Senator Evans. I could not agree with him more. Senator Evans said they must have more time. They have only had 12 years but they must have more time to disarm. For Senator Evans, 12 years is simply not enough.
We have a situation where a number of people have decided that 12 years is enough for a country to disarm itself of these weapons. Iraq has made no attempt to inform the United Nations or the weapons inspection team of those weapons that are still there. The briefings to the Security Council by the heads of UNMOVIC are a damning indictment of Iraq's ongoing refusal to cooperate with the United Nations weapons inspectors. Even Executive Chairman Blix said to the Security Council that `Iraq does not appear to have come to genuine acceptance, not even today'. After 12 years, Iraq does not appear to have come to genuine acceptance. 
Double standards exist within the Labor Party with their talk that there should be no military action without the authorisation of the United Nations. I wonder where the Labor Party stood during the time of the liberation of Kosovo when, without United Nations authorisation, NATO bombed Serbia and thus freed the Muslims of Kosovo—and others, of course, but predominantly the Muslim province of Kosovo. So double standards exist. There should be no military action without United Nations authorisation; yet in the case of Kosovo, when there was no United Nations authorisation, the Labor Party were quite happy to see these people, who had been so badly mistreated by the Serbian and the Yugoslav governments, liberated. Senators opposite stood in here and made a great song and dance about the people who were being forced to go back at the end of their temporary protection. They have double standards and I would like them to think back on some of the commitments that they have made in the past before they continue to score cheap political points in this current argument about the responsible position that has been taken by this government in relation to Iraq and its refusal to give up weapons of mass destruction. 
Like Senator Bolkus, whom I see in the chamber, and a number of others in this place, we have spent some time at the United Nations and seen it in action and how it works. I spent some 3½ months there only two years ago. I observed while there that the United Nations is very good at some things and very poor at others. It is very good at things like world health, world education and promoting democracy amongst the emerging democracies of the world—it is the one body that can do that—but when it comes to solving political conflicts the United Nations is spectacularly unsuccessful. You only have to look at the Israeli situation to know how unsuccessful it can be. For 54 years, the United Nations has been unable to come up with a peaceful solution for the Middle East. Since 1948 and the formation of Israel or very soon after that, the United Nations has been unable to solve political conflicts unless there is political will on both sides to fix the problem. Without that political will, it has been spectacularly unsuccessful. This is the downfall of the United Nations process. Whether we like it or not, the United Nations now consists of 190 sovereign nations, all with their own particular position on most issues. The one thing the United Nations cannot do is make laws. It sponsors international agreements, but it does not make international laws. Each one of those 190 sovereign nations of the United Nations puts their own interests first before they look at what else may be happening around the world.
We have a situation where the weapons inspectors having gone into Iraq have come back and said that Iraq does not appear to have a genuine acceptance, not even today, of the need to disarm. Iraq says that it wants more time. The issue is not whether the inspectors need more time but whether Iraq is willing to cooperate with the United Nations and its inspectors. With all the time in the world, for months and years to come, without Iraqi cooperation the inspectors will not be able to do their job. So what is the point of giving them much more time if the Iraqis will not cooperate and let them do their job?
As Executive Chairman Blix himself noted, cooperation needs to be active. It is not enough to open doors. Inspection is not a game of catch as catch can. The onus is on Iraq, not on the weapons inspectors. We know that Iraq has developed and pursued weapons of mass destruction and we know that it has used them in the past. What we do not know and will never know unless Iraq is forthcoming and cooperates with weapons inspectors is whether Iraq has rid itself of these weapons as it is required to do under the United Nations resolutions and under the terms of the cease-fire that was drawn up at the end of the 1991 Gulf War. It is important that the facts be put on the record and that there not be political point scoring, as we have seen from the opposition.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,2,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-02-04,"—That was a very sad speech for the Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I rise to express my opposition to the looming war in Iraq: my opposition to the war, my opposition to Australia's involvement as designed by this government, my opposition to the government's continuing lies to the Australian people and my opposition to the US extreme right-wing Republican administration's policies and strategies in this area. I also rise to express my concern at the direct and obvious consequences of this conflict— the consequences for world peace, the consequences for regional stability both here and in the Middle East, the consequences for the United Nations and for the international rule of law and the consequences for the Australian public, who will definitely become a target both at home and abroad.
I also rise to express my concern for the Australian armed services, who have been sent in advance to be used, I believe, as political sacrificial lambs under the control of the United States, whose interests are obviously to protect their own first. Haven't we learnt from our history? Haven't we learnt to put our national interests first? It is quite obvious that the Howard administration has not learnt. Like most Australians, I believe that there is a way to bring about a disarmament of Saddam Hussein's regime—a most necessary disarmament—within the forums of the international processes while maintaining an alliance with the United States, as we should and as we have been able to do in the past when we have disagreed with it from time to time on day-to-day policy. 
To go to war is the gravest and most onerous decision a country and a government can make. We were misled into Vietnam and paid the price—and we continue to pay the price. We are now being misled into Iraq and will pay a price. We need an honest, open debate on this issue. That is one thing the Prime Minister is not allowing. That is one thing that the Howard government is not allowing. The Australian public are not being led into this war with any sense of dignity. They are not being led into this war in Iraq; they are being misled into this war. They have been dragged into this war. John Howard is not leading Australians into war; he is misleading Australians into war. He is not courageous enough to tell the truth, he is not brave enough to tell the truth, because he knows that truth does not at this stage substantiate his case.
The Prime Minister continues to mislead as he claims that he has not committed our forces. But such a claim is so opaquely dishonest; we all know that he has. We all know why they were sent overseas. We all know that preparations were started some months ago for our engagement. No-one believes that the Australian forces are being sent off to do duty-free shopping in the Emirates, for instance—that is farcical. Neither does anyone believe that those forces can be withdrawn before engagement. No-one believes that this Prime Minister will say to George Bush, as Bush is about to drop the axe on Saddam Hussein, `We're not going to be sending our forces on. They're going to come back home.'
—They're under US command.
—They are under US control, Senator Sherry. This is another fiction that the Australian Prime Minister seems to perpetrate on the Australian people. `No, it's all right, they are responsible to an Australian commander.' But they are going to be under the control—as is planned by this government—of a US administration. Once again, as we have learnt through our history, Australians become the sacrificial lambs. Our national interests are second pegging to those of another country.
Why won't this Prime Minister tell the truth to the Australian people? We see, day after day, the sanctimonious hand wringing, but what is it? This sanctimonious hand wringing is nothing but a cover for a lack of courage, a lack of ticker. If he really believed in what he was doing, he would open up and tell the Australian public the truth about the engagement, the truth about the commitment. He loves to be photographed with the armed forces, but he has never been brave enough to fight with them. The only army this Prime Minister has ever had the courage to enlist in has been the Salvation Army, and that has kept him at home. He will glean political points off the back of the armed services. He is very keen to send them off to fight a war. But, as I say, the interests that he puts first are not those of Australia. This is all about Prime Minister Howard and the conservatives in this parliament sucking up to the Bush White House. He makes a pathetic figure as he does that—a figure that the Australian public, more and more, are waking up to. Australians are waking up to the truth and to the fraud that has been perpetrated upon them.
The Prime Minister has continued this perception over recent days, as he claims to be going off on a mission for peace. What a demolition job of the English language. What a distortion of the English language. What deception. What gall. He has conned some in the media, but no-one in the public believes that this Prime Minister is on a mission of peace as he goes to Washington and to the UK. If this is the sort of action he commits us to whilst he is pursuing peace, I hate to think what he would be doing if he were pursuing war.
Australians are opposed to this war, and for good reason. The case for it has not been made. There are other rogue states of concern—North Korea and Saudi Arabia, for instance. This process is a bullying of the United Nations and its processes. As I said earlier, it undermines the international rule of law. Australians are increasingly concerned and scared about the leadership qualities of President Bush, hearing night after night the inanities `I'm doing it for daddy' or `This is like an old movie rerun'. This sort of rhetoric does not instil in people the confidence that the free world—as President Bush would like it to be seen—is in capable hands. There is a man with faraway eyes that they see on TV every night, and they wonder what is behind them. 
As I have said, Australians are opposed to this engagement for good reasons. Another reason they are opposed to it is that they do not see it as being in our national interests. Our national interests are very much in our region, and Australians are concerned that we will become a target. Of the coalition of the willing, the coalition that President Bush has put together, we are the only country that has in its proximity the problems of Muslim extremism, of terrorism. States close to us— Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, for instance—have their hands full trying to maintain some control over them. What we are in the process of doing is making the job more difficult for our regional neighbours. It is going to make it more difficult for them as we give more and more oxygen to terrorists and as we not only make ourselves a target but by our actions—leading the pack, going out there in advance of the world community and in advance of the United Nations—invite, incite and provoke retaliation on Australians and Australian interests.
We as a nation are concerned at the impact that the current processes and decisions will have on world stability, particularly on moderate states in the Middle East and on Israel—which I am sure could become a target if this conflict gets out of control. Australians are also opposed to this war in that they are asking themselves: `Whatever happened to bin Laden? Wasn't he the target? Wasn't he the perpetrator?' The connection has not been drawn between bin Laden and Iraq. But whatever happened to him? The US administration lost track of his mobile phone and they lost him! That also does not instil much confidence in the way that world affairs are being run at the moment.
I want to express another concern on behalf of the Australian people and that is the way that they are being denied the truth not just by the government but also by the Australian newspapers. I particularly point out an example on the front page of the Australian this morning in an article written by Dennis Shanahan. He claims that the `battlers' are turning to the Prime Minister's war. The concept of a UN endorsed war is, in Mr Shanahan's eyes, the policy proposal of the Prime Minister. Anyone with a memory span longer than that of a goldfish would have known that this is not the Prime Minister's preferred position. Anyone with a memory span longer than a goldfish would have realised that when Simon Crean was putting up this proposal some eight to 10 months ago he was abused by the government—from the Prime Minister to the Minister for Foreign Affairs—as being an appeaser and as talking like Saddam Hussein.
This is just another example of this paper's continual cry for war. It has maintained this month after month. You will not get a balanced appreciation of the international conflict in the Australian. What you will get is not just barracking for a conflict, for the right-wing US administration and its position but also continual apologies for John Howard's position. This is a paper that should change its name from the Australian to the War Cry. The downside of this sort of censorship in the paper, this sort of biased reporting, is that the Australian public is being denied a lot of facts that people in Europe, in particular, are getting in relation to this conflict. This is a war that Australians do not support and they do not support it for good reason.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,2,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2003-02-04,"—To decide to go to war is a momentous decision, one of the most momentous decisions that a particular country can make. We as Australians need to consider this very, very carefully indeed. We should not be dictated to by anti-Americanism or by accusations about certain journalists—people who cannot protect themselves here. We need to make our decision by having a look at the principles of a just war. These principles have been around for 15 centuries, largely, and if I may I will indicate my recollection of them. Firstly, there must be a just cause; secondly, the decision to go to war must be taken by a legal authority; thirdly, it must be for the right reason; fourthly, there must be a reasonable chance of success; fifthly, there must be proportionality; and, sixthly, every other reasonable method must have been used to try to obtain the eventual end, which is peace. 
Let us have a look at those, beginning with the question of cause. It could be said that Saddam Hussein is a dictator who treats his people appallingly—or at least some of them, with the exception of the elites. But then again there are a number of other dictators. There has been a history of denials by Iraq of UN decisions and resolutions leading up to this particular point in time. It is clear that Iraq is not observing the spirit, the intent or the actual wording of Security Council resolution 1441. But one has to look at it from Australia's point of view. One has to consider whether or not there is an imminent danger to Australia's interests and security. No-one wants to go to war. Everybody hates war, and to send our young people off to war we must be absolutely certain that the cause is a just one.
I am yet to receive that information. Last week I was hoping that we might be able to have briefings for the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee. Tomorrow, the Leader of the Government in the Senate is going to speak to the committee and answer questions. That is good from a political point of view, but we need to have the facts. Colin Powell is to address the Security Council on Wednesday, US time, and perhaps more will come out of that. But, at the moment, there have been problems. The Australian people need to be told more on the question of whether it is a just cause.
I do not necessarily say that the UN is the be-all and end-all when it comes to the issue of legal authority. In respect of this matter, there has to be a clear, moral decision on the part of the government. If, for example, the decision by the Security Council is vetoed, what do we do? I notice that the Leader of the Opposition has left that question quite open. I do not say that it ought necessarily to be determined by the United Nations, because these sorts of things can occur and decisions are vetoed. If there is to be a sending of Australian forces—as per the third principle—it has to be done for the right reason. For example, it has to be done not for revenge against Saddam Hussein but for a clear, right reason.
The fourth point is that there must be a real chance of the success of the operation. Not much has been said about that. There must be proportionality—that is, collateral damage should be far less than the damage that would be done if there were no action taken at all. Of course, that is a judgment, but I believe we need to have further information before that judgment is taken or a view is determined. Also, all other reasonable methods need to be attempted.
The Kanimbla has gone off. Is that to be used, as the Navy was used previously, to support previous resolutions of the Security Council—that is, on the embargo and so on? If so, let us hear it and let us have that detailed to us. Essentially, in the conduct of any such conflict, there must be absolute protection of and immunity for civilians. The Iraqis are human beings. Most of them seem to be oppressed by the dictator. We must be sure that in the event of such a conflict civilians are protected and also that the military action is proportionate to the objectives to be obtained.
In all of this we need to have mature discernment. In my view, many questions are outstanding. They may be able to answer but, in my view, they are as yet unanswered. People might say: `Who are you? You are not the government. In these areas the government ought to be the one to decide.' But I, as well as every other person in Australia, need to grapple with the issues surrounding this whole question. Yes, it is the government's responsibility, in the end, to decide the matter. I appeal to the government to provide as much information as possible so that the people of Australia will also be able to make up their minds after mature consideration of the facts. No-one likes war. I will end by simply saying that not only must we have discernment but also we must pray for those who have gone to the Gulf region; we pray for peace.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2003-02-04,"—I agree, as Senator Harradine said, that we as a nation ought to be praying for peace. Australia is a nation blessed—blessed with unparalleled freedoms, both personal and economic. These freedoms are enjoyed in an environment of peace. As we consider our approach to the violent and dictatorial regime of Iraq, I trust that we in our comfort zone will not turn away from our moral duty and obligation to the plight of the Iraqi people and the threat to the world community.
Australia has a proud history. We do our bit in theatres all around the world—be it in Europe, North Africa or Asia—promoting peace and freedom, even when Australia herself is not under direct threat. I trust that we in this Senate are all agreed that the Iraqi regime is evil and murderous and has committed genocide. In case you have any doubts, just ask the Iraqi refugees in our own country. I trust that we are all agreed that the Iraqi regime has, and continues to develop, weapons of mass destruction, and has used them. I invite honourable senators to read the book Saddam's Bombmaker, by Khidir Hamza, who escaped from Iraq in 1994 after the UN sanctions had already been implemented. He gives chapter and verse about what occurred, and—by the way—about, strangely, the support of German technology and French materiel. You then wonder why France and Germany are so out of line with the rest of Europe—countries such as Spain, Italy, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Poland and Hungary. I trust we are also agreed that the Iraqi regime is in ongoing breach of 16 UN Security Council resolutions spanning a decade. For proof of that, I suggest you just have a look at the 16 resolutions. 
Faced with these facts, the genuine question needs to be asked: what is to be done? Clearly, the regime needs to be removed if it fails to comply with the 16 UN resolutions. The Iraqi people need liberation and the world community deserves liberation from the threat of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The next question is: how is that to be achieved? Preferably, of course, it is to be achieved peacefully and with the support of the United Nations taking resolute action on its resolutions, which have now been blatantly violated for over a decade. But, if the UN refuses to act on its own resolutions and thereby makes itself irrelevant, what do we do as a nation? Are we, because of UN impotence, absolved of our moral responsibility? I suggest to the Senate that the cause of removing the heinous Iraqi regime is right, proper and moral if Iraq fails to comply with the UN resolutions, irrespective of UN sanction. The UN should sanction the regime's removal if the regime fails to fully disarm and abide by all the 16 UN Security Council resolutions. If the UN does not, I pose the question: does the regime somehow gain some moral imprimatur because of that failure to act? For me, the answer is absolutely not. The cause remains right and just, irrespective of UN sanction. 
With the time left, I will try to debunk some of the arguments that seem to be gaining currency. The first one is that the US supported the Iraqi regime in the 1980s. That may well be true, but so what? A country has no permanent friends, only permanent interests. We supported communist Russia in 1943 not because we loved them, but because the greater risk at the time was a victory by national socialism. We supported communist China in 1944 not because we liked that regime, but because the consequences of Japanese militarism would have been even worse. By 1950, we actively and quite properly opposed both communist China and communist Russia.
We were told in one senator's contribution that there are no links between Iraq and Osama bin Laden. That may or may not be the case, but it is interesting that the Czech government is now supportive of the US position. Let me remind those that are not aware that Czech intelligence officials have confirmed that an Iraqi diplomat, later expelled for espionage, met with the leader of the 9-11 hijackers, Mohamed Atta, when Atta was in Czechoslovakia prior to going to the US.
I turn to Labor's amendments. I can see why the names of Senators Ray and Conroy are absent from speakers list. I can see why Mr Beazley did not want to take a position on the front bench of the Labor Party when I have a look at this disgraceful amendment. It is full of errors, and the suggestions in it clearly show that the Australian Labor Party is not fit for the government of this great country. First of all, Labor would censure the government for forward-deploying Australian troops in the absence of any United Nations authorisation. Does the Labor Party provide the same condemnation for NATO activity in Kosovo, which in fact helped protect Muslims? There was no UN sanction for that action. What about the actions in the Falklands Islands and during the Cuban missile crisis? There is no requirement that there be UN authorisation. It is my hope and prayer that that in fact does occur.  
We are then told that Labor `declares its opposition to a unilateral military attack on Iraq by the United States'. I hope it will not be unilateral and I hope it will not be necessary, but I assure honourable senators opposite that, if it does become necessary—and I hope and pray it does not—it will not be unilateral. It will have the support of many other nations and therefore it will be multilateral. The Labor Party knows that and it should amend its amendment accordingly.
It then insists that the disarmament of Iraq proceed under the authority of the United Nations. I agree, but what happens if the United Nations fails? Then the disarmament of Iraq no longer becomes a concern of the Australian Labor Party. The Labor Party seeks to hide behind the United Nations' apron strings rather than saying what is moral, right and just, irrespective of the stance of the United Nations. The Labor Party would seek to condemn the government's decision to forward deploy some of our servicemen and women; they have all volunteered to serve. The government's decision has been to send troops; all those that have gone have volunteered. Why is that not in the motion? I think we know why.
Further, we are told that the Labor Party expresses its total opposition to any use of nuclear arms: `In any operation where such weaponry may be used, Australia should not be involved.' Does that mean that if Iraq were to use such weapons, Australia should remove itself from the theatre? That is what this motion says. This motion is strangely silent about where Labor actually stands on Iraq. Allow me to finish—time is very short—by quoting David Martin Jones, senior lecturer at the School of Government at the University of Tasmania:
There is a stark legal and moral case for removing Hussein by force in the interests of the Iraqi people and to preserve the norms of international society. The motley coalition of the unwilling—

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2003-02-04,"—There are few areas of bipartisan agreement in Australian politics. One enduring commitment that both the major parties have shared, and still do, is to the importance of the World Trade Organisation; that is instructive. Australia is a middle, not a major, economic power. We need merit, not might, to triumph in the conduct of world trade. We need and support an international rules based organisation—the WTO—to achieve this. That gives us an independent voice. It also enables the nimble footwork necessary to maintain our commitments to long-term friends and allies without compromising the basic integrity of our principles and our national interests.
What the WTO is to trade, the United Nations is to world affairs. Like the WTO, the United Nations is not a perfect organisation. But we should support these bodies and seek to improve them rather than criticise and undermine them. The United Nations and the World Trade Organisation have these things in common: both are essential to good global governance, both have strong support, and in their own ways both can deliver peace and prosperity to the world. Without them, we would have chaos and anarchy—a world in which Australia's security, economy and vital interests would be dangerously imperilled.
The Labor Party wants bipartisanship on the United Nations. The Howard government should make the same commitment to the UN as it makes to the WTO. There is no difference between ordered, rules based, independent action for Australia in the WTO, as there should be in the United Nations. In international relations, Australia needs to protect its own independence while being able to play the constructive role within the US alliance that our nation requires. It can only do that through a strengthened and strong United Nations. 
It was documented last week that this government has acted to weaken the authority of the UN on 77 different occasions. Now the Prime Minister is at it again. He has committed Australian troops to war if Washington decides to take action on Iraq without United Nations authority. Labor says: `Commit to the United Nations, commit to the United Nations processes, act with the mandate of the Security Council, and allow the steps laid down for weapons inspection and verification to be carried through properly.'
On Iraq, the United Nations processes are the right ones. The inspectors need to complete their job. Decisions should be made about what they find on the facts—not on artificially whipped up war hysteria. The next decisions on this subject are serious indeed. They potentially involve the loss of human life, the destruction of property, the creation of homelessness, injury, family break-up and the generation of a huge refugee population. Of course, all the decisions we make on international affairs should be considered and responsible. But the decisions that the world and Australia are now on the threshold of taking should be made carefully and calmly and be based on a thorough consideration of the evidence and the options. That is what the Australian people want, and that is what Labor is committed to.
But Labor says something more. It is time this government told the Australian people the truth—and the whole truth—about these circumstances. What secretive and confidential deals have been entered into between our Prime Minister and the US President? Does Mr Howard have credibility any more? Don't we remember the `children overboard' incident, when the then Minister for Defence blatantly lied to the Australian people about what happened? For example, take in this current debate the invented word `predeployment'. Not only is the word `predeployment' a contradiction in terms—you cannot be predeployed, just like you cannot be a little bit pregnant—but `predeployment' is a word that is now being coined to cover the commitment of Australians to conflict ahead of the UN, before a proper parliamentary debate, and without the support of the Australian public.
There are now around 2,000 Australian military personnel and billions of dollars worth of Australian military equipment in a war zone before the proper democratic processes in Australia have been followed. No-one believes that this nation has not been pre-empted by the Prime Minister. `He's played us for mugs,' is a common sentiment among Australians. But that is a direct criticism of Mr Howard and of the government he leads and not a criticism of the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. While we will criticise the government, justifiably, we have confidence in our Defence Force personnel. It is their job to obey government orders; our disagreement with those orders is no reflection on their endeavours, their standing or their credibility.
On the subject of credibility, let me now go back to the Prime Minister. The credibility of the Prime Minister is in question not only because of private undertakings he may have given to Mr Bush committing Australia to war but also because of the consequences that logically flow from a conflict with Iraq. Does this mean that Australia is automatically committed to be part of an occupying force in that war-torn country after the conflict is over? If so, how long will we be there? Will this also mean that we will transfer, by force of necessity, our major foreign policy interests from Asia to the Middle East? How does that serve the future welfare of this country? Does that make us a bigger and more obvious target for international terrorism? Are we committed to action against other `axis of evil' countries? There are a number of them, and some would argue that many of them are a more dangerous threat than the threat allegedly posed by Iraq. 
It is hard to believe that these issues were not discussed during Mr Howard's last visit to the Oval Office. It is impossible to believe that they will not be discussed in the talks he will have with President Bush in Washington next week. But did we hear any of these issues canvassed in the statements delivered in this parliament today, in either the other place or here? Neither Senator Hill nor Mr Howard answered any of those questions. The Australian people still do not have answers about the wider context in which the proposition that the Australian government is leading—that is, a war with Iraq—might arise.
Not only do the Australian people want to know the answers to these questions but it is disingenuous for the government to tell only part of the story—the convenient part—and leave out all of the inconvenient obligations. Are we getting into another open-ended Vietnam-type commitment? This is an important question. Since a lot of the world community and many Australians believe that this is all about oil and not about weapons of mass destruction and the restoration of democracy in Iraq, why does the government not canvass these wider issues and provide us with a sense of its vision for the future and the direction it wants to take in managing them? These are important matters. Australians should at least have an understanding of what is in the government's mind so that they can put into context the actions the government is taking here and overseas—in the UN and in the Persian Gulf.
I believe the Prime Minister will be going to Washington not to represent the view of the majority of Australians—which is that the UN process should be supported and followed through—but to confirm his commitment to unilateral US action in Iraq. He will be going to receive his final orders before war commences, irrespective of UN deliberations and world opinion.
In the context of having made the decision to commit Australian service personnel to a war in Iraq, the Prime Minister's visit to Indonesia has to be seen as too little, too late. The government has consistently acted in a way that has allowed Australia's relationship with our neighbours in South-East Asia to deteriorate, yet these countries are the key to our future security in this region. It is in our own region that Australia has been most affected by terrorist activity, when bombs went off in the Sari Club and Paddy's Bar. Rather than work to secure Australia through regional cooperation, the Prime Minister has committed our diplomatic and defence resources in pursuit of Iraq without having presented evidence of links with terrorist activity.
Regardless of the reality, whether we like it or not, there will be those that will interpret any attack on Iraq as an attack on Islam, and it is well known that our nearest neighbour has the largest Muslim population in the world. Without indulging in the fearmongering of the Howard government, logic dictates that Australia has been made a target by the commitment of this government to supporting unilateral US action in Iraq. At the same time, by neglecting our relationship with countries in our own region, our ability to meet this challenge has been eroded.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-02-04,"—On behalf of Senator Abetz, I seek leave to incorporate the last paragraph of Senator Abetz's speech. It is a quote from an article called `Legal argument exists for war in Iraq'. I understand that this has been agreed to.
Leave granted.
The paragraph read as follows—
There is a stark legal and moral case for removing Hussein by force in the interests of the Iraqi people and to preserve the norms of international society. The motley coalition of the unwilling who oppose war do not offer a just, stable, peaceful world based on the sanctity of international law. The only condition they offer is that of anarchy where the human condition is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,2,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2003-02-04,"—I rise to speak in response to Senator Hill's motion on Iraq. Australians stand divided over the possibility of war in Iraq. We have seen demonstrations and direct actions against the potential war. Even the Liberal Party itself is internally divided, as evidenced by John Valder's highly critical letter in the Sydney Morning Herald last week. One Nation believes that the most democratic way to deal with this important issue would have been to hold a referendum and let the people decide. The government has missed the opportunity to poll the Australian people. An amount of $15 million was spent on distributing antiterrorism information to all households across Australia. Why not include a ballot paper and a return envelope for consultation, at least allowing the people to have their say? 
One Nation believes that senators and members should be allowed a conscience vote on this issue, as a war on Iraq could have far-reaching financial and political implications, some of those being the costs associated with a military commitment, increases in oil prices, substantial declines in financial markets, interest on any debt accumulated because of the war, terrorist acts of reprisal in Australia and the high casualties which may result if military forces in Iraq are involved in urban combat. President Saddam Hussein would have every incentive to use weapons of mass destruction against US forces and allies if attacked.
No modelling of the possible impacts on the Australian economy has been released by the federal government. It is difficult to determine exactly what the effects of a war with Iraq would be because there are many unknown factors, such as the type of campaign, how many personnel will be involved, what kind of equipment will be used, the type and quality of munitions that will be expended, how long the conflict will last, how long the country will be occupied after the war and the level of contribution from other countries. In 1999 the federal government introduced a special tax—that is, the Medicare levy—for people who earn in excess of $50,000 per annum, to pay for an increased Australian Defence Force commitment in East Timor. Taxpayers who earn between $50,000 and $100,000 pay an additional 0.5 per cent, and those who earn over $100,000 pay an extra one per cent.
If the government wants the cost of military contributions to Iraq to be budget neutral, spending in areas such as health, education and social programs might be forgone. Military personnel are paid irrespective of war; however, military involvement will require additional spending. To what extent can the additional spending be met from within the current budget allocation? The 2002-03 budget estimates indicate that the Defence outlay expenses for that year will be 1.7 per cent of GDP—that is, $13,144 million. Oil prices have already partially risen in expectation of a war. The effect on short-term prices will depend on a number of possible developments, and it could be that prices would quickly return to normal levels. It should not be assumed that prices would necessarily stay high.
A war would increase pressure on the US federal budget, which is already in deficit. With an increased deficit the Bush administration would come under pressure to cut other forms of spending, and financing the deficit could lead to a rise in US interest rates. However, a slowing US economy would put downward pressure on interest rates. If the economy continued to slow, the American Federal Reserve would come under pressure to lower interest rates to stimulate demand. So the net effect on interest rates would be unclear. Whatever the effect on US interest rates, any differential that emerges between the US and Australian interest rates would lead capital to follow the currency with the higher rates. Other possible effects may come through the exchange rate. A rise in oil prices would increase the cost of imports. All other things being equal, that would tend to push the value of the Australian dollar down against other currencies. If the US economy moved into recession, that would reduce Australia's exports, putting further downward pressure on the Australian dollar.
What are the reasons for a possible war with Iraq? Observers and analysts have provided several explanations for the singling out of Iraq for action by the US. Saddam Hussein provides a real target, unlike the frustrating campaign against the shadowy and decentralised al-Qaeda. The risk of containing Saddam Hussein and allowing his administration to develop nuclear weapons is too high. President Bush and his supporters have argued that replacing Saddam Hussein and establishing democracy could deter other regimes supporting an anti-US group and could also act as a catalyst for democratic change in other Arab states. 
Since the September 11 terrorist attack in the United States there have been renewed concerns about the security of the world's oil supplies. I will quote briefly from a Country Analysis Brief from EIA, in America, dated October 2002, which states:
Iraq contains 112 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, the second largest in the world (behind Saudi Arabia) along with roughly 220 billion barrels of probable and possible resources. Iraq's true resource potential may be far greater than this, however, as the country is relatively unexplored due to years of war and sanctions. Deep oil-bearing formations located mainly in the vast Western Desert region, for instance, could yield large additional oil resources (possibly another 100 billion barrels), but have not been explored. Iraq's oil production costs are amongst the lowest in the world, making it a highly attractive oil prospect.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Mr Tony Blair, has said that `the two grave issues that the world must confront are weapons of mass destruction and terrorism'. I would add two other threats to that: oil and water depletion. Sixty-five per cent of the world's known petroleum reserves lie beneath the Middle East, and key issues that divide Israel and its Arab neighbours are the control of the Jordan River and the West Bank aquifers. Without oil, the Middle East cannot live well; without water, it cannot live at all. There is already an issue between Iraq and Turkey over the Ataturk Dam, and more problems are brewing over proposals by Turkey to install a series of dams along the Euphrates River. The possibility looms that Iraq would then have to buy its water from Turkey. One Nation challenges Senator Hill's claim that US behaviour is not driven by a wish to take control of Iraq's oil reserves. Senator Hill has stated:
Self-evidently, if cheap oil supplies were America's dominant motive, then years before now the United States would have done a deal with Iraq to lift the sanctions in return for plentiful supplies of low-priced oil.
The fact is that there is a plentiful supply of low-priced oil in Iraq, and the Energy Information Administration, whose document I previously quoted, refers to that. This is because Iraq's oil comes from enormous fields that can be tapped by relatively shallow wells, producing a high flow rate. More than a third of Iraq's oil lies less than 600 metres below the surface.
The capability of the Australian Defence Force is another issue. There is currently an absence of a broad military coalition such as that which was formed in 1991 in the Gulf War. In closing, I would like to say that a war with Iraq will also divert attention and resources from pressing domestic issues such as the drought, the bushfires and the crises in health, welfare and education. I have no doubt that Australians will pull together if war erupts and that our military forces will serve Australia with courage, bravery and expertise. I say to Australia's Defence Force personnel: One Nation publicly and emphatically expresses our support to each one of you personally in your commitment to the services.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-02-04,"—Today, in the other place, the Prime Minister made a very important contribution to the debate around security issues—one of the most important debates we will hear in our time in this place—and Senator Hill has made a ministerial statement in similar terms in this place. I had the privilege to be here when last this parliament debated the Iraq situation, back when the Gulf War was declared. That debate, I believe, was a very important debate for this parliament. We are not debating Australia's involvement in a war at the moment—although the possibility of Australia being involved in a war in the Gulf region is, of course, significant. The parliament is addressing that at the moment and the Prime Minister, in his detailed statement, has set out very eloquently and very clearly the pressures and the forces that are at work and why we are faced with this situation, which, I know—from my discussions during the summer recess—concerns many Australians, particularly Western Australians.
One of the concerns that people have shared with me is that there is a picture being painted of the United States and Australia wanting to move towards war with some sort of passion. I say to those people and to all my Western Australian constituents—indeed, to all Australians—that my assessment is that the Prime Minister is, in fact, trying to do whatever he can, with all his skills and enormous capacity as a very successful national leader and world statesman, to ensure that war does not take place. He does not want Australian troops in conflict in the Middle East, if that can be avoided. He also does not want—and the government does not want—to have a situation perpetuated where a significant threat hangs over freedom loving and peace loving people throughout the world because of the convergence of the increasing threat of international terrorism and terrorist activity. 
Terrorism brutally destroyed human life and property in New York and at the Pentagon in Washington on September 11 and, closer to home—particularly close to Western Australia and to many Western Australians—in Legian Street in Kuta, Bali only a few months ago. So there is the threat of terrorism and the convergence of it with the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction being available to rogue states which have flouted the conventions, protocols and treaties in relation to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and other treaties governing chemical and biological weapons. As Tony Blair, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, has said, the convergence of those two threats is the reason for the focus on Iraq.
I think Senator Harris's approach is a rather cynical one. It picks up the populist, left-wing media approach to the subject, which is that it is about oil. It is demonstrably not about oil; the Prime Minister addressed that very clearly. If the Americans were interested in oil, they would do a deal and buy it like they always do. If they were interested in oil, they would have got it from Kuwait when they liberated it—with the assistance of Australia and many other nations—back in 1991. It is about ensuring for Australia, America, Great Britain and all freedom loving people of the world, particularly the democracies of the world, that we, our children and grandchildren do not live in an era of terror and that we do not allow someone like Saddam Hussein—if this parliament and this government were to let him get away with it—to destroy the good work of good people in governments and parliaments around the world over the past 50 years.
Recently I had the pleasure of finally finishing a biography of President Eisenhower—something I tried to read all of last year on flights to and from Canberra. President Eisenhower—and, to his credit, Khrushchev, the Soviet leader back in the 1950s—sought to create an international environment where weapons of mass destruction were controlled. These weapons scared the daylights out of Eisenhower. He had seen the destruction that war can bring to people and to mankind. Khrushchev saw that as well. Both of them, being former army officers, knew that war was not a solution. Eisenhower spent all his time trying to devise ways to stop the arms race—unsuccessfully, as it proved. Eisenhower and Khrushchev put in place negotiations between the superpowers—distrustful as they were, in those days. They put in place communication systems and international diplomacy systems that, ultimately, through the work of Presidents Kennedy, Nixon, Johnson and all the presidents down the track—past Presidents Reagan, Bush Sr, Clinton to President George Bush Jr today—have achieved an international system of treaties which have allowed the world to live in relative peace and not be threatened by weapons of mass destruction. Weapons of mass destruction are now a bigger threat than ever because of convergence with the threat of highly organised international terrorism, which has already blighted the world so much in the last 18 months. That is the threat.
What the Prime Minister, the government and the leaders of the Western nations that are combining to confront the issues in Iraq are seeking to do is to weigh up the risk of doing nothing, of not being steadfast and of not, for example, ensuring that in Saddam Hussein's mind there is a very real risk that, if he does not comply with the UN—if he does not finally comply after 12 years of defying the people of the world and the United Nations, that great instrument of peace created out of the embers of World War II by the great leaders of the post World War II era—then there will be a consequence. And if you do not have a forward deployment of troops—if you do not have troops, aircraft carriers, fighter planes and bombers amassed on the border ready to ensure that there is a significant consequence if Iraq fails to comply with the UN resolution—then, of course, there will be a repeat of what has happened every month and every year for the last 12 years. 
To conclude where I commenced, I think that is an issue that does build on the concern of people in the community—from people whom I know personally and, more broadly, from constituents whom I do not know so well but who write to me and phone me. The picture of troops moving into the Middle East makes them think that there is some keenness to get to war. In fact, even the Secretary-General of the United Nations has made it very clear, and the Prime Minister quoted the words, that, had there not been a serious threat of imminent military action— and Kofi Annan has said publicly that, in his opinion, had the Americans not applied that military pressure through the build-up of forces in the gulf—then the weapons inspectors would not now be in Iraq. I think that is an important thing.
I say to all Australians that this is important. If you want to get a resolution and disarmament of Iraq—which is what we all want; the one thing that everybody here agrees on is that we want Iraq disarmed and we want the threats of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction to be taken away—then you need the weapons inspectors there. I reassure Australians that that is why our troops are there. When Iraq disarms—and we hope that that is before the UN's deadlines—then our troops can come home, and that is what we all want. We want them to come home safe and secure—and secure also in the knowledge that they have made the world a safer place, free from the threats of weapons of mass destruction and international terrorism.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,2,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2003-02-04,"—I seek leave to table a document that I circulated to the whips earlier. It is the document I referred to in my contribution.
Leave granted.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,2,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-02-04,"—I want to commence by saying that, in my view, war with Iraq is not inevitable. It is not a necessary consequence of the atrocities committed in New York and Bali in recent times. It is not, as Senator Hill told us today, a necessary consequence of any new dimension to international relations flowing from those events. For centuries, leaders have committed young men and women to war to fight noble causes on their behalf. For centuries, leaders have told their people that war is inevitable, necessary or just. Sometimes it is all of those things, but that is rarely the case. I do not believe that unilateral military action by the United States against Iraq is necessary or just. But there is a growing sense of inevitability about such action, because the Bush administration appears determined to act.
Regrettably, the Bush administration has received the full support of the Howard government in this regard. This support has been delivered in defiance of the wishes of the Australian people and without recourse to this parliament. No doubt the government thinks that it has fooled some of the people with its recent rhetoric on the role of the United Nations in resolving the Iraq crisis. Maybe some people are fooled into believing that the Prime Minister's upcoming mission to Washington has something to do with peace when, in fact, it has everything to do with war. Maybe the Prime Minister thinks that today's debate in the parliament constitutes adequate consultation with the parliament.
The fact is that the Prime Minister has already sent 2,000 Australians to a theatre of war. He has done this for the very purpose of preparing Australia's forces for military action in concert with the United States. Even the government's newfound support for the UN Security Council's reconsideration of the Iraq matter is based on his view that a second resolution will make the inevitable military attack more powerful. It is the sort of doublespeak that we have come to expect from this Prime Minister. Labor called for the United Nations to resolve the crisis and that led to this government labelling our action as appeasement. The Prime Minister's latest trip to Washington for war talks is a so-called peace mission. 
The dimensions of war are great and its ultimate consequences are often unknown. What we do know is that unilateral military action will seriously damage our relationship with the Middle East and will most likely damage relations with nations in our own part of this world. Damage to our trade links will be an inevitable consequence of a war. US President Bush told the Congress during his recent State of the Union address that food aid is a component of his plan for Iraq following his removal of the Iraqi regime. President Bush said:
... we will bring to the Iraqi people food and medicines and supplies—and freedom.
Senators from rural and regional Australia and those with an interest in trade will know that Iraq has been a key market for Australian wheat for many years. Any move to substitute Australian wheat with wheat of other nations, including that of the United States, will threaten Australian farmers' access to Iraqi markets. There has been serious criticism of the statements made by ministers of this government early last year which, through the failure of the Howard government to support a peaceful resolution of the Iraq crisis, cost Australian farmers $400 million in wheat contracts. The Australian Wheat Board said in August last year that they thought they had recovered the situation in relation to those contracts but, clearly, that is not now the case.
Our wheat farmers, currently savaged by drought, are paying the price for the Howard government's rush to war through the loss of those forward wheat export orders. The Howard government's actions on Iraq have denied our farmers hundreds of millions of dollars in income and are providing an opportunity for our trade competitors to fill our hard-won wheat orders. So far, the Howard government has done nothing to protect Australian farmers from the consequences of its warmongering—nothing at all—but it is my hope that our farmers will not be counted amongst the collateral damage of any non-UN sanctioned military action. The original motion and its amending motion would appear to suggest that there is sharp division on this matter. Let me say that there are some things on which we all—or most of us, at least—surely agree. The first point on which we are at one is in our support for the men and women of the Australian defence forces.
—I take that interjection. We are at one, and Simon Crean is at one with us, in support for the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. The fact that he was prepared to go to them when they were leaving this country at the direction of the Prime Minister and tell them that, but that we did not support the Prime Minister's decision to send them, was an action of courage which I totally support and which I think has won him a great deal of respect in the community.
The second thing on which we surely agree is that no-one believes preventing the spread of nuclear weapons is anything other than a critical security issue for the world. The third thing we all agree upon is that Saddam Hussein must abide by the terms of Security Council resolution 1441. It is therefore profoundly disappointing that today the parliament and the nation are divided on the question of Australia's actions in the Middle East. It did not have to be this way. The government should have adopted Labor's commitment to exhausting the processes of the United Nations before amassing the forces of war. I do not accept the argument that that amassing of forces will somehow change the ultimate outcome of this matter.
The Prime Minister should have told the United States that his first responsibility is the protection of Australia's national interest. He should have told President Bush that Australia's interests dictate support for the United Nations and the resolution of conflict without resorting to war. Sadly, the Prime Minister has done none of those things. Unfortunately, I have to say that Australia deserves better. We should be supporting the amendment proposed by Senator Faulkner. If, ultimately, resolution 1441 is not abided by then the United Nations Security Council has made very clear its position, which ultimately will be tested against the performance of Iraq. The Security Council has decided to convene immediately upon receipt of a report, in accordance with paragraphs 4 and 11 of the resolution, in order to consider the situation and the need for full compliance with all of the relevant council resolutions in order to secure international peace and security. It recalls that in that context the council has repeatedly warned Iraq that it will face serious consequences as a result of its continued violations of its obligations. That is the strength of the position of the United Nations. That is the position we should be behind. We should reject unilateralism. Australia should not be sending troops to the Middle East at this time. ",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,2,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",IND,2003-02-04,"—When Minister Hill delivered the Prime Minister's statement to this chamber, he detailed a list of what the government considers to be reasons for the imminent bombing of the people of Iraq. It certainly seems imminent. It seems as the days go by and more and more of our troops are sent that we have got ourselves into something that it is simply not going to be possible to get ourselves out of. In the brief time I have to speak, I would like to quickly look at some of the key issues raised in that speech and issues that have been raised by other senators in this debate.
Firstly, I wish to look at the person Saddam Hussein—the one it is claimed is a danger to his people and, indeed, to the world. I do not think there is any doubt that Saddam Hussein has little, if any, regard for his people. There is a long list of atrocities, including the use of chemical weapons against minority groups. The many refugees that have come out to Australia tell quite horrific stories of what happens to ordinary Iraqis at the hands of Saddam Hussein. But, unfortunately, he is certainly not alone. As we look around the world we have a long list of regimes where people are not cared for; they are not even considered in the manic determination of their rulers to hang on to power.
One example which is relevant to us at the moment and which we can look at briefly is that of Mugabe in Zimbabwe, the atrocities that are occurring there and the mass starvation of the people of Zimbabwe. But what is our response? We are off to play cricket. I very much oppose the Australian team going there to play cricket, but I highlight that simply to show the inconsistencies surrounding the whole argument as to why we now have to head off to war.
Is Saddam Hussein a risk to his region? He may well be, but certainly if we look at his record since 1991 he has not stepped over any borders and he has not made any sign that he is going to invade his neighbours. So I argue very strongly that while he may not be the choice of the United States as president of Iraq, it is simply unacceptable that they lead a military attack for regime change. It is totally unacceptable that Australia is out there in the front line tagging along wanting to be one of the first nations to sign up in step with the United States as part of that move for regime change. It is regime change in a nation that is very rich in oil, as has been discussed by a number of other speakers.
Secondly, there is the whole question of whether or not Iraq has weapons of mass destruction and, if it does not actually have them, whether it wants to develop them. That is possible. Indeed, when it comes to biological weapons, it is even probable. But again, there are many other such countries, particularly in terms of nuclear weapons. Again, you can go through the list. So far, various pressures and international actions have averted their use since World War II. But, if we do want to talk about nuclear weapons, it is likely that there are about eight nations that have those capabilities—starting, of course, with the US itself. It, we know, is the only country to have ever actually used them. The US apparently has at least 10,000 in active deployment and another 2,000 to 3,000 stockpiled. If we go down the list of countries, there is Israel, with an estimated arsenal of at least 100 warheads, most with long-range capabilities. As far as Israel is concerned, it also has a long list of UN resolutions that it has not abided by. In fact, I think it takes the prize as the country which has ignored the most UN resolutions—there have been some 32. By using its power of veto, the US has prevented any more UN resolutions actually coming into force as far as Israel is concerned. There are other countries such as North Korea, which has been mentioned by both the Prime Minister and other speakers. There, we are still talking and we are prepared to work through the issues. Indeed, what they seem to be doing is basically trying to buy off the rest of the world with their requests for additional aid. We can move down the list to India and Pakistan. Apparently there, thank goodness, we are not going to go to war and there seems to be very little concern now that they too have an arsenal of nuclear weapons. 
With sanctions and surveillance in place, everything that I have found to read indicates that Iraq has not been able to re-establish any nuclear capabilities. Indeed, that is what the inspectors also seem to have found. As far as biological weapons are concerned, again, the inspectors have found nothing. But we know that there may well be some missing, because, after all, it is the US and its allies who supplied them with the ingredients in the first place. So Saddam Hussein may be hiding something and he may not be fully cooperating with weapons inspectors, but surely we have time to keep the pressure on and perhaps offer some carrots rather than all this threatening with sticks and certainly with war.
As I mentioned, in terms of resolutions there are many other countries—led by Israel—who have failed to abide by UN resolutions. I think Turkey is on the list, and Morocco is also on the list—with some 17 resolutions not complied with—and so it goes on. As far as the UN and these resolutions are concerned, surely it is the UN's first and foremost responsibility to work to prevent war. It is not their job to go to war in case one might be started. Indeed, I would suggest that it is an absolute nonsense to say that the way to prevent war is to actually go to war.
In the last Gulf War, the US military used about 944,000 rounds of depleted uranium bullets. The impact on the Iraqi people has been horrific. There has been an increase in cancer of something like five times the rate that was there before the war. This has included cancers such as bronchial cancer, bladder cancer, skin cancer, stomach cancers and leukaemias et cetera. Birth defects have doubled since the war—these details are from the British Medical Journal—there have been children born without eyes, fingers, limbs et cetera. The last war and the UN sanctions have contributed to widespread hardship right across Iraq. There have been increases in the prevalence of diseases like polio, TB and hepatitis. Low birth weight babies have been born and there has been an increase in infectious diseases. Malnutrition has dramatically increased. There has been a deterioration in water quality and quantity, a deterioration in health services and a decrease in the medicines and medical services available. There is a long list of problems relating to transport and general services. From 1991-98 children under five died in their thousands month after month. The figures for children's deaths from diseases relating to malnutrition are somewhere between 2,690 to well over 5,000 per month. The WHO reports that some 800,000 children under five are chronically malnourished. So the coming war will have absolutely horrific consequences for the ordinary people of Iraq, further destroying services and infrastructure and further making their lives an absolute misery, particularly if the US plans for precision bombing go ahead.
I want to go to the links to terrorism. As other speakers have said, there is no direct link to the atrocities of September 11. As we look around for who is to blame there, there are a number of other countries such as Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries—perhaps Egypt and certainly Afghanistan—where there does seem to be some link between the perpetrators and particular nations. Indeed, if we look at the relationship between Iraq and those who perpetrated the September 11 atrocities, al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein have a history of antipathy. Apparently that is because they come from different Islamic creeds which are hostile to each other. It is highly likely that bin Laden considers Hussein's regime too secular, and I imagine that Saddam Hussein would consider his own country at risk from such fundamentalism. If we move to the issue of Bali, again, there are no direct links with those atrocities. It seems the bombers were Indonesian with links to the Muslim extremist al-Qaeda group. 
Is Saddam Hussein a risk? I would argue that the greatest risk is that if we bomb the people of Iraq we give the extremists another incentive to wage war, to wage their campaigns, to carry on with their terrorist activities. By attacking Iraq we will increase the risk of creating the situation that we most fear: increasing, not decreasing, the risk of terrorism. We must not proceed down this road. Even if our troops are already there, the Australian people do not want to be involved in the bombing of the men, women and children of Iraq.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,2,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NP,2003-02-04,"—This is a unique time in our history and the history of the world, particularly in terms of international power structures. The world's strategic balance has developed in a way predicted by analysts at the end of Cold War and that is the fragmentation of power into what are now called rogue states and terrorist organisations that may or may not coalesce with each other. Unfortunately, there appears to be an inevitable closing of the gap between these two challenges, and the so-called axis of evil is born. On September 11, the United States, the remaining superpower of the world, was near paralysed by an example of this evil.
There are times when democratic governments must stand up and make tough decisions. Tough decisions have more credibility if the government is trusted and has a history of doing what is in the best interests of its citizens. The coalition government has that record. The decision of the government to be part of the coalition of the willing to exert pressure on the government of Iraq is in the best interests of Australia. This decision, like others the Prime Minister has made, particularly in regard to East Timor, is courageous. I doubt that the Prime Minister would be offended to be made an example of the theory of history that there are no great people, just ordinary people who rise to extraordinary circumstances. I for one have more confidence in that sort of leader. He is a man hardened by tough decisions and the weight of leadership.
The Prime Minister understands the Australian people more than any other leader in our time. He knows there is a reluctance for war, particularly without the sanction of the United Nations. He also understands that to do nothing is not an option for Australia and particularly not for the United Nations, which must act responsibly. If the United Nations does not act responsibly, what sort of future does it have to play in any collective international responsibility for the resolution of world conflicts? The events of September 11 reinvigorated the desire by the United States and others to confront Iraq on both its weapons of mass destruction and its nuclear development capacity.
The question people ask is: why act now? We have had 12 years of attempting to bring Iraq to heel through sanctions and other means. The 1991 cease-fire at the end of the Gulf War was based on Iraq being willing to yield up evidence of its weapons of mass destruction and destroy them. Essentially, the Iraqi debate has continued to be about that. We have seen the Richard Butler led UN inspectors become so frustrated that they left. We have seen Saddam Hussein continue to persecute his own people, financially reward PLO bomber families and develop his weapons of mass destruction, of which there is no doubt. Since September 11, we have seen the US committed to making the United Nations confront its responsibilities.
Iraq has continued to ignore UN resolutions. As Secretary-General Kofi Annan says, without the ability of the United States to bring pressure on Saddam the Iraqi government would not have allowed in the new weapons inspectors in the last few months. To go to the core of the Blix report to the UN, it is clear that Iraq cooperated in process but not in substance. That is the situation that we confront this day, 4 February 2003.
Iraq is a country rich in resources and, unlike some other Middle Eastern countries, it has the capacity to feed itself. Above all, it has a population entitled to democracy with a role to play in world affairs. It has always fascinated me as to why Saddam continues his charade when his country has so much to gain and so little to lose by complying with UN resolutions. While sanctions remain in force, such as the oil for food embargo in which the Royal Australian Navy has played a part since 1991, Iraq will steadily go downhill domestically and continue to be a world pariah state. Saddam Hussein alone has the power to make the decision to ensure a peaceful outcome to this problem. It is not too late for him. The message to the Iraqi government is still there to be heard: shape up or ship out. I remind my fellow senators and Australians of the old maxim: all that is required for evil to prevail is for good people to remain silent. We must not remain silent on this issue. I am proud to be a part of a government that is brave enough to take tough but proper decisions for the future of world peace and security but particularly for our region. 
I want to finish by hitting on the head the furphy that this dispute is about the West getting access to Iraqi oil reserves. Nothing could be further from the truth or from reality. Firstly, world oil companies have worked cooperatively with Iraqi oil producers over the last decade and oil prices have remained very stable. Secondly, Iraq would be agreeable at any time to flood the world with oil in exchange for a reduction in or a removal of sanctions. Oil prices or access to Iraqi oil reserves is not the motivation for disarming Iraq.
 It is now up to the Security Council to determine further action, and further meetings of the council are expected over the next few weeks. It is appropriate that the Prime Minister visit New York to put Australia's case in person, and he is to do that. We hope that a peaceful solution can still be found. However, we cannot allow this issue to go on unresolved. After 12 years of noncooperation, the international community must act decisively to eliminate the threat posed by Iraq's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. If we do not act today, we will certainly regret our inaction tomorrow.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,2,1,speech
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2003-02-04,"—The government today stands condemned and accused by the Labor Party of misleading the people of Australia. The government today stands condemned and accused by the Labor Party of doing the wrong thing by the people of Australia, of obfuscating the truth and deliberately hiding the facts from the people of Australia to ensure they remain in the dark.
Tonight on Channel 9, in an item from Mr Laurie Oakes, there was made public a record of a confidential conversation in October last year between Foreign Minister Alexander Downer and the New Zealand High Commissioner on possible action against Iraq at that point. This was October last year. Of this conversation between Mr Downer and the New Zealand High Commissioner, Laurie Oakes says:
Mr Downer said that Australia would indeed prefer UN backing. However, and this was not a point that could be made publicly, Australia was not in a position, if the UN process broke down, to withdraw our ships and other presence from the Gulf.
What a telling statement it is from the Minister for Foreign Affairs that `this was not a point that could be made publicly'. The reality is that, for all the rhetoric and hyperbole that this government has fed the Australian people, it has no intention of paying any attention whatsoever to the processes of the United Nations. Despite coalition speaker after coalition speaker getting up here and saying things such as `It will depend on the UN', `We would prefer it to go to the UN' and `The UN has a massive responsibility', the government stands condemned by the words of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Alexander Downer, when he said in this conversation last October that if the UN process broke down we would not be in a position to withdraw our ships and other presence from the Gulf but that he could not make this point publicly. Why not? Why couldn't he make this point publicly? Why would he mislead the Australian people to that degree?
This is a damning indictment of the coalition government's position. Why on earth haven't they come clean with the Australian people, given that this was their position in October last year? Why haven't they come clean and said, `We have no intention of paying any attention whatsoever to the UN processes'? This quote is basically saying: `Too bad what the UN decides. We are not withdrawing our troops, irrespective of any UN decision; but, by the way, people of Australia, we're not going to tell you about it. We will not make this comment publicly.' What an absolute indictment of this government. We, the Labor Party, accuse the government of keeping the people of Australia in the dark. And this revelation on Channel 9 tonight totally vindicates the position of the Labor Party in this respect. 
How stupid does the government think the people of Australia are? Does the government seriously think that people will believe, after the predeployment of 2,000 troops, that if the United Nations process works very smoothly and things go according to plan those troops will be withdrawn or that the government has had a Damascan revelation about internationalism through the processes of the United Nations—`Let us hope there is peace' et cetera—when the Minister for Foreign Affairs admitted in October last year in a private conversation that this government had no intention whatsoever of withdrawing those troops if the UN processes broke down but he could not say it publicly?
I think that speaks volumes. That says to the Australian people something that they have known for a long time in relation to this issue—that you cannot trust this government. They are not coming clean. They are not telling the truth to the Australian people. You just have to talk to people on the street to realise they know this. Here we have, in October last year, an admission from the foreign affairs minister, Mr Downer, that there has never been any intention to withdraw the troops, irrespective of any UN decision. I think that is absolutely startling and very revealing information. It will simply add to the distrust the people of Australia already have of the sycophantic behaviour of the government towards the United States.
I noticed that the Prime Minister quite recently talked about Vietnam in relation to this issue. In fact, in an article in the Weekend Australian of Saturday, 1 February 2003, he said:
I think the arguments here are even more compelling than they were in relation to Vietnam.
Obviously we have a Prime Minister who still believes that the action in Vietnam was correct. I do not meet anybody these days who thinks that the action in Vietnam was correct—nobody—but the Prime Minister says `even more compelling than Vietnam'. What an indictment that is. The government is not putting the interests of Australians first. Instead, Australia's national interest is coming second—look at the obsequious behaviour of the government towards George W. Bush—to George W. Bush's obsession with destroying Saddam Hussein.
After the disastrous events of September 11, we all said that a link between al-Qaeda and Iraq had to be found to prove a clear and present danger there. There has been no evidence to date of such a link. What the American government sought to do, however, was distort the issue in relation to those tragic events of September 11 by trying to involve Saddam Hussein. I want to put on the record that nobody here in this parliament thinks that Saddam Hussein is anything other than a tyrant and a thug—nobody here thinks anything other than that. Obviously the Iraqi people would be far better off without Saddam Hussein, but the same could be said, as Senator Lees said, about many governments across the world.
Many people would argue that in fact North Korea poses a greater threat to the world than Iraq. Not only is North Korea known to have nuclear capability but it has withdrawn from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and has threatened to resume its nuclear program. What has the response of the Bush administration been to North Korea? Far less hawkish than it has been towards Iraq. If ever there were a country that might merit the sort of argument put forward in relation to Iraq, North Korea would be streets ahead. It has made active threats and it has withdrawn from the treaty.
It is no wonder that people across the world, including in Australia, are legitimately asking, `Why Iraq?' Why Iraq? Why has the Iraqi regime under Hussein been elevated to the position of public enemy No. 1?' I have to disagree with the previous speaker; I believe that a lot of it has to do with Iraq having huge oilfields and with the fact that the US currently consumes around 25 per cent of the world's oil supplies. We know that the United States Department of Energy announced recently that by 2025 US oil imports will be around 70 per cent of total US domestic demand, up from 55 per cent two years ago. International oilfields are becoming increasingly depleted, and there is an increased likelihood that in the future world oil supplies will be dependent on Gulf oil. We also know that there are many people in the Bush administration who advocate the argument that resource or energy security is a primary mission for the US military. That the Bush administration believes its strategic and economic interests will benefit from a regime change in Iraq to a government more supportive of American interests is patently clear. We also know that one of the reasons that President Bush has been talking up war in Iraq for a long time is to shore up domestic support for the Republican Party in the recent congressional elections. I have to say that that bit of wedge politics paid off big time. The White House is now using the threat of war against Iraq as a convenient way of distracting the American people from any concerns about the faltering state of the United States economy. 
The decision by the Prime Minister to deploy Australian troops to the Gulf region in January was the wrong decision. We now know that when those troops went off in January this government had no intention whatsoever of bringing them back. I bring the Senate back to the startling admission today on Channel 9 that Alexander Downer indicated to the New Zealand High Commissioner in October last year that, if the UN process broke down, Australia was not in a position to withdraw ships, troops or presence in the Gulf but that this was not a point that could be made publicly. I ask the government to respond, perhaps through its next speaker, as to whether this statement is in fact correct. I ask the government to explain to the Australian people why it did not say that in October last year and why it continues to perpetuate this fiction that the situation is not QED.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,2,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2003-02-04,"—Like many, I came to parliament this week acutely aware of my responsibilities as an elected representative of South Australians. Surveys and polls over the last few months, including today, have demonstrated that the vast majority of Australians are opposed to Australia's involvement in a US-led war against Iraq. Today I speak together with those Australians. I share their deep concerns and I share the many, many questions that they and others in this chamber have.
I want to make two things very clear from the outset. Firstly, I deplore the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein and I am appalled by the atrocities that have been committed in the name of that dictatorship. I want the Iraqi people to be democratically governed and to have their fundamental human rights respected. I also want the Iraqi people—as I want the people of Zimbabwe, North Korea, China, Tibet and Burma, among others—to be protected from human rights abuses and to have the opportunity to freely elect their political representatives. Secondly, I am unequivocally opposed to the development, storage and use of weapons of mass destruction—whether by India, Pakistan, Iraq, France, Russia or indeed the United States of America. Yet despite my very strong feelings on these issues I do not support Australia's involvement in military action against Iraq.
War is not just another strategy to achieve desired ends. War is a desperate measure. Only the most exceptional circumstances can ever justify the killing of other human beings. Not only must war be eminently justified but its objectives must be clear and precise. The objectives of military action against Iraq are anything but clear at this stage. The reasons given by Tony Blair, George W. Bush and, indeed, our own Prime Minister for such military action do not assist us. In fact, they simply raise more questions. These are questions they have failed to answer and questions that I know many Australians would like the Prime Minister to address. It is disappointing that we did not have question time today as that would have enabled us to ask the government some of these questions. In the absence of question time, I am going to put on notice and put on the public record a number of the questions that we have. 
We know that Iraq has consistently failed to meet its obligations relating to disarmament and weapons inspections following the Gulf War. Of course it is vitally important to ensure that Iraq complies with these obligations. But, if the war is about forcing Iraq to comply with international law, why are we contemplating illegal military action to achieve this compliance? It simply does not make sense to break the law, in this case, in order to enforce it. Nor does it make sense to abandon the procedures of the United Nations in order to enforce the resolutions of the United Nations. The inconsistency—indeed, the hypocrisy—of this was illustrated in the recent State of the Union address given by President Bush. The President accused Iraq of being in contempt of the United Nations. He then went on to make it clear that the United States would not depend on the decisions of others.
We do not need to rely on the words of President Bush to understand the attitude of the United States towards international law on occasions. If the United States is so committed to international law, as outlined by President Bush, then how does it explain the imposition of embargoes on the supply of food and medicine to Cuba when such embargoes have been repeatedly condemned by UN resolutions and described as `serious violation of international law'? The United States has also ignored international law, specifically the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Beijing rules, when it has executed people who were under the age of 18 when they committed a crime. What legal or moral authority does the United States have to make other countries comply with their international obligations when this is its own track record?
The Prime Minister has consistently stated that the purpose of any proposed war would be to address the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. If this is the purpose, then why are we not also going to war against North Korea? Many nations around this world have weapons of mass destruction. The United States, as we know, has an abundance of such weapons. For a nation which professes such a strong opposition to weapons of mass destruction, it is interesting to note that the US remains the only nation which has ever resorted to the use of nuclear weapons during military warfare. It also refuses to sign the protocol to the biological weapons convention.
Yet the fundamental distinction that is relied upon is that weapons of mass destruction in the hands of so-called rogue states, which has been referred to repeatedly today, present a particular threat to international security. There is no doubt that Iraq is a rogue state. What is not clear, however, is what exactly defines a rogue state and why we are not pursuing military action against other rogue states that possess weapons of mass destruction. If a rogue state is one which is not democratically governed, then what about North Korea? If it is a state in which human rights abuses occur, then what about China? How does the United Kingdom justify the exportation of key nuclear weapons-grade material to Iran? If the US and the UK are so opposed to weapons of mass destruction, why is it that neither country will rule out the use of nuclear weapons in military action against Iraq? If the war is really about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program, why has President Bush said that the voluntary exile of Saddam Hussein would be one way to prevent the war?
This brings me to the issue of regime change. There are many reasons to abhor the regime of Saddam Hussein and to seek an end to the suffering of the Iraqi people under that regime. We have all heard the stories of torture and murder. They appal us all. The stories that we hear appal me; they anger me; they grieve me. Yet while the United States and Australia condemned these practices in Iraq, neither country was prepared to support the optional protocol to the convention against torture. If the purpose of the war is really to topple a cruel and undemocratic dictatorship, then why aren't we also going to war against Zimbabwe? The Prime Minister will not even stop the Australian cricket team from playing in Zimbabwe as a sign of our opposition to that regime; yet he will risk the lives of Australians to put an end to Saddam Hussein's dictatorship.
If the war is to save the Iraqi people, why does Washington intend to adopt a strategy in which 800 missiles could be launched on Baghdad, where almost five million Iraqis live? If the purpose of this war is to achieve regime change, what exactly are we hoping to change the regime to? How will it work? What is the post war assistance that we are going to offer Iraq? None, according to our Prime Minister, who told us last week that Australia would not be involved in any such rebuilding process. 
It appears that none of the reasons given for this war really stacks up, which begs the question: what is the real underlying motivation for this war? Some suggest oil; others suggest US imperialism. I am not going to speculate on those allegations, but one thing is clear: no persuasive argument has been made to justify any military action against Iraq at this stage. The Prime Minister tells us that the decision as to whether or not Australia should participate in this war weighs heavily on him. I say to the Prime Minister: this is not your burden to bear. When faced with such a grave decision, the Prime Minister should turn to the Australian people. That is what democracy is all about. That is what differentiates regimes such as that of Saddam Hussein and those of democratic governments.
It is time to change the rhetoric in this debate. It is time we stopped restricting the debate to the terms dictated by George W. Bush, our Prime Minister or even Tony Blair. Going to war against Iraq does not demonstrate leadership. It demonstrates failure. The Prime Minister risks associating his premiership with a rush to failure. War represents failure because it gives up on those things that characterise decent civilisation: negotiation, rational discussion, persuasion, the use of international goodwill and the offer of help in return for cooperation. If the combined brains of the international community cannot avoid war, we have failed desperately. John Winston Howard should have regard to another Winston—Winston Churchill. Despite his great reputation as a wartime leader and warrior chief, despite the glory that came his way, Churchill said it best when in the fifties he said: `To jaw-jaw is better than to war-war.' He said this in Washington. Let the Prime Minister go to Washington and jaw-jaw.
We the people do not want war. We do not want to send our younger or older Australians to terrible fields of conflict to use disgusting weaponry against each other, against their fellow human beings, and to risk them returning to their homeland injured, limbless and demented by the horrors they have witnessed or coming home dead. We want people to live peacefully without the deaths of thousands, if not millions, on our conscience. We want to face the problems that we have; we do not want to create new ones. We want to write our history. We want to say sorry. We do not want to create more and more reasons for being sorry. There are no sufficient reasons for being involved in this conflict. There are no reasons to include Australians; bring the troops home. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,2,1,speech
"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2003-02-04,"—If we are to be honest in this debate, we must accept that Iraq is a world problem. Most Australians understand that. Iraq is a rogue state—and Australians certainly understand that. The Saddam regime has a zero record when it comes to complying with UN demands that it disarm itself of weapons of mass destruction—and Australians understand that. Australians understand that, if he will not disarm, he will have to be disarmed. Australians understand that this is a risk and that sometimes you have to take risks to do the right thing. Sometimes you have to make a stand and that time is now. Under American leadership and in partnership with Britain and other countries, we are making a stand.
War is an abhorrent notion, as we have heard here repeatedly today. It is to be avoided whenever there is an alternative path. But sometimes being decisive today— even at the risk of war—can avoid conflict or save us a greater and more deadly conflict later. The world is trying to avoid a war today by making it clear to Saddam Hussein that his time has run out. I believe time has also run out for those who want Australians to believe that there is no such thing as a just war. Labor and Simon Crean are in grave danger of falling into this trap. In fact, they seem to want to fall into it—another abject failure of the party that aspires to be the alternative government. So, too, are the churches, some of whose leading members have been prominent in the peace not war movement that is trying to take over our streets and apparently has taken over some of our churches. Their `no need for war' position overturns a millennium of Christian tradition and threatens to remove the moral force of the church from genuinely influencing state policy in times of conflict. Last year when he was asked if he thought Saddam was a dangerous person, the Anglican Primate of Australia, Archbishop Peter Carnley, said Saddam was `morally suspect'. 
Is it merely morally suspect to wage war on your neighbours and your own people? Is it merely morally suspect to act as paymaster for suicide bombers who attack and wreck Israel? Is it merely morally suspect to seek to acquire chemical, biological, and possibly nuclear, weapons for clearly offensive purposes? Can the Anglican Primate of Australia possibly and genuinely believe this? 
The Saddam regime in Iraq has played games with the world, with the UN, for 12 years, since it was evicted from Kuwait. Saddam Hussein has shown no willingness to mediate his circumstances and his demands against those of the world community. We hope the UN will, through action to enforce Iraq's compliance with resolution 1441. But if it will not, if it again allows Saddam Hussein to thumb his nose at the world and continue his oppression and weapons acquisition, then nations with sufficient moral fibre will, in my personal view, have a real job to do and they will need to do it. We want to avoid that, of course. We believe that, ultimately, the moral force of the argument presented by the Americans—and pre-eminently by President Bush in his State of the Union address to Congress last week—will persuade the Security Council to hold firm.
These are the facts: Saddam Hussein has a record of murderous behaviour and dangerous weapons. The United Nations must play its full role or it will have to be bypassed. Leadership has come from various sources; if the UN will not provide it, then other options, in my view, need to be considered. Leadership came from America in the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, when the United States faced down the Soviet Union. Leadership came from Britain in the Falklands in 1982, when the UK fought to regain the Falklands on behalf of the 1,800 islanders— British subjects—from the regime of the Argentine generals. Leadership again came from America on September 11, 2001, when the United States suffered direct attack by terrorists. 
But the stand we are making is not one that must inevitably lead to war. It is a stand designed to avoid war, to force the opponent to back down without a fight. As the Leader of the Government in the Senate noted in his speech this afternoon, the history of the 20th century demonstrates with stark and murderous clarity the folly of trying to appease dictators. It teaches in blood how sometimes it is better to fight a small war than to wait for a big one to start. I believe that, with Iraq, the Prime Minister has shown tremendous leadership and great courage. The opposition leader has not, and that is a real shame. It is a shame on him, it is a shame on his party— which aspires to government—and it is a shame on this country. Under its present leader, the Labor Party has let this country down. It has played shrill politics where it could and should have played statesman politics.
Of course Australians are concerned about the risk that their country may find itself at war. Of course Australians—all Australians, religious or not, and of whatever creed— pray that the volunteer members of the Australian Defence Force in the Gulf, or on the way there, will be safe and that they will not have to go to war. The government's strategy is to avoid war. The Labor Party and other critics of the Prime Minister and his policy must understand that, because that is the reality. The Australian deployment to the region bolsters—by a measured and appropriate amount, taking into account our national interests and our military capabilities—the forces deployed there or being deployed there by the United States and Britain. One reason for the deployment ahead of possible events is that personnel need to acclimatise, and equipment and in-theatre training have to be worked up—something else Senator Hill mentioned in his speech. The opposition leader might pretend he does not know this. His predecessor is too honest to make such a hollow pretence. Another reason for the early deployment is to put the Iraqi regime in as tight a vice as possible in order to persuade it to back down. The opposition leader may pretend he does not know this. His predecessor is too honest to do so. 
President George Bush's State of the Union address last week put tremendous pressure on the Security Council to stick to its guns and insist that the Iraqi regime does what the UN says is required of it. It should eventually bring France and Germany into line. We note that Italy and Spain are already on board with Britain. The European Union really should be able to speak with one voice on so important an international issue if it expects to be taken seriously as a unified voice in world affairs. The Prime Minister's visit to Washington, New York and London next week for talks with President Bush, the UN, and the British Prime Minister is a measured response to Iraq's continued defiance of the UN. It is not about `all the way with George W. Bush'; it is about continuing to talk to the United States and its president and continuing to put forward Australia's view and to represent the Australian interest.
No-one should forget that, if the world had acted more firmly against Saddam's murderous banditry in the past, we would not today find ourselves in the position of having to contemplate the possibility of going to war. The best outcome would be for Saddam to back down. His record indicates that he will only do so if confronted by annihilation. The world should not be taken in either by Saddam's militaristic rhetoric. 
Debate interrupted. ",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,2,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2003-02-04,"— I rise firstly to extend sincere sympathy to the residents of Canberra, who have suffered such severe deprivation and loss in the recent bushfires. For the residents of Victoria, while the loss of life has not been an issue, the loss of property and the issue of national heritage, in some instances going up in flames, is something that I sympathise with greatly. I wish to extend my sincere condolences to them. 
However, at a time when we have not had the best summer season in the world, nor have trade and other seasonal conditions been favouring farmers, I would like to look to the future. In this instance, I would like to examine the report of the Sex Discrimination Unit of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which last year handed down its blueprint for a national paid maternity leave scheme.
I welcome this proposal, as it contains some important considerations for the future of Australian families. I would like to bring the report to the attention of all senators. The proposal is entitled A time to value. In its recommendations, the scheme is to be Commonwealth government funded, with employers encouraged to top up the payment through enterprise bargaining. Women in full-time, part-time or casual work for 40 out of the past 52 weeks are to be eligible. There will be a 14-week minimum entitlement of the federal minimum wage of $431 per week or the equivalent of the recipient's previous weekly earnings from all jobs, whichever is the lesser amount.  
Women receiving paid maternity leave will not be able to claim baby bonus, maternity allowance or family tax benefit. I would also like to point out that 85,000 women annually are expected to receive paid maternity leave. The estimated cost to the Commonwealth government of paid maternity leave would be $460 million gross, and that would be offset by the cost of baby bonus, maternity allowance or family tax benefit. The cost of the scheme is calculated to be $213 million for 2003-04.
Australia is one of only two OECD countries that do not have a system of paid maternity leave. At the heart of the proposal is the changing face of the Australian family, the combination of commitments for working mothers and the overarching need for newborn babies to be with their mothers, rather than separated through financial necessity. Information for the proposal was collected through consultation with a wide range of employer and employee groups, unions, women's organisations and community organisations in all states. The report was based on the input from those groups, who represent the views of the majority of Australian women. Given the level of consultation, and the primary role of the Howard coalition government in the preservation and protection of families, I would like to see my government consider the proposal in the context of work and family policy settings.
—You might have to talk to Nick Minchin about that.
—I will be, Senator Crossin. Juggling work and family responsibilities can weigh heavily on men and women alike, but it can prove particularly difficult for working mothers. The report contends that it is part of the broader issue of work and life balance. The proposal reflects accounts of women who, after their husbands have lost their jobs, have, in order to breastfeed, returned to work with a two-week-old under the counter. You would hope that in the Australia of 2003 that prospect would not have to be contemplated. Other women report that they do not have enough leave or money saved up to have another child. You would hope that such contemplations would not play a part in the sort of family planning that I would like to see. Others, who deferred motherhood due to financial concerns, discovered that it was biologically too late to start a family.
The proposal on paid maternity leave, as put forward by the unit, takes into account the undeniable change in today's family structure. This has been attributed to `irreversible global factors' as well as the incorporated cost of living, job uncertainty, high divorce rates and the changed expectations of men and women. The proposal also asserts that government family policy must evolve and modify to suit the changes to the overall family and social environment.
The government has already demonstrated its commitment to Australian families. In accordance with that commitment, I would like to look seriously at the recommendations laid out in the report and in the perspective of the changed structure of the modern family. This proposal tables a fundamental question: `Is the concept of modern family, and a woman's choice to have a child, a right or a privilege?' The proposal concludes that the scheme will be of most benefit to women in low-pay, low-skill jobs with limited bargaining power. As such, almost half of the recipients of the proposed paid maternity leave scheme would receive the equivalent of full wage replacement for up to 14 weeks.
This report may not as yet be the archetypical response to the issue of paid maternity leave, and it acknowledges that implementation is not a panacea. I am sure that there will be sufficient debate and further consultation required before policy on this issue is determined. I would like to think that the government, and the Senate in particular, would contemplate this proposal based on the current considerations to family benefit, but in that wider context of work and family policy. The document contains vital considerations of national importance and I urge all senators to review its recommendations.  
As a Victorian senator, a parent of five and a grandparent of three, I can reflect on my own experiences as a working mother. I would like to think that a government view on family and work policy had changed sufficiently over the last 20 to 25 years and that we could take further considerations into account. I would like to point out that it is not a solution to the problem of the fertility rate, which is due to other considerations that are outside the scope of this report, but it is a possible solution, and a financial solution, for those mothers and fathers who choose to have children. 
I have been very proud to serve in a government that has a demonstrated commitment to work and family issues. I would like all senators to consult within their own families and communities on this issue so that when the final result comes, as I hope it does, it is a holistic reflection of the requirements of Australia's families.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Bushfires</title>,Adjournment,4,1,speech
