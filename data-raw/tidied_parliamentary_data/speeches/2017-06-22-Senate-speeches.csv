"PRESIDENT, The",,2017-06-22,"



The PRESIDENT
 (09:31):  Senators will recall the statement I made to the Senate on 10 October 2016 regarding the records of the Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry. The commission was established in May 1986 to investigate whether the conduct of the late Justice the Hon. Lionel Keith Murphy, a senator for New South Wales from 1962 to 1975 and a justice of the High Court of Australia from 1975 to 1986, had been such as to amount to 'proved misbehaviour' within the meaning of section 72 of the Constitution.


The commission's inquiry was brought to an end in September 1986 when it became known that Justice Murphy was suffering a terminal illness. The parliament then enacted the Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry (Repeal) Act 1986, dividing the records into two categories: 'class A documents' comprising records relating to Justice Murphy's conduct, and 'class B documents' consisting of all other commission records including those relating to the interpretation of section 72 of the Constitution. The act strictly prohibited access to the class A documents for 30 years, that being until 26 September 2016, and, after that date, required that the presiding officers determine the access or otherwise of the documents. The class B documents could be accessed at any time with written approval of the presiding officers.


On 13 December 2016, the Speaker and I, taking into account the advice of our officials, authorised publication of the class B records of the commission. These records were duly published on the parliament's website on 19 December 2016. In my statement to the Senate last year, I announced that the Speaker and I had authorised the Clerks of the Senate and the House of Representatives and a small number of other officials from our departments to examine the commission's class A records and advise us how the records might be handled from now on. The independence of this process was very important to us. Neither the Speaker nor I personally reviewed the documents prior to making any decisions about granting or withholding wider access to them. I said in October that the process would be thorough and may take some time, and that we would await advice on the contents of the records before determining a way forward.


The Speaker and I have now made a decision in relation to the class A documents. In making our decision, following this independent advice, we have taken into account the following key matters:


1. that the records contain a significant amount of personal information relating to Justice Murphy and other persons;


2. that the information potentially pertains to illegal behaviour;


3. the time that has elapsed since the establishment of the commission of inquiry; and


4. the decision taken by the parliament in 1986.


In relation to the last matter—that is, the decision taken by the 34th Parliament when dealing with the class A documents—we note two key issues. First: the parliament, by way of legislation, preserved the documents for 30 years and did not order the destruction of them in 1986. Second: the parliament, significantly, did not provide for an automatic release of the documents after 30 years, but strictly empowered the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives to make a decision about the release, or otherwise, of the documents.


Then senator Gareth Evans, who was at that time the Minister for Resources and Energy and who led the debate for the Hawke government in the Senate, acknowledged that there would be legitimate historical interest in the records in the future. During the debate on the bill in the Senate on 21 August 1986, Senator Evans told the Senate:


It is appropriate that basic archival rules apply … and that in 30 years time the basic ground rules for Commonwealth documentation generally apply, subject to such exemptions as apply to this sort of material, which can properly be administered by the Presiding Officers.


The Speaker and I have approached this important decision in exactly that spirit.


It is important to recognise that the records of the commission reflect an incomplete process, insofar as it could not fulfil its ultimate purpose of formulating and reporting to the parliament its conclusions regarding the conduct of Justice Murphy. Of course, the privacy or reputation of all people impacted by the documents was a factor that was carefully considered in deciding whether or not to release the records. However, these concerns had to be weighed against the considerable public interest in having access to information relating to important concerns about the integrity of the High Court and, more broadly, about serious issues of public governance and accountability at the time of the commission's investigations. In seeking to serve this public interest, the Speaker and I took into account the fact that the general and specific nature of the allegations relating to Justice Murphy and others are widely known and, after 30 years, are historical in nature. We also took into account the non-partisan, focused and highly credible nature of the investigative processes employed by the commission, which is reflected in the character of its records. At the time it was wound up, the commission had provided Justice Murphy with a number of specific allegations to which he had been invited to respond, but the judge's unfortunate prognosis meant that a response was never to be received.


I now advise the Senate that the Speaker and I have decided to approve the publication of the class A documents. Now that we have made our decision public, the Speaker and I will request that the Clerks of both houses, where possible and appropriate, advise persons named in the records, and the closest living relatives or legal representatives of deceased persons, of the forthcoming publication of the class A documents. To enable sufficient time for this to happen, we have ordered that the class A documents be scanned and published in electronic form on Monday, 24 July at 10 am. A small amount of personal information, including signatures and addresses of unrelated persons, will be redacted from the published versions.


In concluding my remarks, I wish to reiterate the deep sense of responsibility that the Speaker and I have felt in executing the task that was bequeathed to us by the 34th Parliament. I thank the Senate.

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2017-06-22,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (09:37):  I rise to speak on the Productivity Commission Amendment (Reducing Inequality) Bill 2017. This bill places inequality firmly on the agenda of one of our country's most influential economic policy institutions. We consider the bill at a time when inequality in Australia is at a 75-year high, and when global leaders are warning that inequality threatens the global economy.


The Productivity Commission is tasked with providing research and policy advice on industry, industry development and productivity. Its scope is broad; it encompasses both specific industries and the productivity performance of the economy as a whole. Its influence is significant. Most people in this chamber could easily identify economic debates in the last 30 years where the commission's intervention has been decisive, and on many of these occasions its advice has, of course, been hotly contested. What is uncontroversial is that its advice has been central to government decision making, and we can no longer afford to allow this advice to be developed insensibly to the significance of economic inequality. The commission is already required to consider a range of considerations—everything from ecological sustainability to regional development is listed in its enabling legislation. Inequality should be on this list.


We can also no longer afford to starve our government of credible, focused research on inequality. The Productivity Commission is well placed to apply its substantial resources to generating just this type of analysis. The bill would require the commission to do just this: tabling an inequality report every five years, aligned with the production of the Intergenerational report. Doing so would bring valuable analysis into a debate that is already raging.


There has been growing discussion of economic inequality in the media and in these corridors in the last 12 months, and it is not just because people have got around to reading a couple more chapters of Thomas Piketty's book. There is a palpable fear that inequality has bred populism in Australia and overseas, and that it threatens the economic consensus that has held sway since the 1990s. Just this week we heard the governor of the Reserve Bank calling on workers to demand higher wages and the head of the Business Council of Australia writing that, rather than being allowed to pool in certain cities or among certain citizens, the business community must ensure that the benefits of growth are felt by all.


I am heartened by those sentiments but, in the flurry of sudden interest, we cannot forget that inequality is not, in fact, new; nor is the imperative to address it. Inequality was important before Brexit and it was important before Trump. Inequality affected ordinary people's lives well before it affected our political systems. Inequality threatened families' security and their stability well before it threatened business's access to global markets. We should not have to look to shock election results to find an imperative to address inequality, because the imperative lies in basic fairness—in families who are working harder for less, sandwiched between one generation that fears it may never be able to afford to buy a house and another generation that fears it may never be able to afford to retire. The imperative has always been there, and I am glad we are starting to get the momentum to address it.


Australians like to think that we are removed from the stark inequality that we see in America and the United Kingdom—and in some ways we are. Income and asset concentration in Australia is a fraction of what it is in the United States. The GFC did not hit us hard, as we entered it with significantly less inequality than other nations and, during the 2000s, Australia's middle incomes grew strongly—unlike other countries in the OECD that experienced slow growth or falling middle incomes. A Labor government responded to the GFC with a strong stimulus that prevented widespread joblessness and the inequality that comes with it. We should be proud of that intervention, but it has not insulated us from the broader trends that have been in play since the 1980s. Over the past four decades incomes for the top 10 per cent have risen nearly four times as fast as they have for the bottom 10 per cent, and this is not just the result of high-income earners being able to negotiate better pay packages. It reflects broad changes in the way our shared prosperity is divided.


During the 1990s wages decoupled from productivity growth, and even though Australian workers are more efficient and productive than ever before they are not being rewarded for it in wages. The labour share of national income in Australia has dropped from 75 per cent in the 1970s to just 53 per cent in 2016. The share for business, on the converse, is increasing. Let us be very, very clear about what this means: it means that investment pays better, much better, than work. But only—and this is critical—for those who can afford to invest. These dynamics are starting to weigh on our social structures and on our economy. Wealth is far more unevenly distributed than income. In 2003 the wealthiest 20 per cent were worth 57 times more than the poorest 20 per cent. Ten years later that figure has risen substantially: they are now worth 71 times more. The three richest Australians own more than the million poorest Australians put together. Today inequality is at a 75-year high. Australia now sits in the bottom half of the OECD's rankings for economic inequality.


We may live in a time of deepening economic inequality; however, it is worth reflecting that for most of our history since Federation we have actually experienced falling levels of inequality. At the start of Federation, we were a very unequal nation. When the Anzacs headed to Gallipoli, inequality was at its peak—one per cent of Australians owned one-third of all wealth and earned one-eighth of all income—but for the next 60-odd years inequality steadily fell, reaching a low point in the 1970s. The point I want to make is this: what happened over those six decades was not an accident, it was not a quirk of trickle-down economics; it was a direct function of the progressives' project to make Australia a fairer place for everyone. The labour movement and its political representatives have fought and won policies that shared Australia's growing prosperity much more fairly over those 120 years, and those policies became part of Australia's social contract. They evolved into institutions that were able to survive changes of government. This social contract drove down inequality in the postwar period and, to the extent that it survived changes in the 1980s and 1990s, it helped Australia avoid the excesses of inequality that we see today in the US and the UK, and there are a few aspects of it I want to briefly touch on, because they go to role of Labor governments in navigating the transformation of our economy to become more open and yet still fundamentally fair.


The first element, of course, is having a targeted welfare net. Between the health care provided by Medicare, and now the NDIS, the payments and the income support available, we seek to protect our poorest from the very worst effects of inequality. We do that very efficiently. The second element is having a progressive taxation system, reflecting the principle that those who earn more can afford to contribute more. The third element is publicly available universal education, a system of public schooling and the wide availability of tertiary education. But perhaps the most important element is our protection for wages and workplace conditions. In 1904, the world's first Labor national government started to put in place systems to manage workplace conciliation and arbitration. The systems developed by the labour movement in those early years were uniquely Australian. It was a solution that shaped dramatically the relationship between the labour movement and the state, and it formed the basis for decades of industrial outcomes that lifted the living conditions of millions of Australians.


But, like so many of the other bulwarks against equality, this has been eroded by continuing conservative calls for deregulation. And it starts to have consequences. Earlier this week, as I mentioned, the Reserve Bank governor said he would like to see workers asking for more pay increases. I agree. But it is not timidity or a lack of ambition that is holding Australian workers back; our industrial relations system has been reshaped to limit the bargaining power of workers in their workplaces. It shows in the level of unionisation today, dropping to only around 10 per cent of the private sector workforce. We need to be careful about this. The Australian social contract lifted living conditions and reduced inequality for Australians for much of the last century, and Labor has been a proud part of that story. But under conservative governments, as welfare payments are cut, workplace protection slashed and penalty rates removed, inequality has started to increase. Australia is the most unequal it has been in 75 years.


There are some people who might say, 'So what?' They say we should be focused on prosperity, not inequality; that as long as the pie is growing, it does not matter if some people are taking bigger and bigger pieces. I do not agree, and neither do most Australians. When surveyed, almost three-quarters of Australians agree that differences in income are too high. Inequality is not just about money; inequality shuts the door to opportunities, and Australians are not happy for wealth to decide the quality of someone's education or their health care. We do not think that your wage should depend on what your parents earned.


What has also become increasingly obvious in recent years is that the dichotomy between prosperity and fairness is false. More equal societies grow more quickly. That is not just wishful thinking from those on the Left. It is the considered view of hard-headed economists in institutions like the IMF. On a microeconomic level inequality creates barriers to people starting a business or going to university or being able to participate fully in the economy. It is a drag on growth. More broadly, income inequality affects the way an economy operates. Increasing the pay of low- and average-income earners boosts growth more, much more, than increasing the return to the well-off. These households spend more of their extra incomes, stimulating the economy. The OECD estimated that income inequality between 1985 and 2005 reduced economic growth among its member states by almost five per cent. As the head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, explained: the benefits of higher incomes are trickling up not down.


Why this bill then? Whatever excuses there may once have been for ignoring economic inequality, they have dropped away. All the signs demand action: economics, political pragmatism, not to mention basic fairness. I do want to be clear that I do not believe that passing this bill will solve inequality. We need concerted action to level access to education, to strengthen workplace rights, to make our tax system more progressive and to make our welfare system fairer and stronger. This bill does not tackle those specifics. Instead, it is a step in building the policy infrastructure to make sure we do these things. It aims to fire up the Public Service institutions and to build the expertise that we need to look at inequality and properly address it. It aims to build a wealth of expertise and knowledge within an eminent public policy institution through establishing a requirement for a five-yearly inequality report produced by the Productivity Commission. It seeks to use that capability to bring these issues before the parliament regularly for our consideration and response.


I am from the political Left, and I am conscious that over the years there have been regular calls from within that tradition to dismantle the Productivity Commission. I understand the hesitation that some may have in tasking it instead to look at economic inequality. My own view is that nearly always we are best to build on and transform the institutions we already have.


Australia has a proud tradition of innovative public mechanisms to deliver on public policy. Medicare remains an extraordinary achievement. Globally, our superannuation system is much admired. We have also proven skilful at recasting older institutions to meet new challenges. In the 1980s and the 1990s under Labor, we transformed Australia's political and economic institutions to respond to a more open world. To provide just one example, the Reserve Bank's role changed profoundly in the eighties, reorienting its activities to deliver effective monetary policy in a newly opened financial system.


Today we need to retool all our institutions once more to address the challenge of our times: the growing disparity in wealth and income. The Productivity Commission has changed direction and purpose before, and it will have to again. From the Tariff Board of the twenties through to the Industry Assistance Commission of the seventies up until its present form, this institution has been repurposed to respond to contemporary policy imperatives. But, institutions matter. They have a rhythm of their own and they develop momentum that survives changes of government.


The great Nugget Coombs, arguably one of our most celebrated public servants, understood this. He played an incredible role shaping the institutions of the postwar period. Reflecting on that he said, 'I was not a fan of revolution.' He said there is:


… only reform—the creation of new institutions, the recasting of those already existing, the revitalisation of the moral and social imperatives which lend them vigour.


This bill seeks to ensure that the Productivity Commission is alive to one of the most significant moral and social imperatives of today: economic inequality.

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2017-06-22,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (09:55):  I listened with great interest to the contribution from Senator McAllister, my valued colleague on the Finance and Public Administration Committee. It was thoughtful and measured, as her contributions typically are. But I was listening very carefully for one particular point in her speech, which did not come, and it is an important one in the debate about inequality. The particular question that advocates of action on inequality must answer is: how much inequality is too much inequality and how much inequality is an acceptable level of inequality? That might sound like a strange thing to ask. One might assume, if one agrees that inequality is a terrible thing, which most people do, that there should be no inequality. But if there were no inequality then that would mean complete equality of outcomes, and I do not think anyone in this chamber advocates that. I do not think Senator McAllister advocates that. I do not think Senator Whish-Wilson, who I understand is speaking next, advocates that; although perhaps his colleague Senator Rhiannon would advocate that. I do not know how much her thinking has evolved on these issues.


It is an important question to answer, because if we agree that complete equality is not a good idea and that complete inequality is not a good idea, where do we draw the line between complete equality and complete inequality as to an acceptable level of inequality? I have not yet heard in this debate, nor in dozens of debates on this issue by economists, academics and others who take an interest, anyone nominate an acceptable or tolerable level of inequality. I think that is an important thing to nominate, because if we are seeking to address a problem then we have to know how to define it in an empirical way, know when we are making progress on it and know when we are falling behind. I look forward to later contributions in this debate and seeing whether anyone will rise to that challenge.


Inequality is a problem and is something which government has a role to tackle in some ways, but it is a much less serious problem than poverty. Poverty is something which demands much greater attention from all of us than inequality. I make that point very deliberately and will expand on it. Many of the measures of inequality and poverty sometimes are deliberately or perhaps accidentally confused. Senator McAllister in her contribution referred to a number of facts and figures about how the top 10 people in Australia have more wealth than the bottom 50 per cent. All these sorts of figures get thrown around in this debate in Australia and also internationally. They typically come from reports which are deeply flawed and which overlook the much more important human imperative, which is to abolish poverty and to lift people out of poverty. Sometimes lifting people out of poverty and reducing inequality are in fact competing and contrasting imperatives that do not always move in the same direction at the same time. There is a specific example I will come to later.


One of the reports that purports to be about poverty is an annual report produced by ACOSS, the Australian Council of Social Service. It purports to measure of poverty in Australia, but what it in fact measures is inequality. It defines poverty as anyone being below 50 per cent of the average wage. If you define poverty as a proportion of the average wage then it does not matter how much the average wage increases: you will never eradicate poverty. That is a disturbing thing, because we know that poverty has been largely or substantially eradicated in the wealthy Western world and we have made great gains towards eradicating it around the world, particularly in the latter half of the 20th century.


Oxfam International annually publishes another report on inequality, which advocates often rely upon. It sometimes has seemingly alarming statistics about the top five wealthiest people in the world and their share of global wealth compared to the bottom half of the population, but it has some fundamental flaws. One of the flaws is that it accepts as a premise that capturing someone's wealth at a single point in time is a good proxy or a good measure for their standard of living. But we know that that is not the case. It is often a very bad measure of their standard of living and within the Oxfam report we have a very good example of why that is the case. When measuring someone's wealth, for the purposes of comparing them for inequality, they of course take into account, as may be appropriate, any debts that a person may hold. Obviously, a person who has debts—particularly a young person who is perhaps a university student—has the potential to have negative wealth. So a young Australian university student or a university student at Harvard will be measured by Oxfam as having negative wealth.


In many parts of the world you cannot get a loan. In the developing world it is sometimes very difficult to get a loan. So a subsistence farmer in Africa may not have any debts, they may even have a few assets to their name. Maybe, for the purposes of Oxfam's inequality report, they may be listed as having small net positive assets, even if only a few hundred dollars. If you listen to Oxfam and you take them at their word, a privileged student in the Western world studying at university who has a HECS debt is poorer than a subsistence farmer in sub-Saharan Africa. That highlights I think very powerfully the lack of quality research in this area and the way in which statistics can be abused to give you a very misleading impression. If you took Oxfam at their word, you would believe that a substantial number of those people who are suffering severe inequality are in fact in the Western world when clearly the reverse is the case—by any standard we are the wealthiest people in the world. 


If we really care about poverty and poverty is what we seek to alleviate then economic growth is the best way to do that. Sometimes economic growth does come at the cost of inequality. The best example of this is the economic growth that China has experienced over the last 40 years. It has been, in my view, one of the most positive developments of the second half of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st century. Over 600 million people have been lifted above the poverty line—the absolute measure of poverty. Their lives have been transformed in a fundamental and wonderful way. People who did not have access to electricity now have access to electricity. People who did not have access to refrigeration now have access to refrigeration. People who did not have access to education now have access to education. The standard of their food, clothing and technology has improved in a profound way. While this magnificent reduction in poverty has taken place within China in the span of 40 years—one of the greatest reductions in human poverty in history—inequality has increased.


If you listen to those opposite and their concerns about inequality, and if you read Thomas Piketty, then you would think that inequality must be fought at all costs. I understand where they are coming from and it is a good place to come from—inequality on its own, as a premise, sounds like a bad thing. But what do you think the people in China who have been lifted out of poverty would have rathered? Would they have rather been lifted out of poverty as they have been while, at the same time, some people in China have accumulated great wealth—billions of dollars of wealth—or would they have rather stayed, as they were for most of their history, in real poverty? I think, if I was someone living in China and I could choose to remain in my station in life, in relative poverty, in order to keep others in poverty at the same time so that we could be relatively equal, or I could choose that my wealth would increase modestly and my living standards would increase modestly while others' standards of living increased spectacularly—far more than mine—I would accept the latter. I would accept an increase in inequality for me and for my society in order to have a decrease in poverty. Poverty is a far more important thing to fight than inequality. 


I think we had a really wonderful contribution to this debate, in a general way, in the maiden speech last night by Senator Gichuhi from South Australia. She spoke very powerfully of her own journey from Kenya to Australia and about her experience of the welfare state in Australia and the effect it had on her and her family. The observations she made were very powerful. I think we should always bear in mind, as Senator Gichuhi said, that the best path out of poverty is employment and jobs. That has been and always will be a priority of my side politics and of this government.


Finally I want to turn to the Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017 itself, which was proposed by Senator McAllister. While I, like her, respect the Productivity Commission as an important institution and, I like her, respect its work, it is for that reason that I am concerned about this specific proposal. I think it seeks to politicise the Productivity Commission in an inappropriate way. As Senator McAllister admitted, she is the person of the Left and she wants to see the Productivity Commission produce reports that align with, and address, her political priorities.


I do not think that is an appropriate thing to do with an independent economic agency like the Productivity Commission, which has provided such important reports and advice to government. I think it is best that, as far as possible, it be kept at arm's length from government and not dictated to by the politics of the day, so that it has the greatest potential to provide independent, dispassionate advice to the government. I think it is unwise to try and seek to direct the Productivity Commission to address the political priorities or philosophy of any party in this place. There are certainly changes we could make to the Productivity Commission's charter to address the priorities and concerns that I might have and ensure that the Productivity Commission's reports in the future more closely match the political priorities I have; but I recognise that I am a member of a political party and that I have my own views and preconceptions, and it would not be a good idea to ask the Productivity Commission to take those on and reflect those. 


I appreciate the concern of Senator McAllister and all senators in this place about inequality. But I would finish on the note that, while inequality can be and is important, poverty is far more important. If we ever have to choose between the two, as some people have, including in China, the best one to choose is to alleviate poverty. The best way to alleviate poverty is through free markets and economic freedom. Every country that has gone from relative poverty to relative prosperity has gone through a period of inequality as a result. It is the advanced capitalist countries of the world, like Australia, that are relatively equal by world standards, and it is through a state of far reaching and complete capitalism that inequality is best tackled, rather than through government intervention.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2017-06-22,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (10:07):  I commend Senator McAllister for bringing forward the Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017. The Greens would support, in principle, any enhancement or refocusing of our attention on what is arguably one of the greatest issues of our time. My party talks a lot about climate change. But economic inequality, while it is tied to issues like poverty, as Senator Patterson outlined, and issues like climate change, is all-encompassing and one of the biggest challenges that we face—and not just here in Australia but right around the world. What we can do here is put a lens over every piece of legislation we look at and ask ourselves: is it making economic inequality worse in this country? When we deal with foreign aid or participate in overseas conflicts, international treaties and international trade deals, we should ask ourselves: are we making inequality worse around the world? These are the questions we should ask ourselves every chance we get.


Having said that, I have spent nearly every round of estimates since I became a senator asking the same question to our agencies here in Australia, especially to Treasury officials: what holistic approach do you take to tackle the issue of economic inequality in Australia? The answers have always been a source of disappointment. Whether it is the Reserve Bank, focusing on inflation and interest rate targets, and everything else will fall into place, or APRA focusing on financial stability, or ASIC investigating matters in relation to the Corporations Act—the one thread that is missing is a holistic approach to one of the greatest challenges of our time.


Whether the Productivity Commission itself is the right body—and I am happy to be advised on that, and on what kinds of legislative implications that might have—I would be interested to hear more and I would certainly be interested to hear from the Productivity Commission itself about this amendment. It is independent—fiercely independent. It has produced some good work. I do not say that lightly. We do not always agree with some of its recommendations; nevertheless, we respect the fact that it should be independent.


Recently I met with the economics committee, with the Reserve Bank governor, in a private meeting. I will not go into any details of that private meeting. The Reserve Bank governor in Australia has been playing a very interesting role in public debate. He has been commenting on issues like economic inequality, lack of infrastructure spending, housing risks, and pressures to the financial system. He sees himself as having an interesting role in at least informing public debate. That is probably the closest thing I could say. And of course the Reserve Bank produces occasional papers which allow them to do research projects. So, the governor has played a very important role; nevertheless, I would like to see a much more holistic approach to this issue in Australia.


So who does tie together the threads on economic inequality in Australia? It is left to the not-for-profit sector or the private sector, and here I have an excellent report called Inequality in Australia 2015—which I am not using as a prop; I am just having a look at it. It is produced by ACOSS, who tie together the threads and do their own research. It is very well respected. While these kinds of things are critical for the public debate—and I am about to summarise some of the key findings in a minute—it would be good to see the government taking a holistic policy approach to economic inequality.


What we often overlook when we think about economic inequality is that it is very closely tied to the politics we are seeing around the world at the moment—the backlash we saw in the US, which allowed Donald Trump to get elected. Many commentators have, I think rightly, pointed out that one of the key underlying reasons he was elected was that there was discontent related directly to economic inequality in the US—not poverty, as Senator Paterson alluded to as the critical problem, but economic inequality. And with Brexit— the reaction we saw in the UK—it was economic inequality. I would say— and I know you would be very interested in this, Acting Deputy President Bernardi—that the outcome of the recent UK elections, with the rise of Jeremy Corbyn, is another sign that economic inequality is being taken very seriously by voters and citizens, who have a considerable amount of frustration.


We have seen all these issues rise to the surface following the GFC, during which the financial system around the world was shaken up. We are seeing retaliation against globalism building all around the world, including I suppose Mr Trump himself, reflecting the views of his voters—cancelling the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement and other policy initiatives. And we are seeing it in this country. Let's not hide our head in the sand; economic inequality is a very significant issue here, and I will go through some statistics in a minute. Obviously it is not anywhere near what we are seeing in other countries. Nevertheless, it is an issue that should be addressed. In fact, I might go to some of those issues right now, because they tell a very important story and paint a very stark picture of how we should be responding to these issues in the legislation and the policies we look at in this place.


Inequality in Australia is higher than the OECD average, which I think is a recommendation and a conclusion that people would be surprised by. A person in Australia who is in the top 25 per cent income group has around five times as much income as someone who is in the bottom 20 per cent. Strong employment growth over the past 17 years has helped to reduce inequality, and I think Senator McAllister alluded to this, as those at the bottom end of the income distribution had greater access to the workforce and more workforce related hours. However, wages growth was very unequal over the period and acted to increase inequality. Over the 25 years to 2010 real wages increased by 50 per cent on average but by 14 per cent for those in the bottom 10 per cent of workers, compared with 72 per cent increases for those in the top 10 per cent of income earners in this country. In other words, the wealthier you are—the more money you earn—the better you have done over this period.


When we look at an average of 50 per cent increase across the board, let's break that down: if you are poor in this country, or a low-income earner, you have hardly any of that 50 per cent increase. That is nearly all gone to the top 10 per cent income earners in this country. It is no wonder the Reserve Bank governor this week, once again contributing to public debate, has called on workers to stand up for their wage increases. And I will acknowledge Senator McAllister and her colleagues, who have been in the Productivity Commission estimates and have continually raised this issue around penalty rates and cuts to penalty rates and why these things were not considered by an institution such as the Productivity Commission in relation to inequality—what kinds of impacts that is going to have on the economy—because it is actually an accepted fact that economic inequality, particularly when it becomes more acute, is a drag on economic growth and the economy. That is why wage rises themselves can be very useful for stimulating economic activity, because of course with the circular flow of income that money, that pay, gets reinvested back into the economy.


Increases in investment income, for those at the very top of the distribution, increase inequality, with investment income for the top 10 per cent doubling between 2004 and 2010. This increase is responsible for most of the increase in inequality over this period, despite forming only a small component of income. Looking at the demographics of this, people who are more likely to be found in the bottom of the income distribution are those over 65, sole parents, people from non-English-speaking countries and those reliant on government benefits as their main source of income. And may I say that since I have been in the Senate—for five years—they have been the target of policy in this place, especially by the Liberal government, to raise revenue to balance budgets. The most vulnerable people in this country have been targeted.


Remember the zombie budget cuts of 2013, and how the Greens and mostly Labor and other people in this place stood up to Joe Hockey's and Mr Tony Abbott's cruel budget? That is taking action on inequality; that is running the inequality lens over every piece of legislation that we consider in this place. So, why is it that these demographics are clear yet have been the target of our economic policy and legislation in this place? It is exactly the opposite of what we should be doing. And I want to see more of what we saw in this chamber this week: taking $6 billion off the big banks—$6 billion of tax that will pay for schools and hospitals from some of the wealthiest companies in the world. People who are more likely to be found in the bottom income distributions are the ones at whom we should be targeting our policies towards tackling inequality.


Income is not evenly distributed across the states and territories. We all know that. For example, people in my home state of Tasmania are more likely to be in the bottom 20 per cent, whereas people in Western Australia are more likely to be in the top 20 per cent. So, why do Western Australian senators come in here, Senator Bushby—through you, Chair—and ask for more money from my state of Tasmania, when we have a GST system in this country, horizontal fiscal equalisation, that is designed to transfer wealth from the wealthier states to help the poorer states? We are a federation. That is what this was set up to do. There are those states that, through an accident of geography, for example, do not find themselves sitting on some of the biggest mineral deposits in the world, but those states that do should be sharing that income with other states. Yet we constantly hear in this place that Western Australia should be getting more money and Tasmania should be getting less.


Let's talk about the distribution of wealth in Australia today. Wealth is far more unequally distributed than income—that is the really bad news. The average wealth of a household in the top 20 per cent wealth group in Australia, so the top 20 per cent of richest people in this country, is around 70 times the average wealth of a household in the bottom 20 per cent in this country—70 times. Who wants to get a jelly bean for guessing what the key reason for that is? I will tell you: it nearly all comes down to land prices and real estate. The top 10 per cent of households own 45 per cent of all the wealth in this country, so the richest 10 per cent of Australians own nearly half of the wealth in this country. Most of the remaining wealth is owned by the next 50 per cent of households, while the bottom 40 per cent of households—get this—nearly the bottom half of households in Australia own just five per cent of this country's wealth.


Home ownership is the particular asset I just referred to. Australia is one of the most concentrated places in the world for home ownership. Let me tell you why: the group with the top 20 per cent of wealth distribution owns over 80 per cent of all wealth in investment properties, and shares over 60 per cent of all superannuation wealth. Wealth held in the home is relatively evenly distributed across income groups, largely due to the high levels of home ownership of older retirees, who are more likely to be in low-income groups. One positive is that wealth inequality has declined since the global financial crisis because, obviously, we have seen a fall in asset prices, particularly in financial markets. That has now recovered, but it has increased over the longer term, Senator Seselja, between 2004 and 2012.


These statistics are stark, so why wouldn't a logical, rational person—a senator in this place who is fortunate enough and privileged enough to not only have the pedestal to raise these issues in debates like this today, but to put up legislation, as Senator McAllister has, that could try and hone our focus on tackling these issues—do just that? Why aren't we doing that? What kind of legislation should we be looking at? In my last few minutes I would say that, given these very black-and-white statistics on wealth ownership in this country, why do we still have perverse incentives that give property investors the opportunity to corner the housing market? That, by the way, is not just increasing economic inequality in this country, but is adding very severe risks to our financial system that have been recognised by international investors and, very recently, by the ratings agencies, who have basically said that we are close to a crisis in the housing market.


Why don't we kill two birds with one stone and remove these investment incentives—these perverse incentives like negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions? They are taking revenue out of the tax system that could be used to pay for schools, hospitals, pensions for retiring people and unemployment benefits, social safety nets and health care. That money is contributing to inequality and instability in our financial system. It is an absolute no-brainer, but no-one has the political courage in this place to tackle this. We have been banging on about this for nearly 10 years. Labor has a version of a policy to at least ratchet back some of those investment incentives, but we should actually remove them. Then we will have tens of billions of dollars that we can allocate to where it is most needed.


What other things could we be doing? We could be taking government money—debt, long-term capital issuances are at record low interest rates—and investing in the future of this country. The government could be playing an active role in our life by investing in productive infrastructure that would also tackle economic inequality, create jobs and growth—if I can use that term, as much as it makes me cringe—and, of course, reduce housing bubbles. The Reserve Bank governor has also said that investing in long-term infrastructure, especially public transport, is one of the best ways to reduce housing inequality in this country.


What else could we do? We could invest money in a federal housing trust to build accommodation for the many homeless in this country and those who cannot afford their own home. My colleagues Senator Rhiannon and Senator Ludlam over the years have done some fantastic work in setting up what a federal housing trust would look like. We have nearly half a million people in this country who cannot afford to buy a home. Where is the role of government? Where is the provision of low-income housing that we see in overseas countries, especially in Europe? It is almost non-existent. There is so much we could do; there are so many positive, proactive things I could talk about here today to reduce inequality. But, to go back to Senator McAllister's bill, unless we focus on economic inequality we are never going to fix it. We are always going to be burying our head in the sand. We are always going to be dealing with the short-term political issues of the day—which leadership struggle gets the most eyeballs on social media, in the papers or on TV sets? It is personality politics. 


We are fortunate and privileged in this place to be able to tackle these issues. Other governments around the world are moving to tackle these issues—and they are not just economic issues or social issues. I would argue that economic inequality is one of the biggest sources of political instability around the world. I have read Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century. It is difficult reading—I must confess that it took me a long time to read it, but I did finish it. There is a lot of empirical data there, and the conclusions are stark: we are entering a period of unprecedented economic inequality all around the world and it is creating political instability. We owe it to our democracy, which is the best system we have, to tackle this issue because it is, all around the world, undermining our democratic institutions. People are fed up. They do not believe in trickle-down economics. It has failed. The neoliberal experiment has failed. We need to find a new business model that looks after people and puts people before profit and has an increased role of government in our lives. That is what the Greens propose.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2017-06-22,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia—Deputy President and Chair of Committees) (10:27):  I want to put on the record comments that take a perspective different from the remarks of Senator Whish-Wilson. I am a WA Labor senator and I have spoken in this place about the need for Western Australia to receive more GST but never have I suggested, for a minute, that it should be at the expense of Tasmania. I do not think any Labor senator or MP in the other place has suggested that. We want to see a fairer distribution—we have never suggested taking from one state or territory and giving to another. I do remind the Greens party that poverty exists across this country, and to somehow claim that Tasmania has a greater need than Western Australia is to ignore the state of poverty in Australia and indeed in my home state. 


The other point I would make, and this Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill goes some way to addressing it, is that Senator Whish-Wilson said that somehow the Greens have been banging on about this for 10 years. That is the problem—we have had words but not actions. I do remind senators in this place, and particularly the Greens senators, that it is Labor that has put in place a whole range of reforms—superannuation, Medicare, parental leave. We had policies in government that did tackle homelessness and affordable housing. We had a bill in the other place, which the government knocked off, to try to protect penalty rates. We have put those actions in place but sadly they have not gone far enough. Also, every time the conservatives come into power, whether as state governments or federal governments, we see the situation eroded. This bill says let us start tackling and reporting on economic inequality. That is at least a start.


Recently I attended the Women's Forum in New York, which looked at women's economic empowerment across the world. It is shocking—wherever you look across the world, Australia is no different. We might be a little better off than our sisters in some Third World countries, but, nevertheless, women are not treated equally in this country—despite the reforms that Labor governments have put in place. And, certainly, that equality is absolutely under attack from the Turnbull government. It has been under attack since the day that they were elected. 


With issues such as penalty rates, who on earth thinks that penalty rates will somehow magically lead to greater employment? It is an absolute nonsense. It takes pay out of the pockets of, particularly, low-paid workers—of women workers. We know that in Australia we have one of the most highly gender segregated workforces in the world. Men work in traditional male occupations; women are clustered in low-paid jobs and they rely on penalty rates. Yet, the Turnbull government, come 1 July, are going to take money out of the pockets of those women. It is an absolute disgrace and, quite frankly, I cannot believe that they think it is somehow going to create more employment. Of course it will not. So we will see women who work in hospitality and retail, come 1 July, get less money in their pay packets to support their families, to go to university or to do whatever else they rely on. The reason women and men work on weekends is to supplement low income. I do not get which bit of that those opposite just cannot understand. It is an absolute disgrace that on 1 July we will see people in this country lose income, and they will do so at the hands of the Turnbull government. I will never let the Turnbull government forget that. Labor has said that we will address this. We will put it back. We will make the changes to the Fair Work Commission to make sure that low-paid workers cannot be attacked by the Turnbull government. 


On 1 July what else will happen? Millionaires will get a tax cut. On the very day the Turnbull government is taking money out of the pockets of low-paid workers—particularly women stuck in those areas of low pay—they will be giving their millionaire mates a tax cut. What a disgrace. They still believe, in this day and age, that somehow this trickle down will work. It will not. In the same way as when they cut superannuation, they refused to pass on the next percentage increase. That damages long-term retirement incomes, but they boasted that somehow that would create employment. Well, it has not, because we have seen record unemployment under the Abbott and Turnbull regime as prime ministers of this country. That is actually what we have seen. And the jobs that have been created are low-paid jobs, casual jobs—jobs in areas where workers will lose penalty rates. So this bill will actually start to hold up a light. It will start to say, 'We need to report on inequality in this country.' That would be a first step.


Using the Productivity Commission will take the political spin out of it. It will look at the impacts of inequality on the Australian economy, and it will produce a report—like Closing the Gap—that we will have to address as lawmakers in this country. We did see evidence during the inquiry—I was fortunate enough to be able to attend one of the hearings in Sydney—that inequality is stark, particularly for women. Women around this country, quite frankly, are a bit sick of just keeping on talking about it. We have known this for a very long time. We know we have a highly gender segregated workforce. Yet, despite some effort, we are not getting women into those STEM areas. We really need to do much more than we are currently doing to encourage the break-up of the gender segregation that we see. On the other side, in the caring industries and in retail and hospitality, men are never going to work in those industries in large numbers. Why? Because the pay is appalling. It is poverty wages.


For an educator working in the early education field, it is one of the most important jobs you could do in our society, because we know that for young children the vast majority of brain development happens between one and three years of age. What are we paying those workers? We are paying them poverty wages—about $21 an hour. That is what we are paying low-paid educators. Those wages are so bad. In an industry predominantly funded—almost 100 per cent—by those opposite in the federal government, the wages remain at poverty levels. It is not that educators do not love their jobs. It is incredibly rewarding working with young children, particularly young children between the ages of one and five. But they are forced out because they cannot afford to stay, or, alternatively, they are working two and three other jobs and that means that when they come to work in the morning to work with young Australians—our future leaders—they are tired and that automatically puts them at a disadvantage. But if they want to stay in the job that they love they have to work elsewhere, or they have to rely on another wage in their family. That is disgraceful.


At the other end of the spectrum we have aged care workers who, again, care for some of the most vulnerable in our society—senior Australians who have worked and have contributed to our economy, have paid their taxes, have raised families, have built homes and have led decent lives. Yet, at the end of their lives they are cared for by workers who are very low paid and part-time, who also have to work at least one other job to make ends meet. What is the key feature of these two sectors? Women. Women are clustered in aged care and early childhood, and an aged care worker earns about the same as an early childhood worker—about $21 an hour—but they rely on penalty rates, because the caring industry is seven days a week, 24 hours a day. But you can bet your bottom dollar that now that the Turnbull government has simply closed its eyes to the attack on penalty rates in retail and hospitality they will come for the aged care workers—the first they came for. We all know that sequence of events.


But it will not stop at hospitality and retail. What we have seen from the Turnbull government is that they are doing nothing to stop the attack on workers wages. In fact, many in the Turnbull government applaud the loss of penalty rates. They think it is a good thing for our economy. What is less money in our economy a good thing? Why is taking money out of the pay of low-paid workers a good thing? Why is giving someone less money to spend each fortnight when they get their pay packet good for our economy? No-one believes that. But somehow those opposite in the Turnbull government think there is going to be this magic proliferation of jobs.


Even if there were more jobs created as a result of this—I do not believe that, but let us assume for a minute that we will create a few more jobs—what will they be? More low-paying jobs—not good for our economy, not good for our tax system, and not good for individuals' prosperity. Yet, those opposite will champion it.


So, education and early childhood education—low-paid workers—women; aged care workers—low-paid women. Than there is the disability sector. How proud am I to be a Labor senator and to have been part of the government that introduced the NDIS? It is a revolutionary reform. Like Medicare, it will become a very important part of our economy. The NDIS is there. From the work that Labor did, we know that we need a massive increase in the workforce into the future.


What are the key features of the disability services sector? Low pay, and guess what the gender is—female. It is a feminised, low-paid workforce. Yet those opposite have done absolutely nothing to address the needs of that workforce into the future. You cannot have choice and control, which is a key part of the NDIS, if you do not have the workforce to match. We will not be able to attract the workforce we need unless we do something about the pay. Again, we see that those workers are on about $21 an hour. They want to look after and support people with disability to be able to manage in their own homes. They do an incredible job and they are unsung heroes, as are early childhood educators and aged care workers. But there will be a shortage into the future if we do not act on the pay. I think that those opposite think that the answer to that is to just import workers. Of course that contributes noting to our economy either.


So not only do we have to encourage women into STEM areas and traditional male areas of our workforce; we need to fix the pay and working conditions in low-paid areas so that we attract a different workforce. We want diversity in our workforce. We recognise that male workers bring a different perspective to these sectors, particularly early childhood workers. We want to encourage males in, but we will never get them unless we address this shocking poverty pay that exists in these areas. So having Senator McAllister's bill here, which is going to force us to report on a whole raft of things in relation to social injustice and economic inequality in our country, is a really positive issue. 


The other issue we have to address as a society, as a community and as legislators is that we really have to start speaking about the unpaid work that women do. We know that, despite many men being much more enlightened than perhaps my father and men that went before him, we do need to share the family work that is traditionally done by women, because that prohibits women from going out and finding higher-paid jobs. If you have to be there to do school pick-up or to care for an aged parent, you cannot take a job that requires you to work from 3 pm to 5 pm. You are prohibited from doing that. We know that in our country the unpaid work is traditionally still done by women. We need to start to talk about that. 


But of course we have a government that is characterised by those famous comments by former Prime Minister Abbott, when he talked to the women who apparently do all the ironing in the country. If you have MPs and senators opposite with a view that somehow it is our normal destiny as women to take on this unpaid caring role, we are in trouble. It is time that we started to challenge that and to measure the sorts of unpaid work that women do in our community and really start to change that. For that to happen we need flexible workplaces. We need to actively encourage men to take time to care for children, to take days off when their children are sick, to take time to go to school assemblies and all of the things that traditionally in our community we rely on women to do. We need our workplaces to be much more flexible to the needs of men when they have family commitments. 


This is not some utopian socialist dream. This is actually good for our economy. It is good for our economy when we have workforce flexibility for men and women, when we encourage employers and hold up private employers to role model where flexible work actually works, where men are taking a share of what happens in family life. Until we start to address the unpaid work done by women, we will still be talking about inequality in 20 years. It is a major impediment to women fully participating in the workforce.


Gone are the days in our country when the male worked full time and the woman worked part time. That is no longer acceptable. If that is an arrangement people choose, good on them, but let us make a real choice for men and for women. Across your career in the paid workforce there might be times when both of you work part time and times when both of you full time, and that unpaid component of family life is shared equally between men and women. We are a long way from that, unfortunately, but that is something we need to consider as a community, and to role model best practice when we see it.


At the inquiry the Australian Industry Group talked about barriers for flexible workplace issues, so it is not just the Labor side of politics talking about this, but the Australian Industry Group, too. They indicated to us that flexibility was something most employers wanted to offer to staff and they felt that inflexibility made it very difficult for employers to implement alternative working arrangements for workers who desire or require more-flexible working arrangements. I think all of this in this place and many Australians struggle when our children start school. That is probably a time when it is very hard to manage full-time work and also pick children up from school and make sure they are properly cared for. If we had that flexibility, particularly across the early years, we would create more-productive workplaces.


With regard to the gender pay gap, despite Labor making great inroads on pay inequality in the famous cases that were run in the industrial commissions in this country, wage inequality still exists. It is 16 per cent and has been stubbornly stuck there for 20 years—that is generations of workers—and in my state of Western Australia it has been stubbornly stuck at 24 per cent. These are issues that need urgent attention from the government and indeed this parliament, yet they simply get overlooked. It is not acceptable in this day and age to have such inequity in pay continue on and on without being addressed.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2017-06-22,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:47):  Listening to this debate, and particularly the previous two speakers, with their socialist rhetoric, brings to my mind some maxims that were first mentioned in the 19th century by the philosopher Reverend Bottger, sometimes attributed to Abraham Lincoln and elaborated upon by Winston Churchill. I think it is always important to remind ourselves of those 10 maxims, which are as important and evident now as they were when they were first uttered. I notice some schoolchildren in the gallery. I love to see them here. It is good to see them watching parliament in action in the cause of democracy. They too might be interested in these 10 maxims. I am going to repeat them because they are so germane to the debate we are having today. The first one is: you cannot strengthen the week by weakening the strong. Winston Churchill elaborated on that by saying you cannot make the poor rich by making the rich poorer. You cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift. You cannot help little men by tearing down big men. You cannot lift the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer. You cannot help keep the poor by destroying the pitch. You cannot establish sound security on borrowed money. You cannot further the brotherhood of man by inciting class hatred. You cannot keep out of trouble by spending more than you earn. You cannot build character and courage by destroying men's initiative and independence. And you cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they can and should do for themselves.


Those maxims are self-evident, and they are what made America great, a little before Australia was made great by people following those principles. They are a series of thoughts that I was delighted to hear our newest senator, Senator Gichuhi, mention, not in those words but in the themes that she addressed yesterday in her maiden speech to this chamber. Of course, they are the principles upon which the Liberal Party of Australia is based. It is a tenet of the party that I belong to that you must look after those who are disadvantaged and those who are not as fortunate as we are. Through the majority of the Commonwealth, when we have had Liberal governments, those principles have been put in place.


This Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017 is a private member's bill from a Labor senator, and I congratulate Senator McAllister for bringing forward for debate a sensible policy proposal—not one that I necessarily agree with, but I appreciate the fact that it is an attempt to have a sensible policy discussion in this place and does not, as with many of Senator McAllister's colleagues, simply to make some very base political point or attack members of the Senate who are not members of their party. So I am pleased that this debate is before us. I should point out to Senator McAllister that the Intergenerational report, which she mentioned both in her second reading speech and in the explanatory memorandum, is produced not by the Parliamentary Budget Office, as she said, but by the Treasury. I do not think that error in your second reading speech makes a great deal of difference to the bill before us, but it is important to make sure we all understand these things.


The Labor Party want the Productivity Commission to do another investigation and another report. If you have plenty of money and plenty of time, that is sometimes a useful way to go. Rather than doing reports, investigations or studies, the Turnbull government is actually addressing inequality with policies to boost economic growth that generates greater employment and income for hardworking Australians whilst targeting assistance to those who need it most. Again quoting our newest senator, Senator Gichuhi, yesterday in her first speech, the best form of welfare is a job. The best form of welfare is a job, and that is what our government are attempting to do. 


The previous, Labor speaker, Senator Lines, mentioned that the current government has presided over record unemployment. Clearly, the previous  speaker has not been here long. I am proud to say I have been here 27 years and am currently the longest serving parliamentarian, and I have seen it all before. I happened to be here when, under the Keating Labor government, unemployment across Australia was at almost 13 per cent. Youth unemployment in the Keating years across Australia was upwards of 35 per cent. Yet Labor speakers come in here and try to suggest with non-factual comments that unemployment under this government is at record levels. It clearly is not. I can tell you, though, Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi, that it is at record levels in the city where I have my office, the city of Townsville. We are, regrettably, a state with a Labor government which has done little on the economy. In fact, it has done little on anything. It is adopting the principle that if you do not make a decision and you do not do anything, then you are not going to offend anyone, so your chances of getting re-elected at the next election are better, because you have not put anyone off side. More than that, they have employed another 12,000 public servants, most of whom are not needed in Queensland but who, I guess, are grateful for their job and will show their gratitude in the upcoming state election in Queensland. 


But in my home city of Townsville, unfortunately, unemployment is at very high levels. Why? Because of the mining downturn and because the state government, who control the local economy, have done nothing. The federal government has tried to help in Townsville, with commitments to the Eastern Access Rail Corridor project, to the Townsville Stadium, to the ring road around Townsville, to beef roads and to regional roads. The money from the Commonwealth for dams and for water studies has really flooded into the north, but, unfortunately, whilst the Commonwealth government provides the money, with the way our Constitution is set out, the work has to be done by the state government, who own the roads and who own the rivers. We, federally, can only provide the money, and we have done that. Regrettably, the state government have not used that money for the benefit of the people of North Queensland. 


Credit where credit is due, I will give the Labor Premier of Queensland credit for staring down the opponents in her own party, including her Deputy Premier, by—reluctantly, I think—eventually supporting the Adani project to build a long railway line in Queensland to go from the central Queensland coalfields to the Abbot Point port near Bowen. For young people who might have heard of this debate, can I say to you: please do not believe the rhetoric of the Greens and GetUp, who tell you that opening a coalmine about 500 or 600 kilometres inland, behind the Great Dividing Range, is somehow going to destroy the Great Barrier Reef. I live on the Great Barrier Reef. All of the people of that part of Queensland, who are represented by members of the Liberal-National Party—not of the Labor Party—know that the reef is carefully managed. It has ups and downs, but, generally speaking, it is a resilient organism that will continue to flourish, because it is well managed by, principally, the federal government, in conjunction with the Queensland government. 


I have diverted a fraction from saying that the Queensland Premier, against opposition from within her own party, did in fact supports the Adani railway and mine project, which will also, as an adjunct, help the South Australian steel industry, because all of the steel for the railway will be sourced from Whyalla. That project will provide real jobs, will provide some sustenance to small businesses who are struggling in that area and will, consequently, help with the equity of those who are less fortunate in the North Queensland region at the moment.


The previous speaker also made some reference to the abolition of penalty rates on 1 July. Somehow this is the fault of the Turnbull government, even though it was a decision made by the Fair Work Commission, whose members are principally ex-union workers and ex-union bosses appointed by the Labor Party.




Senator Seselja:
  Under a Labor piece of legislation.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Under a Labor piece of legislation—that is quite right, Senator Seselja. This independent commission, made up of mates of Senator Cameron who his government appointed to the job, took evidence and looked at it all. They understood the facts and figures, and they—not the Turnbull government—made a decision to adjust penalty rates for Saturday and Sunday work. Why? It is because the evidence clearly showed that penalty rates discourage employment opportunities. I know, without a study by the Productivity Commission or the Fair Work Commission or anyone else, just from my contact with my constituents, that there are so many small businesses who will not open on Saturday and Sunday because they cannot afford to pay the penalty rates. They cannot afford to compete in wages, because they have to pay huge penalty rates, whereas the big chains—like Maccas, Kentucky Fried and those fast-food chains; Myers and David Jones; Woolworths and Coles—thanks to a union deal, do not have to pay those same rates.


Why? It is because Mr Shorten, when he was a union leader, did these deals with that sector of the industry and said, 'You don't have to pay these huge penalty rates,' but the small businessmen, the mums and dads trying to compete with these multinational chains, 'Sorry you've got to pay these prohibitive penalty rates,' which means that most of them do not open. With a more realistic approach to penalty rates these small businesses, the mums and dads, will say, 'Yes, we will open on Saturday and Sunday, because we can afford to employ people.' That means more people will be employed, and that sort of thing will address the critical unemployment situation in my home city of Townsville. Fortunately, this is not shared by most of the rest of Australia at the present time, but it will make a difference there and right across Australia.


As I said before, it is my party's vision—it is in our DNA and it is certainly in the DNA of coalition governments federally—to look after those who cannot look after themselves, the more disadvantaged in our society. I will give just one example: the National Disability Insurance Scheme. I concede this originated in the term of the Labor government, but it was a proposal that was fully supported by the then opposition, which was our party, something you do not see today in this parliament. Anything that comes to this parliament, whether it be good, bad or indifferent, is automatically opposed by Labor and the Greens, just because we brought it forward. The Liberal Party in opposition thought that the NDIS was a good idea. It is part, as I say, of our DNA to look after those not as advantaged as the rest of us.


It was a good idea, but at the time we warned, 'Is this being paid for?' As I mentioned before in one of those important maxims, 'You can't keep out of trouble by spending more than you earn.' That is what Labor governments do all the time. That is what they did with the NDIS. That is what they do with everything: 'Yeah, good idea, it will get a few votes: let's promise we'll have a national disability insurance scheme. How's it going to be paid for? Don't worry about that; let's get the credit for setting this up and we'll worry about that later.' Of course, the Labor Party never provided money for the NDIS. It has been left to this government to actually fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme.


We are asking Australians to contribute, with the Medicare levy to be increased by half a percentage point from two to 2.5 per cent of taxable income. This means that one-fifth of the revenue raised by the Medicare levy, along with underspends within NDIS, will be directed to an NDIS savings fund to ensure that this good scheme can continue and be fully funded into the future—a proposition, an arrangement that the Labor Party had neither the wit nor the courage nor the understanding to introduce.


This is a measure because we do have those hated rich people that Senator Lines spoke about. Fortunately they are rich, because 2.5 per cent of their income will mean a huge boost to looking after those who need the NDIS. I repeat that maxim: you cannot establish sound security—social security in this instance—on borrowed money. Because we do have people who earn a lot, they contribute more—and thank goodness we do have them.


Similarly, this government understands inequality in education. That is why Senator Birmingham is bringing in a scheme that is equal across the board. It makes sure that people, no matter which category they are in, have money to be properly educated. As a state school veteran—all my school years were at a state school; I could not afford to go to university; I did my tertiary studies externally—I understand how important it is that all students should be helped by the federal government and the state governments. People say to me: why is the federal government giving Catholic and private schools so much money and state schools so little? The reason is that the state governments in our Federation give the state schools all the money and the Catholic and private schools very little at all. So what the Commonwealth has always done, since the Menzies days, is try and equalise that. We do not care where kids go to school; as long as they are getting a good education, they should all be treated relatively equally.


Across the board, coalition governments, since time immemorial, have tried to lessen the inequalities within Australia by sensible policies that work and that do achieve results;. That is why every serious social reform, and indeed environmental reform, that has ever come before the Australian parliament has been a product of Liberal governments over the decades.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2017-06-22,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (11:07):  I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in the debate on the Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017. I support this bill and congratulate my friend and colleague Senator McAllister on her initiative in bringing this bill before the Senate and commencing a debate on inequality, one of the great social and economic issues facing the nation. The bill amends the Productivity Commission Act 1998 to expand the general policy guidelines for the exercise of the Productivity Commission's functions to require consideration of inequality. The bill establishes a framework for the Productivity Commission to regularly report on economic inequality.


I have been a long-time critic of the Productivity Commission since appearing before the commission and former Commissioner Banks on the future of the vehicle and component industry many years ago. I appeared in my role as the national secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union. Arising from that hearing, the commission set the stage for the destruction of the vehicle and component industry in this country. It did not do a lot for equality and it did not do a lot for working people. The commission, in my view, is far too dominated by economists. Worse still, these economists are predominantly advocates of neoliberal economics who argue that the economy will reach equilibrium, in which all resources will be fully employed, if only government is minimised.


These people in the Productivity Commission are the acolytes of the Austrian school of economics, influenced by Friedrich Hayek, and the Chicago school of economics, influenced by Milton Friedman. It is my view that, unless there is an injection of economists who understand the role of the state and Keynesian economic principles, the majority of the reports will be guided by an increasingly discredited economic theory that increases poverty and inequality. There must be an injection of economists who are not bogged down by their ideological presumptions, such as, 'Markets are always efficient,' or, 'Government is always inefficient.'


The Productivity Commission can always be relied on to minimise the role of government and maximise the role of the so-called free market. We therefore need a renewed debate on the role of government in reducing inequality while moving away from the sterile and unrealistic slogans of the coalition, such as 'jobs and growth' and 'innovation agenda' and the empty rhetoric of trickle-down economics, of which we heard so much about from the previous senator in this debate, Senator Macdonald.


As the renowned Nobel economics laureate Joseph Stiglitz stated in his book Freefall: America, Free Markets, and the Sinking of the Global Economy:


Economics had moved—more than economists would like to think—from being a scientific discipline into becoming free market capitalism's biggest cheerleader.


The Productivity Commission is an example of this. The economists in the Productivity Commission, who can pontificate on any issue that the government brings before them, were missing in action and failed to analyse or understand the problems being created by greed and corruption in the US finance sector which led to the great recession. Where were all the alarm bells from these right-wing economists in the Productivity Commission that there was something happening in the US that would lead this country into what almost became a recession?


We would have been in a recession if we had not had a Labor government in place to actually use Keynesian economic principles to keep people at work, keep communities operating and keep businesses and corporations going. Labor in government, in my view, should not solely rely on advice from the Productivity Commission, unless the dominance within the commission of free market economists is balanced by economists who understand the importance of the role of government in the economy. Unless we do this, the good aspiration contained in this bill that the Productivity Commission consider inequality and establish a framework to regularly report on inequality will be frustrated by the dominance of the Chicago school of economics thinking of the economic staff in the Productivity Commission.


What are the drivers of inequality? The drivers of inequality are the neoliberal economics we just heard from Senator Macdonald. Again, he just used the same tired, old, regurgitated rhetoric that the coalition have been using for years about trickle-down economics. They think that, if they give a $65 billion tax cut to big business who do not pay their fair share of tax now, there will be economic growth and jobs will be created. What a load of tosh from Senator Macdonald and the coalition on this issue. They argue about too much tax and small government. Small government means that you end up not having the capacity to provide the health services, the education services and the infrastructure that this country needs to continue to compete at an international level.


They do not deal with multinational tax avoidance, which is a great driver of inequality. They constantly attack the union movement. We heard from Senator Macdonald. He is full of rhetoric about the trade union movement without understanding the benefits that the trade union movement brings to working class people in this country through decent wages and decent conditions and how that flows on to small businesses across the country because workers have a dollar in their pocket to spend in those small businesses.


Another driver of inequality is the budgetary decisions of the coalition. No-one should ever forget the 2014 budget. It was the epitome of inequality created by government policy. If you ever want to look at what would drive inequality, go back to the 2014-15 budget of this government: changes to welfare for young people; reductions in hospital funding and health expenditure, including new patient contributions to the cost of medical services; and reductions in school funding. That is where they really are. The only reason they are trying to put up a smokescreen that they are interested in education is that they were being killed out there, day in day out, in the political debate on education and school funding. That is the only reason they have actually been dragged kicking and screaming to any semblance—and a pale imitation—of what Gonski is really about. They actually reduced family tax benefits in that budget. They reduced the indexation of the age and disability pensions. Cuts to pensioners was their DNA in their policy and their budget. And these cuts, including reduced funding to higher education and increased student contributions, mainly affected low- and middle-income households.


I will not be lectured by any of that mob, that rabble of a government across there, on inequality—absolutely no way. They all, like lemmings, supported these cuts when they first came to government and argued that this was good for the economy. Well, they destroyed people's lives! I will not accept any criticism of Labor policies from a mob who just do not understand inequality. In that budget, young people under 30 were denied access to income support for six months of every year, losing up to $255 a week. Young kids were supposed to starve if they did not have their family looking after them! What an obnoxious policy to bring in a country like Australia—which had an international reputation for egalitarianism. Young people aged 22 to 23 were transferred from Newstart allowance to the lower youth allowance. Young people with disabilities were reassessed, with income reductions of up to $214 a week in the disability support pension.


Indexation changes were put in place that would erode the real value of payments over the long term with the loss of $80 a week in a decade. They abolished the pensioner education supplement. And they tightened access to family payments, impacting mainly on low-income families with children—in particular, sole parents. They made changes to family tax benefit B. Sole parents with a youngest child aged between six and 12 lost $37 a week and those with a youngest child aged over 12 years would lose $58 a week. This is their understanding of inequality. This is how they behave when they think they can get away with it.


Do not listen to any coalition member who ever stands up here and talks about looking after working class people in this country, because it is not in their DNA. They do not care about working people. They care more about the big businesses that put the dollars into their election funds, whether that is done legally or in the back seat of a Bentley with a property developer up in Newcastle handing over $10,000 in a brown paper bag to the coalition. They do not care about working class people in this country.


The coalition want us to change the payment indexation for pensions. They have changed it from the CPI to wages. That would erode the value of the pension by $80 a week over 10 years. That is how much they care about pensioners. They extended the qualifying age for the age pension without any increase in the Newstart payment, reducing income for those unable to work up to 70 by between $64 and $166 a week. This was the coalition in action. Boilermakers, fitters, builders and labourers are being told, 'You've got to work until you're 70.' What a nonsense!


Then look at the group of Australians who are suffering most from inequality—Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. One hundred and fifty programs were consolidated into five. The government cut $493.7 million from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander support, and $160 million of the cut was from a reduction of expenditure on Indigenous health programs. So no wonder the government cannot deal with inequality. It is because they just do not know what it means. There are cuts to Indigenous language support programs of $9.5 million. They reduced funding to the National Rental Affordability Scheme, which was putting low-income people into houses, with the loss of round 5 incentives and 12,000 dwellings that should have been in there for low-income households.


They cut funding to homelessness services and they did not give any indication that they would continue funding. They have defunded housing help for seniors and defunded the first home saver account scheme. That was when they first came into government. Now in the most recent budget they have put it back in. They do not know if they are Arthur or Martha, this mob. They will just do anything to try to save their necks, because they are such a rabble of a government. They are so divided internally. They do not want to deal properly with the issue of inequality. They do not want to deal with the issues that really go to ensuring that there is a fair and egalitarian society in this country.


Who could ever forget the sight of former Treasurer Hockey, who was telling everyone there were 'lifters' and 'leaners', becoming the 'leaner-in-chief' over in New York? Who will ever forget him and the current Minister for Finance, Minister Cormann, celebrating the imposition of all this inequality on Australians with a fat Havana cigar. It probably cost more for one cigar than they expected an Australian in trouble to survive on for a day. It was absolute nonsense. The current Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, in an interview said he supported every aspect of that horrendous budget. So the coalition cannot criticise anyone in relation to what we are doing to try to deal with inequality.


Inequality comes at a cost to the whole economy. There is a vicious spiral when inequality is not dealt with. Look at what has happened under this government—record underemployment, record-low wages growth and record-low share of national wealth, down from 75 per cent in the 1970s to 53 per cent now. There is the highest level of income inequality in 75 years and yet the government still support cuts to penalty rates for 700,000 of the most vulnerable, low-paid workers in this country. They are an absolute disgrace.


Thankfully, in more and more countries around the world they are getting rid of these policies of globalisation, privatisation, competition policy and austerity. Thatcherism is dead—it is just that these people do not understand that. Even the International Monetary Fund has identified that reductions in the number of trade unionists and the taking away of the rights of trade unions results in more inequality. That is the speciality of this mob—they know that if they can destroy the trade union movement, weaken the trade union movement, working class people will suffer more and more inequality. When the International Monetary Fund is saying that, then we should all be very concerned about what they are about. Deunionisation weakens earnings for middle- and low-income workers. That is what they are about—giving $65 billion of tax cuts to big business on the theory of trickle-down economics and, while they give tax cuts to millionaires, increasing taxes on ordinary working families. That is their view of inequality. That is how they try and deal with inequality. They do not have a clue.


The trade union movement is absolutely essential to dealing with inequality. We have seen a position where every time this government gets an opportunity they try and weaken the rights of workers who belong to trade unions. They try and diminish the capacity of workers to enterprise bargain effectively. And the push to enterprise bargaining has created a position where multinational corporations can use all of their resources against workers and their unions, but the unions cannot take any coordinated action across that company. I think it is a disgrace. That should be changed. The right of entry for union officials should be liberalised so that we can actually get in there and talk to workers about the problems they have on the job. But this government is so busy with its ideological obsession, with destroying the trade union movement, cutting rates for pensioners and getting rid of decent funding for education and health, that they do not care. They are an absolute rabble and a disgrace of a government. (Time expired)

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2017-06-22,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (11:27):  I rise to oppose Labor's Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017. This bill would require the Productivity Commission to prepare five-yearly reports on the effects of inequality. A saving grace of this is that this requirement is not loaded with an assumption that inequality is bad and the government should counter inequality. The Productivity Commission would hopefully measure the things that matter to people, how equally these things are distributed and the effect of this distribution. 


Some people want more money, more goods and services and more assets, so the commission would measure inequality in these things and assess the effects of such inequality. But consumption is not all that matters to people. Inequality is found in many areas of life. Some people at death's door just want to survive, while others with poor health just want to be able to enjoy everyday life. The lonely among us long for friends, meaningful relationships and family. Many yearn to have children. Some people long to find meaningful employment and have fulfilling careers. Some people are tired of carrying the tax burden for others. Some just want a bit of respect. Some people have a spiritual gap in their lives and some people wish they were better looking or still had hair on their heads. Good luck to the Productivity Commission if it has to measure and assess inequality with respect to all of this. Given the problems confronting the governments of Australia, this exercise does not strike me as the best use of the Productivity Commission's time. 


However, the critical component of the bill before the Senate today is a requirement on the Productivity Commission, in performance of all its functions, to have regard to the need 'to mitigate the negative effects of inequality on the Australian economy and the Australian community.' This requires the commission to accept, before it has done any investigation, that inequality has negative effects that should be mitigated. This undermines the usefulness of having an organisation where staff are tasked to gather evidence and come to their own conclusions. 


As it happens, inequality does have negative effects, namely: envy. But the moral thing for the government in response to this envy is to do nothing. The role of government should not be to do whatever the median voter wants, which could very well be to seize the property of the minority. The role of government is to protect life, liberty and property and, more broadly, to do other beneficial things that businesses cannot profitably provide due to free riding. In other words, liberty should trump democracy. This is in the long-term interests of Australians, including the median voter. 


Currently the bipartisan obsession with spending other people's money has us on a slow path to self-destruction. I urge parliamentarians, whenever they are thinking about spending more of other people's money, to consider what Australia will look like in decades ahead if such behaviour were to continue. Equality in poverty is not something we should aspire to.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2017-06-22,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (11:31):  I rise to speak in support of the Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017. In opening my comments I want to congratulate my colleague Senator McAllister for bringing on a debate on such an important matter. For those of us on this side of the chamber the recent decision of the Productivity Commission to recommend a reduction in penalty rates makes the case very, very strongly that this reform is long overdue. The Productivity Commission is the brainchild of the former Howard government, and, while, I must confess, sometimes its reports have been useful—and I will come back to that—its most recent recommendation in respect of penalty rates in the retail, hospitality and fast-food sectors has given cover for the industrial commission to follow through with devastating cuts, which are going to further entrench inequality.


On this side of the chamber we know that equality of opportunity is core business for people in political life. If we are here for nothing else, we should be here to ensure that all Australians have equal opportunities. We know that it has become mainstream economic thought that inequality is inextricably linked with economic growth, so we really need to tailor our institutions to focus on this issue and ensure that it is an important consideration. But it is not just economic linkage. We know if there is a sustained perception of inequality in a society then that will have political consequences. I would argue that the rise of President Trump and the events in the UK with Brexit are all symptoms of people's perception that they are not adequately benefiting from the growth of the economy, and that is therefore leading to dissatisfaction, disaffection, dislocation and disengagement. This is something that, as a body politic, we need to nip in the bud, and I think Senator McAllister's proposal for the Productivity Commission is a good starting point for focusing one of our key institutions on the issue of inequality—amongst other things, of course. They will always need to address other criteria, but inequality should be up there, of equal importance, with those other issues.


We know that Australia's inequality level is the challenge of our time. Even the Treasurer, Mr Morrison, has indicated that low wages growth is probably the single most important economic issue that we confront. Having said that, the government will not do anything to prevent the cuts to penalty rates and prevent the take-home pay of many low-wage employees being further affected. It is a very hollow observation on the part of the Treasurer. We know that wealth is growing more quickly at the top of the spectrum, and over the past four decades real earnings for the top 10 per cent have risen nearly four times faster than they have for the bottom 10 per cent. That is a huge concern. Unless we do something about this trend of increasing inequality then, as sure as night follows day, we are going to see a continuation of it and things will get a lot worse before they get any better.


I was somewhat heartened, and a bit surprised, to see the new Governor of the Reserve Bank come out in support of workers demanding a greater share of the economy's profits to drive up record low wages growth. The Governor of the Reserve Bank is not normally seen as a champion of workers' rights, though to be fair to the governor he has made a number of other comments as well—but this was a central tenet of one of his recent speeches. He identified that there is a real need to address this issue of demand in the economy, and we need a sustained pick-up in wages to enable us to move out of the abnormally low interest rate settings that we are currently in. It is surprising to see the Governor of the Reserve Bank make those comments.


We have also seen comments from the Business Council of Australia's chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, who has written that the sense of resentment in the community over the changing economic outlook is real and it must be understood. She has said:


Economic liberalisation is a social compact. In exchange for rising incomes to help them look after their local needs, people are asked to accept an ever-changing economy with industries that rise and fall with the tide of global progress.


After a decade of phenomenal income growth, built on the back of a deregulated economy that reaped the benefits of increased global trade, business investment has now slowed and wages growth has fallen flat.


She says that the crisis really is in real wage growth. This is coming from an unusual quarter—even people on the business side of our society are saying that enough is enough, that we have seen surprising income growth in certain quarters but the people who most need the benefit of the growth in our economy are not seeing that.


Almost three-quarters of Australians agree that differences in incomes are too high. We do not have the sorts of levels of income inequality that you might see in the US, for example, but that is because of many of the institutions that we now take for granted in our country. I am very proud to be a Labor politician and to be able to point to many of those institutions as having been initiated, created or sustained and protected by the Labor Party in the course of 100 years, whether it comes to forms of welfare which were absolutely necessary—payments to mothers, in the first instance, going back 100 years or so; along the way, through Medicare and our occupational superannuation system; and, as we go forward, the NDIS. There are many other initiatives that the Labor Party has taken which form part of the fabric of the safety net we have in this country that has been so effective in the past in ensuring that the benefits of economic growth do flow through to those people that really need it. 


It is of continuing concern to me that, despite the fact that many credible economists identify this as one of the reasons why Australia does have this relatively low level of inequality, we continue to see from the other side of politics continued attacks on these institutions and concepts. Really, if there is one area that should have bipartisan support, it is buttressing the institutions which prevent levels of inequality such as we see in the United States. I call on colleagues opposite to get on board with that. 


The tide is turning and there is a need for us to adjust our thinking, out of the Thatcherite and Reaganist era, if we are going to lift economic growth out of the doldrums it is currently in. Although we have had a sustained period of economic growth, and there are a number of reasons for that, it is low growth and it is growth that is not flowing through in benefits to low-income workers. When we talk about this safety net, we are also talking about the trade union movement, as it is an integral part of it. We should get our heads out of the Thatcherite and Reaganist era, when there was a hard Right attack on the union movement because they interfered with the free market. That type of thinking, trickle-down economics, should be confined to the dustbin of history, and we should be adopting a more enlightened approach, one that is more in line with the facts and with the empirical evidence. 


It is not just Labor saying this. For example, the International Monetary Fund has made the comment and has actually quantified the extent to which inequality is an inhibitor of economic growth. So as a former trade union official I join with Senator Cameron in saying that, rather than continuously attacking the trade union movement—which is at a low ebb at the moment, and we should be frank about that; levels of union membership in this country are quite low, historically speaking, and I would put that down to the fact that there is a lot of emphasis given to sensationalist media reporting—it should be considered, and it is, as I said in my first speech in this place, an integral part of the system of transmitting the proceeds and the benefits of economic growth through to ordinary working people. That is where I stand and that is what I support.


As I said, while we do not have those extremes of inequality that we see in other countries, we are below the OECD average, and the Gini coefficient, which is a well-respected metric in this area. Whereas the OECD average is 0.32, Australia's is 0.33. We are not doing as well as we should and as well as we have done in the past. We know that 2½ million Australians live below the poverty line. I have indicated that inequality is a drag on economic growth and a destabilising force in society. I have touched on that point. The OECD has estimated that from 1985 to 2005 inequality reduced growth among member states by almost 5 per cent. That is an extraordinary figure. The IMF's chief, Christine Lagarde, has warned leaders as the World Economic Forum recently that economic growth can only be sustained if it is equitable. It comes back to the need for an institution like the Productivity Commission to focus on this particular issue. I started by talking about the penalty rates decision, which I think is the most egregious example of the Productivity Commission looking at a set of facts and coming up with a conclusion that is unhelpful to our economy and our society. We know that the McKell Institute has done work in respect of what happens when you cut penalty rates. They have identified that the retail and hospitality trade is a particularly important trade for rural Australia. We know that the retail trade, as far as the workforce was concerned, was 11 per cent in the 2011 survey, and we had accommodation and food services at seven per cent. That is a significant part of the rural workforce. 


We know that when you cut penalty rates, you take that spending power that exists in those regional communities out of regional communities and repatriate it back to the head offices of companies, so that that money is used someone else rather than in the local community. We know that regional and rural communities are already struggling, so we are going to see significant impacts from 1 July. When we should be doing all that we can to support our regional communities and we see this coming forward, this is going to be a devastating new impact on regional communities.


We should do a number of things when talking about inequality. We should establish measures for economic inequality. We should be looking at things like geography, gender and age in respect of inequality. We know that governments do not work effectively if they cannot measure and quantify the problem so we can prioritise our efforts in dealing with these types of issues in a policy setting. Unless you do that sort of thing, the community remains unaware of the extent to which inequality is connected to social and other outcomes.


This is a significant concern for me as a Labor politician. I want to highlight the concern that I have in respect of cuts to penalty rates and the impact that that is going to have on future economic growth. We know that households are under extraordinary pressure at the moment. There are 700,000 households across Australia that are going to be directly impacted by the penalty rate cut. Albeit the cuts will be phased in over a period of time, the failure of people's incomes to keep up with other increasing prices is going to be a significant problem for economic growth into the future. It will make it so much harder.


Of course, we also know that households are suffering under a huge amount of debt. Australia is something like third in the world when it comes to household debt as a percentage of GDP, which I think is something in the order of 125 per cent. That is already causing the consumer side of our economy to languish. If we want to see people loosening up their purses and wallets to spend in the economy, we need to provide better wage growth for them. That can only be done if we have lower levels of inequality, so that people can start to enjoy the benefits of economic growth. If we do not do that, it is a very serious issue. We do not want to see the instability in our society that we have seen across the world. Australia has a great track record but it is under pressure, and measures such as those in the bill will go some way to addressing that concern. (Time expired)

"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2017-06-22,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (11:51):  The Productivity Commission Amendment bill 2017 amends the Productivity Commission Act 1998 to expand the general policy guidelines for the exercise of the Productivity Commission's functions to include consideration of inequality, and establishes a framework for the Productivity Commission to regularly report on economic inequality.


The purpose of this bill is to improve the quality of information and analysis available about economic inequality in Australia and to ensure that proper consideration is given to inequality in the public debate about economic policy. We firstly compliment Senator McAllister and the ALP for putting forward this bill, even if we have some reservations, as expressed quite well by Senator Leyonhjelm.


I will firstly discuss inequality. Inequality of wealth is an important economic phenomenon that should be properly and independently measured and analysed; however, it is a result, not a cause. A significant level of inequality is not in itself an economic issue. It is whether someone has sufficient and growing wealth to pay the bills, not whether someone else has even more sufficient and growing wealth. So, provided this is used correctly, and not politically for pushing a philosophy, it will be a valuable addition to the debate in this country.


Inequality only makes economic sense as one possible indicator that something may be askew with the levels and trend of real net wealth. Real net wealth is driven not by inequality but by factors such as real income and wages versus the real cost of living. The latter, cost of living, is partially and imperfectly measured by the CPI, which nevertheless clearly shows why poor and middle-class Aussies continue to struggle. The poor in fact get hammered by regulations, which seem to be the solution to many of the problems or challenges that the ALP see. The ALP, along with their Greens allies, quite often put forward an increase in regulation. Regulations bring with them an increase in cost, a decrease in quality and a decrease in production, which hurt the poor most of all. Regulations are an indiscriminate and regressive impost on the poor.


The Productivity Commission has been a bastion of sound economics and common sense for decades. The Productivity Commission will be aware of the primary role that too many government interventions, such as in the form of regulation, tax and money supply, have in reducing real net wealth as possibly indicated by significant levels of inequality. Thus, no government agency is in a better position to be tasked with assessing inequality than is the Productivity Commission.


Inequality can be very difficult to define. Senator Ketter has already attempted to discuss some of those aspects. Is it gender inequality? Is it geographical inequality? Is it inequality of tax? Is it inequality of wealth? As I said, regardless, when it comes to economic considerations, inequality is a result, not a cause.


Senator Ketter raises the question of declining union membership. That is no secret. A lot of people are aware of this. And then he raises the point about penalty rates. It is all too clear that the people who have pushed the decrease in weekend penalty rates, for example, are the very union bosses that have complained no about the Fair Work case result. Some in the media are referring to the Leader of the Opposition as Electricity Bill. That is not something I would do in this chamber, but that highlights two things. That is what people are seeing, and that gets to the heart of Senator Ketter's comments: these are open, everyday things. The penalty rates decision was preceded by the union bosses doing deals with the big end of town to strip penalty rates out of enterprise agreements. The decrease in penalty rates has been led by union bosses.


We then see energy policies—electricity especially. As the famous saying goes, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Some work by our staff indicated that single pensioners pay 11 per cent of their income, which is not discretionary, on energy. It is now a highly regressive tax to increase energy prices, which is at the core of Labor Party policy with its 50 per cent renewable energy target and its now support for the disgraceful Finkel report, which has no sound economic merit at its base.

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2017-06-22,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (09:37):  I rise to speak on the Productivity Commission Amendment (Reducing Inequality) Bill 2017. This bill places inequality firmly on the agenda of one of our country's most influential economic policy institutions. We consider the bill at a time when inequality in Australia is at a 75-year high, and when global leaders are warning that inequality threatens the global economy.


The Productivity Commission is tasked with providing research and policy advice on industry, industry development and productivity. Its scope is broad; it encompasses both specific industries and the productivity performance of the economy as a whole. Its influence is significant. Most people in this chamber could easily identify economic debates in the last 30 years where the commission's intervention has been decisive, and on many of these occasions its advice has, of course, been hotly contested. What is uncontroversial is that its advice has been central to government decision making, and we can no longer afford to allow this advice to be developed insensibly to the significance of economic inequality. The commission is already required to consider a range of considerations—everything from ecological sustainability to regional development is listed in its enabling legislation. Inequality should be on this list.


We can also no longer afford to starve our government of credible, focused research on inequality. The Productivity Commission is well placed to apply its substantial resources to generating just this type of analysis. The bill would require the commission to do just this: tabling an inequality report every five years, aligned with the production of the Intergenerational report. Doing so would bring valuable analysis into a debate that is already raging.


There has been growing discussion of economic inequality in the media and in these corridors in the last 12 months, and it is not just because people have got around to reading a couple more chapters of Thomas Piketty's book. There is a palpable fear that inequality has bred populism in Australia and overseas, and that it threatens the economic consensus that has held sway since the 1990s. Just this week we heard the governor of the Reserve Bank calling on workers to demand higher wages and the head of the Business Council of Australia writing that, rather than being allowed to pool in certain cities or among certain citizens, the business community must ensure that the benefits of growth are felt by all.


I am heartened by those sentiments but, in the flurry of sudden interest, we cannot forget that inequality is not, in fact, new; nor is the imperative to address it. Inequality was important before Brexit and it was important before Trump. Inequality affected ordinary people's lives well before it affected our political systems. Inequality threatened families' security and their stability well before it threatened business's access to global markets. We should not have to look to shock election results to find an imperative to address inequality, because the imperative lies in basic fairness—in families who are working harder for less, sandwiched between one generation that fears it may never be able to afford to buy a house and another generation that fears it may never be able to afford to retire. The imperative has always been there, and I am glad we are starting to get the momentum to address it.


Australians like to think that we are removed from the stark inequality that we see in America and the United Kingdom—and in some ways we are. Income and asset concentration in Australia is a fraction of what it is in the United States. The GFC did not hit us hard, as we entered it with significantly less inequality than other nations and, during the 2000s, Australia's middle incomes grew strongly—unlike other countries in the OECD that experienced slow growth or falling middle incomes. A Labor government responded to the GFC with a strong stimulus that prevented widespread joblessness and the inequality that comes with it. We should be proud of that intervention, but it has not insulated us from the broader trends that have been in play since the 1980s. Over the past four decades incomes for the top 10 per cent have risen nearly four times as fast as they have for the bottom 10 per cent, and this is not just the result of high-income earners being able to negotiate better pay packages. It reflects broad changes in the way our shared prosperity is divided.


During the 1990s wages decoupled from productivity growth, and even though Australian workers are more efficient and productive than ever before they are not being rewarded for it in wages. The labour share of national income in Australia has dropped from 75 per cent in the 1970s to just 53 per cent in 2016. The share for business, on the converse, is increasing. Let us be very, very clear about what this means: it means that investment pays better, much better, than work. But only—and this is critical—for those who can afford to invest. These dynamics are starting to weigh on our social structures and on our economy. Wealth is far more unevenly distributed than income. In 2003 the wealthiest 20 per cent were worth 57 times more than the poorest 20 per cent. Ten years later that figure has risen substantially: they are now worth 71 times more. The three richest Australians own more than the million poorest Australians put together. Today inequality is at a 75-year high. Australia now sits in the bottom half of the OECD's rankings for economic inequality.


We may live in a time of deepening economic inequality; however, it is worth reflecting that for most of our history since Federation we have actually experienced falling levels of inequality. At the start of Federation, we were a very unequal nation. When the Anzacs headed to Gallipoli, inequality was at its peak—one per cent of Australians owned one-third of all wealth and earned one-eighth of all income—but for the next 60-odd years inequality steadily fell, reaching a low point in the 1970s. The point I want to make is this: what happened over those six decades was not an accident, it was not a quirk of trickle-down economics; it was a direct function of the progressives' project to make Australia a fairer place for everyone. The labour movement and its political representatives have fought and won policies that shared Australia's growing prosperity much more fairly over those 120 years, and those policies became part of Australia's social contract. They evolved into institutions that were able to survive changes of government. This social contract drove down inequality in the postwar period and, to the extent that it survived changes in the 1980s and 1990s, it helped Australia avoid the excesses of inequality that we see today in the US and the UK, and there are a few aspects of it I want to briefly touch on, because they go to role of Labor governments in navigating the transformation of our economy to become more open and yet still fundamentally fair.


The first element, of course, is having a targeted welfare net. Between the health care provided by Medicare, and now the NDIS, the payments and the income support available, we seek to protect our poorest from the very worst effects of inequality. We do that very efficiently. The second element is having a progressive taxation system, reflecting the principle that those who earn more can afford to contribute more. The third element is publicly available universal education, a system of public schooling and the wide availability of tertiary education. But perhaps the most important element is our protection for wages and workplace conditions. In 1904, the world's first Labor national government started to put in place systems to manage workplace conciliation and arbitration. The systems developed by the labour movement in those early years were uniquely Australian. It was a solution that shaped dramatically the relationship between the labour movement and the state, and it formed the basis for decades of industrial outcomes that lifted the living conditions of millions of Australians.


But, like so many of the other bulwarks against equality, this has been eroded by continuing conservative calls for deregulation. And it starts to have consequences. Earlier this week, as I mentioned, the Reserve Bank governor said he would like to see workers asking for more pay increases. I agree. But it is not timidity or a lack of ambition that is holding Australian workers back; our industrial relations system has been reshaped to limit the bargaining power of workers in their workplaces. It shows in the level of unionisation today, dropping to only around 10 per cent of the private sector workforce. We need to be careful about this. The Australian social contract lifted living conditions and reduced inequality for Australians for much of the last century, and Labor has been a proud part of that story. But under conservative governments, as welfare payments are cut, workplace protection slashed and penalty rates removed, inequality has started to increase. Australia is the most unequal it has been in 75 years.


There are some people who might say, 'So what?' They say we should be focused on prosperity, not inequality; that as long as the pie is growing, it does not matter if some people are taking bigger and bigger pieces. I do not agree, and neither do most Australians. When surveyed, almost three-quarters of Australians agree that differences in income are too high. Inequality is not just about money; inequality shuts the door to opportunities, and Australians are not happy for wealth to decide the quality of someone's education or their health care. We do not think that your wage should depend on what your parents earned.


What has also become increasingly obvious in recent years is that the dichotomy between prosperity and fairness is false. More equal societies grow more quickly. That is not just wishful thinking from those on the Left. It is the considered view of hard-headed economists in institutions like the IMF. On a microeconomic level inequality creates barriers to people starting a business or going to university or being able to participate fully in the economy. It is a drag on growth. More broadly, income inequality affects the way an economy operates. Increasing the pay of low- and average-income earners boosts growth more, much more, than increasing the return to the well-off. These households spend more of their extra incomes, stimulating the economy. The OECD estimated that income inequality between 1985 and 2005 reduced economic growth among its member states by almost five per cent. As the head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, explained: the benefits of higher incomes are trickling up not down.


Why this bill then? Whatever excuses there may once have been for ignoring economic inequality, they have dropped away. All the signs demand action: economics, political pragmatism, not to mention basic fairness. I do want to be clear that I do not believe that passing this bill will solve inequality. We need concerted action to level access to education, to strengthen workplace rights, to make our tax system more progressive and to make our welfare system fairer and stronger. This bill does not tackle those specifics. Instead, it is a step in building the policy infrastructure to make sure we do these things. It aims to fire up the Public Service institutions and to build the expertise that we need to look at inequality and properly address it. It aims to build a wealth of expertise and knowledge within an eminent public policy institution through establishing a requirement for a five-yearly inequality report produced by the Productivity Commission. It seeks to use that capability to bring these issues before the parliament regularly for our consideration and response.


I am from the political Left, and I am conscious that over the years there have been regular calls from within that tradition to dismantle the Productivity Commission. I understand the hesitation that some may have in tasking it instead to look at economic inequality. My own view is that nearly always we are best to build on and transform the institutions we already have.


Australia has a proud tradition of innovative public mechanisms to deliver on public policy. Medicare remains an extraordinary achievement. Globally, our superannuation system is much admired. We have also proven skilful at recasting older institutions to meet new challenges. In the 1980s and the 1990s under Labor, we transformed Australia's political and economic institutions to respond to a more open world. To provide just one example, the Reserve Bank's role changed profoundly in the eighties, reorienting its activities to deliver effective monetary policy in a newly opened financial system.


Today we need to retool all our institutions once more to address the challenge of our times: the growing disparity in wealth and income. The Productivity Commission has changed direction and purpose before, and it will have to again. From the Tariff Board of the twenties through to the Industry Assistance Commission of the seventies up until its present form, this institution has been repurposed to respond to contemporary policy imperatives. But, institutions matter. They have a rhythm of their own and they develop momentum that survives changes of government.


The great Nugget Coombs, arguably one of our most celebrated public servants, understood this. He played an incredible role shaping the institutions of the postwar period. Reflecting on that he said, 'I was not a fan of revolution.' He said there is:


… only reform—the creation of new institutions, the recasting of those already existing, the revitalisation of the moral and social imperatives which lend them vigour.


This bill seeks to ensure that the Productivity Commission is alive to one of the most significant moral and social imperatives of today: economic inequality.

Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (09:55):  I listened with great interest to the contribution from Senator McAllister, my valued colleague on the Finance and Public Administration Committee. It was thoughtful and measured, as her contributions typically are. But I was listening very carefully for one particular point in her speech, which did not come, and it is an important one in the debate about inequality. The particular question that advocates of action on inequality must answer is: how much inequality is too much inequality and how much inequality is an acceptable level of inequality? That might sound like a strange thing to ask. One might assume, if one agrees that inequality is a terrible thing, which most people do, that there should be no inequality. But if there were no inequality then that would mean complete equality of outcomes, and I do not think anyone in this chamber advocates that. I do not think Senator McAllister advocates that. I do not think Senator Whish-Wilson, who I understand is speaking next, advocates that; although perhaps his colleague Senator Rhiannon would advocate that. I do not know how much her thinking has evolved on these issues.


It is an important question to answer, because if we agree that complete equality is not a good idea and that complete inequality is not a good idea, where do we draw the line between complete equality and complete inequality as to an acceptable level of inequality? I have not yet heard in this debate, nor in dozens of debates on this issue by economists, academics and others who take an interest, anyone nominate an acceptable or tolerable level of inequality. I think that is an important thing to nominate, because if we are seeking to address a problem then we have to know how to define it in an empirical way, know when we are making progress on it and know when we are falling behind. I look forward to later contributions in this debate and seeing whether anyone will rise to that challenge.


Inequality is a problem and is something which government has a role to tackle in some ways, but it is a much less serious problem than poverty. Poverty is something which demands much greater attention from all of us than inequality. I make that point very deliberately and will expand on it. Many of the measures of inequality and poverty sometimes are deliberately or perhaps accidentally confused. Senator McAllister in her contribution referred to a number of facts and figures about how the top 10 people in Australia have more wealth than the bottom 50 per cent. All these sorts of figures get thrown around in this debate in Australia and also internationally. They typically come from reports which are deeply flawed and which overlook the much more important human imperative, which is to abolish poverty and to lift people out of poverty. Sometimes lifting people out of poverty and reducing inequality are in fact competing and contrasting imperatives that do not always move in the same direction at the same time. There is a specific example I will come to later.


One of the reports that purports to be about poverty is an annual report produced by ACOSS, the Australian Council of Social Service. It purports to measure of poverty in Australia, but what it in fact measures is inequality. It defines poverty as anyone being below 50 per cent of the average wage. If you define poverty as a proportion of the average wage then it does not matter how much the average wage increases: you will never eradicate poverty. That is a disturbing thing, because we know that poverty has been largely or substantially eradicated in the wealthy Western world and we have made great gains towards eradicating it around the world, particularly in the latter half of the 20th century.


Oxfam International annually publishes another report on inequality, which advocates often rely upon. It sometimes has seemingly alarming statistics about the top five wealthiest people in the world and their share of global wealth compared to the bottom half of the population, but it has some fundamental flaws. One of the flaws is that it accepts as a premise that capturing someone's wealth at a single point in time is a good proxy or a good measure for their standard of living. But we know that that is not the case. It is often a very bad measure of their standard of living and within the Oxfam report we have a very good example of why that is the case. When measuring someone's wealth, for the purposes of comparing them for inequality, they of course take into account, as may be appropriate, any debts that a person may hold. Obviously, a person who has debts—particularly a young person who is perhaps a university student—has the potential to have negative wealth. So a young Australian university student or a university student at Harvard will be measured by Oxfam as having negative wealth.


In many parts of the world you cannot get a loan. In the developing world it is sometimes very difficult to get a loan. So a subsistence farmer in Africa may not have any debts, they may even have a few assets to their name. Maybe, for the purposes of Oxfam's inequality report, they may be listed as having small net positive assets, even if only a few hundred dollars. If you listen to Oxfam and you take them at their word, a privileged student in the Western world studying at university who has a HECS debt is poorer than a subsistence farmer in sub-Saharan Africa. That highlights I think very powerfully the lack of quality research in this area and the way in which statistics can be abused to give you a very misleading impression. If you took Oxfam at their word, you would believe that a substantial number of those people who are suffering severe inequality are in fact in the Western world when clearly the reverse is the case—by any standard we are the wealthiest people in the world. 


If we really care about poverty and poverty is what we seek to alleviate then economic growth is the best way to do that. Sometimes economic growth does come at the cost of inequality. The best example of this is the economic growth that China has experienced over the last 40 years. It has been, in my view, one of the most positive developments of the second half of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st century. Over 600 million people have been lifted above the poverty line—the absolute measure of poverty. Their lives have been transformed in a fundamental and wonderful way. People who did not have access to electricity now have access to electricity. People who did not have access to refrigeration now have access to refrigeration. People who did not have access to education now have access to education. The standard of their food, clothing and technology has improved in a profound way. While this magnificent reduction in poverty has taken place within China in the span of 40 years—one of the greatest reductions in human poverty in history—inequality has increased.


If you listen to those opposite and their concerns about inequality, and if you read Thomas Piketty, then you would think that inequality must be fought at all costs. I understand where they are coming from and it is a good place to come from—inequality on its own, as a premise, sounds like a bad thing. But what do you think the people in China who have been lifted out of poverty would have rathered? Would they have rather been lifted out of poverty as they have been while, at the same time, some people in China have accumulated great wealth—billions of dollars of wealth—or would they have rather stayed, as they were for most of their history, in real poverty? I think, if I was someone living in China and I could choose to remain in my station in life, in relative poverty, in order to keep others in poverty at the same time so that we could be relatively equal, or I could choose that my wealth would increase modestly and my living standards would increase modestly while others' standards of living increased spectacularly—far more than mine—I would accept the latter. I would accept an increase in inequality for me and for my society in order to have a decrease in poverty. Poverty is a far more important thing to fight than inequality. 


I think we had a really wonderful contribution to this debate, in a general way, in the maiden speech last night by Senator Gichuhi from South Australia. She spoke very powerfully of her own journey from Kenya to Australia and about her experience of the welfare state in Australia and the effect it had on her and her family. The observations she made were very powerful. I think we should always bear in mind, as Senator Gichuhi said, that the best path out of poverty is employment and jobs. That has been and always will be a priority of my side politics and of this government.


Finally I want to turn to the Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017 itself, which was proposed by Senator McAllister. While I, like her, respect the Productivity Commission as an important institution and, I like her, respect its work, it is for that reason that I am concerned about this specific proposal. I think it seeks to politicise the Productivity Commission in an inappropriate way. As Senator McAllister admitted, she is the person of the Left and she wants to see the Productivity Commission produce reports that align with, and address, her political priorities.


I do not think that is an appropriate thing to do with an independent economic agency like the Productivity Commission, which has provided such important reports and advice to government. I think it is best that, as far as possible, it be kept at arm's length from government and not dictated to by the politics of the day, so that it has the greatest potential to provide independent, dispassionate advice to the government. I think it is unwise to try and seek to direct the Productivity Commission to address the political priorities or philosophy of any party in this place. There are certainly changes we could make to the Productivity Commission's charter to address the priorities and concerns that I might have and ensure that the Productivity Commission's reports in the future more closely match the political priorities I have; but I recognise that I am a member of a political party and that I have my own views and preconceptions, and it would not be a good idea to ask the Productivity Commission to take those on and reflect those. 


I appreciate the concern of Senator McAllister and all senators in this place about inequality. But I would finish on the note that, while inequality can be and is important, poverty is far more important. If we ever have to choose between the two, as some people have, including in China, the best one to choose is to alleviate poverty. The best way to alleviate poverty is through free markets and economic freedom. Every country that has gone from relative poverty to relative prosperity has gone through a period of inequality as a result. It is the advanced capitalist countries of the world, like Australia, that are relatively equal by world standards, and it is through a state of far reaching and complete capitalism that inequality is best tackled, rather than through government intervention.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2017-06-22,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (10:07):  I commend Senator McAllister for bringing forward the Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017. The Greens would support, in principle, any enhancement or refocusing of our attention on what is arguably one of the greatest issues of our time. My party talks a lot about climate change. But economic inequality, while it is tied to issues like poverty, as Senator Patterson outlined, and issues like climate change, is all-encompassing and one of the biggest challenges that we face—and not just here in Australia but right around the world. What we can do here is put a lens over every piece of legislation we look at and ask ourselves: is it making economic inequality worse in this country? When we deal with foreign aid or participate in overseas conflicts, international treaties and international trade deals, we should ask ourselves: are we making inequality worse around the world? These are the questions we should ask ourselves every chance we get.


Having said that, I have spent nearly every round of estimates since I became a senator asking the same question to our agencies here in Australia, especially to Treasury officials: what holistic approach do you take to tackle the issue of economic inequality in Australia? The answers have always been a source of disappointment. Whether it is the Reserve Bank, focusing on inflation and interest rate targets, and everything else will fall into place, or APRA focusing on financial stability, or ASIC investigating matters in relation to the Corporations Act—the one thread that is missing is a holistic approach to one of the greatest challenges of our time.


Whether the Productivity Commission itself is the right body—and I am happy to be advised on that, and on what kinds of legislative implications that might have—I would be interested to hear more and I would certainly be interested to hear from the Productivity Commission itself about this amendment. It is independent—fiercely independent. It has produced some good work. I do not say that lightly. We do not always agree with some of its recommendations; nevertheless, we respect the fact that it should be independent.


Recently I met with the economics committee, with the Reserve Bank governor, in a private meeting. I will not go into any details of that private meeting. The Reserve Bank governor in Australia has been playing a very interesting role in public debate. He has been commenting on issues like economic inequality, lack of infrastructure spending, housing risks, and pressures to the financial system. He sees himself as having an interesting role in at least informing public debate. That is probably the closest thing I could say. And of course the Reserve Bank produces occasional papers which allow them to do research projects. So, the governor has played a very important role; nevertheless, I would like to see a much more holistic approach to this issue in Australia.


So who does tie together the threads on economic inequality in Australia? It is left to the not-for-profit sector or the private sector, and here I have an excellent report called Inequality in Australia 2015—which I am not using as a prop; I am just having a look at it. It is produced by ACOSS, who tie together the threads and do their own research. It is very well respected. While these kinds of things are critical for the public debate—and I am about to summarise some of the key findings in a minute—it would be good to see the government taking a holistic policy approach to economic inequality.


What we often overlook when we think about economic inequality is that it is very closely tied to the politics we are seeing around the world at the moment—the backlash we saw in the US, which allowed Donald Trump to get elected. Many commentators have, I think rightly, pointed out that one of the key underlying reasons he was elected was that there was discontent related directly to economic inequality in the US—not poverty, as Senator Paterson alluded to as the critical problem, but economic inequality. And with Brexit— the reaction we saw in the UK—it was economic inequality. I would say— and I know you would be very interested in this, Acting Deputy President Bernardi—that the outcome of the recent UK elections, with the rise of Jeremy Corbyn, is another sign that economic inequality is being taken very seriously by voters and citizens, who have a considerable amount of frustration.


We have seen all these issues rise to the surface following the GFC, during which the financial system around the world was shaken up. We are seeing retaliation against globalism building all around the world, including I suppose Mr Trump himself, reflecting the views of his voters—cancelling the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement and other policy initiatives. And we are seeing it in this country. Let's not hide our head in the sand; economic inequality is a very significant issue here, and I will go through some statistics in a minute. Obviously it is not anywhere near what we are seeing in other countries. Nevertheless, it is an issue that should be addressed. In fact, I might go to some of those issues right now, because they tell a very important story and paint a very stark picture of how we should be responding to these issues in the legislation and the policies we look at in this place.


Inequality in Australia is higher than the OECD average, which I think is a recommendation and a conclusion that people would be surprised by. A person in Australia who is in the top 25 per cent income group has around five times as much income as someone who is in the bottom 20 per cent. Strong employment growth over the past 17 years has helped to reduce inequality, and I think Senator McAllister alluded to this, as those at the bottom end of the income distribution had greater access to the workforce and more workforce related hours. However, wages growth was very unequal over the period and acted to increase inequality. Over the 25 years to 2010 real wages increased by 50 per cent on average but by 14 per cent for those in the bottom 10 per cent of workers, compared with 72 per cent increases for those in the top 10 per cent of income earners in this country. In other words, the wealthier you are—the more money you earn—the better you have done over this period.


When we look at an average of 50 per cent increase across the board, let's break that down: if you are poor in this country, or a low-income earner, you have hardly any of that 50 per cent increase. That is nearly all gone to the top 10 per cent income earners in this country. It is no wonder the Reserve Bank governor this week, once again contributing to public debate, has called on workers to stand up for their wage increases. And I will acknowledge Senator McAllister and her colleagues, who have been in the Productivity Commission estimates and have continually raised this issue around penalty rates and cuts to penalty rates and why these things were not considered by an institution such as the Productivity Commission in relation to inequality—what kinds of impacts that is going to have on the economy—because it is actually an accepted fact that economic inequality, particularly when it becomes more acute, is a drag on economic growth and the economy. That is why wage rises themselves can be very useful for stimulating economic activity, because of course with the circular flow of income that money, that pay, gets reinvested back into the economy.


Increases in investment income, for those at the very top of the distribution, increase inequality, with investment income for the top 10 per cent doubling between 2004 and 2010. This increase is responsible for most of the increase in inequality over this period, despite forming only a small component of income. Looking at the demographics of this, people who are more likely to be found in the bottom of the income distribution are those over 65, sole parents, people from non-English-speaking countries and those reliant on government benefits as their main source of income. And may I say that since I have been in the Senate—for five years—they have been the target of policy in this place, especially by the Liberal government, to raise revenue to balance budgets. The most vulnerable people in this country have been targeted.


Remember the zombie budget cuts of 2013, and how the Greens and mostly Labor and other people in this place stood up to Joe Hockey's and Mr Tony Abbott's cruel budget? That is taking action on inequality; that is running the inequality lens over every piece of legislation that we consider in this place. So, why is it that these demographics are clear yet have been the target of our economic policy and legislation in this place? It is exactly the opposite of what we should be doing. And I want to see more of what we saw in this chamber this week: taking $6 billion off the big banks—$6 billion of tax that will pay for schools and hospitals from some of the wealthiest companies in the world. People who are more likely to be found in the bottom income distributions are the ones at whom we should be targeting our policies towards tackling inequality.


Income is not evenly distributed across the states and territories. We all know that. For example, people in my home state of Tasmania are more likely to be in the bottom 20 per cent, whereas people in Western Australia are more likely to be in the top 20 per cent. So, why do Western Australian senators come in here, Senator Bushby—through you, Chair—and ask for more money from my state of Tasmania, when we have a GST system in this country, horizontal fiscal equalisation, that is designed to transfer wealth from the wealthier states to help the poorer states? We are a federation. That is what this was set up to do. There are those states that, through an accident of geography, for example, do not find themselves sitting on some of the biggest mineral deposits in the world, but those states that do should be sharing that income with other states. Yet we constantly hear in this place that Western Australia should be getting more money and Tasmania should be getting less.


Let's talk about the distribution of wealth in Australia today. Wealth is far more unequally distributed than income—that is the really bad news. The average wealth of a household in the top 20 per cent wealth group in Australia, so the top 20 per cent of richest people in this country, is around 70 times the average wealth of a household in the bottom 20 per cent in this country—70 times. Who wants to get a jelly bean for guessing what the key reason for that is? I will tell you: it nearly all comes down to land prices and real estate. The top 10 per cent of households own 45 per cent of all the wealth in this country, so the richest 10 per cent of Australians own nearly half of the wealth in this country. Most of the remaining wealth is owned by the next 50 per cent of households, while the bottom 40 per cent of households—get this—nearly the bottom half of households in Australia own just five per cent of this country's wealth.


Home ownership is the particular asset I just referred to. Australia is one of the most concentrated places in the world for home ownership. Let me tell you why: the group with the top 20 per cent of wealth distribution owns over 80 per cent of all wealth in investment properties, and shares over 60 per cent of all superannuation wealth. Wealth held in the home is relatively evenly distributed across income groups, largely due to the high levels of home ownership of older retirees, who are more likely to be in low-income groups. One positive is that wealth inequality has declined since the global financial crisis because, obviously, we have seen a fall in asset prices, particularly in financial markets. That has now recovered, but it has increased over the longer term, Senator Seselja, between 2004 and 2012.


These statistics are stark, so why wouldn't a logical, rational person—a senator in this place who is fortunate enough and privileged enough to not only have the pedestal to raise these issues in debates like this today, but to put up legislation, as Senator McAllister has, that could try and hone our focus on tackling these issues—do just that? Why aren't we doing that? What kind of legislation should we be looking at? In my last few minutes I would say that, given these very black-and-white statistics on wealth ownership in this country, why do we still have perverse incentives that give property investors the opportunity to corner the housing market? That, by the way, is not just increasing economic inequality in this country, but is adding very severe risks to our financial system that have been recognised by international investors and, very recently, by the ratings agencies, who have basically said that we are close to a crisis in the housing market.


Why don't we kill two birds with one stone and remove these investment incentives—these perverse incentives like negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions? They are taking revenue out of the tax system that could be used to pay for schools, hospitals, pensions for retiring people and unemployment benefits, social safety nets and health care. That money is contributing to inequality and instability in our financial system. It is an absolute no-brainer, but no-one has the political courage in this place to tackle this. We have been banging on about this for nearly 10 years. Labor has a version of a policy to at least ratchet back some of those investment incentives, but we should actually remove them. Then we will have tens of billions of dollars that we can allocate to where it is most needed.


What other things could we be doing? We could be taking government money—debt, long-term capital issuances are at record low interest rates—and investing in the future of this country. The government could be playing an active role in our life by investing in productive infrastructure that would also tackle economic inequality, create jobs and growth—if I can use that term, as much as it makes me cringe—and, of course, reduce housing bubbles. The Reserve Bank governor has also said that investing in long-term infrastructure, especially public transport, is one of the best ways to reduce housing inequality in this country.


What else could we do? We could invest money in a federal housing trust to build accommodation for the many homeless in this country and those who cannot afford their own home. My colleagues Senator Rhiannon and Senator Ludlam over the years have done some fantastic work in setting up what a federal housing trust would look like. We have nearly half a million people in this country who cannot afford to buy a home. Where is the role of government? Where is the provision of low-income housing that we see in overseas countries, especially in Europe? It is almost non-existent. There is so much we could do; there are so many positive, proactive things I could talk about here today to reduce inequality. But, to go back to Senator McAllister's bill, unless we focus on economic inequality we are never going to fix it. We are always going to be burying our head in the sand. We are always going to be dealing with the short-term political issues of the day—which leadership struggle gets the most eyeballs on social media, in the papers or on TV sets? It is personality politics. 


We are fortunate and privileged in this place to be able to tackle these issues. Other governments around the world are moving to tackle these issues—and they are not just economic issues or social issues. I would argue that economic inequality is one of the biggest sources of political instability around the world. I have read Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century. It is difficult reading—I must confess that it took me a long time to read it, but I did finish it. There is a lot of empirical data there, and the conclusions are stark: we are entering a period of unprecedented economic inequality all around the world and it is creating political instability. We owe it to our democracy, which is the best system we have, to tackle this issue because it is, all around the world, undermining our democratic institutions. People are fed up. They do not believe in trickle-down economics. It has failed. The neoliberal experiment has failed. We need to find a new business model that looks after people and puts people before profit and has an increased role of government in our lives. That is what the Greens propose.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2017-06-22,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia—Deputy President and Chair of Committees) (10:27):  I want to put on the record comments that take a perspective different from the remarks of Senator Whish-Wilson. I am a WA Labor senator and I have spoken in this place about the need for Western Australia to receive more GST but never have I suggested, for a minute, that it should be at the expense of Tasmania. I do not think any Labor senator or MP in the other place has suggested that. We want to see a fairer distribution—we have never suggested taking from one state or territory and giving to another. I do remind the Greens party that poverty exists across this country, and to somehow claim that Tasmania has a greater need than Western Australia is to ignore the state of poverty in Australia and indeed in my home state. 


The other point I would make, and this Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill goes some way to addressing it, is that Senator Whish-Wilson said that somehow the Greens have been banging on about this for 10 years. That is the problem—we have had words but not actions. I do remind senators in this place, and particularly the Greens senators, that it is Labor that has put in place a whole range of reforms—superannuation, Medicare, parental leave. We had policies in government that did tackle homelessness and affordable housing. We had a bill in the other place, which the government knocked off, to try to protect penalty rates. We have put those actions in place but sadly they have not gone far enough. Also, every time the conservatives come into power, whether as state governments or federal governments, we see the situation eroded. This bill says let us start tackling and reporting on economic inequality. That is at least a start.


Recently I attended the Women's Forum in New York, which looked at women's economic empowerment across the world. It is shocking—wherever you look across the world, Australia is no different. We might be a little better off than our sisters in some Third World countries, but, nevertheless, women are not treated equally in this country—despite the reforms that Labor governments have put in place. And, certainly, that equality is absolutely under attack from the Turnbull government. It has been under attack since the day that they were elected. 


With issues such as penalty rates, who on earth thinks that penalty rates will somehow magically lead to greater employment? It is an absolute nonsense. It takes pay out of the pockets of, particularly, low-paid workers—of women workers. We know that in Australia we have one of the most highly gender segregated workforces in the world. Men work in traditional male occupations; women are clustered in low-paid jobs and they rely on penalty rates. Yet, the Turnbull government, come 1 July, are going to take money out of the pockets of those women. It is an absolute disgrace and, quite frankly, I cannot believe that they think it is somehow going to create more employment. Of course it will not. So we will see women who work in hospitality and retail, come 1 July, get less money in their pay packets to support their families, to go to university or to do whatever else they rely on. The reason women and men work on weekends is to supplement low income. I do not get which bit of that those opposite just cannot understand. It is an absolute disgrace that on 1 July we will see people in this country lose income, and they will do so at the hands of the Turnbull government. I will never let the Turnbull government forget that. Labor has said that we will address this. We will put it back. We will make the changes to the Fair Work Commission to make sure that low-paid workers cannot be attacked by the Turnbull government. 


On 1 July what else will happen? Millionaires will get a tax cut. On the very day the Turnbull government is taking money out of the pockets of low-paid workers—particularly women stuck in those areas of low pay—they will be giving their millionaire mates a tax cut. What a disgrace. They still believe, in this day and age, that somehow this trickle down will work. It will not. In the same way as when they cut superannuation, they refused to pass on the next percentage increase. That damages long-term retirement incomes, but they boasted that somehow that would create employment. Well, it has not, because we have seen record unemployment under the Abbott and Turnbull regime as prime ministers of this country. That is actually what we have seen. And the jobs that have been created are low-paid jobs, casual jobs—jobs in areas where workers will lose penalty rates. So this bill will actually start to hold up a light. It will start to say, 'We need to report on inequality in this country.' That would be a first step.


Using the Productivity Commission will take the political spin out of it. It will look at the impacts of inequality on the Australian economy, and it will produce a report—like Closing the Gap—that we will have to address as lawmakers in this country. We did see evidence during the inquiry—I was fortunate enough to be able to attend one of the hearings in Sydney—that inequality is stark, particularly for women. Women around this country, quite frankly, are a bit sick of just keeping on talking about it. We have known this for a very long time. We know we have a highly gender segregated workforce. Yet, despite some effort, we are not getting women into those STEM areas. We really need to do much more than we are currently doing to encourage the break-up of the gender segregation that we see. On the other side, in the caring industries and in retail and hospitality, men are never going to work in those industries in large numbers. Why? Because the pay is appalling. It is poverty wages.


For an educator working in the early education field, it is one of the most important jobs you could do in our society, because we know that for young children the vast majority of brain development happens between one and three years of age. What are we paying those workers? We are paying them poverty wages—about $21 an hour. That is what we are paying low-paid educators. Those wages are so bad. In an industry predominantly funded—almost 100 per cent—by those opposite in the federal government, the wages remain at poverty levels. It is not that educators do not love their jobs. It is incredibly rewarding working with young children, particularly young children between the ages of one and five. But they are forced out because they cannot afford to stay, or, alternatively, they are working two and three other jobs and that means that when they come to work in the morning to work with young Australians—our future leaders—they are tired and that automatically puts them at a disadvantage. But if they want to stay in the job that they love they have to work elsewhere, or they have to rely on another wage in their family. That is disgraceful.


At the other end of the spectrum we have aged care workers who, again, care for some of the most vulnerable in our society—senior Australians who have worked and have contributed to our economy, have paid their taxes, have raised families, have built homes and have led decent lives. Yet, at the end of their lives they are cared for by workers who are very low paid and part-time, who also have to work at least one other job to make ends meet. What is the key feature of these two sectors? Women. Women are clustered in aged care and early childhood, and an aged care worker earns about the same as an early childhood worker—about $21 an hour—but they rely on penalty rates, because the caring industry is seven days a week, 24 hours a day. But you can bet your bottom dollar that now that the Turnbull government has simply closed its eyes to the attack on penalty rates in retail and hospitality they will come for the aged care workers—the first they came for. We all know that sequence of events.


But it will not stop at hospitality and retail. What we have seen from the Turnbull government is that they are doing nothing to stop the attack on workers wages. In fact, many in the Turnbull government applaud the loss of penalty rates. They think it is a good thing for our economy. What is less money in our economy a good thing? Why is taking money out of the pay of low-paid workers a good thing? Why is giving someone less money to spend each fortnight when they get their pay packet good for our economy? No-one believes that. But somehow those opposite in the Turnbull government think there is going to be this magic proliferation of jobs.


Even if there were more jobs created as a result of this—I do not believe that, but let us assume for a minute that we will create a few more jobs—what will they be? More low-paying jobs—not good for our economy, not good for our tax system, and not good for individuals' prosperity. Yet, those opposite will champion it.


So, education and early childhood education—low-paid workers—women; aged care workers—low-paid women. Than there is the disability sector. How proud am I to be a Labor senator and to have been part of the government that introduced the NDIS? It is a revolutionary reform. Like Medicare, it will become a very important part of our economy. The NDIS is there. From the work that Labor did, we know that we need a massive increase in the workforce into the future.


What are the key features of the disability services sector? Low pay, and guess what the gender is—female. It is a feminised, low-paid workforce. Yet those opposite have done absolutely nothing to address the needs of that workforce into the future. You cannot have choice and control, which is a key part of the NDIS, if you do not have the workforce to match. We will not be able to attract the workforce we need unless we do something about the pay. Again, we see that those workers are on about $21 an hour. They want to look after and support people with disability to be able to manage in their own homes. They do an incredible job and they are unsung heroes, as are early childhood educators and aged care workers. But there will be a shortage into the future if we do not act on the pay. I think that those opposite think that the answer to that is to just import workers. Of course that contributes noting to our economy either.


So not only do we have to encourage women into STEM areas and traditional male areas of our workforce; we need to fix the pay and working conditions in low-paid areas so that we attract a different workforce. We want diversity in our workforce. We recognise that male workers bring a different perspective to these sectors, particularly early childhood workers. We want to encourage males in, but we will never get them unless we address this shocking poverty pay that exists in these areas. So having Senator McAllister's bill here, which is going to force us to report on a whole raft of things in relation to social injustice and economic inequality in our country, is a really positive issue. 


The other issue we have to address as a society, as a community and as legislators is that we really have to start speaking about the unpaid work that women do. We know that, despite many men being much more enlightened than perhaps my father and men that went before him, we do need to share the family work that is traditionally done by women, because that prohibits women from going out and finding higher-paid jobs. If you have to be there to do school pick-up or to care for an aged parent, you cannot take a job that requires you to work from 3 pm to 5 pm. You are prohibited from doing that. We know that in our country the unpaid work is traditionally still done by women. We need to start to talk about that. 


But of course we have a government that is characterised by those famous comments by former Prime Minister Abbott, when he talked to the women who apparently do all the ironing in the country. If you have MPs and senators opposite with a view that somehow it is our normal destiny as women to take on this unpaid caring role, we are in trouble. It is time that we started to challenge that and to measure the sorts of unpaid work that women do in our community and really start to change that. For that to happen we need flexible workplaces. We need to actively encourage men to take time to care for children, to take days off when their children are sick, to take time to go to school assemblies and all of the things that traditionally in our community we rely on women to do. We need our workplaces to be much more flexible to the needs of men when they have family commitments. 


This is not some utopian socialist dream. This is actually good for our economy. It is good for our economy when we have workforce flexibility for men and women, when we encourage employers and hold up private employers to role model where flexible work actually works, where men are taking a share of what happens in family life. Until we start to address the unpaid work done by women, we will still be talking about inequality in 20 years. It is a major impediment to women fully participating in the workforce.


Gone are the days in our country when the male worked full time and the woman worked part time. That is no longer acceptable. If that is an arrangement people choose, good on them, but let us make a real choice for men and for women. Across your career in the paid workforce there might be times when both of you work part time and times when both of you full time, and that unpaid component of family life is shared equally between men and women. We are a long way from that, unfortunately, but that is something we need to consider as a community, and to role model best practice when we see it.


At the inquiry the Australian Industry Group talked about barriers for flexible workplace issues, so it is not just the Labor side of politics talking about this, but the Australian Industry Group, too. They indicated to us that flexibility was something most employers wanted to offer to staff and they felt that inflexibility made it very difficult for employers to implement alternative working arrangements for workers who desire or require more-flexible working arrangements. I think all of this in this place and many Australians struggle when our children start school. That is probably a time when it is very hard to manage full-time work and also pick children up from school and make sure they are properly cared for. If we had that flexibility, particularly across the early years, we would create more-productive workplaces.


With regard to the gender pay gap, despite Labor making great inroads on pay inequality in the famous cases that were run in the industrial commissions in this country, wage inequality still exists. It is 16 per cent and has been stubbornly stuck there for 20 years—that is generations of workers—and in my state of Western Australia it has been stubbornly stuck at 24 per cent. These are issues that need urgent attention from the government and indeed this parliament, yet they simply get overlooked. It is not acceptable in this day and age to have such inequity in pay continue on and on without being addressed.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2017-06-22,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:47):  Listening to this debate, and particularly the previous two speakers, with their socialist rhetoric, brings to my mind some maxims that were first mentioned in the 19th century by the philosopher Reverend Bottger, sometimes attributed to Abraham Lincoln and elaborated upon by Winston Churchill. I think it is always important to remind ourselves of those 10 maxims, which are as important and evident now as they were when they were first uttered. I notice some schoolchildren in the gallery. I love to see them here. It is good to see them watching parliament in action in the cause of democracy. They too might be interested in these 10 maxims. I am going to repeat them because they are so germane to the debate we are having today. The first one is: you cannot strengthen the week by weakening the strong. Winston Churchill elaborated on that by saying you cannot make the poor rich by making the rich poorer. You cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift. You cannot help little men by tearing down big men. You cannot lift the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer. You cannot help keep the poor by destroying the pitch. You cannot establish sound security on borrowed money. You cannot further the brotherhood of man by inciting class hatred. You cannot keep out of trouble by spending more than you earn. You cannot build character and courage by destroying men's initiative and independence. And you cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they can and should do for themselves.


Those maxims are self-evident, and they are what made America great, a little before Australia was made great by people following those principles. They are a series of thoughts that I was delighted to hear our newest senator, Senator Gichuhi, mention, not in those words but in the themes that she addressed yesterday in her maiden speech to this chamber. Of course, they are the principles upon which the Liberal Party of Australia is based. It is a tenet of the party that I belong to that you must look after those who are disadvantaged and those who are not as fortunate as we are. Through the majority of the Commonwealth, when we have had Liberal governments, those principles have been put in place.


This Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017 is a private member's bill from a Labor senator, and I congratulate Senator McAllister for bringing forward for debate a sensible policy proposal—not one that I necessarily agree with, but I appreciate the fact that it is an attempt to have a sensible policy discussion in this place and does not, as with many of Senator McAllister's colleagues, simply to make some very base political point or attack members of the Senate who are not members of their party. So I am pleased that this debate is before us. I should point out to Senator McAllister that the Intergenerational report, which she mentioned both in her second reading speech and in the explanatory memorandum, is produced not by the Parliamentary Budget Office, as she said, but by the Treasury. I do not think that error in your second reading speech makes a great deal of difference to the bill before us, but it is important to make sure we all understand these things.


The Labor Party want the Productivity Commission to do another investigation and another report. If you have plenty of money and plenty of time, that is sometimes a useful way to go. Rather than doing reports, investigations or studies, the Turnbull government is actually addressing inequality with policies to boost economic growth that generates greater employment and income for hardworking Australians whilst targeting assistance to those who need it most. Again quoting our newest senator, Senator Gichuhi, yesterday in her first speech, the best form of welfare is a job. The best form of welfare is a job, and that is what our government are attempting to do. 


The previous, Labor speaker, Senator Lines, mentioned that the current government has presided over record unemployment. Clearly, the previous  speaker has not been here long. I am proud to say I have been here 27 years and am currently the longest serving parliamentarian, and I have seen it all before. I happened to be here when, under the Keating Labor government, unemployment across Australia was at almost 13 per cent. Youth unemployment in the Keating years across Australia was upwards of 35 per cent. Yet Labor speakers come in here and try to suggest with non-factual comments that unemployment under this government is at record levels. It clearly is not. I can tell you, though, Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi, that it is at record levels in the city where I have my office, the city of Townsville. We are, regrettably, a state with a Labor government which has done little on the economy. In fact, it has done little on anything. It is adopting the principle that if you do not make a decision and you do not do anything, then you are not going to offend anyone, so your chances of getting re-elected at the next election are better, because you have not put anyone off side. More than that, they have employed another 12,000 public servants, most of whom are not needed in Queensland but who, I guess, are grateful for their job and will show their gratitude in the upcoming state election in Queensland. 


But in my home city of Townsville, unfortunately, unemployment is at very high levels. Why? Because of the mining downturn and because the state government, who control the local economy, have done nothing. The federal government has tried to help in Townsville, with commitments to the Eastern Access Rail Corridor project, to the Townsville Stadium, to the ring road around Townsville, to beef roads and to regional roads. The money from the Commonwealth for dams and for water studies has really flooded into the north, but, unfortunately, whilst the Commonwealth government provides the money, with the way our Constitution is set out, the work has to be done by the state government, who own the roads and who own the rivers. We, federally, can only provide the money, and we have done that. Regrettably, the state government have not used that money for the benefit of the people of North Queensland. 


Credit where credit is due, I will give the Labor Premier of Queensland credit for staring down the opponents in her own party, including her Deputy Premier, by—reluctantly, I think—eventually supporting the Adani project to build a long railway line in Queensland to go from the central Queensland coalfields to the Abbot Point port near Bowen. For young people who might have heard of this debate, can I say to you: please do not believe the rhetoric of the Greens and GetUp, who tell you that opening a coalmine about 500 or 600 kilometres inland, behind the Great Dividing Range, is somehow going to destroy the Great Barrier Reef. I live on the Great Barrier Reef. All of the people of that part of Queensland, who are represented by members of the Liberal-National Party—not of the Labor Party—know that the reef is carefully managed. It has ups and downs, but, generally speaking, it is a resilient organism that will continue to flourish, because it is well managed by, principally, the federal government, in conjunction with the Queensland government. 


I have diverted a fraction from saying that the Queensland Premier, against opposition from within her own party, did in fact supports the Adani railway and mine project, which will also, as an adjunct, help the South Australian steel industry, because all of the steel for the railway will be sourced from Whyalla. That project will provide real jobs, will provide some sustenance to small businesses who are struggling in that area and will, consequently, help with the equity of those who are less fortunate in the North Queensland region at the moment.


The previous speaker also made some reference to the abolition of penalty rates on 1 July. Somehow this is the fault of the Turnbull government, even though it was a decision made by the Fair Work Commission, whose members are principally ex-union workers and ex-union bosses appointed by the Labor Party.




Senator Seselja:
  Under a Labor piece of legislation.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Under a Labor piece of legislation—that is quite right, Senator Seselja. This independent commission, made up of mates of Senator Cameron who his government appointed to the job, took evidence and looked at it all. They understood the facts and figures, and they—not the Turnbull government—made a decision to adjust penalty rates for Saturday and Sunday work. Why? It is because the evidence clearly showed that penalty rates discourage employment opportunities. I know, without a study by the Productivity Commission or the Fair Work Commission or anyone else, just from my contact with my constituents, that there are so many small businesses who will not open on Saturday and Sunday because they cannot afford to pay the penalty rates. They cannot afford to compete in wages, because they have to pay huge penalty rates, whereas the big chains—like Maccas, Kentucky Fried and those fast-food chains; Myers and David Jones; Woolworths and Coles—thanks to a union deal, do not have to pay those same rates.


Why? It is because Mr Shorten, when he was a union leader, did these deals with that sector of the industry and said, 'You don't have to pay these huge penalty rates,' but the small businessmen, the mums and dads trying to compete with these multinational chains, 'Sorry you've got to pay these prohibitive penalty rates,' which means that most of them do not open. With a more realistic approach to penalty rates these small businesses, the mums and dads, will say, 'Yes, we will open on Saturday and Sunday, because we can afford to employ people.' That means more people will be employed, and that sort of thing will address the critical unemployment situation in my home city of Townsville. Fortunately, this is not shared by most of the rest of Australia at the present time, but it will make a difference there and right across Australia.


As I said before, it is my party's vision—it is in our DNA and it is certainly in the DNA of coalition governments federally—to look after those who cannot look after themselves, the more disadvantaged in our society. I will give just one example: the National Disability Insurance Scheme. I concede this originated in the term of the Labor government, but it was a proposal that was fully supported by the then opposition, which was our party, something you do not see today in this parliament. Anything that comes to this parliament, whether it be good, bad or indifferent, is automatically opposed by Labor and the Greens, just because we brought it forward. The Liberal Party in opposition thought that the NDIS was a good idea. It is part, as I say, of our DNA to look after those not as advantaged as the rest of us.


It was a good idea, but at the time we warned, 'Is this being paid for?' As I mentioned before in one of those important maxims, 'You can't keep out of trouble by spending more than you earn.' That is what Labor governments do all the time. That is what they did with the NDIS. That is what they do with everything: 'Yeah, good idea, it will get a few votes: let's promise we'll have a national disability insurance scheme. How's it going to be paid for? Don't worry about that; let's get the credit for setting this up and we'll worry about that later.' Of course, the Labor Party never provided money for the NDIS. It has been left to this government to actually fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme.


We are asking Australians to contribute, with the Medicare levy to be increased by half a percentage point from two to 2.5 per cent of taxable income. This means that one-fifth of the revenue raised by the Medicare levy, along with underspends within NDIS, will be directed to an NDIS savings fund to ensure that this good scheme can continue and be fully funded into the future—a proposition, an arrangement that the Labor Party had neither the wit nor the courage nor the understanding to introduce.


This is a measure because we do have those hated rich people that Senator Lines spoke about. Fortunately they are rich, because 2.5 per cent of their income will mean a huge boost to looking after those who need the NDIS. I repeat that maxim: you cannot establish sound security—social security in this instance—on borrowed money. Because we do have people who earn a lot, they contribute more—and thank goodness we do have them.


Similarly, this government understands inequality in education. That is why Senator Birmingham is bringing in a scheme that is equal across the board. It makes sure that people, no matter which category they are in, have money to be properly educated. As a state school veteran—all my school years were at a state school; I could not afford to go to university; I did my tertiary studies externally—I understand how important it is that all students should be helped by the federal government and the state governments. People say to me: why is the federal government giving Catholic and private schools so much money and state schools so little? The reason is that the state governments in our Federation give the state schools all the money and the Catholic and private schools very little at all. So what the Commonwealth has always done, since the Menzies days, is try and equalise that. We do not care where kids go to school; as long as they are getting a good education, they should all be treated relatively equally.


Across the board, coalition governments, since time immemorial, have tried to lessen the inequalities within Australia by sensible policies that work and that do achieve results;. That is why every serious social reform, and indeed environmental reform, that has ever come before the Australian parliament has been a product of Liberal governments over the decades.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2017-06-22,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (11:07):  I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in the debate on the Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017. I support this bill and congratulate my friend and colleague Senator McAllister on her initiative in bringing this bill before the Senate and commencing a debate on inequality, one of the great social and economic issues facing the nation. The bill amends the Productivity Commission Act 1998 to expand the general policy guidelines for the exercise of the Productivity Commission's functions to require consideration of inequality. The bill establishes a framework for the Productivity Commission to regularly report on economic inequality.


I have been a long-time critic of the Productivity Commission since appearing before the commission and former Commissioner Banks on the future of the vehicle and component industry many years ago. I appeared in my role as the national secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union. Arising from that hearing, the commission set the stage for the destruction of the vehicle and component industry in this country. It did not do a lot for equality and it did not do a lot for working people. The commission, in my view, is far too dominated by economists. Worse still, these economists are predominantly advocates of neoliberal economics who argue that the economy will reach equilibrium, in which all resources will be fully employed, if only government is minimised.


These people in the Productivity Commission are the acolytes of the Austrian school of economics, influenced by Friedrich Hayek, and the Chicago school of economics, influenced by Milton Friedman. It is my view that, unless there is an injection of economists who understand the role of the state and Keynesian economic principles, the majority of the reports will be guided by an increasingly discredited economic theory that increases poverty and inequality. There must be an injection of economists who are not bogged down by their ideological presumptions, such as, 'Markets are always efficient,' or, 'Government is always inefficient.'


The Productivity Commission can always be relied on to minimise the role of government and maximise the role of the so-called free market. We therefore need a renewed debate on the role of government in reducing inequality while moving away from the sterile and unrealistic slogans of the coalition, such as 'jobs and growth' and 'innovation agenda' and the empty rhetoric of trickle-down economics, of which we heard so much about from the previous senator in this debate, Senator Macdonald.


As the renowned Nobel economics laureate Joseph Stiglitz stated in his book Freefall: America, Free Markets, and the Sinking of the Global Economy:


Economics had moved—more than economists would like to think—from being a scientific discipline into becoming free market capitalism's biggest cheerleader.


The Productivity Commission is an example of this. The economists in the Productivity Commission, who can pontificate on any issue that the government brings before them, were missing in action and failed to analyse or understand the problems being created by greed and corruption in the US finance sector which led to the great recession. Where were all the alarm bells from these right-wing economists in the Productivity Commission that there was something happening in the US that would lead this country into what almost became a recession?


We would have been in a recession if we had not had a Labor government in place to actually use Keynesian economic principles to keep people at work, keep communities operating and keep businesses and corporations going. Labor in government, in my view, should not solely rely on advice from the Productivity Commission, unless the dominance within the commission of free market economists is balanced by economists who understand the importance of the role of government in the economy. Unless we do this, the good aspiration contained in this bill that the Productivity Commission consider inequality and establish a framework to regularly report on inequality will be frustrated by the dominance of the Chicago school of economics thinking of the economic staff in the Productivity Commission.


What are the drivers of inequality? The drivers of inequality are the neoliberal economics we just heard from Senator Macdonald. Again, he just used the same tired, old, regurgitated rhetoric that the coalition have been using for years about trickle-down economics. They think that, if they give a $65 billion tax cut to big business who do not pay their fair share of tax now, there will be economic growth and jobs will be created. What a load of tosh from Senator Macdonald and the coalition on this issue. They argue about too much tax and small government. Small government means that you end up not having the capacity to provide the health services, the education services and the infrastructure that this country needs to continue to compete at an international level.


They do not deal with multinational tax avoidance, which is a great driver of inequality. They constantly attack the union movement. We heard from Senator Macdonald. He is full of rhetoric about the trade union movement without understanding the benefits that the trade union movement brings to working class people in this country through decent wages and decent conditions and how that flows on to small businesses across the country because workers have a dollar in their pocket to spend in those small businesses.


Another driver of inequality is the budgetary decisions of the coalition. No-one should ever forget the 2014 budget. It was the epitome of inequality created by government policy. If you ever want to look at what would drive inequality, go back to the 2014-15 budget of this government: changes to welfare for young people; reductions in hospital funding and health expenditure, including new patient contributions to the cost of medical services; and reductions in school funding. That is where they really are. The only reason they are trying to put up a smokescreen that they are interested in education is that they were being killed out there, day in day out, in the political debate on education and school funding. That is the only reason they have actually been dragged kicking and screaming to any semblance—and a pale imitation—of what Gonski is really about. They actually reduced family tax benefits in that budget. They reduced the indexation of the age and disability pensions. Cuts to pensioners was their DNA in their policy and their budget. And these cuts, including reduced funding to higher education and increased student contributions, mainly affected low- and middle-income households.


I will not be lectured by any of that mob, that rabble of a government across there, on inequality—absolutely no way. They all, like lemmings, supported these cuts when they first came to government and argued that this was good for the economy. Well, they destroyed people's lives! I will not accept any criticism of Labor policies from a mob who just do not understand inequality. In that budget, young people under 30 were denied access to income support for six months of every year, losing up to $255 a week. Young kids were supposed to starve if they did not have their family looking after them! What an obnoxious policy to bring in a country like Australia—which had an international reputation for egalitarianism. Young people aged 22 to 23 were transferred from Newstart allowance to the lower youth allowance. Young people with disabilities were reassessed, with income reductions of up to $214 a week in the disability support pension.


Indexation changes were put in place that would erode the real value of payments over the long term with the loss of $80 a week in a decade. They abolished the pensioner education supplement. And they tightened access to family payments, impacting mainly on low-income families with children—in particular, sole parents. They made changes to family tax benefit B. Sole parents with a youngest child aged between six and 12 lost $37 a week and those with a youngest child aged over 12 years would lose $58 a week. This is their understanding of inequality. This is how they behave when they think they can get away with it.


Do not listen to any coalition member who ever stands up here and talks about looking after working class people in this country, because it is not in their DNA. They do not care about working people. They care more about the big businesses that put the dollars into their election funds, whether that is done legally or in the back seat of a Bentley with a property developer up in Newcastle handing over $10,000 in a brown paper bag to the coalition. They do not care about working class people in this country.


The coalition want us to change the payment indexation for pensions. They have changed it from the CPI to wages. That would erode the value of the pension by $80 a week over 10 years. That is how much they care about pensioners. They extended the qualifying age for the age pension without any increase in the Newstart payment, reducing income for those unable to work up to 70 by between $64 and $166 a week. This was the coalition in action. Boilermakers, fitters, builders and labourers are being told, 'You've got to work until you're 70.' What a nonsense!


Then look at the group of Australians who are suffering most from inequality—Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. One hundred and fifty programs were consolidated into five. The government cut $493.7 million from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander support, and $160 million of the cut was from a reduction of expenditure on Indigenous health programs. So no wonder the government cannot deal with inequality. It is because they just do not know what it means. There are cuts to Indigenous language support programs of $9.5 million. They reduced funding to the National Rental Affordability Scheme, which was putting low-income people into houses, with the loss of round 5 incentives and 12,000 dwellings that should have been in there for low-income households.


They cut funding to homelessness services and they did not give any indication that they would continue funding. They have defunded housing help for seniors and defunded the first home saver account scheme. That was when they first came into government. Now in the most recent budget they have put it back in. They do not know if they are Arthur or Martha, this mob. They will just do anything to try to save their necks, because they are such a rabble of a government. They are so divided internally. They do not want to deal properly with the issue of inequality. They do not want to deal with the issues that really go to ensuring that there is a fair and egalitarian society in this country.


Who could ever forget the sight of former Treasurer Hockey, who was telling everyone there were 'lifters' and 'leaners', becoming the 'leaner-in-chief' over in New York? Who will ever forget him and the current Minister for Finance, Minister Cormann, celebrating the imposition of all this inequality on Australians with a fat Havana cigar. It probably cost more for one cigar than they expected an Australian in trouble to survive on for a day. It was absolute nonsense. The current Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, in an interview said he supported every aspect of that horrendous budget. So the coalition cannot criticise anyone in relation to what we are doing to try to deal with inequality.


Inequality comes at a cost to the whole economy. There is a vicious spiral when inequality is not dealt with. Look at what has happened under this government—record underemployment, record-low wages growth and record-low share of national wealth, down from 75 per cent in the 1970s to 53 per cent now. There is the highest level of income inequality in 75 years and yet the government still support cuts to penalty rates for 700,000 of the most vulnerable, low-paid workers in this country. They are an absolute disgrace.


Thankfully, in more and more countries around the world they are getting rid of these policies of globalisation, privatisation, competition policy and austerity. Thatcherism is dead—it is just that these people do not understand that. Even the International Monetary Fund has identified that reductions in the number of trade unionists and the taking away of the rights of trade unions results in more inequality. That is the speciality of this mob—they know that if they can destroy the trade union movement, weaken the trade union movement, working class people will suffer more and more inequality. When the International Monetary Fund is saying that, then we should all be very concerned about what they are about. Deunionisation weakens earnings for middle- and low-income workers. That is what they are about—giving $65 billion of tax cuts to big business on the theory of trickle-down economics and, while they give tax cuts to millionaires, increasing taxes on ordinary working families. That is their view of inequality. That is how they try and deal with inequality. They do not have a clue.


The trade union movement is absolutely essential to dealing with inequality. We have seen a position where every time this government gets an opportunity they try and weaken the rights of workers who belong to trade unions. They try and diminish the capacity of workers to enterprise bargain effectively. And the push to enterprise bargaining has created a position where multinational corporations can use all of their resources against workers and their unions, but the unions cannot take any coordinated action across that company. I think it is a disgrace. That should be changed. The right of entry for union officials should be liberalised so that we can actually get in there and talk to workers about the problems they have on the job. But this government is so busy with its ideological obsession, with destroying the trade union movement, cutting rates for pensioners and getting rid of decent funding for education and health, that they do not care. They are an absolute rabble and a disgrace of a government. (Time expired)

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2017-06-22,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (11:27):  I rise to oppose Labor's Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017. This bill would require the Productivity Commission to prepare five-yearly reports on the effects of inequality. A saving grace of this is that this requirement is not loaded with an assumption that inequality is bad and the government should counter inequality. The Productivity Commission would hopefully measure the things that matter to people, how equally these things are distributed and the effect of this distribution. 


Some people want more money, more goods and services and more assets, so the commission would measure inequality in these things and assess the effects of such inequality. But consumption is not all that matters to people. Inequality is found in many areas of life. Some people at death's door just want to survive, while others with poor health just want to be able to enjoy everyday life. The lonely among us long for friends, meaningful relationships and family. Many yearn to have children. Some people long to find meaningful employment and have fulfilling careers. Some people are tired of carrying the tax burden for others. Some just want a bit of respect. Some people have a spiritual gap in their lives and some people wish they were better looking or still had hair on their heads. Good luck to the Productivity Commission if it has to measure and assess inequality with respect to all of this. Given the problems confronting the governments of Australia, this exercise does not strike me as the best use of the Productivity Commission's time. 


However, the critical component of the bill before the Senate today is a requirement on the Productivity Commission, in performance of all its functions, to have regard to the need 'to mitigate the negative effects of inequality on the Australian economy and the Australian community.' This requires the commission to accept, before it has done any investigation, that inequality has negative effects that should be mitigated. This undermines the usefulness of having an organisation where staff are tasked to gather evidence and come to their own conclusions. 


As it happens, inequality does have negative effects, namely: envy. But the moral thing for the government in response to this envy is to do nothing. The role of government should not be to do whatever the median voter wants, which could very well be to seize the property of the minority. The role of government is to protect life, liberty and property and, more broadly, to do other beneficial things that businesses cannot profitably provide due to free riding. In other words, liberty should trump democracy. This is in the long-term interests of Australians, including the median voter. 


Currently the bipartisan obsession with spending other people's money has us on a slow path to self-destruction. I urge parliamentarians, whenever they are thinking about spending more of other people's money, to consider what Australia will look like in decades ahead if such behaviour were to continue. Equality in poverty is not something we should aspire to.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2017-06-22,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (11:31):  I rise to speak in support of the Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017. In opening my comments I want to congratulate my colleague Senator McAllister for bringing on a debate on such an important matter. For those of us on this side of the chamber the recent decision of the Productivity Commission to recommend a reduction in penalty rates makes the case very, very strongly that this reform is long overdue. The Productivity Commission is the brainchild of the former Howard government, and, while, I must confess, sometimes its reports have been useful—and I will come back to that—its most recent recommendation in respect of penalty rates in the retail, hospitality and fast-food sectors has given cover for the industrial commission to follow through with devastating cuts, which are going to further entrench inequality.


On this side of the chamber we know that equality of opportunity is core business for people in political life. If we are here for nothing else, we should be here to ensure that all Australians have equal opportunities. We know that it has become mainstream economic thought that inequality is inextricably linked with economic growth, so we really need to tailor our institutions to focus on this issue and ensure that it is an important consideration. But it is not just economic linkage. We know if there is a sustained perception of inequality in a society then that will have political consequences. I would argue that the rise of President Trump and the events in the UK with Brexit are all symptoms of people's perception that they are not adequately benefiting from the growth of the economy, and that is therefore leading to dissatisfaction, disaffection, dislocation and disengagement. This is something that, as a body politic, we need to nip in the bud, and I think Senator McAllister's proposal for the Productivity Commission is a good starting point for focusing one of our key institutions on the issue of inequality—amongst other things, of course. They will always need to address other criteria, but inequality should be up there, of equal importance, with those other issues.


We know that Australia's inequality level is the challenge of our time. Even the Treasurer, Mr Morrison, has indicated that low wages growth is probably the single most important economic issue that we confront. Having said that, the government will not do anything to prevent the cuts to penalty rates and prevent the take-home pay of many low-wage employees being further affected. It is a very hollow observation on the part of the Treasurer. We know that wealth is growing more quickly at the top of the spectrum, and over the past four decades real earnings for the top 10 per cent have risen nearly four times faster than they have for the bottom 10 per cent. That is a huge concern. Unless we do something about this trend of increasing inequality then, as sure as night follows day, we are going to see a continuation of it and things will get a lot worse before they get any better.


I was somewhat heartened, and a bit surprised, to see the new Governor of the Reserve Bank come out in support of workers demanding a greater share of the economy's profits to drive up record low wages growth. The Governor of the Reserve Bank is not normally seen as a champion of workers' rights, though to be fair to the governor he has made a number of other comments as well—but this was a central tenet of one of his recent speeches. He identified that there is a real need to address this issue of demand in the economy, and we need a sustained pick-up in wages to enable us to move out of the abnormally low interest rate settings that we are currently in. It is surprising to see the Governor of the Reserve Bank make those comments.


We have also seen comments from the Business Council of Australia's chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, who has written that the sense of resentment in the community over the changing economic outlook is real and it must be understood. She has said:


Economic liberalisation is a social compact. In exchange for rising incomes to help them look after their local needs, people are asked to accept an ever-changing economy with industries that rise and fall with the tide of global progress.


After a decade of phenomenal income growth, built on the back of a deregulated economy that reaped the benefits of increased global trade, business investment has now slowed and wages growth has fallen flat.


She says that the crisis really is in real wage growth. This is coming from an unusual quarter—even people on the business side of our society are saying that enough is enough, that we have seen surprising income growth in certain quarters but the people who most need the benefit of the growth in our economy are not seeing that.


Almost three-quarters of Australians agree that differences in incomes are too high. We do not have the sorts of levels of income inequality that you might see in the US, for example, but that is because of many of the institutions that we now take for granted in our country. I am very proud to be a Labor politician and to be able to point to many of those institutions as having been initiated, created or sustained and protected by the Labor Party in the course of 100 years, whether it comes to forms of welfare which were absolutely necessary—payments to mothers, in the first instance, going back 100 years or so; along the way, through Medicare and our occupational superannuation system; and, as we go forward, the NDIS. There are many other initiatives that the Labor Party has taken which form part of the fabric of the safety net we have in this country that has been so effective in the past in ensuring that the benefits of economic growth do flow through to those people that really need it. 


It is of continuing concern to me that, despite the fact that many credible economists identify this as one of the reasons why Australia does have this relatively low level of inequality, we continue to see from the other side of politics continued attacks on these institutions and concepts. Really, if there is one area that should have bipartisan support, it is buttressing the institutions which prevent levels of inequality such as we see in the United States. I call on colleagues opposite to get on board with that. 


The tide is turning and there is a need for us to adjust our thinking, out of the Thatcherite and Reaganist era, if we are going to lift economic growth out of the doldrums it is currently in. Although we have had a sustained period of economic growth, and there are a number of reasons for that, it is low growth and it is growth that is not flowing through in benefits to low-income workers. When we talk about this safety net, we are also talking about the trade union movement, as it is an integral part of it. We should get our heads out of the Thatcherite and Reaganist era, when there was a hard Right attack on the union movement because they interfered with the free market. That type of thinking, trickle-down economics, should be confined to the dustbin of history, and we should be adopting a more enlightened approach, one that is more in line with the facts and with the empirical evidence. 


It is not just Labor saying this. For example, the International Monetary Fund has made the comment and has actually quantified the extent to which inequality is an inhibitor of economic growth. So as a former trade union official I join with Senator Cameron in saying that, rather than continuously attacking the trade union movement—which is at a low ebb at the moment, and we should be frank about that; levels of union membership in this country are quite low, historically speaking, and I would put that down to the fact that there is a lot of emphasis given to sensationalist media reporting—it should be considered, and it is, as I said in my first speech in this place, an integral part of the system of transmitting the proceeds and the benefits of economic growth through to ordinary working people. That is where I stand and that is what I support.


As I said, while we do not have those extremes of inequality that we see in other countries, we are below the OECD average, and the Gini coefficient, which is a well-respected metric in this area. Whereas the OECD average is 0.32, Australia's is 0.33. We are not doing as well as we should and as well as we have done in the past. We know that 2½ million Australians live below the poverty line. I have indicated that inequality is a drag on economic growth and a destabilising force in society. I have touched on that point. The OECD has estimated that from 1985 to 2005 inequality reduced growth among member states by almost 5 per cent. That is an extraordinary figure. The IMF's chief, Christine Lagarde, has warned leaders as the World Economic Forum recently that economic growth can only be sustained if it is equitable. It comes back to the need for an institution like the Productivity Commission to focus on this particular issue. I started by talking about the penalty rates decision, which I think is the most egregious example of the Productivity Commission looking at a set of facts and coming up with a conclusion that is unhelpful to our economy and our society. We know that the McKell Institute has done work in respect of what happens when you cut penalty rates. They have identified that the retail and hospitality trade is a particularly important trade for rural Australia. We know that the retail trade, as far as the workforce was concerned, was 11 per cent in the 2011 survey, and we had accommodation and food services at seven per cent. That is a significant part of the rural workforce. 


We know that when you cut penalty rates, you take that spending power that exists in those regional communities out of regional communities and repatriate it back to the head offices of companies, so that that money is used someone else rather than in the local community. We know that regional and rural communities are already struggling, so we are going to see significant impacts from 1 July. When we should be doing all that we can to support our regional communities and we see this coming forward, this is going to be a devastating new impact on regional communities.


We should do a number of things when talking about inequality. We should establish measures for economic inequality. We should be looking at things like geography, gender and age in respect of inequality. We know that governments do not work effectively if they cannot measure and quantify the problem so we can prioritise our efforts in dealing with these types of issues in a policy setting. Unless you do that sort of thing, the community remains unaware of the extent to which inequality is connected to social and other outcomes.


This is a significant concern for me as a Labor politician. I want to highlight the concern that I have in respect of cuts to penalty rates and the impact that that is going to have on future economic growth. We know that households are under extraordinary pressure at the moment. There are 700,000 households across Australia that are going to be directly impacted by the penalty rate cut. Albeit the cuts will be phased in over a period of time, the failure of people's incomes to keep up with other increasing prices is going to be a significant problem for economic growth into the future. It will make it so much harder.


Of course, we also know that households are suffering under a huge amount of debt. Australia is something like third in the world when it comes to household debt as a percentage of GDP, which I think is something in the order of 125 per cent. That is already causing the consumer side of our economy to languish. If we want to see people loosening up their purses and wallets to spend in the economy, we need to provide better wage growth for them. That can only be done if we have lower levels of inequality, so that people can start to enjoy the benefits of economic growth. If we do not do that, it is a very serious issue. We do not want to see the instability in our society that we have seen across the world. Australia has a great track record but it is under pressure, and measures such as those in the bill will go some way to addressing that concern. (Time expired)

"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2017-06-22,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (11:51):  The Productivity Commission Amendment bill 2017 amends the Productivity Commission Act 1998 to expand the general policy guidelines for the exercise of the Productivity Commission's functions to include consideration of inequality, and establishes a framework for the Productivity Commission to regularly report on economic inequality.


The purpose of this bill is to improve the quality of information and analysis available about economic inequality in Australia and to ensure that proper consideration is given to inequality in the public debate about economic policy. We firstly compliment Senator McAllister and the ALP for putting forward this bill, even if we have some reservations, as expressed quite well by Senator Leyonhjelm.


I will firstly discuss inequality. Inequality of wealth is an important economic phenomenon that should be properly and independently measured and analysed; however, it is a result, not a cause. A significant level of inequality is not in itself an economic issue. It is whether someone has sufficient and growing wealth to pay the bills, not whether someone else has even more sufficient and growing wealth. So, provided this is used correctly, and not politically for pushing a philosophy, it will be a valuable addition to the debate in this country.


Inequality only makes economic sense as one possible indicator that something may be askew with the levels and trend of real net wealth. Real net wealth is driven not by inequality but by factors such as real income and wages versus the real cost of living. The latter, cost of living, is partially and imperfectly measured by the CPI, which nevertheless clearly shows why poor and middle-class Aussies continue to struggle. The poor in fact get hammered by regulations, which seem to be the solution to many of the problems or challenges that the ALP see. The ALP, along with their Greens allies, quite often put forward an increase in regulation. Regulations bring with them an increase in cost, a decrease in quality and a decrease in production, which hurt the poor most of all. Regulations are an indiscriminate and regressive impost on the poor.


The Productivity Commission has been a bastion of sound economics and common sense for decades. The Productivity Commission will be aware of the primary role that too many government interventions, such as in the form of regulation, tax and money supply, have in reducing real net wealth as possibly indicated by significant levels of inequality. Thus, no government agency is in a better position to be tasked with assessing inequality than is the Productivity Commission.


Inequality can be very difficult to define. Senator Ketter has already attempted to discuss some of those aspects. Is it gender inequality? Is it geographical inequality? Is it inequality of tax? Is it inequality of wealth? As I said, regardless, when it comes to economic considerations, inequality is a result, not a cause.


Senator Ketter raises the question of declining union membership. That is no secret. A lot of people are aware of this. And then he raises the point about penalty rates. It is all too clear that the people who have pushed the decrease in weekend penalty rates, for example, are the very union bosses that have complained no about the Fair Work case result. Some in the media are referring to the Leader of the Opposition as Electricity Bill. That is not something I would do in this chamber, but that highlights two things. That is what people are seeing, and that gets to the heart of Senator Ketter's comments: these are open, everyday things. The penalty rates decision was preceded by the union bosses doing deals with the big end of town to strip penalty rates out of enterprise agreements. The decrease in penalty rates has been led by union bosses.


We then see energy policies—electricity especially. As the famous saying goes, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Some work by our staff indicated that single pensioners pay 11 per cent of their income, which is not discretionary, on energy. It is now a highly regressive tax to increase energy prices, which is at the core of Labor Party policy with its 50 per cent renewable energy target and its now support for the disgraceful Finkel report, which has no sound economic merit at its base.

Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister) (11:58):  I move:


At the end of the motion, add ""and, in respect of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017 and the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2017, the provisions of the bills be referred to the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 8 August 2017"".

"Gallagher, Sen Katy",ALP,2017-06-22,"



Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (11:59):  The opposition agrees with the amendment, but I would like to rise and make a few comments about the Selection of Bills Committee report and, in particular, the referral of the Australian Citizenship Legislation Amendment (Strengthening the Requirements for Australian Citizenship and Other Measures) Bill 2017 to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry. We support the referral to the committee, but the opposition would like to put on the record our concerns that were raised at the selection of bills meeting last night about the conduct of that inquiry. The Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee is an important and powerful committee of the Senate. Its job is to scrutinise important legislation and report to the Senate, and it is critical for the Senate to be able to perform its responsibilities as a house of review.


Labor has informally raised concerns before that we had about the conduct of previous inquiries, whether it be specific legislation or through the estimates process. Specifically, our concerns are about the ability of the chair to conduct hearings which are respectful both of senators and of witnesses and professional in their approach at all times. The Australian Citizenship Legislation Amendment (Strengthening the Requirements for Australian Citizenship and Other Measures) Bill is an important piece of legislation. It is vital that the inquiry is professional, that witnesses are respected and that senators are able to perform their duties as provided for by the relevant standing orders without obstruction or harassment. Whilst it is regrettable to raise these issues in the chamber, in this instance Labor believes it is important to bring our concerns to the attention of the Senate.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2017-06-22,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (12:01):  I endorse the comments made by Senator Gallagher and want to offer a few thoughts with regard to Senator Macdonald, the Chair of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, who, in conducting himself in that role, has consistently demonstrated bias and incompetence. We have seen badgering and bullying of witnesses—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKim, resume your seat. I will just remind you that you cannot reflect on a senator in those terms, so I ask you to withdraw those remarks.




Senator McKIM:
  I do withdraw those remarks. I guess I cannot call him a lickspittle either.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKim, I have cautioned you. Please do not take licence with that.




Senator McKIM:
  In that case, what I will say is this: the conduct of Senator Macdonald as the Chair of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee risks bringing that committee and this Senate as a whole into significant disrepute in the minds of the Australian people. We have seen Senator Macdonald trying to evict me from that committee for doing my job as a senator representing the Tasmanian people and the Australian people, trying to prevent me from asking questions and trying to prevent me from holding the government to account.


The Australian people have witnessed the difference in the way he conducts himself with regard to some witnesses that have appeared before that committee and the contrast in that behaviour with the behaviour he engages in with regard to government ministers who are appearing as witnesses before that committee. If you look at the 14th edition of Odgers, it says, on page 462, this:


It is in the … committee] room that careful, calm consideration can be brought to bear upon a subject, and [senators] can work harmoniously in spite of party differences.


We are in danger of not meeting that standard. We are in danger of undermining public confidence in the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee as a result of the way that that committee is chaired.


With regard to citizenship legislation, which is part of this report, the bill is nothing other than an attempt to remake Australia in Peter Dutton's narrow-minded and bigoted image. It is aimed at demonising—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKim, resume your seat. Senator Macdonald, on a point of order?




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I do not think I need to make my point of order. I think you were about to make the point.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Macdonald. I do remind you Senator McKim to refer to those in the other place by their correct titles, and I will ask you to respect them as members of this place and to withdraw that comment.




Senator McKIM:
  I withdraw that. But I will make the point here again that the citizenship legislation proposed by Minister Dutton, with the support of the entire cabinet, including Prime Minister Turnbull, is aimed at demonising and ostracising people who are already living, working and raising families in Australia. They are men, women and children who show every day how much they love this country and how hard they are working to contribute to our society and community. They want to make Australia their home. They want to build their lives, or rebuild their lives, in this country. For all their hard work, the government wants to spit in their faces. This legislation is like the policy of a carload of drunk thugs shouting abuse at passers-by. It is the policy of the Cronulla riots.


This legislation assumes the very worst in people—like high-standard English language tests that, I suspect, members of the cabinet would struggle to pass.




Senator McGrath:
  You're a dirtbag.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McGrath!




Senator McKIM:
  It is no coincidence that these kinds of English language tests were a hallmark of the White Australia policy.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKim, please be seated. Senator Whish-Wilson on a point of order.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Deputy President, you heard exactly what Senator McGrath said. He needs to withdraw that.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McGrath, I invite you to withdraw those remarks.




Senator McGrath:
  I withdraw those remarks.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I remind all senators that senators are entitled to be heard with respect and in silence. Senator McKim.




Senator McKIM:
  It is no coincidence that high-level English language tests that are designed to set people up to fail were a hallmark of the White Australia policy. This legislation and this government now want to lecture people about violence against women, despite the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Mr Dutton, trying to prevent a pregnant woman suffering serious health problems from being let out of detention in Nauru and coming to a hospital in Australia. This government, which impugns the independence of our legal system, including the AAT, now wants to lecture others about the rule of law. This government is trying to bend Australia to its will, to force Australia to give in to our fears, to put up the shutters and to build the fences. But I will tell you now that the government will not succeed, and it is the Australian people who will stop them from succeeding, because whether or not this government manages to change the laws to make it harder to become a citizen in this country, they will not change the fundamental character of our country, because the people will not let them.

 (Victoria) (12:07):  Going back to the original issue that started this whole thing, without going into the side lines of Senator McKim, as a participating member of the committee I want to say that I endorse Senator Gallagher's remarks.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,4,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2017-06-22,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:08):  I am the chair of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, to which the citizenship bill has been referred. I have already been in touch with the secretariat to try to work out a schedule for approval by the committee at an urgent meeting, which we have just called, so that we can deal with this before the Senate rises. I have given the committee some suggestions as to when hearings could be held in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Canberra to give everybody the widest opportunity to discuss what is clearly a very important bill, on which there will be lots of different views. Senator McKim espouses one view, which a minority might espouse. This is not the place for it, of course. If my suggestions are adopted, Senator McKim, as a full voting member of that committee, will have at least four occasions in public hearings to question witnesses. But when he questions witnesses he will, while I am chairman, do it respectfully and properly and in accordance with the standing orders.


Another senator in this chamber, who I will not mention, has complained to me that even in the committee he cannot hear what is going on because he sits near Senator McKim who consistently interjects. A senator has raised the same point in this particular chamber, not in the committee, complaining to the President that he cannot hear the President because of the consistent and constant interjections of Senator McKim. I have said many a time in the committees that I chair that I will not stand for that type of behaviour. It is bullying and it is disrespectful, and, as I proved with Lieutenant General Campbell, when senators disrespect witnesses I will insist that those senators either withdraw or remove themselves. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKim, a point of order. 




Senator McKim:
  Quite frankly, I could not care less what Senator Macdonald thinks about me. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is not a point of order. 




Senator McKim:
  The point of order is that you required me to withdraw personal reflections on Senator Macdonald. I ask that you hold him to the same standard and require him to withdraw those personal reflections on me. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKim, I asked you to withdraw comments which I considered to be unparliamentary. I am listening very carefully to the comments made by Senator Macdonald. If he or any other senator in this place makes unparliamentary comments, I will hold them to the same account. 




Senator McKim:
  I am making sure that you heard Senator Macdonald call me a bully. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I do not believe he talked about— 




Senator McKim:
  He said I engaged in bullying behaviour. I ask you to reflect on that. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKim, I do not believe the use of that term to be unparliamentary. 




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Talk about a glass jaw! What I am repeating are actual facts. There has been a senator stand up in this chamber, not in the committee, and request the President to get Senator McKim to be quiet so that senator can exercise his right to hear what is happening in the chamber. The same thing happens in my committee. I have a constant and consistent barrage of interjections from Senator McKim that I will not stand for. There is one member of the opposition—again, who I will not name but those on the committee will know to whom I am referring—who does the same thing. These two senators think they are somehow special and that there are special and different rules for them that do not apply to anyone else. 


Senator McKim is also concerned about the fact that, in the committees that I chair, I try to give every senator a fair crack of the time available. It is my consistent position—as all the senators in my committee know—to give each one 15 minutes at a time; no more and no less. They can come back and have another 15 minutes later. That way every senator gets to have their say. That does not suit Senator McKim or the Labor senator I am talking about, who want special privileges. Well, it will not happen. I work on the basis that the questions at estimates should be roughly proportional to the make-up of the Senate. It is my practice, which I will continue, to have one Labor, one Liberal, one Labor, one Liberal and then one crossbencher, because that is roughly the proportions of this chamber. Nothing can be fairer than that. But, of course, it does not suit Senator McKim because he is a member of a very minor party, which is becoming more minor, and he does not get the same say as a member of the Labor Party, who have two or three times as many senators as he has in this chamber. 


I can understand why Senator McKim is going around the chamber trying to get some support to get me taken off chairmanship of the committee. I treat that as a badge of honour. He would not want to get rid of me if I was not an effective and fair chairman, and I will continue to be an effective and fair chairman. I will not be bullied by the likes of Senator McKim and one other senator. (Time expired)



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question is that the amendment moved by Senator McGrath be agreed to.


Question agreed to.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question now is that the amended motion that the report be adopted be agreed to.


Question agreed to.

At the end of the motion, add ""and, in respect of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017 and the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2017, the provisions of the bills be referred to the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 8 August 2017"".

Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (11:59):  The opposition agrees with the amendment, but I would like to rise and make a few comments about the Selection of Bills Committee report and, in particular, the referral of the Australian Citizenship Legislation Amendment (Strengthening the Requirements for Australian Citizenship and Other Measures) Bill 2017 to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry. We support the referral to the committee, but the opposition would like to put on the record our concerns that were raised at the selection of bills meeting last night about the conduct of that inquiry. The Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee is an important and powerful committee of the Senate. Its job is to scrutinise important legislation and report to the Senate, and it is critical for the Senate to be able to perform its responsibilities as a house of review.


Labor has informally raised concerns before that we had about the conduct of previous inquiries, whether it be specific legislation or through the estimates process. Specifically, our concerns are about the ability of the chair to conduct hearings which are respectful both of senators and of witnesses and professional in their approach at all times. The Australian Citizenship Legislation Amendment (Strengthening the Requirements for Australian Citizenship and Other Measures) Bill is an important piece of legislation. It is vital that the inquiry is professional, that witnesses are respected and that senators are able to perform their duties as provided for by the relevant standing orders without obstruction or harassment. Whilst it is regrettable to raise these issues in the chamber, in this instance Labor believes it is important to bring our concerns to the attention of the Senate.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2017-06-22,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (12:01):  I endorse the comments made by Senator Gallagher and want to offer a few thoughts with regard to Senator Macdonald, the Chair of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, who, in conducting himself in that role, has consistently demonstrated bias and incompetence. We have seen badgering and bullying of witnesses—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKim, resume your seat. I will just remind you that you cannot reflect on a senator in those terms, so I ask you to withdraw those remarks.




Senator McKIM:
  I do withdraw those remarks. I guess I cannot call him a lickspittle either.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKim, I have cautioned you. Please do not take licence with that.




Senator McKIM:
  In that case, what I will say is this: the conduct of Senator Macdonald as the Chair of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee risks bringing that committee and this Senate as a whole into significant disrepute in the minds of the Australian people. We have seen Senator Macdonald trying to evict me from that committee for doing my job as a senator representing the Tasmanian people and the Australian people, trying to prevent me from asking questions and trying to prevent me from holding the government to account.


The Australian people have witnessed the difference in the way he conducts himself with regard to some witnesses that have appeared before that committee and the contrast in that behaviour with the behaviour he engages in with regard to government ministers who are appearing as witnesses before that committee. If you look at the 14th edition of Odgers, it says, on page 462, this:


It is in the … committee] room that careful, calm consideration can be brought to bear upon a subject, and [senators] can work harmoniously in spite of party differences.


We are in danger of not meeting that standard. We are in danger of undermining public confidence in the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee as a result of the way that that committee is chaired.


With regard to citizenship legislation, which is part of this report, the bill is nothing other than an attempt to remake Australia in Peter Dutton's narrow-minded and bigoted image. It is aimed at demonising—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKim, resume your seat. Senator Macdonald, on a point of order?




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I do not think I need to make my point of order. I think you were about to make the point.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Macdonald. I do remind you Senator McKim to refer to those in the other place by their correct titles, and I will ask you to respect them as members of this place and to withdraw that comment.




Senator McKIM:
  I withdraw that. But I will make the point here again that the citizenship legislation proposed by Minister Dutton, with the support of the entire cabinet, including Prime Minister Turnbull, is aimed at demonising and ostracising people who are already living, working and raising families in Australia. They are men, women and children who show every day how much they love this country and how hard they are working to contribute to our society and community. They want to make Australia their home. They want to build their lives, or rebuild their lives, in this country. For all their hard work, the government wants to spit in their faces. This legislation is like the policy of a carload of drunk thugs shouting abuse at passers-by. It is the policy of the Cronulla riots.


This legislation assumes the very worst in people—like high-standard English language tests that, I suspect, members of the cabinet would struggle to pass.




Senator McGrath:
  You're a dirtbag.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McGrath!




Senator McKIM:
  It is no coincidence that these kinds of English language tests were a hallmark of the White Australia policy.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKim, please be seated. Senator Whish-Wilson on a point of order.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Deputy President, you heard exactly what Senator McGrath said. He needs to withdraw that.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McGrath, I invite you to withdraw those remarks.




Senator McGrath:
  I withdraw those remarks.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I remind all senators that senators are entitled to be heard with respect and in silence. Senator McKim.




Senator McKIM:
  It is no coincidence that high-level English language tests that are designed to set people up to fail were a hallmark of the White Australia policy. This legislation and this government now want to lecture people about violence against women, despite the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Mr Dutton, trying to prevent a pregnant woman suffering serious health problems from being let out of detention in Nauru and coming to a hospital in Australia. This government, which impugns the independence of our legal system, including the AAT, now wants to lecture others about the rule of law. This government is trying to bend Australia to its will, to force Australia to give in to our fears, to put up the shutters and to build the fences. But I will tell you now that the government will not succeed, and it is the Australian people who will stop them from succeeding, because whether or not this government manages to change the laws to make it harder to become a citizen in this country, they will not change the fundamental character of our country, because the people will not let them.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2017-06-22,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:08):  I am the chair of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, to which the citizenship bill has been referred. I have already been in touch with the secretariat to try to work out a schedule for approval by the committee at an urgent meeting, which we have just called, so that we can deal with this before the Senate rises. I have given the committee some suggestions as to when hearings could be held in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Canberra to give everybody the widest opportunity to discuss what is clearly a very important bill, on which there will be lots of different views. Senator McKim espouses one view, which a minority might espouse. This is not the place for it, of course. If my suggestions are adopted, Senator McKim, as a full voting member of that committee, will have at least four occasions in public hearings to question witnesses. But when he questions witnesses he will, while I am chairman, do it respectfully and properly and in accordance with the standing orders.


Another senator in this chamber, who I will not mention, has complained to me that even in the committee he cannot hear what is going on because he sits near Senator McKim who consistently interjects. A senator has raised the same point in this particular chamber, not in the committee, complaining to the President that he cannot hear the President because of the consistent and constant interjections of Senator McKim. I have said many a time in the committees that I chair that I will not stand for that type of behaviour. It is bullying and it is disrespectful, and, as I proved with Lieutenant General Campbell, when senators disrespect witnesses I will insist that those senators either withdraw or remove themselves. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKim, a point of order. 




Senator McKim:
  Quite frankly, I could not care less what Senator Macdonald thinks about me. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is not a point of order. 




Senator McKim:
  The point of order is that you required me to withdraw personal reflections on Senator Macdonald. I ask that you hold him to the same standard and require him to withdraw those personal reflections on me. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKim, I asked you to withdraw comments which I considered to be unparliamentary. I am listening very carefully to the comments made by Senator Macdonald. If he or any other senator in this place makes unparliamentary comments, I will hold them to the same account. 




Senator McKim:
  I am making sure that you heard Senator Macdonald call me a bully. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I do not believe he talked about— 




Senator McKim:
  He said I engaged in bullying behaviour. I ask you to reflect on that. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKim, I do not believe the use of that term to be unparliamentary. 




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Talk about a glass jaw! What I am repeating are actual facts. There has been a senator stand up in this chamber, not in the committee, and request the President to get Senator McKim to be quiet so that senator can exercise his right to hear what is happening in the chamber. The same thing happens in my committee. I have a constant and consistent barrage of interjections from Senator McKim that I will not stand for. There is one member of the opposition—again, who I will not name but those on the committee will know to whom I am referring—who does the same thing. These two senators think they are somehow special and that there are special and different rules for them that do not apply to anyone else. 


Senator McKim is also concerned about the fact that, in the committees that I chair, I try to give every senator a fair crack of the time available. It is my consistent position—as all the senators in my committee know—to give each one 15 minutes at a time; no more and no less. They can come back and have another 15 minutes later. That way every senator gets to have their say. That does not suit Senator McKim or the Labor senator I am talking about, who want special privileges. Well, it will not happen. I work on the basis that the questions at estimates should be roughly proportional to the make-up of the Senate. It is my practice, which I will continue, to have one Labor, one Liberal, one Labor, one Liberal and then one crossbencher, because that is roughly the proportions of this chamber. Nothing can be fairer than that. But, of course, it does not suit Senator McKim because he is a member of a very minor party, which is becoming more minor, and he does not get the same say as a member of the Labor Party, who have two or three times as many senators as he has in this chamber. 


I can understand why Senator McKim is going around the chamber trying to get some support to get me taken off chairmanship of the committee. I treat that as a badge of honour. He would not want to get rid of me if I was not an effective and fair chairman, and I will continue to be an effective and fair chairman. I will not be bullied by the likes of Senator McKim and one other senator. (Time expired)

I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.

The speech read as follows—



TREASURY LAWS AMENDMENT (2017 MEASURES NO. 3) BILL 2017


This Bill is an administrative technical amendment to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 and the Corporations Act 2001. The Bill eliminates potential legal risks that have recently become apparent by validating certain past agreements that were made to employ or engage a small proportion of ASIC staff before the end of 9 March 2017.


From the commencement of this Bill, the validation of the agreements means that those affected staff will be taken to have always been valid staff members who were effectively delegated ASIC's functions and powers.


These amendments address various administrative oversights including one that occurred in 1999. At that time, legislative changes shifted the power to employ or engage staff outside of the Public Service Act from ASIC itself to ASIC's Chairperson. However, relevant delegation instruments were not updated to reflect this change.


ASIC only recently became aware of this oversight. Successive previous governments have not been aware of it. The irregularities only potentially affect a small proportion of ASIC staff employed outside of the Public Service Act.


The passage of this Bill ensures that previous actions taken by those ASIC staff will be effective. In turn this will remove any doubt about the validity of any sanctions that have otherwise been legitimately imposed on people; and any doubt about the effectiveness of the relief that ASIC has provided.


The amendments will have no impact on any current or former ASIC staff members beyond ensuring the validity of their employment and actions. The legislation maintains the status-quo, under which the Chairperson of ASIC has the ongoing ability to employ or engage staff members and for ASIC to delegate its powers and functions to them. 


Full details of the measure are contained in the explanatory memorandum.

Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (12:46):   I rise to speak in support of the Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Measures No. 3) Bill 2017 and its expeditious passage through the chamber. ASIC has discovered that certain delegations being relied upon did not meet particular requirements under the ASIC Act, leading to a defect in the employment of staff and consultants, and legal uncertainty as to whether people employed by ASIC were lawfully entitled to exercise certain functions and powers. Those functions and powers include coercive powers, such as compelling the production of documents that may then have been used in evidence in court proceedings. So, a range of outcomes under those acts, and the other laws ASIC had administered, may be open to legal challenge.


The bill before us today is to validate certain agreements to employ or engage ASIC staff that were purportedly made before the end of 9 March 2017, and thus provide a legal basis for the exercise by affected staff members of delegated functions and powers of ASIC. The amendments also deal with the consequences are validating those agreements for the purposes of provisions of the Corporations Act, and the ASIC Act, dealing with the transition from the old Corporations and ASIC legislation.


It is important that the operations of our corporate markets and financial services regulator are beyond reproach. A properly well-functioning regulator ensures there is confidence that the financial system is operating properly for the benefit of all Australians. As I stated in my opening remarks, Labor supports this bill and will support its speedy passage through the Senate this morning.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:04):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister representing the Prime Minister (Senator Brandis) to a question without notice asked by Senator Polley today relating to workplace relations.


It might be Senator Brandis's birthday today, but it certainly will not be a birthday present for any of the 700,000 low-paid workers who will lose penalty rates over the next few years as a result of the Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and the coalition—the rabble of a government over there—refusing to stand up for penalty rates for Australian workers. They are an absolute disgrace. They simply do not understand how important it is for workers in this country to have access to penalty rates, to put food on the table, to put shoes on their kids' feet, to pay the bills, to pay the rent, to pay the mortgage, to engage in society. They do not have a clue. They are a clueless mob, and all they have is this argument amount trickle-down economics. According to this mob, you can give $65 billion of tax cuts to business and that will create jobs.


Well, no-one around the world who has looked at what tax cuts have done in the UK or in the USA believes that absolute nonsense. This is a mob who are going to give $16,400 of tax cuts to millionaires but stay silent when it comes to the penalty rates of workers in this country. I have to say, at least George Christensen, the member for Dawson down in the other place, actually understands how important it is to protect penalty rates.



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator CAMERON:
  Senator Macdonald can laugh and giggle all he likes. After many, many years in the Senate, he would never have had to worry about penalty rates. He would never have had to worry about putting food on the table. He has lived off the public purse for decades. Yet workers on penalty rates are not supported by Senator Macdonald, not supported by the Nationals party.


And I will tell you where the workers will be most affected: it will be in rural and regional Australia; it will be in areas where Senator Canavan lives; it will be in areas where Senator McKenzie lives; it will be up in New England, with Senator Williams. I wonder whether Senator Williams in New England has told the workers up there why he is supporting cuts to penalty rates, when he had an opportunity, when Labor moved protection of penalty rates in this place—why he voted against it. We know penalty rates are so important to the working poor in this country, yet this mob over here, on their $200,000 base salaries, do not have a clue about how important it is for workers to have access to penalty rates.


Even Senator Hanson, after her initial opposition to penalty rates, was forced to capitulate and support the Labor Party on that issue. If Senator Hanson can understand that, why can't the Nationals? If George Christensen can understand it, why can't the Nationals? I mean, One Nation are not the protectors of working class families in this country—far from it—but even Senator Hanson, with all her loopy ideas, with all her divided ideas, with all her hatred for some groups in this country, understood how important it was—eventually—to protect penalty rates. And she only did it for pure political purposes, because she does not really support penalty rates in this country. It is about time those opposite understood the difficulties for ordinary families, for the working poor, to put food on the table and to look after their families. For you lot on a basic salary of 200 grand a year to cut penalty rates is outrageous. (Time expired)

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2017-06-22,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (15:10):  I am glad to respond to Senator Cameron. Talk about who has been on the pay! You say it is Senator Macdonald, with his years in the Senate. What about the free ride you have had all of your life from workers paying your union job? 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Williams, resume your seat. I remind you to direct your comments to the chair and not refer directly to other senators. 




Senator WILLIAMS:
  That is a very good point. I am sorry I overlooked it, but Senator Cameron sometimes winds me up, because of the hypocrisy of those on the other side. They will not pay attention to or respect an umpire. I will tell you why. Go back to 1983 and the 'wide comb dispute' with shearers. I am probably the only shearer in this chamber. I say to those over there: the shearers started your party. But none of them could bend their backs and knock the wool off a sheep. There are only two shearers out of 226 parliamentarians in this building, and we are both Nationals: Andrew Broad MP and me. When the umpire made the decision in 1983 that we could use wide combs, what happened? Ernie Ecob and former senator Michael Forshaw said: 'Go on strike. Don't listen to the umpire's decision. Umpires are bad.' Those over there set up an umpire, Fair Work Australia, and they appointed the commissioners. The commissioners were appointed by the Labor Party. Then, when then the commissioners made an independent umpire's decision, those over there would not abide by the umpire's decision. Nothing has changed in the Australian Labor Party since 1983. 


Let's have a good look at who is getting ripped off. Mr Bill Shorten stripped penalty rates from lowly paid cleaners with no compensation while accepting payments to his union, the Australian Workers' Union, from the company Cleanevent. Are they proud of that history? I bet—for sure! For years the unions and big business have been making agreements to cut Sunday penalty rates and even under the Labor Party we had two lots of penalty rates cuts when they were in government. Let's look at the classic examples. A bed and breakfast small business pays $10 an hour more for labour than a five-star hotel on penalty rates, a family chicken shop must pay $8 an hour more than KFC and a family owned takeaway—Senator Hanson will know about this because she comes from a small business—must pay $8 an hour more than McDonald's. Why do they stick up for McDonald's but not care about small business? Why will they not let the umpire give small business a break and employ more people? A family pizza takeaway must pay $8 an hour more than Pizza Hut and—this is the best of all—a family greengrocer must pay $5 an hour more than Woolworths. Why are they in love with big business? Why do they hate small businesses, who are the biggest employers in our country? 


So we got the umpire's decision, from the umpire established by the Australian Labor Party. I remember the jubilation when I was in opposition when the legislation establishing Fair Work Australia went through the chamber. Those opposite appointed the commissioners, and they asked them to review penalty rates in four years. The commission did the review they requested when they were in government, and they do not like the answer. If they ever went to court and the judge made a decision, they would never accept the judge's decision. They would put up some stupid argument about why they were found guilty or innocent. It is unbelievable. As I said, it goes back a long time to 1983 with those opposite.


Senator Cameron is talking about 'those wealthy ones over there', such as Senator Macdonald. I remember that before I came to this place I was on $25,000 a year and living in a caravan. And we are the wealthy ones on this side? Give us a break! As I said, we are the workers on this side. You do not find shearers over on their side, despite the fact that shearers started the Australian Labor Party under the Tree of Knowledge at Barcaldine. No, no—they are just specialists at selling union tickets. They get the free ride. When the shearers were not getting paid any money back in 1983 because they had to go on strike, the union reps still got paid every week. They got the free ride. The Senator Camerons know when those situations are on. It is just amazing!


We had a situation where the Australian Labor Party set up the Fair Work Commission umpire. I want to make sure that Senator Sterle gets this message from me clearly. I am worried that he has not got it yet. They set up the umpire. Imagine if they were playing football. If the umpire gave a free kick to someone, they would walk off the field. They would not obey the umpire's decision. Well, they set up the umpires. The umpires have made a decision, and those opposite do not like it. They even appointed the umpires—the commissioners. They said to them to review the awards. Then when the decision came down against them they put on a sook, blaming us, blaming the government for their work. (Time expired)

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (15:15):  When we talked about 1 July, we talked about birthdays in this place. It is the birthday of one of my brothers on 1 July, and I can tell you that he is not looking for any cuts to the penalty rates for his workforce and his colleagues there. What we know about those on the other side is that they are so out of touch. They talk about independent umpires, but they did not even make a submission on behalf of Australian workers. You did not even make a submission. What we have always said is that there needs to be protection for the lowest-paid workers in this country. If they are giving up their time to serve us on a Sunday in hospitality or in retail, they should be compensated for being away from their families. I do not know anyone who goes out for lunch on a Sunday afternoon who is resentful of paying a little bit more. I do not know anyone who is prepared to complain about that. 


But what I do know is that, on 1 July, in my home state of Tasmania, there are some 40,000 Tasmanians who will be worse off. We already know that because we talk about it in this place all the time. Senator Duniam is here. He understands the economic difficulties that we have in Tasmania. We have a very low paid workforce. That workforce cannot afford to lose that $77 a week. 


Those on the other side talk about small business and how they are the champions of small business. They lecture us all the time. The reality of life is that small businesses rely on everyday Australians to keep their businesses turning over. But I can assure you that those people who work in hospitality or retail, or as hairdressers or aged-care workers expend all of their weekly salary. They have to do that. They do not have money to put away. They need those penalty rates to ensure that they can pay their bills, meet their mortgage payments or pay their rent, and go to the doctor. That is the reality. I can assure you that I very much look forward to being in this place in the coming months, when we come back to this chamber after the break, because I guarantee that I will be vindicated for saying that there will not be any further increase in jobs in small businesses in Tasmania. That is because there will not be. They will be pocketing that money—that is what they will be doing—and there will not be any flow-on effect to the Tasmanian economy.


We have spoken time and time again about 1 July and what is going to happen with these penalty rate cuts. Let's not forget that this government had ample opportunity to support the bill that we introduced into the House of Representatives that was supporting the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Take-Home Pay) Bill 2017. The government have refused to support it. Today is the last day of sittings—maybe we will sit tomorrow; that remains to be seen—and this government can still act to support that legislation to protect some of the lowest-paid workers in this country.


Why is it that the government, when they come in here and lecture us about the big end of town and the great saviours that they are of small business, are then giving the millionaires of this country $16,400 on 1 July?




Senator Duniam:
  The millionaires!




Senator POLLEY:
  Senator Duniam is saying, 'Hear, hear!'




Senator Duniam:
  I actually said, 'The millionaires!' Don't verbal me.




Senator POLLEY:
  Do you know what is really interesting? And the Liberal Senate team from Tasmania are very good at it. They pretend that they are lions when they are down in Tasmania and that they are going to stand up for Tasmanians; but when they come in here to this place, they are pussycats. They do it in just the same way that the member for Dawson, George Christensen, espoused in his electorate that he supports penalty rates. Yes, he crossed the floor, but he did that knowing full well that it would not change the outcome of that vote. They are crocodile tears. He is like every other person who sits on that side of the chamber and on that side in the other place who supports these cuts to penalty rates: they are so out of touch and they are so arrogant.


I remember making these same comments in relation to the Howard government—how out of touch and arrogant they were. This government, under Malcolm Turnbull, could not be any further out of touch or more arrogant than they have already demonstrated they are in this place all week, when they would not even condemn Senator Hanson for her outrageous— (Time expired)

"Duniam, Sen Jonathon",LP,2017-06-22,"



Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (15:20):  It is always a pleasure, and it seems to be a regular occurrence, that I get to follow my colleague Senator Polley on various debates in this chamber. I am pleased to once again have that opportunity and to contribute to the motion to take note of the answer given by Senator Brandis on the issue of penalty rates. I think most of the points that Senator Williams made are absolutely salient to this debate. The facts are that Labor created the Fair Work Commission, Labor appointed the commissioners and, indeed, Labor said they would abide by the decision. It was a point that was made by the Attorney in his answer today. We can all recall that radio interview by the opposition leader, Mr Bill Shorten. When quizzed repeatedly as to whether or not the Labor Party would accept the outcome, the final decision, of the Fair Work Commission when it came to penalty rates, repeatedly he said yes. But now we find ourselves in a situation where that is not the case. You have to remember that when we consider this issue and the points that have been made by those opposite.


I think it is important, though, to talk about what actually creates jobs, improves employment conditions and increases people's earning capacity. We have talked about small business in this debate a lot. Senator Polley made a couple of comments during question time today, by way of interjection, in relation to small businesses. Senator Polley referred to those people who will be the recipients of the benefits of the enterprise tax plan as 'millionaires'. I would not make the argument that people who run small businesses are millionaires. I would not argue either, as Senator Polley did, that those people will keep the benefits of the enterprise tax plan for themselves and just pocket them. I do not agree with that. That is what Senator Polley thinks they will do, but I do not agree.


I would love to take Senator Polley down to a small business. We could go together to one of those nice cafes in Evandale and talk about penalty rates. In fact I might extend an invitation to her next week when we are down in town. We can talk to the proprietor of that cafe about how penalty rates affect their business and how they might close because people do not want to pay the surcharge. That was the point that the proprietor of a cafe in Evandale made to me when I was recently there. Indeed, Senator Polley made the point that people are happy to pay that little bit extra to cover the cost of penalty rates on a Sunday or Monday, but then in the same debate Senator Polley said, 'Those people who are working in aged care, those people who are on penalty rates, they have no money.' You cannot have it both ways. Either people have money to spend or they do not. I think that contradiction highlights just how political this is, and that it is not a substantial debate about real issues.


The other point that Senator Williams made in his contribution was about the difference in employee pay conditions that small businesses face against those that big businesses face. To highlight the hypocrisy there, again we go through that list. Look at the family newsagent, the small business, that has to pay an employee a Sunday rate of $37.05 per hour, the award penalty rate for 2014-15, as opposed to the Officeworks Sunday rate of $30.05 an hour under the union agreement. The family greengrocer pays $37.05 per hour under the award penalty rate; Woolworths, the big multinational, pays a Sunday rate of $31.79 an hour under the union agreement. It goes on and on. Senator Williams mentioned McDonald's, comparing that to the family owned takeaway: $29.16 per hour under the award penalty rate; $21.08 per hour under the union agreement at McDonald's. We have to look at those facts. We have to take all of these things into account.


You cannot come in here and scream about the things that you have screamed about—injustices against workers in this country—when union agreements are delivering less for the people who are covered by them than the penalty rates that apply to those in small businesses, which cannot absorb massive increases in costs; are largely, as Senator Cameron pointed out, based in rural and regional communities; and do not have multiple outlets that can cross-subsidise one another. These are the things we have to remember when it comes to regional employment, which is something we talk about a lot in these debates. Burnie is different to Sydney. We need to protect small businesses, which create jobs in these small communities. The rates they face—those I read out—compared to those of multinationals and other large businesses demonstrate that it is all hypocrisy, froth and bubble. It is not actually about protecting jobs and supporting businesses. (Time expired)

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2017-06-22,"



Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (15:25):  I want to put a different angle on this debate as I rise to contribute to taking note of questions to ministers. I just want make it very clear to those poor devils stuck in here listening to some of the nonsense here: I actually am a former small businessman. I come from a trucking background, with three generations of truckies. I had the privilege of being a rank-and-file employee, where I learnt my skills as a furniture removalist, going into long distance trucking to buy my own. I had to actually put the family house on the line. My wife and I had no idea how we were going to pay off our debt of $100,000 or so back in 1980 when the truck was about $30,000.


I want to talk from the heart—and I know what it means—when we start talking about union collective agreements. Senator Duniam, who is on his way out of the chamber, had a crack at union agreements. These collective agreements under the enterprise bargaining structure are where the employer speaks to the employees and they may come to an arrangement where there is an increase in base pay for the normal 38 hours. It will mean an increase in their superannuation. It will be an increase that affects their holiday pay, their sick leave and all sorts of stuff. If they have traded off a higher penalty rate for the weekend then it is because it has been picked up in the ordinary hours. That is how that happens. But those opposite forget to say that.


But I want to talk about penalty rates. When I was cutting my teeth in furniture removals with an old company called Ansett, which is no longer with us, unfortunately, the cream on the cake at the end of the week was our penalty rates. After moving furniture back then for eight hours a day—it was not 7.6 hours and RDOs—we had the opportunity, because the boss came out and said, 'We need you to keep working because we have to start loading the truck for Darwin and the truck the Sydney. Will you stay back?' You jumped at the opportunity and you did so purely for the reason that not only were you going to get more pay but you got an extra rate. That was the cream on the cake—the icing on the cake. And then if you had the opportunity on the weekend to do bush runs as an offsider or as an offsider on office removals, guess what? The first two hours were time and a half and then double time. For that I had to give up my footy career. I was a state schoolboy footballer. I did not have to, but I wanted to, because I wanted to carve out a living. I wanted to take that step forward to buy that block of land so my girlfriend, who I am still married to 35 years later, and I could afford to build a house on it. I have no fear with people making a good dollar. But I understand that it can get tough for employers. Because of penalty rates they have to make the decision, if they are paying the penalty rates, to not open the doors. I get that. But when we start talking about penalty rate cuts we are not talking about phasing it in over the next 10 years in a grandfathering clause. We are talking about the true possibility or probability that 700,000 Australians will cop a pay cut from 1 July.


Who are those 700,000? I have no idea. But what I do know, and I think I am pretty close on this, is that the majority of them will be youngsters. The majority will be either kids at school who have a part-time job on the weekend at Red Rooster, Hungry Jacks, Woolworths, Coles, at the local delicatessen, or wherever it may be. I also know that they will probably be paying their way through university. There are probably university students who study like heck all week and, then, while the rest of us are enjoying the football or going out to family functions, they are working in a pub, or a restaurant, or a nightclub or whatever it may be. So please tell me this: if we are going to have a balanced argument, how is it fair when you consider what all of us in here had previously. And I don't think I am the only one who had to rely on penalty rates so I could live my Australian dream and buy my block of land. And how proud was I to get my first EJ station wagon, having wondered where the hell am was going to get 280 bucks for a car, but we managed to do it. Then I progressed to my Monaro, and that made me even happier. But I still for the life of me cannot see how it is fair for us sitting in this chamber and in the other chamber to say—to coin a phrase—now we are okay. We have our homes and probably most of us own our homes and have put our kids through university—or, in my fortunate position, my son followed in my footsteps as a truckie. But is it all right for us to get there now and pull the trapdoor up behind us, and say, 'It is all right for us, but you, the next generation, are not getting it'?


I really struggle with this argument. For the life of me I cannot understand the ridiculous argument where greed is okay if it is us. But all of a sudden we have gone to, 'We have it, so why should the next generation? Those employers really need a lift up.' If you want to give the employers a lift up, why don't you get fair dinkum? You tax the living bejesus out of them at every opportunity. From the time they wake up to the time they close their eyes at night they are battling red tape. They are battling taxes. This is just fairy floss. You can put as many hundreds and thousands on that sandwich, but it is still a you-know-what sandwich. (Time expired)

The PRESIDENT
 (15:35):  It is with deep regret that I inform the Senate of the death, on 21 June this year, of the Hon. Concetto Antonio 'Con' Sciacca AO, a former minister and member of the House of Representatives for the division of Bowman, Queensland, from 1987 until 1996 and again from 1998 until 2004. I call the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Brandis.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2017-06-22,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (15:36):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate records its deep sorrow at the death, on 21 June 2017, of Concetto Antonio (Con) Sciacca AO, a former Member of the House of Representatives for the division of Bowen and Minister for Veterans' Affairs, among other portfolios, places on record its gratitude for his service to the Parliament and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.


Con Sciacca's life was a great Australian story, a great Australian immigrant story. He was born in Sicily on 13 June 1947. At the age of four, Con, together with his family, followed a path familiar to many Italian Australians, leaving postwar Europe in the hope of securing a brighter future in Australia.


The Sciaccas settled in Queensland, where Con's father worked as a canecutter—another very familiar story for Australians of Italian heritage. Con always took immense pride in his Sicilian heritage, and in his maiden speech he told the story of his family and of others like them who had made the courageous journey to Australia in search of a better life. 'Like me,' he said:


Many of them are descended … from poor farming families. Their families, like mine, came to Australia with no knowledge of our language and, in fact, often unable to read or write even their own language. Their only material possessions were the clothes on their backs, but they brought with them the most valuable asset of all—a vision and a dream that through hard work, determination and tenacity they would succeed. Included in this dream was their firm belief that they could achieve for their children and for their grandchildren that which was not available to them in their own country, namely, equal opportunity—the same equal opportunity that Australians often take for granted.


What Con had so eloquently described in that maiden speech was the great Australian success story of so many migrant families, of which his life and that of his family serve as a shining example.


The political bug hit Con Sciacca very early in life. He joined the Queensland branch of the Labor Party's youth wing at the age of 17, and by 21 he had been elected state president of Queensland Young Labor. It was also at the age of 21 that Con made his first tilt at elected office, as the endorsed Labor candidate for what was then the safe Liberal seat of Mount Coot-tha in the Queensland parliament, at the 1969 Queensland state election. As Con recalled in his maiden speech, he had the rather unique distinction of casting his first ever vote in his own favour. 


Between that first encounter with a ballot box and his eventual election to the House of Representatives, Con was admitted as a solicitor and built a large and successful legal practice in Brisbane, specialising in industrial law and general common law damages claims. I practised at the bar in those years, and I remember CA Sciacca and Associates was an extremely successful firm, with a very large following—a large union clientele but also a very large following among the Italian community. 


In 1987, Con was endorsed for and then successfully contested the seat of Bowman at the July double dissolution election of that year, having defeated the sitting Labor member, Len Keogh, in the preselection. As he noted in his maiden speech, at the time he was elected he was only the second ever Italian member of this parliament. He was re-elected in 1990 with an increased majority, and thereafter appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security. 


Tragedy struck the Sciacca family in 1992 with the death of their son, Sam, then only 19, from Ewing's sarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer. This was to have a profound effect on Con's life, prompting him to undertake a number of charitable projects aimed at raising awareness and assisting other families affected by cancer, including through the establishment of the Sam Sciacca Travelling Fellowship, which facilitated international health experts to visit Australia in order to present lectures on the latest developments in cancer research and technology. As Con reflected at the time: 'Sammy's death, something like that humanises you, brings you back to realise what is really important. It gave us back the old Labor spirit of mateship, that spirit that says when the chips are down you put aside your differences and help each other.' 


At the March 1993 election, at which Labor's nationwide victory secured the Keating government's record fifth term, Con Sciacca was, once again, returned to parliament and served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Arts and Administrative Services. On 25 March 1994, he was promoted to the ministry, as Minister for Veterans' Affairs, succeeding former senator John Faulkner in that portfolio. In October 1995, he added to his portfolio responsibilities the role of Minister Assisting the Treasurer for Superannuation. At John Howard's landslide 1996 election victory, which saw Labor lose 29 seats, Con Sciacca lost Bowman to the Liberal Party's candidate, Andrea West. However, in 1998 he recontested the seat and successfully retook it, with a 4.2 per cent swing to the Labor Party. 


Following an unfavourable redistribution, from the Labor Party's point of view, in Brisbane's eastern suburbs, Con Sciacca decided to leave Bowman and contest the newly created seat of Bonner in the 2004 poll—Bonner being named, of course, in honour of a former distinguished Liberal member of this House, the late Neville Bonner. Running against him was Ross Vasta, a fellow Italian Australian, who fondly recalls attending Italian parties in his youth with the Sciacca brothers. Con and Ross developed a friendship and a rapport during that election campaign that was unusual by the standards of modern-day political campaigning. Ross, now the member for Bonner, remembers receiving phone calls from Con in the final two weeks of the campaign, where they would compare notes on the day and, in particular, on how many postal votes each of them had received. It says volumes about the esteem in which Con Sciacca was held by the Italian community in Brisbane that, on polling day itself, Ross Vasta's father, Angelo, announced that he would feel unable to hand out Liberal how-to-vote cards for his son out of respect, he said, for the Sciacca family. I recall being with Ross Vasta on the night that he won the seat from Con Sciacca in 2004. I was the patron Liberal senator for that electorate at the time. I remember being present when Ross received the phone call from Con Sciacca congratulating him on his victory. A more gracious and generous exchange is hard to imagine.


For Con, post-parliamentary life marked a new beginning. He continued his charitable works, and his spirit of community endured long beyond his time in this place. Indeed, it continued until his death only yesterday. In 2006 that community, public and political service was recognised by his appointment as an Officer of the Order of Australia. As recently as March 2014, Con took up a place as deputy chair of the Anzac Centenary Public Fund. Among the numerous accolades bestowed upon him, in addition to the Order of Australia, were the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic, the Order of the Lion of Finland and the Centenary Medal for service to the veteran community. He was also a life member of the Returned and Services League, a life member of the RAAF Association and a life member of the Naval Association of Australia.


Con's lifelong contribution to public service, to business and to the law reflects an inspiring commitment to Australian public life, to the very hopes and dreams to which is family aspired when they left war-torn Europe in search of a better future. For those who knew him best, Con Sciacca will be remembered as a beloved colleague and mentor, a generous friend with an infectious and at times wicked sense of humour and a man dedicated to his family, his party and his country.


I last saw Con Sciacca last year. We had a mutual friend in former senator Santo Santoro. Santo was indeed a very close friend and business partner of Con Sciacca's and saw him very often during the time of the illness which led to his death yesterday. At Santo's 60th birthday party last year, there were many speeches. It was a night of much mirth, much dancing, much high spirits and many, many speeches. One of the speeches was given by Con Sciacca. It was the last time I ever saw him, and I remember the joke he told. He observed that he was at an event surrounded by Liberal Party politicians and supporters, and he reminded people of a saying that he very frequently used: the worst Labor government is better than the best Liberal government. Then he paused and said, 'At least, I used to think that, until I saw the Rudd government!'


Con Sciacca was a good man who lived the Australian dream and did a very great deal for this nation. He will be dearly missed by his many friends, colleagues and professional associates but in particular, of course, by his wife, Karen; his daughter, Zina; his granddaughter, Grace; and his stepsons, Nicholas and Daniel. To them, on behalf of the government, I offer my sincerest condolences.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2017-06-22,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:48):  I rise of behalf of the opposition to acknowledge the passing of a former minister and former member of the House of Representatives, the honourable Concetto Antonio Sciacca, AO, known to all of us as Con. Labor has lost one of our own. Not only do we extend our condolences to the family and friends of Con following his death, but the Labor Party shares, in some part, in their grief. Con Sciacca was a much-loved member of our party. A number of my colleagues will be speaking on this condolence motion to reflect some of their personal recollections of him.


He was a member of the House of Representatives for 15 years and a minister for six. His valuable contribution to our nation is undisputed. I served one term with Con Sciacca, and I remember him as being larger than life and a man full of humour. I also remember him as a man who loved this country, a great patriot. He was a mentor and friend to many, including those who serve in this parliament as well as a number of staff who worked with him. His contribution extended well beyond the political sphere.


He was a man who carried his heritage with pride, a man whose story expresses one of the great Australian narratives—the son of a father who left Sicily to cut cane so that his kids would have a better life, and a son who rose to be not only a member of this parliament but a minister of the Crown. Con Sciacca was born in Sicily in 1951 and, as my colleague Senator Brandis has said, he went on to be Australia's first Italian-born federal minister. He credited his tenacity and determination to his family roots and his upbringing. Variously a bank officer and a solicitor, amongst other occupations, before entering politics, Con was elected to represent the division of Bowman in 1987. He was a member of the AWU and obviously was bitten by the political bug early. He first sought election to the Queensland parliament in 1969 after joining the ALP at the age of 17. He would go on to be re-elected in 1990 and 1993, followed by an interregnum between 1996 and his return in 1998, followed by a further victory in 2001 in the same election in which I entered this parliament.


In his first speech he reflected on his migrant journey and acknowledged how proud he was to represent the party that was, in his words, 'governing with compassion and authority, good sense and confidence'. He contrasted this with the performance of the National Party Queensland state government at the time—in particular, the contrast between what he saw as the draconian approach to the rights of working people being imposed by that regime and the cooperative and rational approach of the Hawke government. These themes of fairness for working people and the values brought by Con's multicultural background would dominate much of his career.


As the Labor government approached 1990, the leadership fissures between then Prime Minister Bob Hawke and his Treasurer began to escalate. As we all know, that came to a head in 1991. Con was a very strong supporter of Bob Hawke—one of his most loyal supporters—even when personal circumstances prevented him from being present for the final vote just before Christmas of that year that saw Paul Keating ascend to the Labor leadership and Prime Ministership. Bob Hawke had earlier appointed Con Sciacca to the position of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security. He went on to retain this post with the change of leadership and gathered a range of additional appointments on the way. He was then given the opportunity to serve as a minister for the first time.


It was as minister for Veterans' Affairs that Con Sciacca perhaps made his greatest impact and for which he is deservedly remembered. Appointed to the position by Prime Minister Keating in 1994, he played a key role in the Australia Remembers campaign in 1995 commemorating the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. It is an initiative that earned him the thanks and respect of countless veterans. And I venture to suggest that it is still the benchmark for the respect we show those who served our nation.


The 1996 election that swept the Keating government from office took Con with it. Fortunately for him and for Labor he was returned in 1998 and would go on to hold the seat for another term in 2001. Under Kim Beazley he had responsibility for immigration and multicultural affairs, a portfolio to which he was well suited because of his own heritage and as a strong supporter of Australia's great multicultural character. His defeat in 2004 contesting the new seat of Bonner, which Senator Brandis has spoken of, provided the opportunity for a second post-political life. He worked as a lawyer and partnered with former Nationals minister Larry Anthony in a consulting firm. He even opened a cafe, now run by his daughter, on the ground floor of the Brisbane building, where he kept an office.


I do want to return to the 1990s before I conclude, because in the midst of the leadership tussle about which I have spoken Con was engaged in a much more personal battle, which was his son's battle with cancer. Sam died at the age of 19, in 1992, of a rare form of bone cancer, Ewing's Sarcoma. Con's response was twofold. First he commissioned a book—Body and Soul: Children, Teenagers and Cancer—launched by the Governor-General, Bill Hayden, in 1994. Later he would set up a fellowship to enable experts to visit Australia to lecture health professionals on the latest developments in research and technology. When he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2006, his service to cancer research institutions was acknowledged and he said it was an honour he would not have received had it not been for Sam.


He was a senior at St Joseph's Nudgee College and came home one day with a sore back. Seven months later, he was gone. I'm dedicating my award to my late son. Without him, I never would have got it.


Con Sciacca was a colourful, generous personality. He maintained wide friendships on all sides of politics. In May he gave an emotional interview to The Courier Mail. He said he was determined to celebrate his 70th birthday on 30 June, quipping, 'I'm looking to go out with a bang.' The succession of people who have visited him over the last few months is testament to the esteem with which he was held by so many.


Tributes have flowed since his death was announced. The Premier of Queensland has described him as 'a good friend, a mentor, a community champion and a true gentleman'. The federal Leader of the Opposition has acknowledged his unstinting support. And such remarks have been typical of those made in the last 24 hours.


Con lived a magnificent life, an Australian life, the life of a migrant, a man who was a patriot and, as I said, whose story speaks to one of the great narratives of our nation. That he was able to achieve what he did speaks volumes about our country. It speaks volumes about the opportunities we open and accept from migrants around the world. His achievements also reflect the immeasurable contribution made to our country by migrants.


Con Sciacca's service to our nation in our parliament and in the broader community was distinguished. His personal friendships extended across the political divide and demonstrate the regard with which he was held, and his passing is a source of profound sadness for many. So Labor extends our deepest sympathies following his passing to his family and friends and particularly his wife, Karen; daughter, Zina; granddaughter, Grace; stepsons Daniel and Nicholas; and the very many members of his family.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2017-06-22,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (15:56):  I too rise to pay tribute to the life of a great Australian. Of course, my name is Concetta, and Concetto is the male of my name. Con was so proud of not just his Italian roots but his Sicilian roots. He would always tell you that, of course, there was a great difference. He was proudly born in Sicily on 30 June 1947 in a little village called Piedimonte Etneo and he migrated to Australia in 1951. Con and I shared many parallels. The Attorney mentioned that his father came to Australia and was a cane cutter. My father came to Australia and was a cane cutter. We always talked and had the opportunity to talk about the parallels in our lives, and so it is probably with some emotion that I stand to pay this tribute.


Con, of course, died yesterday in, I have to say, probably the way he lived his life. All his family was around him. He had taken the last rites, and lots of family and lots of friends were around who had come to pay their respects, which is very, very typical of the tradition and particularly the tradition of Sicily. When he gave his maiden speech when he first came to this place, he talked about his family story and he talked in particular about his proud Sicilian heritage. Of course, he also used the opportunity to talk about the Italian community in Australia and its contribution.


He was the second-ever Italian-born member of parliament. He was the first Italian-born minister. From my perspective, I was the first female of Italian origin to become a minister in Australia, so I share the pride that he had when he did become a minister. I know that it was not just for him and for his family; it was for the whole Italian community.


His story was very much one of the migrant success story. So many people came from Sicily and left their country so that their children and grandchildren could be very successful. The Sciacca family was the embodiment of that. When he gave his maiden speech, he ended by saying, 'Despite the hard road behind me, I have never lost that tenacity and determination characteristic of the Sicilian race.' Of course that tenacity and determination was very, very evident, particularly as he fought his battle with cancer. As has been said, tragically his son died aged 19 of a rare and virulent bone cancer which usually strikes young people during their teenage years—Ewing's sarcoma. He later went on to do a lot of work in the cancer space but also, as Senator Wong has said, commissioning a book, Body and soul: children, teenagers and cancer, in 1994 to help other families facing similar challenges.


One of the things that I want to put on the record and acknowledge was that Con always stood up for the Italo-Australian community at times when the community was criticised. I just went through some of the old clippings and came across this one in June 1993. The heading is: 'Australian Italians tired of the Mafia tag.' Con Sciacca was making some comments and talked about some of the things that he had been called. When you look at what happened then, and having been through this myself, and particularly when you look at what we see today and some of the issues that have been seen recently, particularly in Muslim communities, often communities and people in communities do get labelled negatively. What Con was talking about and talked about at that time is a very good example of what we too are seeing—often whole communities get tagged just because of the deeds of some rotten apples in those communities. Con was never backward in coming forward and standing up for the community that had helped him so much to get there.


He did break new ground when he became the first Italian-born government minister in Australia. He jokes about having become Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Rather than getting upset over Italian war jokes, as one article said, he decided to get ahead. We know that he was so successful as Minister for Veterans' Affairs and he was so proud to have become Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I will come back and make some comments on that in a moment.


I was present when Con became commendatore. He had previously been honoured by the Italian government. Both of us proudly held the title of Knight of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic. Con, having become a minister before me, became a commendatore before me. I was there the day that he got his commendatore at Circular Quay. It was a great day, when we all celebrated with him.


The legacy that Con has left is very much from the time when he was Minister for Veterans' Affairs. There was a piece written in The Age in August 1995. It talked about the work that Con had done as Minister for Veterans' Affairs. He became the first Australian politician and one of the few non-veterans to be awarded honorary life membership of the RSL. He was quoted in an article in September 1995:


Mr Sciacca said the award was particularly significant for him because he had been born in a wartime enemy country, Italy, and had arrived in Australia as a four-year-old immigrant. ""In my culture we revere old people and when I got the opportunity to do something to recognise the contribution of this generation I jumped at it. This was a great generation of Australians and we had to tell them how much we appreciate them. I was fair dinkum about that and I think they can tell when someone is fair dinkum,"" he said.


He was very fair dinkum about this. When he addressed the New South Wales RSL, after he had given his address, apparently he thought that people were booing him. He was a bit perturbed by this. This is in an article in August 1995:


""They're not booing you, Minister,"" the president whispered.


""That's the ninth division's battle cry. They reserve it for their generals.""


The article goes on to say how emotional Con felt, because of his history and because of the work that he did. He was very committed to his work as Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I remember one time we were in Sicily attending a conference when he was minister, and we all stopped for Anzac Day. It was a very emotional time.


I cannot help but quote this article from The Courier Mail of 23 October 2004. Con was defeated, as the Attorney said, for the seat of Bonner:


… but, in usual style, offered some ""friendly advice"" to his former leader.


Mr Sciacca warned Mark Latham not to become a victim of factions and not to allow the party to move towards the left.


""Do not let the Labor Party lurch or have a perception of it lurching to the left,"" Mr Sciacca said. ""A left-leaning Labor Party, in my view, in modern-day politics in Australia is not electable. You should always try to keep that middle of the road.""


I thought I would quote that today. But, as has been said, he then, post politics, went on to have another very successful career. My mother-in-law lived on the Gold Coast, and Sciacca and Sciacca was one of those law firms that were everywhere in Queensland, even on the Gold Coast, so there was a local branch even where my mother-in-law lived.


I conclude by offering my condolences to his wife, Karen, to his daughter, Zina, and to all the Sciacca family and friends. I know that I speak on behalf of the entire Italo-Australian community in paying tribute to a man who did our community proud. Vale, Concetto Sciacca.

Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (16:08):  I rise to pay my respects to Con Sciacca, who, as previous speakers have said, was born in the Sicilian village of Piedimonte Etneo and travelled to Australia at the tender age of four with his parents and brother, Joe, in 1951. As others have indicated, Con gave lifelong commitment to the Labor Party. That commenced very early in his life, at the age of 17, and he became president of Young Labor, as has already been said. From those humble beginnings Con went on to become a revered elder statesman of the Labor Party in Queensland and a friend and mentor to many.


A lawyer by profession, Con had a great respect for the law and the institution of the law. His legal practice in Brisbane was renowned for its industrial work. His work in industrial law, workers compensation and common-law damages claims brought him into direct contact with the trade union movement and its members, which is how I first came to know Con. His work gave him an appreciation of the day-to-day problems which workers face in their workplaces. In the early 1980s Con was one of the pioneers of the practice of providing a free first legal consultation to injured workers. He did this out of a genuine concern for the plight of working people, who are often denied access to justice.


As has been said, Con was elected in 1987 as the member for Bowman. Whilst people have commented on the fact that he was the second ever Italian-born member of this parliament, he was the very first Sicilian-born member of this parliament. As a new Australian, immigration and ethnic affairs were a part of his heritage and matters about which he was always very passionate. In his first speech he said:


Australia has come a long way from the days of its White Australia policy. This policy was effectively traded in for a multicultural Australia for unashamedly practical reasons after the Second World War. Only the most narrow-minded person would now deny the success of multiculturalism and the contribution made to Australia, both economically and culturally, by migrants of all nationalities.


As already commented on, Con was Minister for Veterans' Affairs from 1994 to 1996. He often said to me that one of his proudest achievements was the Australia Remembers program to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. For many years after that veterans around Australia sang his praises for the respect and support that he extended to them. In March 2014, Con took up his place as deputy chair of the Anzac Centenary Public Fund. In 2006 Con was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia. Senator Wong referred to the fact that he dedicated that award to his son, who passed away tragically at the age of 19. I will not say much more about that, but I know that for many years after the death of his son Con felt the loss very deeply. He was very emotional about that. He left no stone unturned at the time to look for cures for Sam, including a visit to Lourdes.


Con valued loyalty above everything else, and he was a strong supporter of Kim Beazley. As one of his principal backers, Con was reportedly so angry about the way his Canberra housemate Gavan O'Connor supported Mark Latham that he moved out of their shared flat and into a hotel. There was much fuming about 10 years of friendship meaning nothing. But, it is reported that over coffee at Aussies the two apparently made up and their shared flat was booked again for their return to Canberra when parliament resumed the following year. When Con lost his seat in the 2004 elections he reportedly said:


I'm 57—hardly an old man, I suppose … I got defeated in 1998 and I came back in 2001. But there'll be no comebacks this time. I'm exiting, if you like, very gracefully out of political life.


Con continued to show a strong interest in the Labor Party and turned his attention to his legal practice, his consultancy and his beloved Italian restaurant Alimentari. He had his special chair and table in the restaurant and I was privileged to lunch with him on a number of occasions and to be served with wonderful food and be regaled with sound advice and entertaining anecdotes. I valued Con's advice, which was always from the heart and often pithy, direct and sometimes colourful. As has been indicated, Con was honoured by the Italian and Finnish governments with some of their highest honours. None of these honours or the high offices that Con held ever went to his head as he never forgot his humble beginnings and always had the best interests of ordinary working people at heart.


Con battled cancer for the past three years but was determined to see his 70th birthday. And he did. After a three-week stay in the palliative care ward, Con was able to celebrate his 70th birthday last week with his family, including his younger brother Joe, who turned 67 on the same day. As Senator Wong has said, Con is reported to have said, 'I'm looking to go out with a bang!' 


Con was a larger-than-life figure who was very respected in Brisbane society but often depicted by cartoons in The Courier Mail in Sicilian garb with a violin case. But that was always taken with good humour. He was a one-of-a-kind political giant, successful businessman, restaurateur, raconteur and cigar-munching larrikin who revelled in his Sicilian heritage and loved this country. He will be greatly missed by his family and many friends and colleagues across the political divide. My sincere condolences go to his wife, Karen, to his daughter Zina and granddaughter Grace and to his step-sons Nicholas and Daniel. Rest in peace, Con Sciacca.

"Chisholm, Sen Anthony",ALP,2017-06-22,"



Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (16:14):  Con Sciacca: friend, mentor, successful politician, lawyer, businessman, failed punter, failed racehorse owner, failed greyhound owner, restaurateur, raconteur. The three words that always come after Con's name are 'larger than life', and I think just about everyone has used them today. I have never met a Labor person who was better company than Con. If you got that phone call from him or his diary person to say 'Con wants lunch', you cleared your diary, you blocked out the rest of the day, because you knew you were in for a very entertaining day—not always politically correct but with plenty of colour and always good fun.


Con's passing is being acknowledged by all sides of politics and, indeed, people in all walks of life. What I believe is the essential element of his character that has led to this is his generous heart. It really pained Con to say no to anyone. I think that is what made him such a good friend and a good politician but probably what made him a bad punter and racehorse owner. One memory I have of Con was meeting him for lunch after he had lost Bonner in 2004. He had a lot more time on his hands for entertaining and he was happy to take a young political activist, particularly one from the Right of the party, under his wing. His regular haunt in those days was Il Centro, and anyone who knows anything about Brisbane restaurants knows that that is the place where Con used to go. Later in the afternoon, Con, in a panic, said: 'What's the time? I've got a dog racing in 10 minutes. Where's the nearest TAB?' Being, at the time, a young person who used to frequent some of the establishments around the town, I quickly led him to the Victory Hotel. Thinking, 'Oh well, Con's putting some money on this dog; I'd better put some money on too,' I got out 10 bucks. Con got out his role of hundreds and started peeling them off to put money on the dog. The dog was called 'Bonner Blitz'. This was after Con had lost, so it was bringing up some bad memories for him, and he told the story of the dog: 'Well, the person who trains the dog, they rang. I can't say no to them, so I bought the share.' So we put our money on this dog. Con put a few hundred on. I put my 10 bucks on. The dog ran stone motherless last!


But that day was not a complete failure, because what also happened, which not many people know, is that Con ran into a lady called Karen, whom he subsequently went on to marry and who has been caring for him in recent months. So, whilst the dog was a failure, the visit to the Victory was not. Con was not the first person to find love at the Victory, but normally they are 18- or 19-year-olds. I think for someone Con's age it was a bit of a rarity.


A few people have mentioned that Con had a number of attempts at entering parliament, but probably the one for which he is most famous in Queensland Labor history was his effort to win the state seat of Redlands, which was within the federal seat of Bowman, which he later won. In a mighty preselection challenge he saw off the then state secretary, Peter Beattie, who was desperate to get into parliament. There were accusations of branch stacking and whatever else—none of which went on in the Queensland Labor Party at the time!—but Con managed to win that preselection and go on to contest the seat. Unfortunately—or fortunately, depending on your view—he lost the seat at the 1986 election. There was a time when Peter Beattie was complaining heavily that Con had moved a motion at the admin to have him gagged as state secretary—and, having been in that job, I know how hard it would be to do if you were gagged. Such was the bitter rivalry at the time that exemplified the wounds that stemmed from intervention. But, in true Con style, he and Peter Beattie became great mates and remained great mates until Con's sad passing.


As was often the case, Con dusted himself off, got back up and contested another preselection the following year, where he defeated Len Keogh, who was the sitting Labor member for Bowman and well regarded. I have spoken to Peter Shooter—who Senator Moore, who is in the chamber, knows—who was involved in that preselection. To win, Con needed cross-factional support, and the Left rallied behind him. He won the preselection. That was controversial at the time, because Con was, as many people know, a conservative member of the Labor Party, but the Left of the party saw great merit in his advocacy. Obviously, the Labor Party in Queensland was quite Anglo at the time, so having a multicultural voice was very important for us. I spoke to Peter Shooter before I came in today, and he said that not once did he regret that decision for the Left about Con, because he did make such a great contribution.


But, as we know, when you get elected to caucus, there are some people who have long memories and are very loyal to previous members. Con turned up at the now Old Parliament House, very keen, and he quickly got shafted into the worst office there, which he claimed was basically a broom cupboard. And he used to smoke like a brown log. He had a junior staffer at the time called Mike Kaiser, who almost died of smoke inhalation in that small office! I remember other stories from Mike about working for Con at that time. I think Con had a unit out at Queanbeyan, and he was known for having a fantastic video collection that I think he might have picked up from Fyshwick that was very popular with some of the young Labor members at the time! Con was always very colourful in terms of his behaviour.


He very quickly became influential in caucus affairs. No-one was ever uncertain about who he supported in leadership ballots in particular. He was a very strong supporter of Prime Minister Hawke and then subsequently Kim Beazley. As Senator Ketter alluded to, Con was always someone who wore that on his sleeve. I think it is important to note, though, that despite this, it was actually Prime Minister Paul Keating who promoted him to the ministry. A number of people here have spoken about his work with Australia Remembers as the veterans' affairs minister. He still is recognised in RSL clubs and the veterans community across Australia for his work during that time.


As I mentioned, I got to know Con more after he lost the seat of Bowman, when he had more time for hosting his legendary lunches, which were first at Il Centro and then later at his own restaurant, Alimentari. In my first speech I mentioned how I was named after Anthony Porter. Con's original business partner in Alimentari was David Porter—I was named after his brother. David reports two things about being in a restaurant with Con. Firstly, it was one of the greatest adventures of his life. Secondly, it was one of the poorest financial decisions he ever made, because Con was the best customer at his own restaurant. But it was always great to see Con there, in his element. He thought it was a little part of Italy that he had brought with him from his childhood and it was something that he was very proud of—as well as the role his family played in that restaurant.


I will finish on this. Con was also a very sentimental person, and he was certainly impacted by the passing of his son, Sam, in 1992. I recall that in 2014, which would have been one of the last times I had lunch with him—actually, I was meeting him for a coffee, but he asked me to stay a little bit longer because he had Ted O'Brien coming in, and Ted had just been elected too, as the member for Fairfax in the other house. The reason Ted O'Brien was coming to have lunch with Con that day was that, in Sam's year at Nudgee college, Ted O'Brien was the school captain, and once a year, on the anniversary of Sam's passing, Con had dinner with Ted O'Brien and a number of the other boys who were in that class. I think that shows where Con's heart lay, and how much Sam meant to him. I know that in this place we all have different beliefs, some are religious, some are not, but I hope we can all have an image of Con with his arm around Sam, catching up on the last 25 years.

BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (BROADCASTING REFORM) BILL 2017


Australian media organisations play a pivotal role in our society, reflecting and representing Australian culture, informing local communities, and supporting our democratic processes. We've come to expect a lot of our media outlets, and the mastheads and networks we've grown up with are ingrained in our daily lives: at work, at home, and on the go. 


But these organisations are under real pressure. Broadcasters and publishers are operating in an increasingly challenging environment, with intense competition for audiences and advertising revenue from other media companies, including online and on-demand operators and foreign technology companies.


The regulations governing our media companies don't allow them to meet these challenges on a level playing field. Figuratively speaking, they are in a fight with one hand tied behind their backs. Reform is essential if these companies are to have a future, and the Government is committed to implementing the necessary change. 


The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Bill 2017 contains a number of key elements of the Government's Broadcasting and Content Reform Package, which was announced on 6 May 2017. The Package represents an integrated set of reforms intended to modernise media regulation and help position the Australian media industry to deal with existing and future challenges more effectively.


The Package has the unanimous support of all sectors of the media industry and they consider it to be vital to their longevity and viability. It upholds important policy objectives, including protecting children from exposure to gambling advertising, supporting the creation of high quality Australian content and ensuring that the value of spectrum – an important public resource – is realised. However, it also removes regulatory barriers and burdens that achieve little from a public policy perspective and undermine the sustainability of Australian media organisations.


The Bill is being introduced today alongside the Commercial Broadcasting (Tax) Bill 2017, which will introduce a tax on the use of broadcasting spectrum. The commencement of the Tax Bill will be contingent upon the enactment of this Bill to ensure that these important reforms are implemented as a cohesive package. 


A number of other measures forming part of the Package will be implemented through their own legislation and processes, including further restrictions on gambling advertising in live sporting events across all platforms, a comprehensive review of Australian and children's content and funding to support the broadcasting of under-represented, niche and women's sports. They are nonetheless an important part of the Government's overall reform agenda being put before the Parliament today with this Bill. 


I now turn to the substantive measures in the Bill. 


Broadcasting licence fees are a relic of an era of analogue media regulation. They were introduced when commercial broadcasters were in a privileged position to provide media content and there was limited demand for spectrum. 


Today the opposite is true. Commercial television and radio broadcasters compete with a range of subscription and digital providers for audiences and advertising dollars. 


Broadcasting revenues are flat or declining in real terms as online and on-demand services draw audiences away from traditional broadcast content. Simultaneously, costs are rising, and the capacity of broadcasters to contain further cost growth will be limited given the need to invest in programming and technology across multiple media platforms. 


Licence fees and datacasting charges have no place in a modern regulatory framework for our media. The Bill will repeal these unwarranted taxes, starting with the payments that would otherwise be due in December 2017. In their place, the Government will introduce a transmitter licence tax for the spectrum in the broadcasting services bands to better reflect its use through the Commercial Broadcasting (Tax) Bill 2017. 


The introduction of a transmitter licence tax and the abolition of broadcasting licence fees and datacasting charges will result in the vast majority of broadcasters paying considerably less in terms of their overall fee and tax burden. This relief will enable broadcasters to better compete with online competitors, invest in their businesses and produce Australian content.


However, a small number of broadcasters will face a net increase in overall charges. The Government will support these broadcasters to ensure that they are no worse off by providing a five year transitional support package.


The five year transitional support package will provide financial relief up to 30 June 2022. It supports 19 individual commercial broadcasters to transition to the new spectrum tax model and help optimise their business structures and support growth over the medium to long term.


Funding for the transitional support package has been set aside in the Budget. The proposed legislation identifies these particular broadcasters and establishes an annual entitlement to payment of a set amount subject to straightforward spend and reporting conditions and the company not having opted out. Identifying these broadcasters provides certainty of the support. The support package totals $4.6 million per year.


As a part of this package, the legislation will require the ACMA after 30 June 2019 to undertake a review and report on whether the new tax law should be repealed or amended on or before 1 July 2022. The ACMA will consult on the review, enabling broadcasters to input into the development of future tax arrangements. The report would be tabled in Parliament. 


This review will be a valuable input into future spectrum taxing arrangements. In the meantime, the Government's policy is that broadcast spectrum taxes remain stable for the next five years to provide certainty. The Government acknowledges industry's desire for certainty beyond this period. While the broader spectrum management framework may change, this Government does not expect large increases in taxes for broadcast spectrum.


As I mentioned previously, it is important for all of the Government's media reforms to progress as a unified package. Only together can these reforms provide greater freedom and flexibility to the Australian media, so that they can configure their businesses in ways that support their ongoing viability. That is why this Bill includes the changes to the media control and ownership rules that are currently before the Senate in the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Media Reform) Bill 2016. 


Our media ownership laws are outdated and need to be reformed in order to unshackle Australia's media industry and enable it to respond to intensifying competition. The Bill will repeal two control and ownership rules that no longer make sense in the digital media environment: the '75 per cent audience reach rule' and the '2 out of 3 cross-media control rule'. 


The '75 per cent audience reach' rule prohibits a person, either in their own right or as a director of one or more companies, from being in a position to exercise control of commercial television broadcasting licences whose combined reach exceeds 75 per cent of the Australian population. The rule is redundant and does little to support media diversity. Audiences across the country receive essentially the same broadcast content due to affiliation agreements between the metropolitan and regional networks, and all three metropolitan television broadcasters and ABC stream some or all of their channels online to 100 per cent of the population. A merger between a metropolitan and regional commercial television network would effectively result in the replacement of one media 'voice' with another, with no diminution of diversity in these areas. 


The Bill also abolishes the '2 out of 3 cross-media control rule' that prevents a person being in a position to exercise control of more than two of the three regulated traditional platforms in any one commercial radio licence area.


The rule has little impact in terms of supporting diversity in regional and remote markets as there is no associated newspaper operating in the majority of these areas, and many cross media transactions would be prevented by the '5/4 rule'. This rule provides that at least five independent media groups must at all times be present in metropolitan commercial licence areas and four such groups in regional commercial radio licence areas, and will not be altered by this Bill. Any consolidation that may arise from the removal of the '2 out of 3 rule' would therefore be limited to the metropolitan and larger regional markets, where diversity issues are unlikely to arise given the greater numbers of media outlets in operation. 


It needs to be remembered that online media is no longer viewed as something distinct from the more traditional media platforms. Audiences in Australia and overseas now discover and access news from multiple sources across a range of media platforms, including online, social media, television, radio and newspapers. It is no longer appropriate that commercial television, commercial radio and associated newspapers be restricted by this rule when unregulated platforms are free to consolidate and adapt their businesses as much as they see fit, subject to wider considerations like competition rules.


Removing these rules will enable media companies to consolidate and build integrated media companies on a larger scale. This reality is widely acknowledged across the media industry and the Bill has been developed following extensive consultations with these parties, including regional and metropolitan broadcasters who strongly support the package. 


The remaining media control rules: the 5/4 rule, and the one-to-a-market rule and two-to-a-market rules (which provide that a person, either in their own right or as a director of one or more companies, must not be in a position to exercise control of more than one commercial television licence in a licence area, or more than two commercial radio licences in a licence area), will be retained. Media transactions will also continue to be subject to scrutiny under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 and the Foreign Acquisition and Takeovers Act 1975. 


These two ownership and control rules are working as handbrakes on the ability of Australian media companies to remain viable and competitive. A failure by the Parliament to support their repeal would leave our local media companies hamstrung by redundant rules from a pre-internet era.


The Bill also includes a range of measures to ensure the availability of local content in regional areas and strengthen links between local content and the communities it is broadcast to. In the absence of regulation, the high costs of local content production and the structural changes underway in the media more broadly will create incentives for broadcasters to achieve efficiencies, placing pressure on the continued supply of local programming at current levels.


Currently, the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 requires regional commercial television licensees in certain types of markets to provide local content – termed material of local significance in the Act – within specified areas. Under the current arrangements, regional commercial television licensees in aggregated markets and Tasmania are required to provide approximately 120 points of material of local significance per week to local areas within the licence areas. 


Material of local significance is material that is broadcast to a local area and relates directly to either the local area or the licence area. The aggregated markets comprise Northern New South Wales, Southern New South Wales, Regional Victoria and Regional Queensland. 


The Bills will extend and increase local content obligations for regional commercial television licensees where there is a 'trigger event'. The new obligations will apply to regional commercial television broadcasting licences which, as a result of a change in control, become part of a group of commercial television broadcasting licences whose combined licence area populations exceed 75 per cent of the Australian population. The additional local content obligations will commence six months after the Bill receives Royal Assent.


The requirement for the licensee to be part of a commercial television group that reaches over 75 per cent of the population ensures that the additional local content obligations are only 'triggered' after the licensee is in a position to benefit from the additional scale and efficiency that the media reforms will allow. 


Under the Broadcasting Services Act and Broadcasting Services (Additional Television Licence Condition) Notice 2014, local programming targets are currently expressed as 'points' where each minute of material of local significance is worth one point, and each minute of news that relates directly to the local area is worth two points.


Where a trigger event takes place the Bill will:


increase local programming requirements for regional commercial television licensees in aggregated markets and Tasmania that are subject to a trigger event by 30 points per week; 


introduce new local programming requirements for regional commercial television licences in non-aggregated markets that are subject to a trigger event. The Bill will require licensees to provide approximately 60 points of material of local significance per week to each local area; and 


introduce an incentive for local news to be filmed in the local area. To achieve this, the Bill introduces a new three point category under the local programming points system for licences affected by a trigger event. 


The additional obligations are aimed at ensuring that there is a local content obligation in nearly all regional licence areas following a change in control, including those where there is none currently. Where there is no trigger event, existing local content obligations for aggregated markets will continue to apply. 




Anti-siphoning 



The effects of Australia's outdated legislative framework for media extend to the regulation of broadcasting through the anti-siphoning scheme. The anti-siphoning scheme was established in 1994, and regulates the acquisition of broadcast rights for sporting and other events of cultural significance or national importance. 


It seeks to ensure that events on the 'anti-siphoning list' remain freely available to Australian viewers. While the Government continues to support the principle that nationally significant events should be available on free-to-air television, the anti-siphoning scheme is outdated and needs reform to better reflect today's media environment.


The Bills will remove the 'multichannelling rule', which prevents free-to-air broadcasters from televising events first, or exclusively, on their digital multichannels. The rationale behind the introduction of the rule in 2006 was to prevent consumers who had yet to make the switch to digital television, or those living in areas where digital television was yet to be rolled out, from being disenfranchised by events being televised on digital-only channels which they were unable to receive. 


With the completion of digital switchover in 2013, this rule is now redundant. Repealing the multichannelling rule will provide flexibility for free-to-air television broadcasters to optimise television coverage of listed events to the benefit of audiences across the country. 


The period from which events are automatically removed – or delisted – from the anti-siphoning list will be extended from 12 to 26 weeks. This will ensure the automatic delisting period is better aligned with the commercial reality of rights acquisition, where the bulk of major sports rights contracts are settled between six months and two years from the commencement of the first event to be played as part of a competition or tournament. 


This will still ensure that free-to-air broadcasters retain the opportunity to acquire sports rights first, while providing greater opportunities for subscription broadcasters to acquire rights where free-to-air broadcasters don't intend to do so. 


The Bill will also rationalise the number of events contained in the current anti-siphoning list through amendments to the Broadcasting Services (Events) Notice (No. 1) 2010. 


The current list is excessively long, encompassing between 1,200 and 1,300 events per year. The Bills will remove those events where the history of right's acquisition by broadcasters and audience viewing patterns no longer warrant their inclusion on the list.


Most of those events coming off the list are those which are no longer broadcast on free-to-air television, garner small audiences, or are events where the relationship to Australia is remote or non-existent (i.e. FA Cup Final and the US Masters golf).


Iconic events such as the Olympics, the Commonwealth Games, all AFL and NRL Premiership matches (including finals), the Bledisloe Cup, international cricket matches played in Australia along with Ashes test cricket matches, the Australian Formula One Grand Prix, the Australian Open tennis, the Melbourne Cup, the semi-finals and finals of the Netball World Cup involving the senior Australian representative team and the Bathurst 1000, will remain on the list.


Importantly, this does not mean that events that are not on the list will necessarily end up on subscription television. There are currently events that are broadcast on free-to-air television that are not, and have never been, on the anti-siphoning list.


The suite of changes to the anti-siphoning scheme will enable it to operate more effectively in a digital media environment while ensuring that events of national and cultural significance continue to be available on free-to-air television.


As I've already alluded, the Australian media industry is at a crossroad. It is incumbent upon the Parliament to ensure the industry isn't tethered to an outdated analogue regulatory framework that no longer serves a policy purpose and does nothing other than hold this important Australian industry back. 


The measures contained in this Bill represent a comprehensive set of reforms. They give our traditional media operators the flexibility to grow and adapt in the changing media landscape, invest in their businesses and in Australian content, and better compete with online providers.


These reforms have the unanimous support of industry and are the end result of extensive consultation with the sector. It is a package that is unabashedly and unashamedly pro-Australian media. 


The Government has done its part by taking media reform out of the long grass and bringing forward a comprehensive and holistic package. The industry has done its part by engaging constructively and in good faith to help shape this package. Each part of the industry has shown leadership by putting their own legitimate commercial self-interest to one side to come together in recognition that this package as a whole delivers substantial and important benefits to the entire sector. 


It is now time for the Parliament to do its part. To put an Australian industry and Australian jobs above partisanship and politics. To secure a strong and viable future for an industry that not only makes an important economic and cultural contribution, but serves as a vital underpinning of our democracy. To seize this historic opportunity to deliver comprehensive and holistic reform for the Australian media industry to ensure that those strong Australian voices continue.


I commend the Bill to the Chamber. 


COMMERCIAL BROADCASTING (TAX) BILL 2017


The Commercial Broadcasting (Tax) Bill 2017 implements a key component of the Government's Broadcasting and Content Reform Package – the introduction of tax on the use of broadcasting spectrum. Along with the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Bill 2017 (the Broadcasting Reform Bill), this Bill will help to modernise media regulation and position the Australian media industry to deal with existing and future challenges more effectively.


With the abolition of broadcasting licence fees and datacasting charges contained in the Broadcasting Reform Bill, the new taxation arrangements in this Bill will provide significant overall fee relief for broadcasters as part of an integrated package of reforms. This relief will enable broadcasters to better compete with online competitors, invest in their businesses and produce Australian content.


The Bill recognises that spectrum is a valuable resource, essential to a digitally networked economy and a critical enabler of services. Like all scarce public resources, it needs to be managed and its commercial value recognised. The Bill balances industry concern about remaining competitive, the obligations placed on them by government, and the need to value spectrum appropriately. These tax arrangements complement the longer term reform to the spectrum management framework the Government committed to in the 2015 Spectrum Review. 


Importantly, the Government Broadcasting and Content Reform package – including the new spectrum tax – has the unanimous support of all sectors of the media industry. To ensure these important reforms are implemented as a cohesive package, the commencement of this Bill will be contingent upon the enactment of the Broadcasting Reform Bill. 


I now turn to the substantive measures in this Bill.




Spectrum tax



The new tax structure set out in this Bill is intended to provide certainty to broadcasters while the Government implements longer-term reform to the spectrum management framework. The Bill is intended to implement key reforms in the overall media package. As such, the tax, as proposed under this Bill, would come into legal operation on 1 July 2017, but only if the Broadcasting Reform Bill is also passed and receives the Royal Assent. In the event the Bill is not enacted by 1 July 2017, the tax will come into effect from that date on a retrospective basis. The retrospectivity of the tax in that event ensures that it is payable from the commencement of the 2017-18 financial year and is consistent with the removal of the existing apparatus tax imposed on broadcasters and the abolition of broadcasting licence fees and datacasting charges, as proposed by the Broadcasting Reform Bill. This is intended to provide for a clean switchover from the old fee and tax arrangements to the new tax structure. 


The Bill sets out upper caps for the tax which are based on classes of transmitters, and also includes a ministerial determination power to set lower tax amounts and provide for rebates. 


The new spectrum tax for television and radio is expected to raise a total of around $40 million in revenue per annum. Unlike the antiquated broadcasting licence fees, the spectrum tax is not based on revenue. Rather, the amount takes account of the power level of the transmitter, the particular band of spectrum used and amount of spectrum used. The use of parameters to determine a tax is a similar approach to that which applies to a number of other spectrum users, such as land mobile operators. 


The tax methodology also supports regional broadcasters with the use of the power parameter. Generally, lower powered transmitters are situated in regional Australia, as distinct from high powered transmitters in metropolitan areas. Given there is less demand for spectrum in regional Australia, use of this spectrum attracts a significantly lower fee. For example, a broadcaster in regional Queensland would pay 99% lower taxes for their use of the same amount of spectrum than a broadcaster in Brisbane.


Overall, the vast majority of broadcasters will pay considerably less in spectrum tax than they currently pay in broadcasting licence fees and charges. This fee relief will enable broadcasters to better manage their business operations and compete in this rapidly evolving market.


However, a small number of broadcasters will face a net increase in overall charges. Through the Broadcasting Reform Bill, the Government will support these broadcasters to ensure that they are no worse off by providing a five year transitional support package ending 30 June 2022. 


This Bill is an essential plank in the Government's overall media reform package, unabashedly designed to support the Australian media industry. The Government has also kept its eye on the long‑game, making sure spectrum is recognised as a valuable resource. As technology advances we will no doubt draw more heavily on this resource. 


Changing taxation arrangements is rarely an easy path, yet industry has done its part by engaging constructively and in good faith to help shape this package. These reforms have the unanimous support of industry and are the end result of extensive consultation with the sector. The package provides certainty for five years on the taxation arrangements and beyond that, this Government does not expect large increases in taxes for broadcast spectrum.


Together with the Broadcasting Reform Bill, this Bill will secure a strong and viable future for the media industry in Australia. Parliament has before it an historic opportunity to deliver comprehensive and holistic reform for the Australian media to ensure that strong Australian voices continue to be heard.


I commend this Bill to the Chamber.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (01:05):  On behalf of the Minister for Defence, Senator Payne, I table a ministerial statement on the implementation of the First Principles Review of Defence and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The statement read as follows—



Over the past two years the implementation of the First Principles Review has helped create a Defence organisation that is far more strategic, far more efficient, and far more effective than the one we inherited when we were elected in 2013.


The First Principles Review was commissioned in August 2014 by my predecessor, David Johnston, to ensure Defence was fit for purpose, able to respond to future challenges and was able to deliver against the Government' s strategy with the minimum resources necessary.


The First Principles Review team, as initially constituted, was chaired by Mr David Peever who was formerly the Managing Director of Rio Tinto. He is also a Non-Executive Director of the Australian Foundation Investment Company and Chairman of Cricket Australia. Other team members included Professor Robert Hill, a former Minister for Defence, Mr Lindsay Tanner, a former Minister for Finance, Professor Peter Leahy, a former Chief of the Army, and Mr Jim McDowell, the Chancellor of the University of South Australia and former Chief Executive of BAE Systems Australia. 


When we announced the Review there was much scepticism about another review of Defence; and for good reason. There have been 35 major reviews of Defence since the early 1970s. However because of the frequency of those reviews many of the recommendations were never able to be implemented before the next review was initiated.


This is why the First Principles Review is so important. It is an end-to-end review of Defence that considered structures, systems and processes. Nothing on this scale had been attempted since the creation of the Department in 1976, which involved the amalgamation of the previously separate three armed services with the civilian department.


As the Review stated, while Defence had a strong and proud history of delivering military capability for Australia, the Defence organisation structure at the time was resulting in processes that were complicated, slow and inefficient. The Review did was highly focused in its criticism of Defence:


""Waste, inefficiency and rework are palpable. Defence is suffering from a proliferation of structures, processes and systems with unclear accountabilities. These in turn cause institutionalised waste, delayed decisions, flawed execution, duplication, a change-resistant bureaucracy, over-escalation of issues for decision and low engagement levels amongst employees.1""


When we came to office in 2013 the challenges for Defence were clear. Defence was faced with delivering ""a significant capability modernisation program against a backdrop of strategic uncertainty including, but not limited to: rapid technological change; budget uncertainty; substantial economic growth in our region; and increasing demand for military responses to various regional and expeditionary crises.2""


In the period since those words were written none of those challenges identified by the First Principles Review team have diminished. If anything, they have only become more pressing.


With the release of the Defence White paper in February last year the Turnbull Government set out its responsible and long-term plan for securing Australia' s national security.


We set out our plans to increase Defence spending to 2 per cent of GDP by 2020-2021 and set out a fully-costed ten year integrated investment program that will create a more capable, agile and potent Australian Defence Force.


This is the capability modernisation program foreshadowed by the First Principles review. These projects must be carefully planned and they require resources – unique skills and expertise – to ensure we are able to deliver the capability our ADF needs to retain its capability edge. That is why we said in the White Paper that successful implementation of the First Principles Review would be critical to realising our plans.


Regionally our strategic environment has become more uncertain over the past four years.


As only one example, weeks of fighting in Marawi in the southern Philippines have highlighted the risk the region faces from violent extremists who claim allegiance to the toxic ideology of Daesh.


Concurrently the rapid advances in technology and rise in prosperity across our region have continued unabated.


The First Principles Review, released on 1 April 2015, recommended that Defence needed to become a single, integrated system, not a federation of separate parts. This is One Defence.


There are four key features of the One Defence approach:


A stronger more strategic centre able to provide clear direction, contestability of decision-making, along with enhanced organisational control of resources and monitoring of organisational performance.


o The strategic centre comprises key senior leadership positions with clear roles and responsibilities that strengthen accountability and top-level decision making


An end to end approach for capability development with Capability Managers assigned clear authority and accountability.


Enablers that are integrated and customer-centric.


A planned, professional workforce with a strong performance management culture at its core.


Given its strong criticism of the Defence organisation it may have been expected that there would be some resistance to the recommendations contained in the review. 


It is very important to note that to the credit of the Defence leadership, in particular the then Secretary Dennis Richardson AO and Chief of the Defence Force Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin AC, the organisation has worked assiduously to implement the recommendations of the Review.


The review team were subsequently invited to form an Oversight Board, which was supplemented with the addition of Ms Erica Smyth, the Deputy Chair of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, and were tasked with overseeing implementation of the recommendations that we agreed should commence immediately. An Implementation Office was also established within the Department to support the Board, as was an Implementation Committee that has met weekly, chaired by the Secretary. 


We have now reached the end of the two year implementation period and very significant progress has been made in delivering on the reforms.


As of today we have implemented 63 of the 75 recommendations of the review. I will focus on some of the detail to illustrate just how these reforms have created a leaner, stronger, more efficient Defence organisation.


A fundamental of the review was to deliver on Government decisions by creating the Capability Life Cycle. The cycle links the early capability concept all the way to its delivery and to its disposal, and greatly simplifies and reduces the time taken for capability decision making. We now have arm' s length contestability, alignment with strategic direction, earlier and better interaction with external stakeholders, and increased accountability for Capability managers.


A key enabler of the new Capability Life Cycle was the review recommendation to bring the former Defence Materiel Organisation back into Defence, which we did, with the creation of the Capability Acquisition and Sustainment Group.


This one change eliminated the administrative burden of having to manually process 72,000 financial transactions between Defence and the DMO every year.


Defence has also drastically simplified its commercial policies and practices. For example, the Defence Procurement Policy Manual has been reduced from 450 pages to 60 pages. 


The number of mandatory procurement requirements we ask of suppliers has been reduced from 290 to 53. 


We have also implemented the new Smart Buyer framework for all projects in Capability Acquisition and Sustainment Group, while the Chief Information Officer Group and Estate and Infrastructure are now piloting the program. 


This approach enables the tailoring of each project by the accountable Capability Manager to ensure that they are delivered with the optimum risk balance between capability, cost and schedule. Industry best practice tools and techniques are used to execute projects in a way that strikes the optimum balance between performance, time and cost. Importantly, industry is now involved much earlier in the process, recognising the key role it plays as a partner in the delivery of Defence capability. 


Not only is this simplification making it easier and more efficient for industry to engage with Defence, but it is also making it much simpler for Government.


Prior to the FPR the average submission to government totalled 70 pages, took 16 weeks to move through the cabinet preparation process and took an average of 46 months – that is almost four years – to move from first pass initiation to second pass approval.


Implementation of the First Principles Review recommendations has resulted in the average government submission reducing to less than 20 pages, taking 6 weeks for the cabinet preparation process and in some instances taking less than 12 months to progress from first to second pass.


In fact the Government has approved 63 Defence submissions this financial year, close to double the previous highest number.


And next financial year is shaping up as an even busier one for Defence with around 80 submissions due for Government consideration.


This of course strongly reflects the Government' s unequivocal commitment to our Defence White Paper, Integrated Investment Program and Defence Industry Policy Statement initiatives across air, land and sea platforms, across the enablers and in fact across Defence.


It would have been impossible without the FPR reforms that we have delivered.


These changes have enabled Defence to progress far more submissions than it has previously, resulting in more efficient delivery of capability. This enables us to deliver the hardware our personnel need to carry out their mission effectively.


Improving the delivery and management of capability acquisition is only one part of the reforms of Defence this Government has driven.


We have created a much stronger strategic centre for Defence and strengthened accountability in support of more effective and efficient enterprise-level decision-making.


We have done this by clarifying the roles and responsibilities at the most senior levels of the Department


- Legislative changes were made to the Defence Act 1903 to formally identify the role of the Chief of the Defence Force and Vice Chief of the Defence Force.


- The individual and joint responsibilities of the Secretary and the Chief of the Defence Force were clearly described in a ministerial joint directive.


- The role of Service Chiefs as capability managers was strengthened, clarifying their responsibility for identifying, developing and delivering Defence' s capability needs.


- Role charters for all members of the senior leadership group have been established, setting out individual and shared accountability, decision rights and agreed leadership behaviours.


These clearer responsibilities have meant the number of committees chaired by senior members of defence has been slashed from 72 to 35, ensuring the Defence executive spends less time meeting, and more time doing.


Another key feature of creating a stronger strategic centre has been the formation of the new integrated Australian Defence Force Headquarters. The stand-up of the headquarters began in April this year, and the model establishes a strategy-led and integrated approach to the development of advice and managing the ADF. To mitigate any single service approaches to ADF capabilities, VCDF has been appointed as the Joint Force Authority, and a new Chief of Joint Capabilities will be established in the next fortnight. The new headquarters is ultimately improving the quality of advice and decision making in Defence.


The review also focussed on improving accountability via specific behaviours. Based on the implementation of several related recommendations Defence has established a culture of personal accountability to drive high performance, foster talent, and effectively manage underperformance.


We have amended Senior Executive Service performance agreements, which now measure individual performance by both outcomes achieved and the demonstration of One Defence Leadership Behaviours in the delivery of those outcomes. Defence is also providing stronger support and coaching to managers and supervisors. A key element of this is having a formal definition of ' good people management'  in the context of the One Defence Leadership behaviours, which is embedded in occupational profiles and recruitment processes. 


These changes have resulted in a common understanding of performance and behavioural standards, and what is expected when managing people. This ultimately increases accountability, fosters a strong performance culture and enhances productivity.


These are just some examples from many reforms of the Defence organisation made as part of the FPR over the past two years.


The future of the First Principles Review


Implementing the Review has been one of the largest organisational change programs in the country and has both national and international significance.


The process followed to deliver the change serves as a valuable example of successfully managing a large scale reform program.


While significant reform has been achieved since implementation began in mid 2015, critical work remains to ensure the full extent of change is realised.


The challenge for Defence and Government now is to ensure we embed the cultural change so that it is routine business and to ensure that the organisation does not revert to its old systems and behaviours. We need to pass the point of no return.


To ensure these changes are fully realised the government will extend the oversight board for another year to provide the necessary guidance and expertise to Defence and Government.


The remaining work will require perseverance and strong leadership, but I am confident given the commitment I have seen from all involved – from the Prime Minister, the oversight board to the senior leadership in Defence – that the One Defence model will be embedded for the future.




Conclusion



Over the past two years we have laid the necessary foundations to enable Defence to continually improve towards the One Defence model.


The Defence organisation of 2017 is a significantly more agile and efficient organisation than the one of 2015, that is better able to support Government decision making and deliver on its operational requirements.


This has not happened by chance. It is the result of the Coalition government recognising a clear problem, initiating a comprehensive review and then driving that change with the clear support of the Oversight board and Defence leadership.


I thank the strong leadership within the department, led by the former Secretary, Dennis Richardson, the Acting Secretary, Brendan Sargeant, and the Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin.


Their unwavering and steadfast leadership has been essential in delivering these reforms. I also acknowledge and thank David Peever and the Oversight Board for ensuring Defence remained on track in implementing the First Principles Review the way it was intended. 


Finally, I would like to thank the personnel, uniformed and APS, within Defence who have worked tirelessly to deliver these reforms on a day to day basis.


The Turnbull Government has helped deliver a Defence organisation that is more strategic, more efficient and more engaged; that can create the future ADF that we envisaged in the 2016 Defence White Paper and respond to a dynamic strategic environment.

 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (01:07):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Quality and Safeguards Commission and Other Measures) Bill 2017 establishes the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission for full scheme NDIS. The Commission will deliver on the Government's commitment to establish nationally consistent quality assurance mechanisms and safeguards for NDIS participants.


The Bill also makes administrative amendments to ensure the efficient and effective operation of the NDIS, resulting from an independent review of the Act in 2015, as required by the Act and supported by COAG.


The NDIS is one of the largest social and economic policy reforms in Australian history. At full scheme, an estimated 460,000 participants will receive supports from thousands of NDIS providers.


The NDIS represents a dramatic shift from services delivered under largely block-funded contractual relationships between providers and primarily state and territory governments, to one where people with a disability purchase and consume services from providers.


The Government has been fully committed to the NDIS from day one. We are bringing forward this Bill to establish a new Commission to oversee quality and safeguards at full implementation of the NDIS. The Commission will:


Register NDIS providers and oversee provider quality


Respond to complaints and manage reportable incidents such as the abuse and neglect of a participant


Provide leadership to reduce and eliminate the use of restrictive practices in the NDIS. The definition within the Bill of a restrictive practice is any practice or intervention that has the effect of restricting the rights or freedom of movement of a person with disability.


Lead the overall design and broad policy settings for nationally consistent NDIS worker screening.


The Bill seeks to balance appropriate protections that meet governments' duty of care obligations, with enabling participants to take reasonable risks in pursuit of their goals. The Commission will support a strong and viable market for disability services that offers people with disability genuine choice and control.


In February 2017, the Disability Reform Council released the NDIS Quality and Safeguarding Framework. The Framework was developed in consultation with people with disability, carers, providers and peak bodies over a three-year period. It outlines the ongoing commitment of all jurisdictions to quality and safeguards for people with disability.


A series of recent inquiries and reports have documented the weaknesses of the current safeguarding arrangements for disability services, many of which result from a disconnection between quality assurance and oversight regulatory functions. These inquiries include the Senate Inquiry into violence, abuse and neglect against people with a disability in institutional and residential settings, Victorian government inquiries, and the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. These inquiries found failures to uncover, report and respond to abuse, and inadequate national screening of workers. They called for nationally consistent provider accreditation and the use of positive behaviour support strategies to reduce challenging behaviours instead of using restrictive practices.


This Bill establishes the Commonwealth's regulatory responsibilities under the NDIS Quality and Safeguarding Framework and in large part forms the basis of the Government's response to the Senate Inquiry.


The new arrangements replace a complex and fragmented system of quality and safeguards in each state and territory, delivering a nationally consistent approach.


The Commission will uphold the rights of people with disability, as part of Australia's commitment to the UN Convention, through the exercise of its registration and regulatory functions. Article 11 of the UN Convention provides that all necessary measures must be taken to ensure the protection and safety of people with disability in situations of risk. Article 16 requires that people with disability be protected from exploitation, violence and abuse.


The Commission will be led by a Commissioner who will be a statutory office holder and staffed by members of the Australian Public Service. The Commission will operate with up to 300 staff, at a total cost of $209 million over four years.


The Bill establishes the Commission in the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 (the Act). The existing objects and principles of the Act will underpin and inform the Commission's regulatory activities. An additional object has been included to provide the specific focus required of this Commission — ""to protect and prevent people with disability from experiencing harm arising from poor or unsafe supports or services under the NDIS"".


In support of the Commission's registration functions, the Bill provides the power to mandate types of supports considered higher risk which can only be delivered by a registered NDIS provider.


The Bill includes a power to issue NDIS Practice Standards benchmarking expectations relating to the quality of support delivery, participants' rights, the management of organisational and operational risk, continuous improvement, legal obligations and workforce management. The registration system requires providers delivering higher risk supports to obtain third-party quality certification against the Practice Standards and providers delivering lower-risk supports to undergo a 'lighter touch' verification process.


Registered NDIS providers will be required to notify the Commission of certain reportable incidents, and comply with all registration conditions and the NDIS Code of Conduct. Establishing the expectations and obligations for NDIS providers will contribute to fostering high-quality and safe supports and services.


The Bill requires registered NDIS providers to maintain complaints and incident management systems in accordance with requirements to be detailed in the rules. It further establishes the Commission's complaints function, which will receive, manage and respond to complaints about NDIS providers and workers. The Commission will provide information about the complaints process to people with disability and also provide information to providers, on best practice complaints handling. The Commission will support people with disability to be heard and provide protections from victimisation should they make a complaint.


The Commission will have extensive compliance and enforcement powers under this Bill, commensurate to the vulnerability of some participants within the NDIS. Monitoring and investigation powers will allow matters to be pursued whether they originate from suspected breaches of registration conditions, the NDIS Code of Conduct, reportable incidents or complaints. Operating as an independent statutory body with integrated functions and powers, the Commission will be a fit-for-purpose, evidence-based, responsive regulator.


Integral to responsive regulation is the ability to monitor changes in the market using data it collects in the course of its regulatory activities. The Bill establishes a market oversight function which will draw on information gathered across the Commission's functions. It will identify provider practice indicating emerging risk and that may contribute to provider failure and unplanned service withdrawal.


Information gathering and sharing provisions within the Bill will support the Commission to work with other regulators and state and territory governments to identify and collect regulatory intelligence.


The Bill provides the Commission with a broad policy design responsibility, including determining scope, information to be considered and a decision-making framework. The states and territories will be responsible for operating worker screening for the NDIS.


The Bill sets out the role of the Commission in providing national oversight and policy settings in relation to promoting strategies to reduce challenging behaviours, and monitoring the use of restrictive practices within the NDIS.


Under the Commission a restrictive practice will only be used as a last resort. It must form part of a behaviour support plan which includes positive behaviour support strategies and which has been developed by a registered behaviour support practitioner. Restrictive practices must also be authorised by the state or territory in which the participant resides.


The Bill provides for the orderly transfer of providers from existing state and territory regulatory environments as each jurisdiction reaches full scheme. The Commission will be established in early 2018 and commence operations in New South Wales and South Australia in July 2018; and in remaining states and territories, except Western Australia, in July 2019. In Western Australia, it


will operate from 2020, subject to final negotiations. NDIS participants will continue to be covered by state and territory quality and safeguards systems until the new Commission is in place at full scheme.


This Bill also amends the NDIS Act in response to an independent review of the operation of the Act. The review, required by section 208 of the Act, considered the operation of the Act in supporting the scheme, and whether any changes were necessary for that purpose. The amendments in Schedule 2 to this Bill were recommended by the review and are supported by COAG in its response to the review recommendations. The amendments are administrative and focus on ensuring the effective operation of the legislation.


For example, the amendments expand on the general supports which can be provided to people with disability under the scheme, to support the implementation of the Information, Linkages and Capacity Building element of the scheme.


The amendments provide clarification of some elements of Act, for example how the disability requirements apply to people with chronic health conditions; how a person with lived experience of disability can become a member of the NDIA Board; and how the NDIA gathers information on people who may be eligible for support under the NDIS.


The Turnbull Government will continue to work with NDIS participants and the disability sector to deliver a fully-funded, high-quality NDIS. This Bill represents a significant step forward in protections for people with disability, their families and carers. We will continue to consult with stakeholders to establish nationally consistent expectations for the conduct of providers, the training and screening of their workers and the quality of supports and services that they deliver under the NDIS.
