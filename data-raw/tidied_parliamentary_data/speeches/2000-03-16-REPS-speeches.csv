"Mr Beazley, MP",ALP,2000-03-16,"—I move:
That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent private members business notice No. 3 from being called on forthwith.
The Convention on the Rights of the Child, article 37, says this—
Motion (by Mr McGauran) put: 
That the member be not further heard. 
—You idiots! 
—It is an ambush. You should have discussed it with me.
—I doubt whether members in the chamber can even hear the question being put and may not therefore know what they are voting on.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2000-03-16,"—Before commenting on the detail of this bill, I would like to make a few observations about the Child Support Scheme. The introduction of the Child Support Scheme a decade ago attempted to put in place a set of principles that I think no-one could disagree with—that is, that parents share in the cost of supporting their children according to their capacity and, secondly, that adequate support is available for all children not living with both parents. The third important reason for the establishment of the Child Support Scheme is the principle that government should not be expected to pay the costs of supporting a child where one or both parents have the financial capacity to do so unassisted.
These are all fairly uncontroversial facts, and ones that any reasonable person would concur with. The problems that many people currently have with the system lie in the judgments it makes about people's capacity to pay, in what circumstances exceptions should be made and how the collection of payments is enforced. The difficulty lies in the fact that complaints about child support are divided evenly between those who pay and those who receive. For every aggrieved payer who argues they are forced to give too much towards the upbringing of their child, there is a payee arguing that they are struggling to meet these costs and they have not got their payment through on time. All of us would certainly be aware of this issue in our own electorates. Some of these issues are resolvable if the government of the day is prepared to work through these issues and talk to the people whom the scheme makes requirements of or guarantees to. But it is important to recognise that the system will never have the capacity to resolve the disappointment and hurt that often go hand in hand with family separation and divorce. The successful resolution of these very human issues lies outside the scope of the Child Support Scheme, and indeed lies outside the scope of the role of government.  
This is an area in which the current government have failed to show leadership and support. They have stripped around $5 billion of social services and other supports from our community, creating a huge social deficit. These services directly assist people to cope with the personal dimension of separation. The government have introduced an unfair tax—the GST—that actively discriminates against those most vulnerable in our community, in spite of the rhetoric by the government about battlers. Child support payers and payees, struggling to mend their lives and go forward, are being slugged. The GST will push up the cost of child support, putting people under further stress. We need to examine very carefully the impact of these changes with the GST. In particular we need to have a close examination of whether some in our community will lose.
The core issue is whether, as a result of the GST, payments that are designed to support the upbringing of children are adequate. While the government claims that people have been compensated, it remains unclear in the case of child maintenance whether payments will keep pace with higher costs. That is because a custodial parent who is receiving appropriate payments from a non-custodial parent meeting their commitment is not in receipt of family assistance. Therefore they will not be a beneficiary of any increase in family assistance, however inadequate that may be, designed to compensate for the introduction of the goods and services tax.
In addition to that, payments by non-custodial parents will not take into account the income tax cuts which people will receive on 1 July as a result of the introduction of the GST. Therefore, my concern is that custodial parents who are already struggling to get by may indeed be worse off as a result of the GST. This is an area that needs examination by the government, because any further economic stress placed on custodial parents will also lead to social disadvantage being reinforced. This needs to be viewed in the context of the fact that a lot of that social support has been taken away by the cuts to social services since the election of the Howard government in 1996.
Only this week, we have seen a classic example of how the GST will put pressure on the most vulnerable in our community. Indeed, the Minister for Community Services would be well aware of that particular group in our community—permanent caravan park residents—because he has 6,649 of them in his electorate of Richmond. Unfortunately, we have seen from this government a refusal to even have dialogue with these Australians. That sends out a message that this government is not prepared to listen to the concerns of the most vulnerable people in our community who, as a result of the ideological agenda being pursued by this government, will suffer the most as a result of the introduction of the GST.
We do have an obligation to make the child support system as fair and painless as we can. I think we still have some way to go before we can truly say that child maintenance is being delivered in this way. This legislation is a step in the right direction in that it seeks to ensure that the system applies fairly and equally to those living outside Australia, whether they be a payer of child support or a recipient. 
This bill also amends Australian domestic law to enable Australia to fulfil its international child and spousal maintenance obligations. The proposed amendments provide for regulations to be made which prescribe for matters relevant to the recognition and enforcement of child support and spousal maintenance liabilities. I will go through some relevant examples: the enforcement of administrative assessments; allowing the Child Support Agency to make an administrative assessment even though the payer is not resident in Australia and does not have an Australian taxable income; in the case of New Zealand, providing that the creation and variation of liabilities will be able to be undertaken only in the country where the payee is resident; obliging each country to assist in locating payers, serving notices and providing advice so that maintenance liabilities can be enforced; allowing the Child Support Agency to collect overseas maintenance liabilities which have not first been registered in an Australian court under the Family Law Act 1975; and, requiring reciprocity in legislative presumptions of parentage. All these measures in this bill appear to the opposition to be uncontroversial in nature. Whatever anyone may think of other parts of the system—and I recognise that there are concerns on the part of both payers and payees—this measure seems to be fair and reasonable. As a result, the opposition will be supporting this legislation.",REPS,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,2000-03-16,"—I will just set the scene for the bill that we are discussing today—the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 2000. This bill has its origins in the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues brought down by the Hon. Roger Price in November 1994. The bill stems from one of the recommendations that was contained in that report. Certainly for members, child support in the community was one of the issues that was right up there in lights. I think all members of the House of Representatives have had constant representations from either custodial or the non-custodial parents in relation to unfairness and inequities that they see in the system. How to manage the issue of child support is certainly very difficult when families break up. It is a very difficult issue for the government to manage fairly for both the parents and also the children of that particular union. The problem is also exacerbated by the fact that one size never fits all—everything is not black and white—and for governments to try to meet all of those competing concerns is extraordinarily difficult when it comes to the very real human problems that are involved.
From my perspective, the current issues that are very important in the minds of people who are affected in this way are matters like that of families which become separated by distance, where a family breaks up and one parent decides to move to the nearest capital city a thousand kilometres away or to the other side of the country and the other parent then does not have access to his or her children. It is very difficult for the government to deal with that particular issue. I just wish parents themselves could deal with things in the interests of their children. The next problem is that, even if parents are separated by long distances, some parents for one reason or other choose not to allow the other parent access to the children. The question of access is certainly very significant for constituents who come to see me. And it is on both sides. This is not a male or a female thing or a custodial or a non-custodial thing; you see it on both sides of the ledger. It is very sad indeed when one parent tries to use the children against the other parent. I just wish that marriages never broke up in the first place, but I guess that is an impossible dream. It is really sad for the children when you see this. Another issue that continues to come before us as members of the parliament is the question of the cost of children—how much money should be paid across and how that should be managed. That is something that members on both sides of the House wrestle with. Generally it surfaces because the non-custodial parent is poor, is unable to get on with their lives and is unable to start a new relationship or a new family. You see some very sad cases indeed. It happens to not only people in relatively poor circumstances but also people in relatively well-off circumstances, and there are reasons for that.
I suppose the government has gone a long way to addressing many of these problems. I was remarking earlier today that it has been the experience in my electorate office that we are seeing fewer constituents with problems with the Child Support Agency or problems related to child support payments. Last year—my memory says July—the government introduced a number of new initiatives that came out of Mr Price's recommendations in particular. It was a pity that they were so long in coming because, when they did come, there was strong support in the community for the particular amendments. The bill we are discussing today is also a response to the 1994 report. Unfortunately it has been a long time coming, but it is often very difficult and very time consuming when you have matters relating to other governments and you have to put all of that together. I guess that is code for: sometimes the bureaucracy does not move all that fast.  
The initiatives last year were in three major categories. They were in relation to changes to the amount of child support payable, changes benefiting second families and changes to improve administration. Initiatives such as these have resulted in some quite remarkable changes within the Child Support Agency itself. The CSA has been improving its client service. I have certainly noticed that in Townsville. The people in our Child Support Agency are extraordinarily caring and extraordinarily cooperative with my office. They bend over backwards to try to solve problems. They understand that when one partner or the other comes to see them that they are emotionally upset and, in the emotion of the moment, tend to say things they really should not have said or do not mean to say. In that sense, the Child Support Agency is very understanding. As members we get claims that if a male goes into the Child Support Agency he is seen by a female who is obviously anti-men. That is just not true. The Child Support Agency is very sensitive to those sorts of things. If a man ultimately thinks that is the case and wants to see a male client service officer he can do that. But I can assure anyone who is listening to this particular broadcast that that is not in the CSA's charter, and the staff of the CSA are very careful to try to avoid being put in that particular situation.
One of the pleasing things is that now over 44 per cent of parents do not need to pay through the Child Support Agency; they pay each other directly. That is a step in the right direction. If parents who are separated can get on well and, as mature adults, can talk to each other and make arrangements and recognise their liabilities, that is a good move forward. I welcome that and support that. I also note, on a technical matter, that the agency's costs have been falling, that the average cost of collecting each dollar has gone to just 13c. That the agency's operational costs are falling is a terrific result for the government. I also note that, if you ask the agency's clients and look at research on the agency's professionalism, you see that is certainly improving. The clients are saying that actions taken by the agency to improve client service are working. Again, I would say to anyone who may be listening to this broadcast that, if they feel that they have a particular problem with the agency, it can be sorted out. They should contact their local member, who would have close links with the agency. I have never had a problem in Townsville in my electorate in being able to resolve any issues of that kind of nature.
In relation to the bill before the House, I am particular interested in and supportive of—as the member for Grayndler is—the arrangements for enforcement of overseas obligations either way. That is, the obligations of Australians who are overseas can be enforced while they are overseas and the obligations of foreign nationals in this country can be enforced within Australia. That is a good move forward. It is understandable that the most number of cases that require this kind of assessment are between Australia and New Zealand. I think everyone would understand why that would be. When this bill goes through, we will have arrangements that will allow cross-Tasman enforcement not only of court orders but also of administrative assessments. Administrative assessments are very important because more and more we are tending towards putting administrative assessments in place because they save the very high costs of going to the Family Court. Of course, the very high costs of going to the Family Court are another matter for discussion at another time. 
I have had constituents complain to me that their partner has gone overseas specifically to avoid child support payments or has made their arrangements so that they can avoid child support payments. This bill will go a long way towards ensuring that those responsibilities are met. I have certainly seen that some smarties among Australians, in situations where they had an Australian assessment, have found they could go to New Zealand, for example, and obtain an assessment there for the specific purpose of extinguishing arrears owed under Australian maintenance orders. That is disgraceful. This bill will put an end to that and the smarties will get their comeuppance.
Of equal importance is the fact that this bill will enable arrangements between the 19 countries that are members of the Hague Convention. For practical purposes, this bill will see Australia's accession to the Hague Convention having the same effect as establishing many bilateral reciprocal arrangements. In that sense, I certainly think we would all support that. The other area of specific interest is the arrangements with the United States of America. As I understand it, child support arrangements in the United States are dealt with on a state by state basis, so the Australian government has been having difficulty in finding a mechanism by which it can enforce Australian orders in the United States. In the reverse case, the states of the United States have had difficulty in enforcing orders or assessments in Australia. Fortunately, the US State Department has proposed that the Australian government sign a new agreement with the US federal government which would put the existing arrangements on a federal level. That is terrific. That is a very good outcome. The agreement with the US federal government will provide for the recognition and enforcement of administrative assessments of child support.
I am very pleased to support this bill. I am certainly among those in the parliament who have some very significant feelings for the parents and children who are affected by separations and marriage breakdowns. I, along with many of my colleagues, want to see done whatever can be done to help both sides of those situations. While wishing that it did not happen in the first place, I recognise that it seems to be a characteristic of modern life that a lot of marriages do not last and I will certainly do what I can to assist where these terrible break-ups happen and where hurt and distress permeate families, including children. I am very strongly supportive of this bill and I thank the opposition for supporting the bill today.",REPS,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Theophanous, Dr Andrew, MP",ALP,2000-03-16,"—The debate on the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 providesus with an opportunity to discuss some of the issues concerning our responsibility as legislators in respect of the rights of children. It is an interesting bill because it reflects the work done by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in particular and also some of the positive efforts that have been made stemming initially from the recommendations made by the joint standing committee on family matters. Nevertheless, those recommendations have been pursued through our department of foreign affairs and it ought to be congratulated for the positive efforts that it has made.
It is interesting that this bill is coming forward from the government at this time because, when you compare it with other things that are happening in the area of support for children, it reflects the contradictory positions which the government is taking on family and children. On the one hand, we have some positive developments such as this but, on the other hand, we have things done by other departments which appear to be opposed to the rights of children, or at least to contradict them. The issue that is live in relation to the rights of children is the mandatory sentencing question. It is interesting to compare the two matters, because one of the provisions involved here is an international agreement, the Hague Convention. We are here looking at signing a convention to protect the rights of children and yet, at the same time, this country is ignoring another international convention concerning the rights of children in relation to the mandatory sentencing issue. I think this brings out the fact that we really have to be a lot more consistent, as a parliament and as a society, in our attitudes to the rights of children. Much has been said about the mandatory sentencing issue. I am one of those who is appalled at the idea that children, in particular, should be subjected to mandatory sentencing. I am also concerned that the Liberal and National parties, because of the internal problems which they are having in trying to get a coherent position on this issue, have prevented the debate and discussion of this question in the House of Representatives and have prevented debate on the bill that went through the Senate. 
Of course, this is not the only matter in which the government's positions on support for children are contradictory. It is very interesting that the department of foreign affairs has done this very positive work, but have a look at what is being done, for example, by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Here we are talking about supporting children in this bill but, as was made very clear in the Four Corners program the other day and by me and others who spoke on the refugee bill that went through the parliament last year, people who are being granted temporary refugee visas at the moment are not allowed to have their wives or children join them. So we grant them refugee status—previously it was permanent residency. That was one issue, and I have made my position clear on that. Not only are we not giving them permanent residency but we are also saying to them that they cannot for three years—until we determine what we are going to do with this three-year visa—bring their spouses and their children to join them. I am not talking about brothers and sisters or parents; I am talking about their spouses and their children. I would be interested to know what the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade thinks about the international perception of Australia, given that provision.
This is the way the government is proceeding. It is proceeding on a contradictory basis in relation to these international conventions concerning family and children. On the one hand, it says, `We'll give people rights.' On the other hand, it says, `We won't give people rights.' In fact, it is taking rights away, because previously when we granted people refugee status we gave them the right to bring their spouses and their children. We did not give them automatic rights about brothers and sisters or anything like that, but at least we gave them that fundamental right—the right of a person to be united with their spouse and their dependent children. I believe the failure to put that provision in—even if you let the three-year rule go through—is cruel and contrary to international obligations. I would urge the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, if anybody is here from the department, to make this point to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Many international bodies, such as the Refugee Council of Australia and Amnesty International, have made representations about this cruel provision in the new refugee category.
So here we have some positive legislation for child support, but negative things are also being done—I have already mentioned the mandatory sentencing issue—such as the treatment of the new category of refugees where their children cannot join them. But there are other things, and this goes to the heart of how these arrangements work. At the moment we have a situation where, judging by his performance yesterday, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs seems to think that there are votes to be gained by getting up and slamming the family reunion program. He keeps saying that the family reunion program is costly and so on. Everything that he said yesterday about that matter of the parents was completely misleading and his so-called facts were false. But that is another story.
The point is this issue in relation to children. Let us address this issue. When a person is granted permanent residence now in Australia after coming through some immigration program or some refugee program—leaving aside the matter that I mentioned before but taking the normal refugee program or the permanent residence program—especially in the permanent residence program, if an Australian citizen or an Australian permanent resident marries someone from overseas, is the House aware that in some countries it can take as long as 18 months for the spouses to be united? This is not because there is some question of the genuineness of the issue but simply because there is a de facto queue placed on the union of spouses. In some cases, we also have children involved in these matters. So here we are on the one hand saying, `Let us put into place these regulations and these new arrangements so that we can make sure people meet their obligations to child support, but on the other hand there are issues about our failure to support marriages when we have a situation where people who are genuinely married can wait up to 18 months for their spouse to come to Australia. The minister tries to justify this on the basis that he has some kind of quota in relation to these matters. But there should not be quotas when it comes to the fundamental, basic right of marriage. Assuming that a marriage is genuine, we should not be saying to people, `If you as an Australian citizen marry a person from overseas or you have a child with somebody from overseas, you should be separated from them.'  
I point all these matters out because it seems to me that some coherence is required on family and child policy. We cannot treat people differently. On the one hand we are saying, `Look, here are some very positive developments.' I support these developments. I support the enforcement of child support arrangements where one person is in one country and one is in another, if that is what they choose. But how about things like visitors' visas? I have raised this issue in parliament on a number of occasions. With the current situation in respect of visitors' visas, if we have a separated couple and the father, for example, wants to come and visit the child in Australia, it is likely under the current arrangements that that person is going to have a lot of trouble if they are coming from certain countries simply to visit their child and to do the right thing as the non-custodial parent.
We are saying that, yes, we are going to try to enforce that you meet your obligations as a non-custodial parent in terms of payments—and I support that—but we are also not doing anything about asking the department of immigration about this visa policy, especially as it applies to countries other than the 29 where you can get automatic visas to visit Australia. What about those other countries? What is happening to non-custodial parents in these cases? It is an interesting question, given the fact that visitors' visas from these areas are being seriously hampered. Notwithstanding the protestations of the minister, from some countries a very high rejection rate occurs, even for relatives coming to visit in Australia.
We ought to think about this in terms of the impact on children. If we are genuine—and again I congratulate the members of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and those in the Department of Family and Community Services who were involved in these positive developments—then we have to get some coherence here. If we support children and we support ensuring that the non-custodial parent pays their fair share in orders of the court, we also ought to be saying to the non-custodial parent, `You can come to Australia and visit your child or children.' We also ought to be taking up these other issues which are creating separation of spouses and of at least one parent and their child or children. 
From a humanitarian point of view it is time we really tried to get the different sections of the government into one coherent totality in respect of these issues. I am not here making an appeal for political point scoring; I am here saying that if we as a society are really interested in the welfare of children then we have to have coherence. We have to get rid of the contradictions that exist in our policies in relation to the rights of children. I repeat again what I said at the beginning, that we have to face the issue of mandatory sentencing of children, we have to face the issue of the refugees who are here and who cannot be united with their children and we have to face all the various bureaucratic things that are put in place with regard to married people or people who are separated being able to visit their children in Australia. 
All of those things have to be addressed if we are actually to ensure that child support means not merely making sure that people pay their financial obligations but looking after the welfare of children in a broader sense. If we are going to do that, then we have to ensure that the provisions in this bill are also met. The Hague Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Maintenance Liabilities is an excellent convention and, even though it is somewhat late in the piece, nevertheless it is a good thing that Australia is now going to sign this convention and is going to participate in the requirements of the convention. But, of course, the convention covers only a number of countries; it does not cover all the countries that we are concerned about, given that we are an immigration society and given that we have people here from virtually every country in the world. I would be interested to know from the minister what proposals are in train for ensuring that we meet obligations with respect to other countries. I know that the bill is structured in such a way as to allow the formation of new regulations with respect to other countries, but does the minister himself have any proposals for new arrangements with countries beyond those which are mentioned in the bill and, in particular, those countries from which recent migrants have arrived? I am speaking especially about countries in Latin America, in Asia, in Africa and in the Middle East. This bill does not actually cover most of those countries. I would be interested to know, Minister, whether you have in train discussions, either through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade or through your department, for putting into place arrangements for these other countries besides the ones that are referred to in the bill. 
In relation to the United States of America, which is another section of the bill, having lived in the United States myself for a couple of years and having seen what happens between the different states of America in relation to maintenance arrangements, which can become a complicated process even within America, I think it is a very good thing that we are signing this new agreement at a national level. Those people in our embassy in Washington and others who have been involved, including the United States Embassy here, who have initiated this new agreement ought to be congratulated, and I support that agreement.
In conclusion, I call upon the government to consider the possibility that on the question of the rights of children there should be an interdepartmental committee of some kind, or perhaps a number of ministers getting together, so that we can have some consistency on the question of the rights of children and that we all in this parliament try to legislate consistency in relation to children across the board and do away with mandatory sentencing, do away with this dreadful thing about refugees not being able to unite with their children and overcome the other hurdles in this bill that I have mentioned. I commend the bill to the House.
Debate (on motion by Mr Anthony) adjourned.",REPS,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2000-03-16,"—The bills before the House today, the A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits) Bill 2000 and the cognate bill, constitute further evidence of the hypocrisy of the government on the question of roll-back of the GST and of the rest of the tax package. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister both promised earlier this year that they would not be making any further changes to their tax proposals, but these bills breach yet again these undertakings. They breach them in two ways. First, there is further legislative amendment to the GST act to insert the new exemption. This is something that the Treasurer said there would not be. On the Neil Mitchell program on Monday, 24 January, when asked, `Does this mean no more changes?' the Treasurer said:
Well, it does mean that we are not changing the legislation, that we've got it right. As you implement these things there have to be further rulings, but they are just rulings as to how the tax office applies the concepts. But we're not changing the legislation. 
Here they are today changing legislation. They are doing it by inserting a new exemption, and inserting a new exemption is something the government claims is bad if it is done by us but apparently good if it is done by them, if it can be done without, in their view, any adverse effects.
Secondly, the bills also involve a significant policy roll-back concerning the cap on fringe benefit exemption for public benevolent institutions. This roll-back backdown will cost almost $300 million over the next four years. So much for the notion that it is Labor out there saying, `Let's roll it back in this area and let's roll it back in that area,' while the government say, `No, can't do roll-back. Roll-back makes it more complicated.' Here they are by this bill announcing roll-back to the tune of $300 million over four years. On 25 February, the Sydney Morning Herald reported a spokeswoman for the Treasurer commenting on this issue. She said:
If the loophole is left open it means it will have to be funded by some other part of the budget.
In other words, if the government makes any further concessions on this FBT cap, the cost of that will have to be borne by expenditure cuts in other aspects of the budget. Since then, the Treasurer has increased quite substantially what his spokeswoman has called a `loophole'. He has increased the loophole in the forward estimates by almost $300 million, a fact confirmed in an official briefing. This decision has worsened the budget bottom line, because of the actions of not the Senate, not the opposition, but the Treasurer.
The roll-back does not just end there. Yesterday, the Treasurer was at it again. His press release No. 13 announced a change in the GST rules for small businesses which provide financial services as an incidental part of their business—something he claimed earlier this year was unnecessary. The Treasurer is simplifying the administration for small business. He is proposing to change his complex dog's breakfast of a tax to make it simpler. Labor welcomes such announcements because, amongst other things, they confirm our criticisms of the complexity and flaws in the legislation. The changes are consistent with the direction that we will be taking. He and other members of the government have been attacking us, claiming that any further changes to the GST will make it more complex, yet they are forced to make changes themselves. As for the complexity, it is impossible to make this GST more complex. It has already achieved world best practice in terms of its complexity. Certainly Labor will be focusing on reducing the compliance burden on small business as part of its roll-back response. The change announced by the Treasurer yesterday confirms that further simplification is necessary.
There is now some professional estimate of the actual size of the initial compliance burden of the GST. I referred to this in the House yesterday in asking a question of the Treasurer, who refused to answer it—but that is not unusual; he refuses to answer all questions. It was supplied unwittingly by probably the fiercest advocates of the GST, the National Farmers Federation. They have ideologically pursued the GST for years. They have been a shameless cheer squad for this most unfair and inefficient of taxes. Yet what did they tender yesterday as evidence in the national wage case hearings? They tendered a report by Professor Binh Tran-Nam of ATAX from the University of New South Wales called The implementation costs of the GST in Australia: a preliminary analysis. Remember: this is referring to the initial costs of preparing for the GST, not the ongoing costs. The estimate of the initial cost is $4.3 billion and it collects $27½ billion in a year. This is an extraordinary take in terms of the return. The implementation and social compliance costs are $4.3 billion, according to the National Farmers Federation expert report. Of this, $2.8 billion is business initial costs and $1.5 billion is government costs. On page 9, the report says:
As a result of its GST implementation, Australian business will incur an additional one-off net cost of about $2.8 billion. This amount is very significant, representing about 10% of the expected GST revenue of $27.2 billion in 2000-01.
So it is going to cost business 10 per cent of the amount collected of the 10 per cent GST just to get ready for it—just as an initial hit—and that figure excludes the $2 billion per year in ongoing costs that the government admits to in its regulatory impact statement on the GST legislation. So much for an efficient new tax system. But the government has assumed away this problem. PRISMOD, the government's tax package model, ignores the problem of compliance costs completely. Can you imagine this? The compliance costs of business are $2.8 billion and the government wishes them away. It just wishes away $2.8 billion worth of the impact on the economy and the impact in terms of compensation. It assumes there are none, when there are many billions of dollars worth. Indeed, I would suggest that the Speaker's office has personally been involved in some GST pricing implementation issues concerning its seminars. It has had some first-hand experience in this regard, Mr Deputy Speaker. It knows just a fraction of the compliance nightmare that business will be confronting. Professor Binh Tran-Nam knows about this too. His NFF paper goes on to say: 
Most of these costs will be ultimately passed on to the consumers. This will add further pressure to the one-off rise in the consumer price level as a result of the introduction of the GST. The initial inflationary pressure was not considered by the federal Treasury in its analysis of the GST-induced consumer price rise.
Understand that point: here is the government saying that the GST impact on inflation will be minimal, when it has ignored this huge hit. Not only is the rate of inflation important when it comes to the driving up of interest rates—and we have already seen evidence of that in advance of the GST coming in—but it also goes to the question of compensation. If compensation is being awarded on the basis of a lower than realistic inflation rate, of course they will claim that people are being adequately compensated; but they are not because they are being compensated off a false base, a base on which the NFF's own submission to the national wage case has blown the government's case out of the water. What they have done is to out the Treasurer on this, on one of the serious economic flaws which, again, has been alluded to, pointed out and demonstrated by Labor from the start through the Senate inquiry process. It is the professor's next observation that is so devastating for the government. He continues:
Most seriously, the high implementation costs of the GST cast doubts on the supposed welfare gains of the GST-based tax reform. Simplicity is, after all, an aspect of efficiency.
He then goes on to compare the estimated long run efficiency gains by both Professor Peter Dixon and by the Prime Minister's preferred modeller, Mr Chris Murphy of Econtech. What does he conclude when he takes into account what other models say about this? He says:
The estimated increase in tax operating costs is clearly much higher than the most optimistic GST-induced efficiency gains estimate.
In shorthand, GST costs significantly outweigh the benefits. This tax is not simple. It is not efficient. It is very costly and, on top of that, it is incredibly unfair.
Let us go to the detail of the bills that are before us. As most members would know, fringe benefits tax is a tax on employers on the value of non-salary and wage benefits provided to their employees. It is imposed on employers to facilitate compliance and administrative efficiency. There are only 67,000 FBT taxpayers, compared with probably millions of employees deriving fringe benefits. It collected $3.3 billion in 1998-99. 
The Ralph Review of Business Taxation proposed to shift the FBT from business to individuals. The Treasurer rejected that proposal, and rightly so. In that he showed the hypocrisy inherent in the GST because it is imposed on every consumer in terms of  them paying, rather than there being a smaller number of collection points. He said that the current collection method—that is, in relation to the FBT—was very efficient, which it is. Yet he is proposing the most inefficient method for collecting the GST. With the GST, he has created at least one and a half million new taxpayers. Every small business around the country is now going to be an unpaid tax collector for the federal government. Currently, the indirect tax system—the wholesale sales tax—is collected by just 75,000 units around the country. It raises more than half the revenue of the GST in an infinitely more efficient way.
So, while Labor's position on efficiency and simplicity is consistent, the Treasurer's is totally inconsistent. FBT is levied at the maximum marginal rate applicable to individuals, plus the Medicare levy, reflecting the fact that the overwhelming benefit from fringe benefits goes to high income earners who would otherwise face this rate of tax on salary or wage income. Certain non-profit and charitable bodies obtain fringe benefits tax exemptions or concessions by way of a rebate. The government claims that these concessions are being abused and in this bill has proposed limits on the concessions. Despite the fact that the FBT is legally levied on employers, it is most often borne, at least in part, by employees in their salary package arrangements. Obviously, such an impact varies between employers. 
There are four basic areas of change to the FBT that are proposed in this legislation. One is to limit the currently unlimited fringe benefits tax exemption for certain employers, namely public benevolent institutions—which, for the purposes of the ongoing debate, I will refer to generically as `charities'—and public and private non-profit hospitals and to limit the rebate arrangements applying to other non-profit bodies such as private educational institutions, sporting bodies and some other charitable bodies. It also covers provisions covering the GST's complex interaction with the FBT system, including a new increased grossed up formula, new exemptions for remote area housing benefits and meals provided by primary producers, and technical amend-ments to the way fringe benefits are treated in the calculation of liability under the Medicare levy surcharge.
As for the limitation on FBT exemption for non-profit bodies, the proposed limit for charities, hospitals and other non-profit bodies is contentious. The government argues that the current provisions are being abused, although the non-profit sector disputes the claim. There is evidence of widespread use of the FBT exemptions by charities—up to 30 per cent of salaries—and, in some states, extensive use in the public and not-for-profit hospital systems. Victoria was particularly active in using salary packaging in the Kennett years. It is not limited to senior executives and doctors but includes large numbers of nurses and other staff. The loss of the FBT exemption would have serious implications for the continuing operation of some charities and hospitals.
Labor has been arguing since 19 October last year that the issue of the impact of the whole of the taxation system, including the FBT, on the non-profit sector should be examined by an independent inquiry. We renewed the call for an inquiry when this bill was introduced. The inquiry could have been completed by now if the government had listened to our suggestions, but it did not. What it did instead was to sit on the legislation until last week. Now it is trying to blame non-government parties for its delay. Unfortunately, it succeeded to some extent with some in the press gallery, but the claim is absolutely false. This was a policy announced 18 months ago by the government but it did not bring the legislation in till last week. It still has to get through the Senate and it is supposed to operate from 1 April. Labor has not been given adequate time to fully consider all of the complexities in the bill but we are being cooperative in the passage of it, nevertheless. 
There is no public data on the behaviour of non-profit bodies regarding FBT other than some aggregate data in the Treasury tax expenditures statement. This information deficiency is one of the key issues that we need the independent inquiry to address. Nonetheless, there is considerable revenue estimated to be raised from the measure—some $170 million in the next financial year, rising to $190 million by 2003-04. So the parliament needs to be aware of the full data on this important issue. 
The key issue is that the government's proposals involve withdrawing this $170 million a year in revenue from the charitable hospital and non-profit sectors. The key question that then arises is: how will it impact on service delivery from these vital community and public organisations? The government has never addressed how this reduction in resources will be accommodated by the sector and this bill is not accompanied by any offer of compensation to offset the inevitable rise in the wages bill with these sectors. Indeed, the issue has not even been publicly raised by the government at all during the debate.  
We need to remember that the government, of its own accord, has modified its original proposals in this bill. The original proposals treated all FBT concession bodies the same in imposing a $17,000 grossed up exemption limit per employee. What is now proposed is a differential scheme. Charities and other bodies face a regime of $25,000 grossed up exemption per employee but hospitals retain the limit of $17,000. A harsher regime, therefore, will apply to hospitals than to charities. No explanation has been given as to why the government has made that distinction. The distinction has cut nearly $300 million out of the forward estimates over four years. This roll-back, therefore, has reduced the funding available for the next four years by $300 million. 
Labor is being consistent in its call for an inquiry into the whole impact of the tax system on the charitable and not-for-profit sector. We call again on the government to institute that inquiry so that the FBT proposal can be examined in the context of the full tax environment faced by these bodies, including the GST, about which there is much consternation in this sector. I now move the following amendment to the motion for the second reading of this bill: 
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House calls on the Government to institute an independent inquiry into the impact of the tax system, and proposed changes to the tax system, on the charitable, non-profit and public health sectors so that the provisions in the bill can be properly assessed”. 
I call on the government again to support this process. It could have been completed if they had listened to us five months ago. If the government does not institute an independent inquiry, a Senate inquiry will be pursued. Let us remember that the delay has been entirely of the government's doing. It reflects its unsuccessful efforts to reach an agreement with the Democrats. 
The second aspect of this legislation deals with the interaction of the GST with the FBT. It is an interaction that is terribly complicated. It dramatically and further complicates the regime. Just so as you understand this new efficient tax system, Madam Deputy Speaker, the publication that I have in front of me is the calculation or the interaction done by Ray Regan of the GST's effect on the FBT. That is one aspect only of the GST, but look how thick it is. It runs to 212 pages, and this is before the legislation we have here today. That is the complexity of this tax just as it interacts only with the fringe benefits tax. Forget about all the other complexities associated with this great new simple tax, Minister. You cannot even explain it in terms of caravan parks, even though you tell them one thing in your electorate and come and vote a different way down here. But go and tell them this is a simple new tax, when you need almost a telephone book—
—I will tell you about your deceit, my friend, in your electorate. You tell them that they will get relief from you and that you will be in there batting for them in relation to caravan parks in your electorate, in which there are many residents and voters. Are you going to do that, Minister? Are you going to stick by your claim on caravan parks? You are a fraud, my friend. You tell them up there that you are going to give them relief and you come down here in your obsequious way and rat on them. You will not do it. The nightmare will simply get worse and worse. The other fact to remember—
—What is this babble over here? Go back to the caravan parks and explain your hypocrisy, my friend. The other fact to remember is that these proposals involve a very significant increase, of nearly $1 billion.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The bill we are discussing is quite specific. It is the A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits) Bill 2000. There is no relationship with caravan parks. I ask you to draw the member for Hotham back to the bill. He is clearly moving right outside the areas of this particular bill.
 (Mrs De-Anne Kelly)—Generally, Speakers allow wide-ranging debate, but perhaps the matter of caravan parks is somewhat specific. The member for Hotham might be good enough to talk about the new tax system bill. 
—I accept that, Madam Deputy Speaker. The reference to caravan parks, of course, was to the minister's hypocrisy, which I think is well known and will continue to become widely known in his electorate as time goes on. But the fringe benefits tax income provided in the form of benefits means that John Howard and Peter Costello are taxing income at record levels. The new gross-up rate involves a 10 per cent increase from 1.94 to 2.13. The huge increase in income tax simply reinforces the hypocrisy of the coalition on tax. They run around falsely accusing Labor of putting up income taxes and then they do what they accuse us of. This is one example in the bill, and then you have the Timor tax as another one.
—You are against Timor; is that right?
—These are your tax increases, my friend. The reasons for the need for these provisions is that generally employers obtain a credit for the GST they pay on providing their employees with fringe benefits. The credit has to be taken into account by the FBT system or else the GST will provide a concession to employees obtaining fringe benefits relative to employees who use their salary to purchase the same fringe benefits on which they would pay the GST. The regime is not opposed by Labor at this stage based on initial cursory examination, although there may well be anomalies in some areas. Industry sources have not yet had time to fully analyse the legislation. Further complications also arise where fringe benefits which are GST free are input taxed. 
But it does not stop there. There are complementary provisions to amend the GST legislation. Just a few weeks ago the Treasurer told us that there would not be any more legislative changes and then he comes in and changes legislation. If he can do it on these, why can't he do it on the other things, including your caravan parks, Minister? These deal with the situation where an employee receives fringe benefits from an employer but makes a contribution to some or all of the cost.
There are also in this bill important exemptions for remote area housing and some meal expenses. The concessions apply not only to housing but also to housing loans, residential fuel and other housing costs. Remote area housing was defined as housing which is not within 40 kilometres of urban areas of 14,000 population in 1981, or within 100 kilometres of an urban area with a population of 130,000 in 1981. This is obviously of major benefit to many remote area employers and their employees such as in the mining industry. It is estimated to cost $35 million a year. But of course this was not the original government policy, either. This is also roll-back. The government's original proposal was to provide relief in respect of employees in the mining industry. This was Labor's proposal prior to the last election as well. However, the financial impact statement in the explanatory memorandum at page 1 notes:
The FBT exemption for remote area housing has not been previously announced.
And that is very interesting because this is the explanatory memorandum that was issued by the Treasurer. Again, it says: 
The FBT exemption for remote area housing has not been previously announced.
But the Treasurer announced it in a press release issued by his office back on 25 November. Then he issued an explanatory memorandum that does not even recognise that he announced it before. It is a further unfunded roll-back to the tune of $15 million a year. In fact the opposition thinks that the memorandum is incorrect for the reason that I have outlined. He announced it, but the explanatory memorandum which he released does not know what he did. He does not like to call it roll-back. He says, according to today's Financial Review:
It's a more technically robust and better system to achieve the original policy intent.
Sounds like roll-back to me, and of course it is roll-back. The date of that press release is also interesting because it was a week before he made that other famous foray into his solution for regional Australia: `Take a pay cut.' This is the Treasurer's view as to how you get things going in the regions: `Take a pay cut.' It was also in the same newspaper article that he said he would not be going to the Olympics; that he was going to invite visiting heads of state to eat pizza on their knees with him—but he has booked the king suite at the Novotel.

 (Mrs De-Anne Kelly)—Is the amendment seconded?
—I second the amendment moved by the shadow Treasurer.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2000-03-16,"—I rise today in support of A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits) Bill 2000 which is part of the government's ongoing program of introducing the new tax system which will be a major benefit to the people of Australia. There is no doubt about the hypocrisy of the member for Hotham. If you want to talk about hypocrisy, just go back and look at the ALP documents before the last election and you will see where the hypocrisy comes from. Not only does the member for Hotham not have any plans himself about how he is going to develop a tax system for Australia; he also says that as of 1 July he has no plans to roll back the GST. He has plenty of criticisms day by day, day in and day out, but so critical is he and so concerned is he that as of 1 July he will simply allow it all to happen. That shows great conviction, great concern, as we all know. 
Let me draw to the attention of House what was included in the ALP's 1998 election manifesto, chapter 6, entitled `Paying for the benefits'. This is your manifesto, not that of this side of the House. This is what you say, yet you have the audacity to comment about hypocrisy regarding the minister and the chair. Let me read what you guys had to say about it:
A Labor Government will reform the Fringe Benefits Tax to limit the value of FBT benefits that can be provided by certain institutions which enjoy concessional FBT treatment to $17,000 of grossed up benefits per employee.
So concerned are they in moving these amendments today, this legislation actually refers to what they had in their own documents. Talk about hypocrisy: before the election this was a good way to go, but after the election we suddenly see all these obstacles. They have delayed these provisions in the bill for months. They would not reach agreement. They were continually running to the media and talking about the problems—yet here we have the provisions included in this bill in the ALP manifesto: concessional FBT treatment of $17,000 of grossed up benefits per employee. I also note in that that fringe benefits are able to be used to avoid means tests for some taxation and social security measures which ignore the value of fringe benefits to calculate eligibility. 
All the way through, they have said one thing before the election but presented a very different situation after it. We all remember that being done in a previous election when Prime Minister Keating announced his l-a-w proposals for tax cuts. It is the same hypocrisy; these are the same provisions. Before the election the opposition said, `This is how we are going to fund it. We are going to cut back these FBT provisions and the generous treatment of $17,000.' But then the government introduces provisions which are for $25,000 for certain charitable institutions and $17,000 for all hospital employees. That amount has a certain ring to it: it was actually included in the ALP documents. I cannot understand the level of sheer hypocrisy that exists on the other side. Don't you think people remember what you said before? It is quite simple where you stand: you stand for nothing except cheap politically expedient moves.
Let us turn to the provisions of the bill. This is all part of the announcement by Senator Rod Kemp in December last year. Senator Kemp advised that the government would:
... introduce legislation to clarify the interaction between the fringe benefits and the GST. Once enacted the legislation will ensure that the supply of goods and services by an employer to an employee is not subject to GST where the supply is subject to fringe benefits tax (FBT).
It was foreshadowed at that time, and we have been waiting for the Democrats and the Labor Party. They have been dragging their heels saying, `This is unfair to charities; it is unfair to hospitals.' It is unfair to everyone they can think of. They have no provisions and no practical solutions and they are in total contradiction of the document they put out before the last election. 
This bill is about making the system fairer for all Australians; it is about equity. There is no doubt at all—and I am sure all members would agree—that rorting of the FBT system has occurred by charitable institutions. There is no doubt about that. Everybody is agreed on that. There is clear evidence of that. But isn't it appropriate that, where this has occurred, we can close the loopholes to ensure that we have equity. Why should it be that an employee in one organisation has to pay the full rate of tax and another employee in another organisation is simply able to cash up half of their income in FBT? That sort of inequity and unfairness goes against the very grain of Australia. The provisions in this legislation recognise that an employee who works for a non-profit organisation or a charitable institution is clearly recognised as such and that while, very often, they are not able to be paid as much, they provide a very worthwhile activity in the community. That is why the first $25,000 for those charitable institutions is recognised as FBT exempt. And hospital employees, because of their significant role in public health care, have the exemption of $17,000. I think we would all agree that $17,000 is a pretty fair amount. If you choose the average Commodore or Falcon and look at the costs of running that vehicle—for example leasing and maintenance costs—they would undoubtedly add up to $17,000. It means that employees in public—not private—hospitals are actually able to have a normal car FBT free under those provisions. It is recognition of the particular role that the charities and hospitals play.
The bill also provides measures for remote housing. In terms of the actual provisions—the overuse of the FBT concessions by PBIs—it has been going on for a long time. It is recognised that this has gone on, and the way in which the whole tax provisions have been manipulated to allow for at least half of the salaries in these benevolent institutions to be taken away in FBT provisions is simply unfair. It is a question of equity; it is a question of fairness, even though we recognise the worthwhile and significant activities that these charities take on board in Australia. Of course, the Australian community depends on them very much—I know a lot of the key players in these charities. We all recognise the Salvation Army, St Vincent de Paul and World Vision. They play a magnificent role in our society for which we are all very grateful. Not by any means would we want to take away from the rights of these organisations or the special role that they play in Australia. It is simply a question of saying that, with clearly recognised charities, we will provide up to $25,000, which will provide not only cars but also some provision for housing. 
I think that is appropriate, but it is also putting firmly on the table that we will not allow a continued use where there is no limit on the FBT that is able to be used by hospitals and recognised charitable institutions. Nor will we allow manipulation of the FBT-free provisions, which they have done in the past. I think that is entirely appropriate and entirely fair.
We clearly knew what the ALP's position was before the last election. It has suddenly changed and we now have the provisions announced through the amendments moved by the member for Hotham. It is also clear that the ALP must recognise that, in terms of the budget provisions, unless the requirements contained in this legislation are enacted, there will be a $400 million hole in the budget. They are always very good at coming up with where money should be spent—on this, that and the other—but there are no suggestions as to how this $400 million can be replaced. It is simply rhetoric and cheap political opportunism from them.
I think it is also important to say that the government recognises, and is thankful for the fact, that the vast majority of eligible employers do not abuse the current FBT exemptions. We are not saying that there is widespread abuse; most people do the right thing. We simply want to remove loopholes that allow the exploitation of the FBT treatment. It is also important to note that the threshold will not include benefits that are already exempt or not classified as benefits under existing law, such as the superannuation provisions. On top of this, the concessional methods of valuing some benefits greatly increase the total value of benefits that will fit within the threshold. 
Let us look at the question of remote area housing. I think this is an important provision. We need to look increasingly at the requirements of regional Australia and remote Australia. I myself have had representations from the police. They talked about the way in which they live in remote areas and that they have no choice when they are sent to remote areas. They are required to live in government housing, provided by the police force, and they would be required to pay FBT on the houses they occupy. Where individuals are in a remote location—and the definitions are contained in this legislation; for instance, locations more than 100 kilometres outside larger towns or cities of 100,000 or more and more than 40 kilometres outside smaller towns—there is recognition that this will make it much fairer to those who, because of the requirements of their job, have to live in these locations.
In the past these exemptions have been provided for primary producers, and I think it appropriate that that was the case. Obviously, the government has decided to extend this exemption to not only the primary producers and those people involved with mining companies but all employees so that there is fairness for those who are posted perhaps as part of a medical requirement or as part of a police force—anybody who has to go to these remote locations—and who are provided with housing and meet the criteria. They will be exempt from the FBT provisions in the bill. When announcing the change last year, the Treasurer said:
This measure will provide assistance to small businesses, remote area communities and State and local government and highlights the government's commitment to the promotion of regional Australia.
The Deputy Prime Minister, who has done so much for regional Australia and outback Australia, as you would know, Madam Deputy Speaker Kelly, and whose own electorate includes significant sections of outback Australia, reiterated these comments. He said:
This move relieves some of the cost burden for labour in regional, rural and remote Australia, flowing on to more jobs and more people in the bush.
I think that is to be welcomed. I talked to the police association as recently as yesterday, and I know that they welcome the provisions included in this bill. Not only does it relate to housing; it also allows an FBT exemption for all meals, excepting meal entertainment, that are provided on a work day to primary production workers in remote areas. That was part of the National Party's campaign platform in 1998. They promised in 1998 and here they are delivering it. We can contrast that with the Labor Party's manifesto before the last election: they promised they would limit it to $17,000. What do they do when they come in? They throw it away. They want to forget it and say, `We're the heroes to charities. We don't want to have any restrictions. We'll just totally ignore what we said before.' I think the contrast between a party of integrity and a party of immediate political opportunism is clearly noted.
Moving on to the new gross-up formula, I think it is important and is required as part of the transition to the new tax system. The main interaction between the GST and the FBT will be through the grossing-up of FBT. The legislation introduces a new gross-up formula that takes the GST inputs into account. As we all know, under the new tax system, employers registered for the GST and with an Australian Business Number will be able to claim GST input credits on any business related purchases, including most fringe benefits. The new formula recovers any input tax credits received in the provision of a fringe benefit to an employee or their associate.
It must be noted that the new formula only applies to those fringe benefits where the employer is entitled to claim a GST input credit for the benefit. Should that benefit be GST free or should the employer not be able to claim input credits, the existing gross-up formula will continue to apply. This formula is also necessary to further ensure that the tax treatment between cash salary and fringe benefits remains neutral following the arrival of the GST. Were this new formula not to exist, the incentive would be there for employees to convert cash salary into fringe benefits, thus avoiding the GST on those items. Quite obviously, the new grossing-up formula is a vital part of this bill and the new tax system as a whole. 
Finally, we have the Medicare amendment that is part of the A New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Act 1999. Under current law, a one per cent Medicare levy surcharge is imposed on a person's reportable fringe benefits total in the year of income. The tests to determine liability are based on a person's or couple's combined income and reportable fringe benefits.
The surcharge introduced by the government can be avoided if an individual takes out private health insurance, which is a great incentive. I cannot remember the member for Jagajaga complimenting the government on this provision to encourage people into the private health system, thereby relieving the pressure on government run hospitals, but we know the member for Jagajaga for her hypocrisy. We look forward to her explaining why her manifesto before the election was to limit the `rorting' to 17 per cent and why she suddenly finds it politically expedient to run around the hospitals saying, `I'll be your saviour. I'll help you out. I'll bag this system.' Never mind the manifesto she put her name to before the election. Does she revoke the manifesto of 1998 to restrict packaging to 17 per cent of their income? Will that be the case? Will she totally ignore that and say, `No, we didn't mean that. We're terribly sorry; we made a mistake. Yes we said it, but we believe we were totally wrong'? Will she say it, or will it all be part of the normal ALP rhetoric to say one thing before the election and after the election to conveniently forget about it and to run all over Australian hospitals saying, `We'll help you out. You can charge whatever you want in terms of the FBT. You can manipulate the tax system so that you can have this gross exploitation of the benefits that are there, where often half of the salary is taken in FBT provisions'? I look very much forward to the member for Jagajaga explaining this dichotomy of views—one view before the election and another after it.
There are provisions in this legislation that will do much to ensure the avoidance of the rorting of the FBT provisions. It recognises clearly that the great majority of non-profit organisations and charitable institutions have done the right thing. We do recognise the important and significant roles of people who work in hospitals and for charities—they are clearly acknowledged and recognised. This legislation will do much to remove the provisions to exploit the system. It also recognises the difficulties that face those who live in remote locations. It ensures that they will not be required to pay FBT on the cost of their housing or their meals in those locations. This is significant and important legislation, and I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2000-03-16,"—It is with great pleasure that I follow the member for Cook in the debate on the A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits) Bill 2000. I emphasise to him that, not surprisingly, he failed to mention the Labor Party's commitment before the last election to make sure that public hospitals would not be left worse off as a result of any FBT changes. That will not be the reality of this bill, if it goes through in its current form without any compensation. The member for Cook is leaving the chamber. He obviously does not have any interest in finding out what the impact of this bill is going to be on public hospitals. The serious impact of this bill on public hospitals is going to be revealed.
The member for Cook and this government should think about why hospitals have had to resort to this type of salary packaging. Why is there widespread use of salary packaging by hospitals in different states in this country? The real reason is the inadequate level of funding provided by this federal government, which has set the scene whereby hospitals in a variety of states are starved of funds and are desperately struggling with staff numbers to maintain operations in the face of growing demand from patients and increasingly expensive medical technology and medicines. We hear stories day after day about declining standards and increasing problems in our public hospitals due to a lack of staff and inadequate training.
The latest issue of our nursing homes has made all of us sick to our stomachs. It is yet another indication of the lack of commitment by this federal government to properly funding our public health institutions. It is therefore not surprising that public hospitals and other public benevolent institutions have been operating as not-for-profit hospitals and nursing homes. They have had to take the opportunity to package staff salaries to reduce the costs to the organisations—to our public hospitals—while giving the employee the same or greater take-home pay as their fellow employees without packages. 
We particularly need to look at the experience in Victoria, where the public hospital system has been using salary packaging to a greater degree. One suspects—I have to say I am being kind to a premier who has, fortunately, left the political scene—that under Jeff Kennett, the Liberal government in Victoria had a deliberate policy of pushing hospitals into maximising the use of salary packaging as a means to reduce the states' contribution to our public hospitals and to push a larger share of the costs of the public health system onto the Commonwealth. So it was a double-barrelled attack that the public hospitals in Victoria had to take into account—cuts in public funding from the Commonwealth, with the Liberal government under Jeff Kennett at the same time saying, `I don't want to be left carrying this baby all by myself. I am going to force as many staff as I possibly can onto salary packaging so I don't have to pay the bill.' It was a cynical manipulation by the Kennett government to cover up its own cuts to the public health budget. If this bill goes through in its current form, with no compensation to public hospitals, it will leave the new government in Victoria with a bill of around $100 million—a very serious amount of money—and there will be major problems for our public hospitals. And that is just in Victoria.
This method of salary packaging has also been used in other states. Not surprisingly, the biggest problems are in the Liberal states. In the Liberal states of South Australia and Western Australia we also see an extensive use of salary packaging in our public hospitals for exactly the same reason that Jeff Kennett did it—to basically palm off the costs of public hospitals onto the Commonwealth in an underhand way because they do not have a commitment to public health. They wanted to cut their funding to our public hospitals, and this was one of the ways that they went about it. Public hospitals which face the loss of the current FBT arrangements, which we see in this bill, will face a huge problem in attracting and retaining staff, particularly if—as we currently have it with this government's proposal—there is no compensation for this change in FBT arrangements. 
The current budgets in all the states are insufficient to provide existing staff with competitive take-home salaries because, up until now, they have been predicated on the availability of packaging. Whether we like it or not, that is how the budgets have been arrived at. If we want to make sure that the tax system is fair and everyone makes a reasonable contribution and concessions are transparent and restricted to those areas where we want to make sure we get the appropriate public benefit, we need to recognise that, if we go down the path the government are insisting on with this change to public hospitals, it is going to leave the public hospitals very short indeed. What are they going to do with all the staff who have been salary packaged? Will those staff have to look for employment elsewhere? We already have a critical shortage of nurses. This issue does not only apply to the high income people. I think many in this parliament might think that it is only the top people in the public hospital system who have been salary packaged in this way. That is just not the case. People have been salary packaged right throughout the public hospital system. So it is not going to be only those at the top who are going to be affected; people right throughout the public hospital system are going to be affected.
It is therefore absolutely unacceptable for this bill to proceed without the government putting forward a detailed plan as to how they will avoid a disastrous impact on our public hospitals. But one would imagine that that will just follow in the current tradition of this government. The government will say, as we have heard the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Dr Wooldridge, say so many times recently, `Oh, well, it's not our problem. Public hospitals are run by the states; they can sort it out.' But this is a problem that the federal government are imposing on our public hospitals—one that is theirs to fix. They are the ones who are changing the FBT arrangements. They are the ones who are going to leave the public hospitals with the enormous problems of how they are going to retain staff and how they are going to make sure that our public hospitals can continue to deliver the services that the public rightly demands. But, of course, the government are going to say, `It has absolutely nothing to do with us. We just pay the states whatever we want to and the states can pick up all the other problems we might create as a result of  FBT legislation.' That is the attitude of this government, and the impact on our public hospitals will unfortunately be there for all of us to see if there is no appropriate compensation. 
Unfortunately, it is also the case that we do not have any decent data on the behaviour of the non-profit bodies regarding FBT, other than some rather aggregate data from Treasury's tax expenditure statement. So, to this point, we have really suffered from a lack of detailed information on how the FBT is currently being used by the charitable and non-profit sectors. This severely limits the capacity of the parliament to consider how these measures that we are debating today are going to impact on these very important sectors, particularly those delivering such critical services in the charitable area. That is why the opposition has been saying for some time now—since last October, in fact—that we believe that, before the parliament can properly consider the impact of the fringe benefits tax changes included in this bill, an independent review of the taxation arrangements for the charitable and non-profit sectors and the impact on public hospitals is necessary. We do not want to have a situation where, in the process of solving one problem, this legislation produces a raft of other problems. I have just outlined what the problems will be in the public hospitals and how serious they will be. The other area in health is going to be in rural Australia, both for rural health services and particularly for Aboriginal health services—and I will come to those issues in a minute.
Not surprisingly, the government do not want to have a look at the detail of what the impact of these changes, particularly on public hospitals, is going to be. They just want to wash their hands of the responsibility of funding public hospitals. So what we have done in the Senate this morning is lay down the terms of reference for a Community Affairs References Committee inquiry. I will not go through the details of that—that will be on the Senate Hansard for everybody to see. If the government were serious about being concerned about how this FBT legislation is going to impact on the charitable and non-profit sectors and on the health sector, they would hold this legislation and have a proper inquiry to make sure that we understand the impact and so that appropriate changes can be made to rectify any problems. Aboriginal medical services as well as the public hospitals have indicated that the measures contained in this bill are going to place significant burdens on their budgets and immediately result in a reduction in services. This is really about a reduction in resources in public hospitals, Aboriginal health services and rural health services, and the government have never addressed how this reduction in resources is going to be accommodated by these critical health services. This bill is not accompanied by any compensation for any of those sectors. 
It is true that we have seen the government modify its original proposals from those it put forward before the election, but public hospitals are left at a limit of $17,000 exemption per employee. These problems will be very serious and I want to give an indication of just how serious they will be for a person in a public hospital earning, say, $60,000 a year and taking home 30 per cent as a non-cash benefit. They currently have the option of $18,000 in package benefits. The  $17,000 cap that the government is proposing is equivalent to a real value of $8,755, substantially less than the $18,000 typically paid now. That is the reality of what we are going to be facing in our health services, which are trying to attract GPs out into rural and remote Australia, into Aboriginal medical services, and are trying to make sure that we get adequate staffing in our public hospitals. 
It is the case that regional and remote health care organisations have used the exemptions to good effect to attract qualified staff to often difficult areas and retain them. There are a number of specific benefits in addition to accommodation. Accommodation is not the only issue. The government has addressed to a degree the issue of accommodation but, as I will indicate in a minute, that will not be sufficient for some rural areas. There are a number of other areas that rural GPs in particular have raised with me. There is no doubt that transport is a major issue, as are travel for study purposes and subsidised professional development arrangements. As for child care, a GP from a rural town in Western Australia raised that yesterday with me as an issue that is emerging in rural towns.
National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations, which represents around 100 Aboriginal health services throughout Australia, is also very concerned about the impact of the bill on the capacity of these Aboriginal medical services to attract and retain health professionals particularly in rural and regional areas. They rely on salary packaging to recruit and retain staff within—and this is the critical thing—their fixed global budgets. The work undertaken in these centres is highly demanding and the services already have difficulty, even with this FBT arrangement, in retaining skilled staff. The full exemptions from the FBT had allowed them until now to offer salary packages which were more competitive than people might have been able to get elsewhere. To quote NACCHO:
Aboriginal Health Services have no means within their fixed budgets to absorb increased FBT liability, and any unfunded liability will inevitably lead to staff losses and retraction or cessation of services.
That is really what it is about. So much for the red light going on in the Prime Minister's office whenever any threat is made by any government legislation to rural health services—and that is what this bill is going to do. The red light is obviously not flashing. As someone said in the House the other day, obviously someone has nicked off with the globe, because this bill will have that immediate effect. As the Aboriginal health services have said, they have no means within their fixed budgets to absorb the increased FBT liability and this will inevitably lead to staff losses and a reduction in or a cessation of services. That is what we are really facing in practical terms. A loss of medical officers, nurses and other administration staff, forcing a reduction in health services in the community—that will be the result of this government's legislation that we are debating today.
We cannot have the Prime Minister out there saying that the red light is going to flash and then the next day a piece of legislation being brought into the House for debate and no consideration being given to the impact on rural and remote health services, beyond the housing issue, and no consideration being given to how this is going to have such a specific impact on our public hospitals. It is important that we get to the bottom of this issue and have a proper inquiry, a Senate inquiry, so that at least the government is informed about what the impact of these changes will be on these critical sectors of our community—our public hospitals, our rural and remote health services and, within that, our Aboriginal health services.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Haase, Barry, MP",LP,2000-03-16,"—The previous speaker, the member for Jagajaga, made much of the fact that welfare and services generally in remote areas will be affected because of the introduction of these changes. The point was absolutely missed that, without some viability in the bush, in remote areas, there is much revenue lost that can support these particular packages. The introduction of FBT was the result of some very ham-fisted moves by the ALP back in 1986. They say that a blunt instrument does a lot of damage. A blunt instrument in the hands of the ALP does damage indeed, and this particular legislation—the A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits) Bill 2000—to collect tax on benefits paid to employees in remote areas has gone a long way to creating the situation we have in remote areas of Australia today; that is, an outpouring of population to the coast.
My electorate of Kalgoorlie is all remote area—91 per cent of Western Australia—and the FBT has done more to damage resource development in that area than any other piece of legislation. This bill provides the opportunity to remove the provision of housing to employees in remote areas from the clutches of FBT, and that is the best news that we have had in the bush for a long time. Prior to the introduction of this legislation in 1986 by the ALP, the Pilbara iron ore industry, the salt industry and the mining industry were doing very well. Communities were built in areas where previously there was desert, isolation and a sparse population. Towns were established, and those towns were viable and complete entities. They had a work force. They had every facility necessary for a good community. There were volunteer groups and sporting groups, and there were educational facilities that were equal to the best in the cities. Even though the operations were being worked around the clock, with a three-shift work force there was a great deal of voluntary action in those towns—voluntary action in the form of volunteer fire brigades, St John Ambulance drivers, welfare support groups and playgroups. All manner of services were provided because we had a viable population base. 
When FBT was introduced, the mining companies found that they had to pay tax on the facility that was provided for their employees, namely housing. There was a change of heart. Suddenly, it became a financial burden for those mining companies. The situation was revisited. Many decisions were made to the detriment of those communities. The first decision made was that this could perhaps be countered by giving over to private ownership those houses that had been provided previously at very low rentals to employees. Having chosen home ownership in the majority of cases, many of those mining families decided that, if they were to own a house, they could own a house elsewhere. This induced the idea in company boardrooms to create the fly-in fly-out situation. It was not long before those remote area towns started to lose their populations. More and more of the employees were opting for the fly-in fly-out situation and moving to coastal areas—predominantly to the city areas of the coastal fringe. With the reduction in population, small business infrastructure in those towns started to wane. There was simply no profitability there, because those small businesses were being forced to provide housing and then to pay tax on that housing. So the inclination to employ a large number of people passed. Staff numbers were reduced and service was reduced; the number of customers had already been reduced. You saw small business in country areas going down the drain—all down to Labor's FBT.
Having had fly-in fly-out arrangements with a three-shift work force for some period of time, mining companies recognised the further economic advantages in reducing those three fly-in-fly-out shifts to just two, and the 12-hour shift was created to keep those mines and operations running around the clock. With a 12-hour shift in those remote towns, you now have half the population working while, at the same time, the other half of the population, in the main, is sleeping. The volunteer efforts in those towns today is down to an all-time low. There are simply not the people available to participate in the volunteer fire brigade. They are screaming for St John Ambulance drivers. The child-care facilities are going down through lack of volunteers and through lack of customers, due to the depletion of the population in those towns. You have a situation where there is no such thing as inter-town sporting competitions any longer because there are no people there to make up the sporting teams. As I said, the population that is flying in and out of the towns is either sleeping or working—there is no time for the niceties of community spirit.
A further exacerbation of the problem comes in the area of safety. With the 12-hour shifts, men are being stretched and accidents are occurring. With the fly-in fly-out situation, families back on the coast are disintegrating because the main breadwinner of that family—the father of the household, in the main—is absent for at least half the time and the fabric of the family is collapsing.
The effect of this bill will be to exempt all remote area housing from FBT. It is my hope that such a reversal may eventually lead to not just a rethinking of the 12-hour shifts and the fly-in fly-out arrangement but the re-creation of communities in remote areas, which will give back vibrancy to those towns. It will give back a reason for there being a town, because suddenly we will have a community again. The upshot of that, of course, is that we will have a greater opportunity for resource development and we will have less stress on community facilities in the city. Speaking of community facilities, one of the further, insidious effects of fly-in fly-out—in the main, created by FBT—is that Australian Bureau of Statistics figures now form the basis for capital grants to local government. Those statistics show a very small population in the bush, because the majority work on a fly in-fly-out basis and their normal place of residence is somewhere on the coast. So the local government facilities in the bush are not getting the funding necessary to provide the infrastructure for that working population who, if they have a spare moment, use the local swimming pool, the local library, the local theatre or hall and all of the other services provided by local government. They contribute nothing towards the cost of those provisions because the capital grant that would be given on their behalf is given to another location as part of their residential local government area. So the area where they are most using local government facilities gets no financial benefit at all. 
The casual observation made by people travelling through these remote areas about money that is earned in these areas is, `You've got a mine. You've got a viable resource development going on there. You've got a very large work force. This must be a viable town.' The simple fact is that the wages earned in those towns by those fly-in fly-out individuals are spent elsewhere. So the small business infrastructure that might remain in that town is getting no fillip whatsoever. The sad thing about this of course is that by now, with the depletion of population, you have declining educational facilities, day care facilities and every other facility in the bush. This legislation will, hopefully, put an end to that and at least provide a start. Once again we will have equity for small business, because small business having to bring managers and employees generally from other parts will be able to provide housing for those individuals in the short term without having to pay an FBT.
This bill also provides for the exemption of the cost of providing meals—that is, meals other than entertainment—on a day-to-day basis for primary producers' employees. This has impacted for a long time on shearing sheds across my electorate. Shearers who take a meal provided by the pastoralist are an additional cost to the pastoralist because the meal is considered to be a fringe benefit. How on earth can you have a shearer working eight hard hours on the floor of a shearing shed and have the meals provided being considered a benefit? It is an absolute nonsense. It is just one of the nonsenses that was created when the ALP introduced this legislation in 1986. So we are going to exempt those meals provided in the course of a working day from FBT.
The other thing that this legislation will do is stop the overuse of the concessional FBT treatment for public benevolent institutions. We have heard much whining about the fact that there is going to be some change in this area, but I say again that without the Commonwealth grants to hospitals and states generally to provide for these not-for-profit facilities and without those funds that are generated in resource development and pastoral industries across my electorate there will be no funding to public institutions. I believe it is a very salient point. This bill is a great breakthrough for remote Australia. It is certainly a breakthrough for my electorate, and I commend it to the House.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,2000-03-16,"—The A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits) Bill 2000 seeks to bring further changes to the taxation treatment of Australia's many charitable and not-for-profit organisations. I think it is sometimes forgotten that there are something like 10,000 charities in this country which have virtually millions of members. Every one of these charities, under this government, is about to become a tax collector. That is something that we should think about. This bill is part of that process, where the government is, through a combination of the GST and FBT changes, placing a significant burden on many charities. In the process of doing that, it is effectively placing a tax on compassion and is effectively putting forward a tax on helping people. It is also going to be a tax on volunteering. 
We have had a lot of debate in this House, particularly about the application of the GST to charitable organisations. We should recall the Prime Minister's commitment when he said:
I do not accept for a moment that the application of the GST will be damaging to the charitable sector.
It will, and that has been documented. We have heard evidence from organisations like St Vincent de Paul, the Uniting Church, the Adelaide Central Mission and many organisations throughout this community that the GST will place a huge burden on them. Recently we had a report from the Australia Institute which looked at all of the issues associated with the taxation of charities. That report found among other things that unregistered entities will not be able to claim refunds of GST on their inputs. That is the government's position. As a consequence of that, they will face cost increases of around seven per cent. That fact is being completely ignored or denied by the government, but it remains the reality for many organisations in this community. The Australia Institute found that if sales by charities fall by around 15 per cent due to a GST induced rise of 10 per cent in the price of giving—and that has been the overseas experience—individual charities could face losses of up to 11 per cent as a result of the GST. They also found the average real loss of income for the sector would be three per cent or more, and they found that the impact on volunteers would be severe. The report predicted that the potential reduction in a volunteer's donation of time would be around 30 per cent. That would be an economic loss to the nation of something like $230 million. So we are dealing with very important matters here which go to the heart of what sort of society we want to be and which go to the heart of the capacity of voluntary organisations in our community to serve their community. I cannot see how this government can talk genuinely about the concept of a social coalition when they are out there, through a combination of measures, taxing the capacity of voluntary organisations to help those most in need. It is completely inconsistent.
Most importantly, in the whole package GST compliance costs are not being compensated for at all. Fundraising and other activities that assist charitable organisations to deliver services are still being slugged by the GST, contrary to what the government says. The core problem with this government's approach to charities, and it is reflected in this bill, is its sheer ignorance about the reality of charities' daily functioning and how they operate. It is simply the case that it does not know and does not care. We have seen so much evidence of this in the bills before the House. The whole proposal to put a GST on site fees, for example, for those residents in mobile homes in caravan parks, simply reflected the government's ignorance. It did not know that there were 160,000 people in Australia who lived in these circumstances—it simply did not know. And it simply does not understand how charities operate and what the impact of these measures will be.
That brings us to the FBT proposals in this bill. The government do not fully understand the adverse impact of these proposals on many charitable organisations, which will cause for those organisations significant stress and significant pressure on their capacity to fund their existing levels of activity. What we on this side of the House say is that, if the government think that there is a very substantial problem with the FBT—and they do by the revenue estimates that they have produced—and if it is being rorted and if that needs to be stamped out, why don't we have a full independent inquiry into the combined impact of the GST and FBT changes on the sector? Why don't we get it all out there? Why don't we have an independent inquiry which gets to the bottom of this matter? We owe that to all the volunteers and all the participants in the charitable sector to at least give them the benefit of a hearing. What they have been saying to me as I move around this country is that there will be for some of them a severe adverse impact from some of these FBT changes. Nobody quibbles with the objective of eliminating rorting in the system, but equally nobody should be quibbling with the fact that some of these changes will not be doing anything other than hurting organisations which are working very hard within the framework of the existing law to serve the community.  
So we do have the view that there should be an independent inquiry and that it should have the scope to examine the whole issue of how the charitable organisations are treated within the tax system—and that includes FBT and GST. We need that inquiry because there is insufficient information at present to properly evaluate the anecdotal claims of rorting on the one hand against the concerns on the other that some charities are going to be unviable if their current fringe benefits tax treatment is capped at the rate proposed by the government in this bill. Let us measure that; let us test it in a full independent inquiry. The Taxation Office gave the opposition a briefing on this matter and it admitted in that briefing that it does not yet possess the information on how charities currently use fringe benefits tax exemptions. It admitted that. In so doing, it confirmed that we do need a wider inquiry. Without further investigation, it is not possible to say how current rules should be changed to allow legitimate assistance while removing any abuse. If we fail to investigate this issue properly and thoroughly and this measure were to pass, some charities will have been punished without accurate evidence proving that there has been abuse in the system. 
I have got to say that the level of concern that I have picked up as I move around Australia, and particularly in my home state of Queensland where there are not as many charities which may necessarily have people on big packages, indicates that the proposed cap may result in many of these organisations having to lay off staff or reduce services to the most vulnerable. That needs to be tested. They have come to me, and I am sure they have been to members of the government and members of the backbench right across this parliament. Many of these people are very genuine. So we have a serious problem here and it needs to be addressed in a very serious way. That is why we on this side of House believe that this whole matter should be tested in an independent inquiry. That is the position of the opposition. It is necessary because the combined impact may seriously disadvantage many charities in our community. The Senate Community Affairs Committee some time ago attempted to examine those issues, but at that stage the government refused to provide any detailed information on its taxation proposals or their impact, and we are not much further advanced from there. But there is plenty of evidence out there from people who work very hard to make this country a better place that if we do not have that independent inquiry we will be seriously punishing not only those organisations but also the people they serve.
Of course, when the sector contemplates the changes to the FBT, they have to do that in the context of the impact of the GST, which is applied right across the sector to these organisations. You could not find a starker example of why we say this is a government which is weak in taxing the strong and strong in taxing the weak. The starkest example of that is the impact of the GST on the charitable sector. When you strip away all of the rhetoric, all of the nonsense that the government talks, the charitable sector is going to be paying the GST, and that is why we say the GST is a tax on compassion and a tax on helping people. It is going to pick up the most basic fundraising activities of the charitable sector. This government will simply go down in history, when it comes to the GST component of this, as the first government in this country that decided to turn the charitable sector into tax collectors.
The charitable sector has already been caught with massive cuts to funding, creating an enormous social deficit. It has had massive increases in demand despite general economic growth, because the growth itself is not being shared fairly. Now the government comes along and says, `Well, you are not doing enough. We are going to take a lot more from you.' That is effectively what the application of the GST to the charitable sector means. We have said that this bill should be the subject of a full, independent inquiry. What we have said generally about the question of taxation is very simple: we will roll back the GST. We will do it with some consistent principles, the first of which is to alleviate its impact on the weakest and most vulnerable sectors of our society, namely, the charities. Secondly, we will alleviate its impact on small business, its impact on those areas which are supposed to be GST free and its impact on employment. They are the principles we operate on. This country is diminished by taking the steps that this government is taking across the board to turn each and every one of our charities in this country into a tax collector. Welcome to John Howard's social coalition. ",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"McArthur, Stewart, MP",LP,2000-03-16,"—I am pleased to participate in this debate on the A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits) Bill 2000 because of my interest over many years in the taxation of fringe benefits. I well recall the introduction of the fringe benefits tax back in 1986 when the then Hawke government were unable to explain to taxpayers and employers how to implement the tax. At that time, there was a famous pink booklet that I spent a number of hours studying, trying to understand what the impact of the tax was on individual employers and individual employees, and the way in which the tax should be interpreted. We have an interesting scenario in this parliament today where members of the Labor Party are suggesting that we need yet another inquiry into a tax which they introduced into the parliament and which they refined during their time in government. At the end of that time, the way in which the tax should be implemented was still in many ways incomprehensible. So it is all very well for the shadow Treasurer and the member for Lilley to call for an inquiry into the provisions before the parliament today.
It might be worth looking at what the changes to the fringe benefits tax are going to be and what they in fact incorporate. As members of the parliament would be aware, the fringe benefits tax is a tax on those benefits that historically had escaped taxation. It was conceded by both sides that there needed to be some form of attack upon that tax loophole. There was great argument at that time about the fact that the tax was to be paid by the employer, not the employee. That was a movement away from the canons of taxation: that those who received a benefit, an income or a remuneration should pay the tax. However, I concede the point that, because of the complexity of it, the current government have maintained that situation. In the new tax changes that will come in on 1 July, there are some changes to the fringe benefits tax.
Let us see what we mean by the `benefit'. The fringe benefits tax includes any right, privilege or service or the use of something— for example, the use of a car, house or equipment. That covers a multitude of activities, and the total revenue received from fringe benefits tax is about $3.2 billion. I make that point: of the total budget, $3.2 billion is received from fringe benefits tax. Governments need to have that revenue, and it does ensure there is less evasion of people's obligation to pay a fair amount of tax. The use of a car provides a very large percentage of the total $3.2 billion in tax revenue. The ownership of something, for instance, clothes and goods, is a smaller proportion of the revenue received. The enjoyment of a privilege or facility, a cheap loan or school fees and the provision of a service, for example, a skill or labour, are the other items. Who pays the fringe benefits tax? As I have said, the employers pay. There has been a lot of argument about that. That will continue to be the position, whether they are sole traders, partnerships, trusts, corporations, unincorporated associations or government bodies. We will talk about unincorporated associations in a minute.
The lodging of the returns will hopefully be improved. As members would be aware, the fringe benefits tax is now going to be assessed on 1 April each year. It begins this year, on 1 April 2000. Under the new taxation proposals, it will be paid in four instalments, on 21 July, 21 October, 21 January and 21 April. It is quite clear what will happen. There will be a special form for paying the fringe benefits tax. That is a tidying up of the arrangements that provide $3.2 billion to the government.
Changes are being foreshadowed by the government in relation to benevolent institutions, including a requirement that fringe benefits for employees of benevolent institutions be limited to $17,000. The limit will be $25,000 for other employees. Members of the opposition have raised that matter. The member for Lilley and the shadow spokesman really have no logical answer to what the government is attempting to do. They in the opposition have been committed to a fringe benefits tax. They instituted the tax. They have supported it and they have defended it, yet they come into the parliament and say, `Look, it is all a bit difficult and we should have yet another inquiry into the benevolent institutions.' Put in very simple terms, the government are saying that, on all the evidence available, the fringe benefits tax has been exploited by some benevolent institutions and that there needs to be a tidying up of this position. It might be worth while defining what a public benevolent institution is under the tax act. The definition reads as follows: 
An institution is considered benevolent where its dominant objective and activity is the immediate and direct relief of poverty, sickness, distress, misfortune, destitution and helplessness and it directly provides relief to persons requiring it. An organisation must satisfy certain tests to qualify as a public benevolent institution; including, being non-profit making, being established for the benefit of a section or class of the public, and providing relief without discrimination to every member of the public which it aims to benefit.
That is a fairly lengthy description of a public benevolent institution, but it does take in all the hospitals. The government's approach in the A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits) Bill 2000 is to limit the amount of fringe benefit that is paid to employees of hospitals or public benevolent institutions to $17,000. That is based on the historical experience. A number of those institutions saw a loophole and managed to increase the total, personal remuneration of doctors and other medical personnel by upping the fringe benefit component, so much so that the receiver of the salary, so-called, had a very large component of fringe benefit from which the Australian Taxation Office received no benefit because the benevolent institution had this exemption. While members of the opposition might complain that they have had a lot of cries for help from hospitals around Australia, saying that the thing is fundamentally difficult and bad, I say that the evidence I have seen suggests that this loophole has been exploited by some people who have seen reason to benefit their employees in an unfair way compared with the rest of hardworking Australians.
If you look at the other categories that are genuinely exempt, they are international organisations and religious practitioners. I do not think the religious practitioners will have a problem with fringe benefit—I do not think it will be increasing because their employers are not generally overwhelmed with money. When you look at some of the evidence of benevolent institutions, the national industry association for disabilities and the Australian Catholic Health Care Association understood that a problem was emerging. They said to their associations that a limit of 30 per cent of the total remuneration package should be constituted as a fringe benefit; that that would be a fair thing. Even the Western Australian Department of Health suggested the same thing. They understood that there was rorting going on in the system and that, to conform with the spirit of the law, they should limit the amount of fringe benefit incorporated in salaries.
That does not support the argument that members of the opposition are putting forward that we need yet another inquiry. It is self-evident that people working in benevolent institutions could see a problem. Particular examples have been drawn to my attention where gross overdoing of fringe benefits in the remuneration of certain practitioners associated with the hospital field made it imperative that the government introduce this legislation. After considerable consultation and discussion—this matter has been around for some time—the government has put a limit of $17,000 on the grossed-up taxable value of the fringe benefit for those employed by a benevolent institution and $25,000 for other classes of employee. Interestingly enough, the Ralph review put up a rather sensible but controversial view that the benefits should be paid for by the employee—something that has been argued for years—but that was not accepted by the government.
We have, I think, a very sensible suggestion before the House that the fringe benefits be limited to $17,000 and to $25,000 for other category employees. However, I draw to the attention of the House a representation that I received in Corangamite, at the local level, from Barwon Health, which is a combination of a benevolent institution in the old Geelong Hospital and other activities now incorporated in Barwon Health which could not be described as benevolent institution type activities. Within the one organisation, there will be a difference between those categories of employees who receive the capping of $17,000 and other employees who receive $25,000. I draw the government's attention to that anomaly and I will be making representations on behalf of my constituents. 
Moving on to the remote area allowance: again the government has seen the merit of trying to sort out the historic difficulty. As the member for Kalgoorlie quite rightly put to the House in his earlier speech, the unintended consequences of FBT in remote and regional Australia have quite a dramatic impact on miners in Western Australia and in Queensland. The practice of fly in, fly out developed as a result of the provisions of the FBT and other taxation measures. As a result, you had some of those rural communities being depleted and people congregating in capital cities. The very thing that all governments have been trying to do is to get people out into regional Australia and keep them there and keep the prosperity in some of those mining towns rather than concentrating it in our capital cities. The provision of an exemption for housing in remote areas is going to be very helpful. I note the definition—in which the government has been very generous—that remote areas are categorised as an area that is 40 kilometres from a town of 14,000 people or 100 kilometres from a town of 130,000 people. The reality of that is that it creates a lot of areas in the comparatively well-populated state of Victoria that can be considered to be remote and receive the housing exemption. The government has been generous to rural and regional Australia, yet again, to sensibly get this exemption. In my assessment, people who live in fairly difficult and arduous conditions in mining towns—shearers and rural workers—do get some benefit of rural accommodation but it is very much part of their work and they are committed to live on the job. On that basis, I think the government has provided a very sensible exemption for these personnel.
Likewise, the exemption for meals for shearers is sensible. Again, these are very hardworking Australians, who probably work the hardest of any Australians over an eight-hour period and who have a large consumption of food. To say that the provision of meals for shearers is a fringe benefit is stretching one's imagination, let alone the bookkeeping required to allocate what would be a commercial benefit and what would be a personal benefit. So I commend that important exemption—only a small one but significant in terms of symbolic support for shearers and for the wool industry, which is having a very tough time at the moment. It will save a lot of bookwork, and a lot of argument about what is desirable and what is not desirable. 
It is interesting to look at the figures relating to what it might cost the government and what has been forgone in terms of revenue. As a result of the capping of the FBT concessions the government will raise $170 million in the next financial year. The remote area housing exemption is going to cost the government only $345 million a year. That seems a very small amount for the bookwork and the compliance provisions. The meals exemption for primary producers is a mere $1 million a year. So the capping-up provisions, which fill a loophole, are a sensible measure. They will help make things more equitable between taxpayers. The revenue, which I always look at very carefully to see what the government is either gaining or losing, indicates that this legislation is sensible. It needs the support of both the Labor opposition, who have a long-term commitment to the fringe benefits tax as a concept and as a principle, and the Australian Democrats in the Senate. This matter has had extensive consultation. Any sensible person can see that there is a rort being activated in the charitable area and that there are some very extreme examples. Hopefully, the Democrats will agree with the legislation when it comes before the Senate to try and yet again tidy up the fringe benefits legislation so that it is equitable across the board between all classes of taxpayers—the employers and all classes of employees—and so that nobody is discriminated against for their job classification in the Australian work force.  
I commend the legislation. I commend the speakers on the government side for the way they have put their case. I challenge the opposition to provide clearer evidence of why they would be opposed to the legislation and why yet again, in the normal Labor Party manner, they want another inquiry into something which is fairly self-evident on most of the evidence that I see. ",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2000-03-16,"—Firstly I would like to express my absolute disgust that the government is once again seeking to gag debate on an important piece of legislation such as the one we are discussing today in this House, A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits) Bill 2000. We are all being forced to reduce the amount of time we can speak on this matter. There are many other speakers on this side of the House who would like to contribute to the debate. But, unfortunately, this government is seeking to ram the legislation through without proper debate. The member for Corangamite has said that it is self-evident that this legislation is needed, that it is imperative and that there has been adequate consultation and discussion. If there has been adequate consultation and discussion and if everyone in the community is satisfied with it, why am I getting so many phone calls telling me that charitable organisations are very dissatisfied with this legislation? Whilst there is this level of angst within the community I believe that it is absolutely essential that there be an independent inquiry into this fringe benefits tax on charitable organisations, public hospitals and the non-profit sector. 
The government talks all the time about its social coalition and how it is going to move to involve charitable organisations more in the welfare process. But it is looking at making it harder for them to operate. The changes to the fringe benefits tax have the capability of attacking the very viability of these organisations. It needs to be looked at in the whole taxation environment. Just to name a few organisations that have expressed their concern, the Wesley Central Mission believes that they are going to have to cut back services to children and to older Australians in isolated areas because of this legislation. It needs to be looked at and discussed. The Spastic Centre of New South Wales said that they are going to have to cut services to hundreds of disadvantaged families. 
Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, as you well know because, like me, you are involved in the inquiry, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs is currently conducting an inquiry into indigenous health. The National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, NACCHO, represents over 100 Aboriginal communities throughout Australia and assists with the Aboriginal medical services, providing support and helping them maintain their viability. These organisations' very viability is under threat by this fringe benefits tax. As we all know, Aboriginal people suffer by far the worst health status of any group in Australia. The life expectancy for Aboriginal people is 15 to 20 years below that of any Australian and the infant mortality rate is two to four times greater. As I said, NACCHO has serious concerns regarding the potential impact of the proposed capping on the concessional fringe benefit treatment of Aboriginal health services. This will create serious problems for Aboriginal health services because the salary package offered is really important when staff are recruited for these remote areas of Australia. They have to pay for that through their fixed budgets. 
NACCHO see this, if it is actually implemented, as going to the very viability of their being able to maintain services. NACCHO have asked to be made exempt because of the high needs in Aboriginal communities, the unique role of the Aboriginal community controlled health sector, the need to maintain an adequate and viable skilled work force in these sectors and for administrative simplicity and transparency of exemption compared with compensation. The previous speaker said in relation to the wool industry how important it is that the meals of shearers should be exempted. That has been included. But isn't it really important that Aboriginal medical centres be exempt for the people living in those areas? Isn't it really important for their health and wellbeing that they be exempt? This needs to be looked at and decided upon during an inquiry looking at all the issues.  
As well as that, there is the area of disability. Many of the disability organisations just survive from day to day—as it is, this legislation will have a negative effect. Unless we have a full inquiry that looks at this and couples it with the impact of the GST, we will not know whether or not this is good legislation. As always, the government are seeking to ram through legislation, stifle community debate and prevent proper scrutiny of legislation. If it is so good, the government should be prepared to have an inquiry to fully examine the legislation and its impact.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2000-03-16,"—I rise to participate in the A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits) Bill 2000 debate this afternoon. This is a subject in which I have had great interest for some time. The aspect of the legislation to which I want to refer is the FBT arrangements as they relate to not-for-profit bodies. You will be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that midway through last year I widely distributed a paper entitled `The Impact of the Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT) reforms on Public Benevolent Institutions (PBI) Aboriginal Organisations in Remote Regional Australia'. I did so because of the concern that I had about the potential impact of the government's proposals on these organisations.
I think it is important that we understand what these PBI organisations do. A public benevolent institution, for the purposes of Taxation Determination 93/11, is a public benevolent institution which:
(a) has as its main or principal object the relief of poverty, sickness, suffering, distress, misfortune, destitution or helplessness; 
(b) is carried on without the purpose of private gain for particular persons; 
(c) is established for the benefit of a section or class of the public; 
(d) provides relief without discrimination to every member of that section of the public which the organisation aims to benefit; and 
(e) gives directly to those in need. 
This is under section 57A of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986. I do not believe that the government properly understand the impact of their proposed changes to the fringe benefits tax arrangements for these organisations. I know a lot has been said and I have heard previous speakers talk about charitable organisations, including, no doubt, church based health organisations. But these organisations are not part of that large welfare network; they are not part of that charitable network of the Catholic, Anglican or Uniting churches. These organisations are, by and large, community based organisations which work for and on behalf of their communities. They include such organisations as land councils, health organisations to which the previous member referred, Aboriginal legal aid services and a whole range of other organisations of that type. It is my very strong view that if the government proceed with their proposals as they currently have them, we will see a large number of organisations severely disadvantaged and their service arrangements diminished, and it is very likely that large numbers of them will cease to operate because they will no longer be viable. 
It is worth while making the observation as we go through that some of these organisations have been starved of funding in any event over a long period of time. What we need to comprehend is that the salary packaging arrangements which they have used have been important. Indeed, without them they would not be able to attract reasonably qualified staff. Therefore, to provide the services they wish to provide, they ultimately have been drawn to the attractions of the fringe benefits tax exemptions which have provided them with the capacity to employ and maintain staff with the appropriate skills to carry out their functions. They have been used as a means of offering more attractive salary packages.
The proposal to cap the FBT exemption to the grossed-up level in the bill will have an impact on the scope and effectiveness of many of these organisations. By and large, in the context of Northern Australia, I am now referring to Aboriginal organisations. But it also applies, as I mentioned earlier, to church based organisations. The PBIs in remote Australia experience great difficulties in recruiting and retaining suitably qualified professional staff. Such staff are generally found in Australia's major cities. It has been argued that PBIs enjoy an advantage in labour markets over other organisations which do not qualify for FBT exemptions, because the cost to the organisation for a given level of after-tax remuneration of an employee is effectively lower than the cost non-exempt organisations pay. 
In the case of PBI employers in Central Australia, this advantage is more than offset by the sacrifices employees make by working in remote communities. Networks of family and friends and established career paths are left behind. The social infrastructure in such areas is less than that found in major Australian cities and FBT exemptions help compensate staff for these sacrifices without imposing additional costs on the organisations with which they work. In a submission to the Senate committee examining the new tax system, the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, NACCHO, stated:
Considering that even with those packages some of our services in remote areas cannot attract doctors and people to them now, we believe that there will be an impact again even with just trying to retain staff. We have had dealings with our doctors and, with the so-called rural incentive programs that are put around and floated around, this will now take the edge off all those so-called doctor programs that are supposed to be benefiting our mob out there.
Retaining staff has always been a problem in the Northern Territory. A labour market survey commissioned by the former Labor government at my direction in 1996 and finalised under the Howard government demonstrates very clearly that there are severe labour shortages throughout Northern Australia. This is particularly true for professional people. We are not just talking about health care workers; we are talking about legal workers, paralegal workers, social workers and teachers. You name it—there is a difficulty in attracting staff.
The FBT exemption also provides a capacity to offset the high cost of living in many parts of remote Australia. This is a subject about which I have spoken on a number occasions in the House—indeed, twice over the last two days. A Northern Territory health survey in 1998 showed that a $100 basket of goods in a capital city would cost $146 in remote communities around Alice Springs; in other areas such as the Anangu Pitjantjatjara lands of South Australia, the cost would be even higher. The difference between the price of this basket of goods in the capital cities and north-east Arnhem Land was 104 per cent. People are being asked to pay more than twice the price for this same basket of goods and services. 
It has been stated that the cap proposed in this legislation is broadly equivalent to the taxable value of an average Australian car, plus some additional minor benefits. Due to the nature of the job, many employees in rural and remote Australia do not drive an average Australian car. They require four-wheel drive vehicles for purely access purposes. One needs to know—as I am sure the House needs to be informed—that there are many communities in Northern Australia that are currently inaccessible to road traffic. This highlights not only the isolation factor but also the great deal of repair and maintenance required when these roads are again passable—repair and maintenance which is not forthcoming because neither this government nor the Northern Territory government has been prepared to commit the funds necessary to bring them up to standard. This means, of course, that people who drive on these roads need vehicles which are appropriately kitted. The only appropriately kitted vehicles in most instances are four-wheel drive vehicles. This is an additional burden on not only the employees but also the organisations for whom they work.
My office undertook a survey of a range of organisations around Central Australia and across Northern Australia about the potential impact these FBT proposals would have on these organisations. We discovered that many of them would have no option but to retrench staff which, as I said earlier, would only lead to a lessening of the services they provide to their clients. The impact of this could be devastating for Australia if Aboriginal communities are without doctors and nurses, and organisations are without senior managers or accountants or bookkeepers and the like. Some organisations may cease to operate. The case studies that I undertook to examine the impact on a number of these organisations point to the fact that some organisations would need top-up moneys of tens of thousands of dollars while others would need hundreds of thousands of dollars. If the government is not providing compensation packages—and there is no sign of that for these organisations—then it has no alternative but to rethink its fringe benefits tax arrangements. 
It is also worth pointing out that the funding for these PBIs—as I have already mentioned—does not always increase in line with IRC pay rises. This is certainly true of Aboriginal organisations. The Northern and Central Land Councils have effectively had their funding frozen at 1993-94 levels. These organisations provide a very important and, indeed, crucial service to large areas of Northern Australia and are subject to an act of this federal parliament. If the government is serious about providing services to people who live in rural and remote areas, it will address this issue. There is no sign that it has any intention of addressing it reasonably. We also know that ATSIC is under severe funding constraints. We know that there has been no indication by the government that, in the forthcoming budget, any more favourable treatment will be given to ATSIC or the organisations with which it works. Indeed, as late as this morning, the Treasurer made it very clear that there will be no funds available for these types of purposes. I say to the House, and to the government in particular, that it ought to rethink this exercise. This could have a dramatically negative impact on people across regional and remote Australia. Again I say to my friends in the National Party, who are not here but who are generally located in cockies corner, when they do come back into the House to contemplate what they are voting on, to contemplate this fact: the communities which they service will be potentially denied services as a result of the fringe benefits tax arrangements which this government is proposing to put in place.
One element of the arrangements that I do applaud is the proposal to exempt housing in remote communities. That is a very important initiative and it is something that I have been demanding for some time. I do question the issue of the definition of `remote area housing' because, clearly, there are small communities around Northern Australia, although not many within 40 kilometres of an urban area of 14,000, I have to say, which do require access to this housing support. I hope that, once this is bedded down, we will see a dramatic improvement in the operation of many organisations. Again, this will impact upon these Aboriginal organisations and it is something that I support. But it is a factor that needs to be taken into account not only when contemplating private enterprise. The government service sector and those organisations that are community based find a great deal of difficulty in meeting the costs of accommodating people in these rural and remote communities. Many of them are without housing, and this will provide them with an incentive to get hold of housing in those communities. To that extent, I think it is a very important initiative.
We have before us today an amendment that has been put forward by the shadow Treasurer that asks the government to put in place an independent inquiry into the impact of the tax system and proposed changes to the tax system on the charitable, non-profit and public health sectors so that the provisions of the bill can be properly assessed. I say to those people who are involved in those sectors that they need to apply pressure on this government and on the Australian Democrats to ensure that the sort of independent inquiry that we have been calling for in the Labor Party is carried out, so that we can properly examine the impact of these new taxation arrangements on these organisations.
In conclusion, I note one very obvious thing about all of this is that the government does not have access to reasonable information. One thing an independent inquiry would do is to provide it with the capacity to acquire public data on the behaviour of non-profit bodies regarding the FBT, other than the ones it currently has in the aggregated data in Treasury tax expenditure statements. This information deficiency is one of the key issues that an independent inquiry would seek to address. This government has an obligation to make sure this inquiry takes place. This government has an obligation to make sure that these community based organisations, these PBIs and the people involved in the charitable, non-profit and public health sectors, are not penalised and that their clients are not penalised by an obdurate government that is not thinking. ",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2000-03-16,"—I rise to speak on the A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits) Bill 2000 andA New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Amendment Bill 2000, which basically propose four areas of change to the fringe benefits tax provisions. They are: to limit the current unlimited fringe benefits tax exemption for certain employers—namely, public benevolent institutions such as charities and public and private non-profit hospitals; to limit the rebate arrangements applying to other non-profit bodies; the provisions covering the GST's complex interaction with the FBT system, including a new, increased grossed-up formula; the new exemptions for remote area housing benefits and meals provided by primary producers to their employees; and, finally, the technical amendments to the way fringe benefits are treated in the calculation of liability under the Medicare levy surcharge.
FBT is imposed on employers to facilitate compliance and administrative efficiency. There are roughly 67,000 FBT taxpayers, despite, probably, the millions of employees that derive some fringe benefit from this. FBT is levied at the maximum marginal rate and is applicable to the individual, plus the Medicare levy itself. Certain non-profit and charitable bodies obtain FBT exemptions or concessions by way of a rebate. The government claims that these concessions are being abused and it proposes in this bill to limit those concessions. The government has no evidence of this abuse. It is purely making an assumption and is basing this legislation on those assumptions without any evidence whatsoever. Also, despite the fact that FBT is legally levied on employers, it is most often actually borne, at least in some part, by employees in their salary packaging arrangements.
This is why Labor has called, since 19 October 1999, for the issue of the impact of the taxation system, which includes the FBT on the non-profit sector, to be examined by an independent inquiry. A number of my colleagues have already spoken on this, but I think this is the key to what should be done by the government in relation to this matter. There are a number of key issues that come out of this debate, and I think one of the biggest ones is the limitation of the FBT exemption for non-profit bodies. The proposed limitation of the FBT concessions for charities, hospitals and other non-profit bodies is contentious to say the least, and grossly unfair at the other end.
The government argues that the current provisions are being abused but, as I said earlier, there is no evidence of this. The non-profit sector disputes this claim outright. There is evidence, though, of widespread use of FBT exemptions by charities of up to about 30 per cent of salaries, and in some states extensive use in the public and not-for-profit hospital systems. The FBT is not limited to senior executives, although they are on very high salaries, as most people might think. It also includes a large number of people such as nurses, doctors and others who have a salary packaged up with some sort of FBT benefit. So it is not just the high income earners who will actually be affected by these changes; it will be ordinary Australians, such as nurses in hospitals, who will also be affected. The loss of FBT exemptions will have a serious implication for the continuing operations of charities and, particularly, hospitals.
As I said earlier, there is no public data on the behaviour of non-profit bodies regarding FBT, other than some aggregate data in the Treasury tax expenditure statements. This information deficiency is one of the key issues that an independent inquiry could deal with if this government were to approve that mechanism. The key issue—that is, withdrawing the amount of tax assistance from the charitable, hospital and non-profit sectors—is that it will impact on service delivery directly. This will be in areas of vital community and public organisations. The government has never addressed how this reduction in the resources will be accommodated by the sector, and this bill is not accompanied by any offer of compensation to offset the inevitable rise in wages bills within these sectors. 
This mechanism is an attack on the services of these organisations. It is an attack on the services provided by hospitals to ordinary Australians. This will hurt them directly in their ability to provide services. So I think the government should sit up and listen and not just call for an inquiry, but actually accept and approve an inquiry on this issue.
The government has also modified its original proposals in the bill. The original proposal treated all the FBT concessions in a similar fashion, imposing a $17,000 grossed-up exemption limit per employee. But this bill actually changes that and puts in a differential rate. It is going to set an exemption limit at $25,000 grossed up for each employee for charities and other bodies, but hospitals are going to face a limit of $17,000 grossed-up exemption per employee. The regime applied to hospitals will be harsher than that applied to charities. I cannot see any specific reason, nor has the government given any specific reason, as to why it has done that. There is absolutely no explanation. I ask the government why it is treating hospitals more harshly. Why is it putting more pressure on our already strained hospital system when this is obviously an area that the government should address very closely? Again it is an attack on the public hospitals, on nurses, on doctors.
Worst of all is that as this government goes out and says it is a friend of the bush, this is an attack directly on the bush. This is an attack on those areas where the government says it wants to help people. It is talking about some sort of billion dollar package to help the bush. Why doesn't it start here with this legislation and treat hospitals and people in the bush the same as it is going to treat other bodies and charities? This is why the Labor Party is calling for, and will keep calling for, an inquiry into this bill on the taxation of charities and non-profit sectors, because there will be a huge impact, an impact they have not factored in or counted on in this legislation.
Another area that I think will be disastrous is how the FBT provisions in this bill will interact with the GST itself. There will be some dramatic complications with the whole FBT regime. The reason is that employers obtain a credit for the GST they pay on providing their employees with fringe benefits. This credit has to be taken into account by the FBT system or the GST will provide a concession to employees obtaining fringe benefits relative to those employees who use their salary to purchase the same fringe benefits where they would face the GST themselves. So there is going to be a complication in how all of this is going to work with the GST in combination with the FBT.
If that sounds like a bit of a mouthful, it is nothing compared to the complication of this whole so-called `simple' tax, because this is very far from being simple. This is a simple tax that this government told us would be easy to administer, a simple tax this government told us would have a great benefit to the community. But the reality is we have legislation about three phone books thick,  with over 1,000 amendments and probably 1,000 more to come. The Treasurer said, I think last week, there would be no more amendments, no more changes and the very next day there was another amendment, another change, and I think we are going to see a lot more of those. 
This legislation, the GST, the ANTS package, weighs over five kilograms. People are supposed to go out there, small business proprietors who have been promised this simple new tax, are supposed to pick up this over five kilo package and somehow read through it and make sense of it when the government itself, government ministers, ministers actually responsible for administering this system, do not understand it themselves. They fumble with it. They talk about rounding up and rounding down and no more than 10 per cent. The reality is they do not have a clue. It is a mess. The whole system is a mess and it has not even begun. The system is yet to actually start. It does not actually start till July 1. So while the government goes out there and tells people this is a simple tax, a tax that will benefit small business—small business supposedly being the close friend of the coalition, or the coalition claiming that it is the friend of small business, as it claims it is the friend of the bush—the reality is it has imposed very complicated—not to put a pun on it, but very weighty—legislation on its so-called friends. This  FBT complication is going to be no different. It is going to be another nightmare, another complication for small business that is trying to just get on with being able to earn a living and actually create jobs in this country. 
The regime appears reasonable on an initial cursory examination, if we look at it just on the surface, although there may well be some anomalies in some areas. If I can give an example of an anomaly, it might be the treatment of fringe benefits tax in relation to cars and their use and, as the member for the Northern Territory mentioned just a moment ago, the inequities that might be faced in relation to four-wheel drives in that part of Australia. Again this is something the government should examine closely and it should put in place an inquiry.
There are also a number of other complications that will arise where fringe benefits are GST free or input taxed. Again the so-called simplicity of GST is being complicated even further by what is contained in this bill. This, I think,  keeps going back to one thing:  the government should approve an inquiry. Until it does that, this bill will not be one that is of a sound nature. The inquiry should examine the impact of the current and proposed taxation arrangements that will apply to the charitable and non-profit sectors and identify, possibly, the changes that will encourage the delivery of the community services they provide while ensuring accountability and transparency. This inquiry is important because of the bottom line effect it will have for charities. This is why we are calling it. We are calling it because this government needs to review all of this information. We actually need to have a debate on what this is going to do to the charitable sector. They deserve to know what the impact will be on them. But they are not being given that opportunity. There are quite a number of charitable organisations and not-for-profit organisations, including hospitals, that have made a number of submissions. I will mention those in a minute.
Any inquiry should also look at the impact that the tax package will have on the sectors as they face significant increases in costs and reduction in their services. The Senate Community Affairs Committee did attempt to examine these issues but the government flatly refused to provide any detailed information on its taxation proposals or their impact on those charitable and not for profit sectors. This is the same flat refusal that this government gave those people who came to Parliament House to protest and to show their disenchantment with this government in relation to the GST being applied to caravan site fees, on rents. This government promised to all of Australia that it would not apply GST to rents.
I think this is just an example of where the government is refusing to listen. It is refusing to actually have a debate on this vital issue. While those people turned up here to have their say, the Prime Minister refused to even acknowledge them or recognise they were here, while the Treasurer flatly said no. This is the same response we are getting in relation to this bill.
There is obviously a growing amount of evidence that the GST will impose an intolerable compliance cost burden on a whole range of essential service providers. This will obviously lead to a reduction in service. I do not see how this government can go out there and say to these people, `You will still be able to deliver those much needed services with a reduced capability.' Where is the compensation package for those people? There is not one.
Numerous organisations presented submissions to the Senate committee indicating their views about the proposed FBT changes and the results they would see in the reduction of services they would be able to deliver in the community. I will mention a couple of these. The Wesley Central Mission said that they would be forced to cut back services to children and older Australians isolated in their homes. Is this what this government wants? Is this what it is aiming to do? Is this the proposal it has put forward?
The Spastic Centre of New South Wales indicated that they will have to cut services to hundreds of disadvantaged families, including many in rural and remote areas. Again, the government trots out its views on the bush all the time, claims it will spend $1 billion, but everywhere it turns, everywhere it puts something down on paper in this House, it attacks the bush. It goes out to the media and says, `We're going to spend $1 billion out in the bush.' That is poll driven. This poll driven government is trying to react to the amount of service cuts that it is imposing on the bush. 
The National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations noted in their submission that, as a result of the tax package, they would have difficulty retaining medical staff, again, in rural and remote communities. What is the message here? Keep cutting back the services in the bush. They will not be able to keep staff. Doctors will not want to go out there. Right now we have numerous committees, both on this side of politics and on the government side of politics, that are investigating the damage being done out in the bush in relation to services and people leaving the bush and going to the cities. Where are the incentives in this package to give people an option to go to the bush or, if they are already there, to actually stay in the rural communities, to stay in the regional and rural areas? There is none at all. This bill actually proposes to further cut back all the incentives, or some of the incentives at least, of those people who are either currently in the bush or who might be thinking about going to the bush.
There is a broad range of charitable and non-profit organisations that have expressed concerns about the impact of the government's tax package on their ability to deliver services. I have mentioned a few but they also include organisations such as St Vincent de Paul, the Salvation Army, Melbourne City Mission, Catholic Health Australia, Uniting Community Services Australia and Anglicare Australia.
I ask the government: if they are not listening to us and if they are not listening to the people who come to this place to put forward their views and tell the government about how they are hurting, why are they not listening to these organisations?  What is wrong with listening to what these organisations have to say about their capacity to deliver services in the community? If they are not listening to those people, who are they listening to?
Furthermore, the Ralph committee report has challenged the government's claimed savings from the package's proposed FBT measure. The committee concluded that it was not convinced that:
... the proposal... will be sustainable in the longer term because of the eventual cost to revenue.
So the proposal may not even be sustainable at all. Yet this government keeps trying to impose its policies and legislation which hurt the bush, hurt rural communities and cut back services. Given the systematic non-co-operation of the government, the growing disaster of the GST, evidence from across a whole range of charitable and non-profit sectors and the doubts thrown up by the Ralph committee, this is enough weight for this government to sit up and listen and actually put an inquiry in place. That was what we are really asking for. We are asking for a proper debate; we are asking for an inquiry.
There are some limited measures in this bill which have merit and I acknowledge that, but this government needs to have this inquiry. Unfortunately, I think that this government is going to refuse to listen. There will not be an inquiry because the government is just not interested. Members opposite can laugh; they think this is funny. But those people in the bush will not think it is funny because you refuse to listen to the 160,000 people living in caravan parks around Australia. It is another broken promise. You said there would be no GST on rents. You went out there and told those people unequivocally, `No, there won't be any GST on rents' and yet those people, who are often disadvantaged, will have a GST on them. You have not listened to the people of Australia who have told you about the full impact that the GST is going to have on them. You have not listened to small business. You have hurt small business. You have not listened to consumers. You have not listened to the benefits to the community that putting GST on receipts will have. I do not believe this government will listen to the case for an inquiry. ",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2000-03-16,"—In considering the cognate debate on these two bills, I wish to examine the implications of this bill for the charitable sector and draw some attention to the need for this government to more thoroughly think through their tax policy, particularly as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Oxley, Mr Ripoll, has mentioned, and their obstinate, defensive attitude towards referring this important and complex legislation to a committee for further inquiry. In my view, this shows the government's dogmatic determination to push through this legislation rather than a genuine concern for the charitable sector that it says it has.
Despite this general observation, I would also like, as the previous speaker suggested, to indicate support for some of the elements of this bill, with the general reservations that I set out above. The first bill—A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits) Bill 2000—details, essentially, limits on the concessions to charities and public benevolent institutions. We on this side of the House have repeatedly called for a thorough independent inquiry into the impact of the tax package on the non-profit sector, including this part of the package. We have been calling for that since 1999.
In fact, a number of my constituents—the very hard working and worthy charities in my electorate—have contacted my office on this very issue, expressing their frustration at the anticipated detrimental effect of this bill's provisions on the level of service they can provide to our community, particularly those in the `not-for-profit' sector.
The critical issue for these people—some of whom are employees, others are employers or proprietors—is how the affected organisations will manage to attract appropriately skilled and qualified professionals and other staff to maintain the level of service expected from their organisations.
The kind of salary packaging that attracts fringe benefits tax is widespread across all levels of staffing professionals in the charity sector. As the member for Jagajaga pointed out before, it is also extensively applied to staffing arrangements in public hospitals such as the Alfred Hospital in my electorate. Ironically, this is more so as a result of the aggressive push for these kinds of arrangements by the former Kennett state government—cut by the Kennett government, belted again by Costello and Howard. It is this aspect of the bill that I am mostly concerned about. I hope that either the government will see sense and refer the matter to an independent inquiry or a clearer picture will arise from a Senate inquiry of how the ill effects on the charities and non-profit sector can be offset.
The positive aspects of this bill contain a few good things for ordinary taxpayers.  In particular, remote area housing is to be made completely FBT free. This includes housing loans, residential fuel and other housing costs as well. However, what has not been addressed are transport costs, particularly in far remote regions where health workers drive long distances and a four-wheel drive is an absolute necessity. One wonders where the National Party is on this. What is it they say? Tigers in the bush, kittens in Canberra! The honourable member for Corangamite says that an inquiry is not required because he knows of cases where the system is abused by charities and the like. I would question that because there is simply insufficient evidence in my view to make that assessment as definitively as he and members of the government make it.
As my colleague the member for Oxley pointed out, that is not based on empirical evidence from the department. I reiterate my call for an independent inquiry on the basis of the impact on service levels for charities in the non-profit community and health sector. I am sure the person representing the government would like to know that the Sacred Heart Mission, which is around the corner from my office, every day feeds some 600 people who do not have enough money to eat. The Sacred Heart Mission says the $25,000 cap on concessions would instantaneously cost the charity $30,000. A recent survey shows that CEOs in the charity sector are at the lower end of the scale as far as FBT is concerned. It is imperative that these organisations maintain their standards of service and do not slip into a situation where they become second rate operators providing a third rate service because of some shortsighted government policy. This matter should be referred to an inquiry and, if the government fails to take up the concerns of the charitable sector, I am afraid the Senate will do it for it. ",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"O'Byrne, Michelle, MP",ALP,2000-03-16,"—The legislation before us proposes four basic changes to provisions relating to fringe benefits tax. It seeks to limit the currently unlimited FBT exemptions with specific relation to charities and non-profit organisations. It includes alterations to the provisions in relation to the way the GST interacts with FBT. It includes exemptions for remote area housing benefits and meals. It includes technical amendments to the method of FBT in relation to the calculation of liability under the Medicare levy surcharge.
Since October last year, Labor has strongly argued that there should be an independent inquiry into the impact on the taxation system, including the FBT in the non-profit sector. This inquiry should look at possible changes that will encourage the delivery of the community services they provide while ensuring accountability and transparency. We need an independent inquiry because the government asserts the current FBT provisions are being abused. The tax system must be fair and everyone should make an appropriate contribution. Concessions are a form of tax expenditure and it is appropriate that clearly defined assistance be provided to charities and organisations providing a public benefit in some situations. However, as yet there is no data available to the public that assesses the behaviour of non-profit bodies and the application of the FBT. There is a small reference in the Treasury tax expenditure statement, but that does not leave us in a position to effectively monitor and respond to alleged abuses.
As I mentioned earlier, this bill refers to exemptions for remote housing benefits. Remote housing is to be made fully tax free. Currently it is tax free for primary production employers and 50 per cent tax free for other employers. Remote area housing is defined as housing which is within 40 kilometres of urban areas of 14,000 population in 1981 or within 100 kilometres of an urban area with a population of 130,000 in 1981.
Regional and remote health care organisations have used the exemption to good effect to attract and retain qualified staff to difficult to recruit areas. The towns in northern Tasmania have difficulty in attracting health staff, and salary packaging is an important mechanism used to make the remunerations competitive. Specific benefits, such as accommodation, travel for study purposes and subsidised professional development arrangements that are currently being used will now come into the capped benefit arrangements. In addition to this, the rural housing exemption included in this bill does not assist many of those in regional Tasmania. 
Essentially, the rules are that the accommodation concession applies only to towns with a population smaller than 14,000, towns which are more than 40 kilometres from a town with 14,000 people or 100 kilometres from a town of 130,000. These rules effectively limit this concession to the remotest locations. In Tasmania it means the accommodation concession will not be available in many places. These accommodation concessions are a significant benefit used to attract professional people to smaller towns. If one looks at the geography of northern Tasmania, one can immediately see how this rule discriminates against Tasmanians in regional areas. Devonport, Burnie and Launceston all have difficulties attracting doctors. Devonport is a town of 22,000 people and is not eligible. Burnie is a town of 19,000 people and is not eligible. Launceston is a town of 67,000 and is not eligible. This measure does not reflect the nature of many regional communities.
I will briefly refer to the environment the charities find themselves in with the imposition of the GST to demonstrate the full implication of the legislation and further validate the need for a full independent inquiry. There is growing evidence that the GST will impose intolerable compliance burden costs. This Government talk of social coalition. It is almost as though they believe that talking about it will make them appear to care or perhaps even make it true. This is the same government whose policies are breaking the backs of families, not only in regional Australia but also in the cities and larger towns. In the Journal of Economic and Social Policy in 1997 Philip Mendes of Monash University quotes from an article in the Age of 28 August 1996: 
The Liberal Government's first budget brought down on 20th August 1996 imposed massive spending cuts on the poor and disadvantaged. They included a saving of $745 million of social security via cuts to payments for new migrants, cuts in rent assistance and changes to eligibility requirements; and savings of $460 million via the abolition of the Commonwealth Dental Health Program, and the introduction of nursing home fees. A further $1.5 billion was cut from labour market programs. According to ACOSS President Robert Fitzgerald, 30 per cent of the Government's spending cuts targeted people on low income.
Community groups in my electorate inform me of an overwhelmingly high level of increased need from within the community. While this government is happy to let the charitable organisations pick up on the responsibility that it blatantly shirks, it continues to further hit the same organisations with a tax that is so unfair the arguments against it grow daily. For the first time in Australian history, charities will become tax collectors, but before they collect they must comply. These groups face significantly increased administration costs under the so-called tax reform. The cost of compliance includes contracting a specialised accountant to explain the complexities of the supposed simpler tax system, new accounting systems and equipment, and an increase in paperwork resulting in an increase in administration staff and training requirements. 
But what if an organisation turning over less than $100,000 decides not to register? The implications, apart from not being able to apply for GST inputs paid, are also very high. For example, charitable organisations, particularly in my electorate, often receive free advertising from their local newspaper for a fundraising event. Pre-GST the outcome of this is quite simple. They receive free promotion of their event and in return the local newspaper's logo is displayed as being a supporter of the event. But post-GST, the flow-on effect on the bottom line of that newspaper makes such a simple exchange complicated to a point where there is no incentive for companies to apply such support to charitable organisations. If the charity to which that newspaper is donating the advertising is not registered for the GST, the newspaper must still pay their portion of GST on that market value of the advertising. This additional cost absorbed by any business already generously donating goods or a service to a charity will more than likely reduce and destroy any real incentive to show support to such charity groups.  However, in the next breath the Prime Minister demands that corporate Australia offer more assistance to the community sector through his social coalition policies.
Terry McCarthy, Chairman of the Society of St Vincent De Paul's national public affairs committee, stated in an article in the Business Review Weekly of 3 September 1999 that the compliance burden will be so great that many charities might choose to cop the expense of GST and not claim GST credits, which will diminish their ability to serve their cause. In the same article Myles McGrego-Lowndes points out:
... to its surprise, the tax office found the not for profit sector is the single biggest sector to be hit.
He says:
... the range of activities covered by many charities is far more extensive than for many corporations.
So where does this leave us as a nation? If the demand for charitable organisations' services is increased as a result of a GST but these services' ability to maintain, yet alone increase, their services is diminished by the GST, where does it leave us? There is a very real fear, backed by submissions to the Senate committee, that the proposed changes will result in a significant reduction in the services they currently deliver. 
We are now living in a society that has taken about all it can from this government, this government that has shown no concern for real people living in real situations of crisis. If the attack then deepens and falls on the charity and community groups who have been picking up this government's slack over their policy decisions since 1996, then I fear we will see a total breakdown of the communities as we now recognise them.  
It was Martin Luther King who said, `Like Moses I am on the mountain top and I can see the promised land. I'm not going to be able to get there with you, but we will get there.' By `we' he was referring to society, a society that works together to build a nation. How can the policies of this government inspire and entice people to work together if their very policies push people further and further apart? We must build a strong active society, not tear it apart. This government's GST will tear it apart.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2000-03-16,"—The Treasurer promised earlier this year that he would not be making any further changes to his tax laws. I refer in particular to an interview with Neil Mitchell on 3AW on 24 January, where he was asked: `Does that mean no more changes?' The Treasurer said: `Well, it does mean that we are not changing the legislation, that we've got it right. As you implement these things there have to be further rulings; they're just rulings as to how the Taxation Office applies the concept, but we're not changing the legislation.'
The amendment bills before us today do change the legislation. So yet again we have another broken promise from the government —from the `never ever' man who said we would never ever have a GST, right through to the Treasurer who, as recently as January this year, said there would be no further legislative changes. Yet that is precisely what we have before us today.
There is now some professional estimate of the size of the compliance burden of the GST. This was supplied unwittingly by probably the fiercest advocate for the GST, the National Farmers Federation. This report was prepared by Professor Binh Tran-Nam of ATAX from the University of New South Wales. It is called The implementation costs of the GST in Australia: A preliminary analysis.  At page 9 of that report it says:
As a result of its GST implementation, Australian business will incur additional one-off net costs of about $2.8 billion. This amount is very significant, representing about 10 per cent of the expected GST revenue of $27.2 billion in 2000-01.
The regulation impact statement produced by the government in relation to the GST provides an estimate of the total compliance cost, the net compliance cost, of $385 million. Yet we have now an initial cost estimate from the University of New South Wales of $2.8 billion. The report goes on to say:
Most of these costs will be ultimately passed on to the consumers. This will add further pressure to the one-off rise in the consumer price level as a result of the introduction of the GST. This additional inflationary pressure was not considered by the federal Treasury in its analysis of the GST-induced consumer price rise.
Professor Binh Tran-Nam goes on to say:
Most seriously, the high implementation costs of the GST cast doubts on the supposed welfare gains of the GST-based tax reform. Simplicity is, after all, an aspect of efficiency.
Finally the report says:
The estimated increase in tax operating costs is clearly much higher than the most optimistic cost-induced efficiency gains estimate.
That estimate was provided by Mr Chris Murphy, the Prime Minister's preferred modeller, where he came up with a figure of $600 million after about seven to 10 years. I wonder what the National Farmers Federation and all the other advocates of the GST think now that even the most favourable estimate of the long term benefits of the GST of $600 million is being swamped by the compliance costs released by the University of New South Wales of $2.8 billion.
One of the key issues in the legislation before us is limitation on FBT exemption for non-profit bodies. I refer now to the Treasurer's frequent, often repeated statements, that the GST legislation is a streamlined new tax system for a new century. Of course, the GST interacts with the FBT and that is why some of this legislation is before us today. So how streamlined is this new tax system when the government's own report says: `When is fringe benefits tax payable? Currently fringe benefits tax is generally payable in three instalments with a balancing payment subsequently'. So there are four in the year at present. Under the new proposals, FBT will be payable five times a year. How does this constitute a streamlining of the existing taxation arrangements?  
The legislation before us today obviously impacts on charities, but when we are asked to have a look at government documentation, The new tax system, information for senators and members, we go to the section entitled, `The new tax system, what's in it for charities and non-profit organisations?' Well, there it is. That is what is in it for charities and non-profit organisations—two miserable dot points. The first one says:
Charities that have registered for an ABN can apply to the Commissioner of Taxation to be endorsed as a deductible gift recipient or an income tax exempt entity.
In other words, if they do not register, they will lose their income tax exempt status. So this is supposed to be a big benefit of the new tax system. It is basically saying that if you do not register you are going to get hit and that is supposed to be a benefit. The second dot point says:
Only genuine charities will be able to access imputation credits from trust donations to restore their funding position and claim income tax exemption.
The same point. This is a penalty if people do not register; it is not a benefit if they do. If you want to have a bit of a look at the interaction between the FBT and the GST as related to this legislation, here is the concise analysis of the interaction of those prepared by Ray Regan. It is entitled The GST's effect on FBT and salary packaging. That is anything but a streamlined new taxation system for a new century. We must ask, therefore, how the GST will affect charities. All charities and non-profit organisations with an annual turnover of more than $100,000 will be required to register for GST. It must be done by 31 May if the charity is to retain its tax deductible status as a gift recipient or an income tax exempt charity. This status will be withdrawn if registration does not occur. So you will have enormous compliance burdens on charities, enormous cost burdens on charities. So it will increase their compliance costs, it will impose a cash flow penalty on charities, it will adversely affect many fundraising activities and reduce the profitability of commercial operations undertaken by charities.
I want to give an example because non-commercial activities of charities will be GST free if the payment received for them is less than 50 per cent of the GST inclusive market value or less than 75 per cent of the cost of supply. So let us have a look at a couple of examples. The first is in relation to supplies of less than 50 per cent of market value. The government's own document uses this example. A charity sells donated baby bootees for $2. The GST inclusive market value of the bootees is $6 if sold by a business.  Since the bootees are sold for less than 50 per cent of the market value, the sale is GST free. What happens if the bootees were sold for $4? If they were donated bootees and they were sold for $4 instead of $2, they would be subject to the GST. So charities have to work this out all the time. Another example: supplies for less than 75 per cent of the cost of the supply. In this example, a charity sells a newsletter for $1.50. The cost of producing the newsletter is $3. Since the newsletter is sold for less than 75 per cent of the cost of the supply, the sale is GST free. What happens if the newsletter sold for $2.50 instead of $1.50? Then the sale of the newsletter will incur the GST. This is a nightmare for charities. That is why we want an inquiry. 
Accommodation provided by charities for more than 75 per cent of the market value or the cost of supply will be subject to the GST. Donated second-hand goods will be GST free where supplied by a charity and provided they retain their original character. But if we look at the example of the sale of industrial cleaning rags that have been made from recycled clothing by a charity, then that will be subject to the GST. Donations in the form of a payment in cash or in kind that are made unconditionally are not subject to the GST. However, where a grant is paid to a charity or non-profit organisation for a specific purpose or with any conditions, GST will be payable. So we have to work out whether there are actual or implied conditions in these donations, because if there are conditions it will be subject to the GST. Instead of doing the work that they are equipped to do, trained to do and dedicated to do, the management and staff of charitable organisations will be trying to tread their way through this nightmare working out whether there is a condition on the donation, working out whether a donated product is being sold for 75 per cent of cost or more or less, or 50 per cent of market value. It is an absolute nightmare.  
I could go on and on and on as to how the GST will affect fundraising activities of charities. It will adversely affect those fundraising activities. It is a nightmare of a tax and that is precisely why Labor has moved the second reading amendment—so that we will get, if the government is sensible about it, an independent inquiry so that we can have a proper look at the interaction of the FBT with the GST and how the FBT and the GST will affect charities. We know it is going to be a bad effect, but we need to know the detail and we need to know the scope for improvement because there's plenty of scope for improvement in this legislation and that inquiry should proceed.

"Martin, Stephen, MP",ALP,2000-03-16,"—Today we are debating the A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits) Bill 2000. Interestingly, the minister at the table interjected a moment ago that we on this side introduced the FBT. The issue I want to raise in here today relates to the FBT and how it affects the Australian Defence Force because, quite frankly, it did not. Under the Labor Government, the FBT was never applied to the Australian Defence Force and the benefits that they received were always exempt. It is on that particular issue that I wish to spend a short time this afternoon.
The simple fact is this: had it not been for the pressure that was brought to bear on this government by the opposition, by a number of different Defence Force retired organisations and by the Defence Force itself through a very effective letter writing campaign through Defence Force journals, perhaps the government may not have decided to change its original stance and introduce some changes on the FBT and how it would apply to the Australian Defence Force.
When those changes were announced by the Minister for Defence and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, we welcomed them but we did say that they did not go far enough. We said that because, unfortunately, there is this view within the community that every worker is the same and, as a consequence, every worker should be treated the same. That is certainly a view which applies as far as this government is concerned. But it is not the case when one looks at the Australian Defence Force. Can honourable members tell me of another category of employees in Australia or anywhere else who are unable to access normal industrial laws and processes; who are on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week; who are never paid overtime; who are subject to the Defence Force Discipline Act; who are compulsorily posted and who can be sent to war at any time?  Tell me of another category of Australian workers that fits into that particular set of criteria. There are none.
It was because of the recognition that there was a special class of employee—personnel in the Australian Defence Force—that Labor, when in government, never applied the fringe benefits tax to any of the allowances which the Australian Defence Force had access to. The proposal under the fringe benefits tax reporting regime was that those allowances paid for things like housing assistance, air-conditioning, removals related to postings and relocations, car parking, defence car parks, medical and dental costs, entertainment, food and drink, funerals and so on. All of those things were always exempt and the grossed up value was always exempt.
The government did finally move on those issues and they are either not reportable any longer or exempt. It was only through the pressure that was brought to bear by the opposition and Defence Force associations that we saw those changes. But what the government has not done is taken it that step further. What the government has not done is exempt some of the other allowances and benefits which are paid to the Australian Defence Force personnel which make living and working in the Australian Defence Force bearable. The simple fact is that the separation rates of the Australian Defence Force at the present time are at an all-time high.
The ability to retain people in the three services of the Australian Defence Force and the ability to recruit people for the Australian Defence Force is not good at present. There are a number of reasons why that might be the case. Certainly I think it has to be said that people perceive that economic conditions provide an opportunity in other employment. But I also have to say the sort of personnel that filed into Defence Force recruiting locations around Australia after our efforts in East Timor threw up some undesirables who we probably would not want in the Australian Defence Force and, as a consequence, they were not recruited. Nevertheless, there are substantial separations taking place at the moment. Why would that not be the case when we note that in terms of the application of fringe benefits tax, each of the different benefits that are given to ADF personnel has a value placed on it which is grossed up and therefore taxed as part of their taxable income to things like remote locality leave travel in Darwin. 
The simple fact is, whether it was under a Labor government or under the present government, there has been a tremendous effort made in ensuring that a large percentage of Australia's Defence Force is located north, for all very good reasons—some very strong defensive reasons and for regional security reasons. As a consequence, we find that remote locality leave travel in Darwin is still subject to the fringe benefits tax. We see also that discharge removals and travel, removal of non-service spouse and breakdown of marriage, removals in the same locality—that is, when they are buying a home—child-care reimbursement allowance, remote locality travel leave, which I have mentioned, reunion travel, defence home loans, home purchases and sales expense allowances and education assistance are all still subject to the FBT. What this government has missed are the reasons why these particular exemptions were given by the former government as far as it was perceived that, because of the employment conditions that applied to people in the ADF, there were peculiar circumstances. And because there were these peculiar circumstances of employment, there clearly needed to be some exemptions given in terms of FBT.
At the end of the day, Australia's serving men and women—those people who are privates, corporals, sergeants and so on—do it because they are committed to the defence of this nation and because they love what they are doing. They are committed to Australia. They are not committed to the salary levels they get because those salary levels are not really competitive. But what they do get are benefits that go with being in remote locations, having to be posted every couple of years. When talking to people in the Australian Defence Force, many of these people will tell you time and again of the number of postings they have had in a five- or 10-year period. They have had anything up to 15, 16, sometimes 20, postings around Australia and all the disruption that goes with that in moving their families, changing schools and going through different education systems when they go across state and territory boundaries because we cannot line up a similar set of educational standards there. Yet each and every time this happens, these people are subject to the fringe benefits tax because they are given some benefits associated with that.
We have said over a long period of time now that it is unreasonable to expect Australia's serving men and women to be subjected to this tax impost. We convinced this government there was a need for some change and we commended them at the time for the direction that they took. But they have not gone far enough. I would have liked to have seen in these bills before the parliament this afternoon a further commitment and a further consideration by the government. I would have loved to have seen Minister Moore and Minister Scott really sit down with people in the ADF and ask, `What are those concerns that you still have?' They would have been told about the grossing-up of fringe benefits and the taxation benefits that have negative impacts on them on the way through in a whole variety of other areas. 
That even raises the question: what impact is there likely to be on these serving men and women with the introduction of the GST? As other speakers on this side have said, there is an inexorable link between both the fringe benefits tax and the GST. Many of those people will continue to be disadvantaged. What will be the outcome of that? I suspect we will continue to see the number of separations in the Australian Defence Force go up. People will simply say it is not worth staying, having that commitment to the defence of Australia and learning skills in the ADF and the three services, yet the government is going to take any of those benefits because they will tax them and gross up the value on reportable amounts. 
The simple fact is that the reason why this FBT reporting regime should be changed is to give particular recognition to the conditions of employment that these people in the Australian Defence Force enjoy. We will continue on this side of the parliament to try to ensure that the government takes the necessary steps to remedy these continuing anomalies. In government we indicated that this was an issue which we would certainly revisit. I see no reason why we would not take the same sort of attitude that we adopted when we were in government in respect of these matters. The simple facts are these: the government has not gone far enough. They were forced into some of the backdowns but they have not gone all the way that is necessary and they were forced into it by the pressure that was brought on them by the opposition. 
Defence personnel are different. They are not normal employees. They are different and they need special consideration. As I said, there is a crisis in both recruitment and retention within the Australian Defence Force at present. It is something that I would have liked to have seen addressed in this legislation, instead of all the formulae that we are debating this morning. I see there are exceptions for remote area housing benefits, meals on working days and so on, and it applies to charities. But I have to say that, in terms of the defence of this nation, this government is letting down those men and women who give 100 per cent commitment to the service of their nation. It should have been looked at very closely in this legislation; it should have been applied. Once again it has not been. We will endeavour to keep the government honest in this matter.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2000-03-16,"—I appreciate the comments of those people who have spoken in this debate. I am feeling very magnanimous. I would like to thank the opposition for its cooperation in ensuring the comparatively smooth passage of this bill through the House of Representatives to date.
These bills are about ensuring greater equity in the taxation system for all Australians. The fringe benefits tax system, I remind everyone, particularly those people in the gallery, was introduced by the Labor Party in 1996. That system is being amended in this bill.
Perhaps the term `fringe benefits' is a bit of a misnomer. These are in fact personal benefits that individuals receive directly from their employer, and typically Australians obtain such personal benefits from their after-tax income. So the capping measures that we are putting in place will ensure that a similar regime is imposed on these employees.
Remember also that not all benefits fall within the consideration of a cap. Certain benefits like remote area housing, remote area meals, superannuation and other benefits of up to $100 are exempt from FBT and can be received by all employees without the imposition of the Labor Party's FBT.
The proposed $17,000 and $25,000 caps will allow organisations such as charities and hospitals to retain some concessional FBT treatment while at the same time removing the scope for an open-ended overuse. Naturally enough, we are not going to accept the Labor Party's second reading amendment. I commend the bill to the House as it stands. The capping measures are fair and reasonable and I commend them to the House.

"Anderson, John, MP",NP,2000-03-16,"—I seek to add to an answer I gave to a question from the member for Batman in question time. The member for Batman sought to imply that the airport that is being progressively upgraded in Rockhampton would not be available for international services. I have advice to say that Airservices did indeed reduce the category of the airport from category 6 to category 5 on 31 January. This involves a reduction in manning by three, and there will be one less fire tender at the airport. Airservices have further advised that, when airlines develop firm plans to operate expanded services to Rockhampton, they will upgrade the level of the fire service accordingly.
—I warn the member for Melbourne Ports.
—It gives me the opportunity in relative silence to repeat the point. Airservices, at short notice, regularly upgrade the fire service at the airport during military exercises. It regularly happens. In conclusion, the opposition is always embarrassed when it is exposed. The member for Batman is, quite simply, dead wrong. When international airlines develop firm plans to use Rockhampton Airport, Airservices will supply the category of fire service that is necessary to support them. I will take steps to ensure that the people of Capricornia are informed of my commitment that international services be able to access the airport when it is required.

"SPEAKER, Mr",N/A,2000-03-16,"—I refer to the question directed to me by the member for Charlton on 6 March and wish to advise the House that in accordance with the precedence established over the last two years, the Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal flags will be flown at the entrance to the chamber during National Reconciliation Week, from 27 May to 3 June. They will be flown together with the two national flags, which will be positioned at either end of the display. Flying the flags in this manner accords with the correct flag protocol and with the precedence of recent years.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER</title>,<title>National Reconciliation Week</title>,Questions to the Speaker,10,1
"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,2000-03-16,"—There is no greater threat to services in rural and regional Australia than John Howard's ideological obsession to flog off all of Telstra. Unfortunately, there is no weaker defender of rural and regional Australia than the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party of Australia. He is a weaker and less effective defender of rural and regional Australia and a weaker and less effective Leader of the National Party than Charles Blunt was. At least Charles Blunt could put his stamp on something. The Deputy Prime Minister cannot even put his stamp on the member for Parramatta. The Deputy Prime Minister could not even rebuke the member for Parramatta when he made absolutely outrageous comments about services in rural and regional Australia. Today we saw the member for Parramatta saying country people should not expect the same access to services as city dwellers. The member for Parramatta is reported as taking a swipe at farmers, saying they should not complain. He also said that people should be prepared to move to find work:
If you find yourself unable to find a job in a regional centre ... you ought not to expect the rest of the country to underwrite your choice to stay there.
In respect of communications, the member for Parramatta was asked on the Today show today:
But why shouldn't country people ... why shouldn't they expect reasonable access to, say, a phone line to telecommunications, to those sorts of services?
The member for Parramatta answered:
Well, I think they do get, in terms of world standards, they do get reasonable access.
And the Deputy Prime Minister, the Leader of the National Party, could not even rebuke him. It is not enough that the Leader of the National Party has spent the last week and a half siding with the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts and the Prime Minister over the full privatisation of Telstra, over Telstra getting a $2.1 billion profit and cutting adrift 10,000 workers and their families. It is not enough that he sides with the minister for communications; he will not even rebuke the member for Parramatta when he says that it is government policy to have a better service for people in the city than for people in the bush. He is too weak to even rebuke him. If John Howard gets away with his ideological obsession to flog off all of Telstra, Australia misses a big chance for the future. It misses a big chance for all of our people to share in a new information world, and the people who will suffer most will be the people from rural and regional Australia. We will have a digital divide—information rich in the city and information poor in the bush. The most galling aspect of the prospect of full privatisation is the cravenness of the National Party leadership—their craven inability to stand up to the Prime Minister and the minister for communications and the way they try to sidle away pretending that they are not being seen. But the deafening silence from the leadership of the National Party is being heard like a roar in regional Australia.
Let us review John Howard's obsession with full privatisation. Just before his bush tour he decided to give the Federation speech, and he committed himself again to flogging off all of Telstra. You have got to read the fine print to see him reminding himself of the government's formal election commitment, which was not to flog off all of Telstra without a legislated inquiry with legislated terms of reference and legislated criteria for Telstra's performance. But shortly into his bush tour he suddenly discovered that the bush was not happy. So then we saw it: Howard's vow at Nyngan to end bush cuts. And what was Nyngan all about? The Nyngan declaration was that there would be no further diminution of Commonwealth services to rural and regional Australia without a red light flashing—without a red light flashing in my office and in every minister's office. What did we see soon after? A $2.1 billion profit and 10,000 jobs gone. And did the light flash? No, it did not. The National Party, too busy looking at steamy videos, had taken the globe out. The light did not flash. 
And what do we see? We see Telstra with a $2.1 billion profit, which brings in a $4 billion profit in a year, and at the same time we see that 10,000 jobs will go. And what have we heard from the government? We have heard from the minister for communications—not just sitting back silently but actually cheering the prospect of a $2.1 billion profit and 10,000 jobs gone. He cheered, popped the champagne cork and said he did not care. He said that he was not the minister for employment, so it did not matter. And what did we find in the course of the last week or so? We have seen statements and evidence from Dr Switkowski, the CEO of Telstra, and we have seen the ministers, the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister respond to questions in this place. Telstra told the government, and the red light did not flash. Telstra told the government, and the government did not ask for details. Telstra told the government about the 10,000 jobs, and the government did not care and did not act.
What did we then see? The assertion that the bulk of the 10,000 jobs would go from metropolitan areas. The Deputy Prime Minister stood in this place and sided with the minister for communications over the Leader of the National Party in the Senate, Senator Boswell, who had effectively asked how you could have a better service to rural and regional Australia when jobs would go. The Deputy Prime Minister refused to rebuke Senator Alston when he said that Bob Katter, the member for Kennedy, was a national disgrace for simply making the point that the further privatisation of Telstra would see a worse service to rural and regional Australia. We saw the Deputy Prime Minister, the Leader of the National Party, siding with the minister for communication when he said, `You don't have to worry—less means more. Fewer jobs means better service. Less means more.' It defies credibility. It defies credulity. It beggars belief, and in the end the beggars will be rural and regional Australia.
What did we find in this place? The Prime Minister, when asked by the Leader of the Opposition, made it crystal clear: yes, his Nyngan declaration about the reduction of Commonwealth services did apply to Telstra as currently constituted, but it would not apply to a fully privatised Telstra. That was a fatal admission. It was a fatal admission that the Prime Minister could not guarantee that under a fully privatised Telstra services to rural and regional Australia would not fall. And in the 21st century that does not mean just the old voice telephony services but the new information services for the new world and the new economy. So the Prime Minister has acknowledged in this place that if Telstra is fully privatised he cannot guarantee that there will not be a further decline in services to rural and regional Australia.
Let us just recap our opposition to the partial privatisation of Telstra. In the course of the 1993, 1996 and 1998 election campaigns, we have opposed the privatisation, either partial or full, of Telstra. What was our public policy rationale for doing that? There are three main points: firstly, that Telstra was an important part of our national infrastructure and was better held in national hands than in private hands; secondly, that if you partially privatised Telstra you would place a commercial imperative on Telstra and the non-commercial, non-competitive and non-profit services would fall; and, thirdly, that it is better to make infrastructure commitments to rural and regional Australia by running off a long-term dividend stream rather than a one-off flog-off. Dealing with those, what have we seen? In the last year, we have seen a $4 billion profit by Telstra—$4 billion in one year. The government returned to the Commonwealth only $14 billion from the first one-third flog-off of Telstra. A three- to four-year profit stream from Telstra is bigger than the return the government secured for the people in the first one-third privatisation of Telstra. And when we get the final return from the sale of the second tranche of Telstra it will come in at about $40 billion—10 years worth of Telstra profit returns a greater amount than flogging off 49.9 per cent. 
On service levels, we have seen a formal report by the Australian Communications Authority investigating Telstra's decline of service levels and their breach of universal service obligations and customer service guarantees. The infrastructure is now more important. Either you say to rural and regional Australia, `We believe that you should have equitable and affordable access to the services of the new information economy,' or you do not. We know as a matter of objective fact, from anecdotal evidence and from the great crescendo of screams that come from rural and regional Australia that currently the government's model cannot even supply voice telephony services in a fair, affordable and equitable way. We do not want rural and regional Australia to be left behind in the new world. We do not want a digital rich in the metropolitan fringe coastal cities and a digital poor in rural, regional and remote Australia.
When it comes to the Prime Minister's commitment to flogging off all of Telstra, having seen the partial privatisation of Telstra fail, he wants to return to the scene of the public policy crime and compound the felony. But he is actually caught by an election commitment which he is now seeking to wriggle out of. The government's formal election commitment in respect of selling Telstra was that the government would not sell more than 49.9 per cent of Telstra without first establishing an independent inquiry to assess Telstra's service levels to customers in metropolitan, rural and remote areas. The assessment was to occur against performance criteria which the government would specify in legislation. The government never specified that in the T2 legislation and the Prime Minister is now squirming, trying to avoid legislation in a proposed inquiry. When this inquiry is established, it will be a rig and a rort. The Prime Minister will seek to rig this inquiry. The Prime Minister will seek to rort this inquiry and to slide an inquiry result under the eyes of rural and regional Australia, pretending to them that service levels are in a fit state and that service levels will not further decline.
In addition to the Prime Minister, today in question time we found the Leader of the National Party not even able to commit himself to the same standard that the National Farmers Federation committed themselves to in their resolution of 28 February. The NFF wants to see delivery of T2 promises, the terms of reference and progress on the inquiry into service levels, and levels of service in rural and regional areas which are equivalent to those in urban Australia before considering T3 further. He would not even commit himself to that. A weaker and more ineffective Leader of the National Party we have not seen. If the Prime Minister is allowed to fully privatise Telstra, the government will be responsible for selling the past. On this side, we want to secure the future for all Australians. Their public policy framework sells the past; ours secures the future for all Australians, irrespective of where they live.
The Leader of the National Party, as I have indicated, has cravenly supported the minister for communications and the Prime Minister on this point. He has agreed with assertions by the minister for communications that, in respect of a $2.1 billion profit and 10,000 job losses, less means more. The job losses will come from the city and the services to the bush will improve. He has disavowed his Senate leader, Senator Boswell; he has disavowed the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Truss; and he has disavowed the member for Kennedy, Mr Katter. We find, on any number of occasions, the Leader of the National Party siding with the Liberal Party. Do not think that this has not been picked up out in the backblocks.
In terms of a public policy, what is the choice that will confront the Australian community at the next election? The choice will be this: the government committing to the full privatisation of Telstra and the Labor party opposed to its further privatisation. In the meantime, the government has committed to privatising Telstra by stealth, through the back door, and the Labor party is opposed to it. The government wants the market to rule and for rural and regional Australia to suffer; our public policy regime wants an equitable chance for all Australians to have access to new information services in the new age. 
As I said, do not think that the Leader of the National Party's stance has not been noticed in rural and regional Australia. In the Friday, 10 March edition of the Northern Daily Leader, a periodical which I am sure the Leader of the National Party is only too familiar with because it is one of his local newspapers, the editorial refers to `our local Member, the Minister for Regional Services and ultimately the Leader of the federal National Party and Deputy Prime Minister'. What does the editorial in his own local paper say? It says:
The Deputy Prime Minister has a responsibility to his party to say enough is enough ...
If the Deputy Prime Minister does not put a line in the sand, the National Party should draw the line for him. The government and Prime Minister John Howard want to sell the past; Labor and Kim Beazley want to secure the future for all Australians. The National Party will not stand in the way. Only the election of a Labor government at the next election will secure that future to ensure that all Australians have affordable and equitable access to the new information services in the new economy.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Telstra: Services</title>,Matters of Public Importance,13,1
"McGauran, Peter, MP",NP,2000-03-16,"—What a weak effort to finish off the parliamentary fortnight. What a lack of energy, commitment or belief in the honourable member's contribution. The number of Labor Party members who supported him numbered but 20 or so, and on our side, because it is a Labor debate, we hardly give it the credence it deserves. It is a Labor Party stunt. It is Labor Party confected anger and outrage. Who is on their tactics committee? I believe they should own up. It has been a jumble of issues for the parliamentary fortnight, with this sort of wrap-up on Telstra, but not a single new point was made today that was not made in an MPI late last week. Indeed, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston, is still waiting for some questions. Over the fortnight during which Labor tried to have people believe it was such a burning issue, Senator Alston has had next to no questions. At last count it was one question. He has had one question in the Senate, as I understand it, from the opposition on Telstra issues. They will not even ask the minister for communications questions, given that they think this is such a burning issue.
Why don't we pick up from where the honourable member left off when he gave an idle boast that only the election of the Labor Party to government could stop the privatisation of Telstra. Nobody in Australia who has got any memory is going to believe that. It is like the Commonwealth Bank, like Qantas and like all those other government businesses that the Labor Party gave promises on in writing. Indeed, who could ever forget the letter from the then Treasurer, Ralph Willis, in early 1993, a letter that was included in the Commonwealth Bank prospectus, that the Labor government on return to office would not privatise the Commonwealth Bank? That was junked a very short time later. So the Labor Party's hypocrisy on Telstra is as absolute as it is revealing. The Labor Party expects—or hopes, I believe, more accurately—that people will forget their deception over the years, but it is a faint hope by the Labor Party. People are not going to forget the Labor Party's sworn testimonies never to privatise. 
We have plenty of evidence that the Labor Party is as confused, as hypocritical and as misleading on privatisation today as they have been over the last 10 years. They are all over the shop. We have a number of members of the opposition who want to privatise parts of Telstra. We have got Senator Chris Schacht and Senator George Campbell in support of the privatisation of aspects of Telstra's business, which in Labor Party terms is always code for the beginning of the end. When they start stating their support for the privatisation of parts of Telstra—part of its mobile network, part of its directories, Big Pond and so on—you will quickly find that they will move to full privatisation. We have got Senator Kate Lundy on the record refusing to rule it out. As the Treasurer keeps reminding us, a Labor thinker is an oxymoron: how can there be a Labor thinker? It is an inherent contradiction of terms. However, the member for Werriwa and the member for Melbourne have both written books, supposedly on the issue of political and social policy, on various issues of great interest to them but, sadly, not to many others. They have touched on this issue and both claim that you cannot have large slabs of government capital tied up in business enterprises. Again, when you strip away the well-practised deceptions of the Labor Party, that is revealing for its intent to privatise Telstra.  
But we should not really just rely on shadow ministers, backbenchers and union heavies like Senator George Campbell. What we should really do is look at the words of the Leader of the Opposition himself. When he was Minister for Finance between 1993 and 1996, he was a champion and an advocate of privatisation.
—Passionate.
—Passionate, even. Let me quote from his budget luncheon address to the Department of Finance on 13 May 1994 to corroborate and substantiate our allegation that he is a passionate privatiser. He said:
And despite some critics suggesting asset sales amount to selling off the family jewels, they do not result in a loss of infrastructure but rather a transfer of ownership.
There you have it: the Leader of the Opposition when in government realised that privatisation is an issue of services rather than ownership. And country people are pragmatic. They want the services and the service guarantees in a regulatory framework before they are concerned about ideological concerns of ownership. We have put in place a legislative framework which keeps the pressure on all of the carriers in a way that the Labor Party never did. They never had a customer service guarantee; they had only the most restrictive of universal service obligations possible, which we have now expanded. We hold Telstra accountable in financial terms to provide guaranteed service levels. At the same time correspondingly we have introduced a whole new competitive regime which has forced down dramatically the price of local calls, long distance calls, overseas calls and the corporate market. Instead of just the old Telecom and Optus under Labor, there are now 37 licensed carriers competing for business, moving into rural areas. At the same time there are more than 1,000 Internet service providers. That competition has a marked effect on Telstra, as well as holding Telstra and the other carrier giants to proper levels of service, otherwise they would lose customers. In the old days they could have a complete disregard for their customers, but now of course they will simply lose business or face financial penalties imposed by the government's legislation. 
Let us look further at the Leader of the Opposition's record of statements on privatisation. At that same address to the Department of Finance on 13 May 1994 he said this:
Asset sales allow the government to maintain public services and benefits to the Australian people while maintaining the deficit reduction strategy without increased taxes.
So what has happened since then to the Leader of the Opposition? Why does he repudiate those arguments now except for the most basic and crass of political motives? In the Hansard of 31 May 1994 he boasts about his government's record in regard to privatisation:
... the government—
the Labor government—
has a proud record of successful privatisations, privatisations which have not only incorporated a substantial return to the taxpayer but have also incorporated a whole series of other objectives in terms of strengthening the companies concerned, giving them a very substantial ownership base and improving the efficiency of the enterprises.
How neatly does he encapsulate all the arguments in favour of privatisation of government businesses. You can maintain the levels of service. You can at the same time inject new levels of service to improve it. You can also meet other government objectives such as retirement of debt and the redirection of government spending capital to other needy areas of the economy or the community. 
At a Press Club speech on 24 August 1994, having been known as the seller of the benefits and of the worth of privatisation, he adds yet another benefit to the many he has outlined in the preceding months. He says:
Of course, another benefit of privatisation is that it contributes to the government budget, helping to reduce debt and providing funds for government programs. 
—Aren't you in the National Party?
—The honourable member for Lilley interjects. You can always rely on one of the Glimmer Twins. Actually, the Glimmer Twins are together. We sort of thought there was a cooling between the two over the last few months. We do not see them together very often, but they are together at the moment interjecting. The member for Lilley's interjection was, `I thought you were in the National Party.' Like all Labor party members, he underestimates the intelligence of country people. They want the services. They want the legislative guarantees. They want the competition. Ownership is not the test for them. They are far more pragmatic, with a commonsense outlook and expectations of government and oppositions alike, than the member for Lilley gives them credit for. You will suffer sadly at the polls if that is your condescending and patronising approach to country people. Don't think that this scare campaign you are attempting to whip up is going to have the desired effect.
 (Mr Nehl)—I am not attempting to whip anything up.
—Agreed, Mr Deputy Speaker. You would not. You bring a degree of honesty and integrity to your dealings with the electorate, unlike the members opposite. They think they are going to ride this wave on this mythical surfboard into government. Well, we have seen what has happened to the GST wave into government. Every time the Leader of the Opposition is asked to specify where the roll-back will occur, who will be the winners and who will be the losers, he avoids the question. He will not specify the details required to be credible in the eyes of the electorate, particularly not country people. 
You are not going to fool country people on this. They know your record on privatisation. They know the advocates within your ranks—the member for Werriwa, the member for Melbourne, Senator Campbell, Senator Schacht, Senator Lundy and the few other brave souls who will eventually throw off the bonds of frustration and let people have an insight into their thinking on privatisation as time goes by. You will not hold your ranks on this issue. There is a majority body within that Labor Party who wants privatisation of a number of Telstra businesses, the directories particularly. There is no question that the members of the Senate and House of Representatives I have mentioned want the directories sold off. So does the Leader of the Opposition. On 11 February this year, a few short weeks ago, in the Sydney Morning Herald, the Leader of the Opposition said:
Telstra has to conduct its affairs as it sees fit.
He is saying `complete hands off'. Let Telstra make the decisions as it wants, including reductions of staff wherever it may be. I repeat:
Telstra has to conduct its affairs as it sees fit.
In regard to proposals to float online services, he said this:
... a matter they have to consider
The Leader of the Opposition was advocating complete hands off. He is not going to prevent Telstra—
—Read the two whole paragraphs.
—The Leader of the Opposition is in direct conflict with the member for Perth, because the member for Perth told Telstra in a semiprivate meeting recently—we will say no more, except we know what was said at that meeting—that they were never to sell off a single thing. The member for Perth is in direct conflict with the Leader of the Opposition. But the Leader of the Opposition is weak and he is not going to rein in the member for Perth—who is running telecommunications policy on behalf of the Labor Party; it is not the Leader of the Opposition.
—What policy? There is no policy. But to the extent that we are having a debate about the privatisation of Telstra, we see the Labor Party awash in various opinions. A majority can be discerned for the privatisation of different aspects of Telstra's business. But only the other day the member for Perth ruled that out. I would like to see the member for Perth able to prevail against the member for Melbourne, the member for Werriwa, Senator Campbell, Senator Schacht and Senator Lundy, combined! In a head-on conflict with any one of them he would bowl them over in policy terms, but together he will not prevail. We want to know from the member for Perth what he said to Telstra the other day. Why tell them something in private and not say it publicly? Is he totally and utterly opposed to any selling off of Telstra's businesses? 
—You can read my press release.
—I will tell you one I have read. On Monday, 20 December 1999, he congratulated Telstra for their improved service levels. The member for Perth, who for the last fortnight has been saying that Telstra's services are collapsing and are going to collapse further, only a few weeks ago was congratulating Telstra for their improved services. As my time expires, I can only restate that that their policy deception, policy hypocrisy and policy inconsistency will not fool the Australian public, least of all the very discerning rural voters who deserve better than what the Labor Party is giving them.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Telstra: Services</title>,Matters of Public Importance,13,1
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2000-03-16,"—The member for Gippsland and the minister talked about the Labor Party riding a wave into the next election. It is certainly not the bush that is surfing on the Net. There are difficulties in being able to surf the Net or use the Net for renewing the bush, because of this government's policies. As our shadow spokeman said, it is the threat to services in the bush because of privatisation that has been the heart of this debate. The government has failed to understand what completely privatising the whole of Telstra means in the bush. It is not just the job losses which will be terrible. It is also the ability to be able to link the bush to the rest of the world at a price that is within the reach of people—links with things like educational services, e-commerce, multimedia and retail services, which are very limited at the moment. This cannot happen without the communications infrastructure being provided. It is like the rail lines on which a multiple of different trains run. The rail lines need to be provided and maintained at the top level and really only a government overseen service can ensure that this will happen. The government should insist on the customer service guarantee that requires the telephone carriers to meet levels of service established for all customers regardless of location.
These carriers should develop pricing, technical standards and levels of support for telecommunications that are independent of distance. The argument that the city subsidises the bush is wrong. In fact, if anything it is the other way around. There is no reason why calls between towns in the bush should be on STD rates, as happens now. Distance is no longer a cost component. For example, the cost of using the Sydney to Melbourne fibre link is roughly $100 per year per channel. If you break this down to per minute, it is minuscule. A call from Sydney to Melbourne is two halves of a local call with a length of fibre in between. It no longer involves exchanges and may be only one switch number, so really all the costs have gone. It may be a very slight increase between two country towns but it is so marginal that it is not even worth considering.
Country people are very high users of long distance calls. Since the introduction of the Internet into many farms, this has grown enormously. They have had no choice but to pay STD charges as there are no exchanges inside their telephone zones. Now that distance is no longer a component of the cost, this is very unfair. The bush is providing the basis for Telstra's $2 billion profit. Tasmania should be one telephone zone with calls reduced to the price of local calls from wherever anyone in Tasmania phones. And then there is the lack of services. The complaints I get are ongoing. I will detail some of those complaints—the ones that the minister did not say anything about. They are very real. A pensioner from Mole Creek rang and said that they needed one of the Easycall add-on facilities, but was informed by Telstra that it was not available through small exchanges like Mole Creek and, more than likely, would never be available. That raises the question: why has this exchange never been upgraded? The answer is obvious: it is not part of the Internet network and all those people in Mole Creek will be highly disadvantaged. This is a town of about 500 people an hour and a bit from Launceston. That is not good enough. 
Beauty Point and other West Tamar residents have been told their calls are directed through Georgetown and therefore they are at STD rates. This is having a terrible effect on small business—only 40 kilometres from Launceston. That is not good enough. An east coast small business just outside Swansea told us of having no fax service for a week. On seeking some response from Telstra, we were advised that there had been only one technician trying to fix a major fault and he had no time to do the repair. Eventually, it was fixed three days later after a weekend loss to that tourist business, which has many overseas customers, of thousands of dollars worth of business. That is not good enough.
Then there was a very serious situation at the hospital in Queenstown—I believe I asked a question on this matter some time ago—when all the phone systems failed over a weekend. There was no technician located in Queenstown and the depot had been closed. The nearest person for this job was located in Hobart and was not in a position to get to Queenstown until after the weekend. People could not phone in or out. Mobiles do not work very well down there, nor did the staff involved have access to them, except for one in the hospital. The only way people managed to contact the local hospital was through the local radio station, 7XS, which made sure that information was ferried backwards and forwards over the weekend. The ambulance was kept tuned to the station—expensive for the radio station and potentially very bad for a patient seeking emergency help, had it not been for this strange backup system which worked for this community. That is not good enough. For a pensioner on the east coast, it took over six weeks to gain the phone links which he so desperately needed. That is not a service; that is a trial for these people and it is not good enough.
I could go on. I have an office full of complaints, and that is just my little patch being represented in this parliament—let alone the lack of services to the rest of the nation. This government has already let the bush down. The National Party has failed its constituency by not acting to ensure that services in the bush are delivered. If anyone is going to believe them now, I do not know who it will be. They have failed in their responsibility in making sure that the bush gets their fair share of the latest technology. There is so much secrecy about the programs that they could be delivering to people. They obviously want to use these programs for pork-barrelling rather than for genuine regional development. How many people in the bush know about the Business Entry Point initiative? What about the Trials in Innovative Government Electronic Regional Service Project? Where is the information about those trials? How successful were they and when is the full program going to start? Then there are the rural transaction centres. There were supposed to be hundreds set up by now, but as far as I can learn, the government has managed only 23.
The report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services which came down this week identified a whole raft of recommendations to help people in regional areas—33 of them to do with communications and information technology. The committee visited people in a whole range of regions right around the country and the major issues causing barriers to trade and the difficulty of renewing the bush all related to communications. So it is not only the ALP raising these issues; it is the bush talking to us in this parliament. If Telstra is not going to play the game, then it is time to look at alternatives and it has to provide the infrastructure that is part of the customer service obligation. But it does not have to have the monopoly on other ways of delivering services. There needs to be some flexibility in how we deal with offering a whole range of services to people in country areas. Local loops, satellite delivery and the use of the technology still being developed must be part of the plan. The bush cannot be locked into one company's business plan. It must have a range of opportunities available at competitive prices. 
The bush knows how to pay for services. We have been paying through the nose for years. Now is the time to be more innovative. I doubt whether this government even knows what `innovative' means. Change and new ideas are frightening and this government gets spooked very easily, especially if someone else is putting new ideas forward. It will mean the government putting up some money to develop a long-term strategy and then forgetting about it. Only the privileged are allowed to benefit from this government.
This government has failed rural and regional areas. It has failed dismally and it is not prepared to admit it. Even the Nationals know this government has failed but they are too lily-livered to admit it. It is their seats that are under threat. They would be well advised to find a little backbone to stand up to the cuts in the bush. When the Prime Minister's red light goes off again with another cut to Telstra in the bush I suggest he take some notice of the red light as it flashes around his office at the other end of this building.

"Thompson, Cameron, MP",LP,2000-03-16,"—In parliament I generally like to follow the member for Lyons because I generally respect his view and I share committee interests with him, but on this particular occasion I have to say that there was not the sort of fire I have come to expect from the member for Lyons. It was rather a drab effort. He was reading his speech and, although it was well put together, there was a lack of fire. I was expecting more fire. He has become known on this side of parliament as Grizzly Adams. I would have expected much more grizzling and a lot less humbug from the member for Lyons than we got on this occasion. His heart isn't in it.
The government insists on a couple of things in relation to Telstra: the universal service order and the customer service guarantee. The universal service order and the customer service guarantee are legislative requirements that apply to telephone companies in Australia and guarantee a level of service to Australians that the Labor Party—if they ever aspired to it—could not have done any better.
The member for Lyons spoke of STD phone costs as being two halves of a local call with a length of wire in between. If it were that simple—and it really is that simple—in the eyes of the Labor Party, why in the time they were in office did the costs of STD calls keep going up and up and up? Why was the trend always up when it came to STD phone calls? Why couldn't the Labor Party, with all its immense influence over the activities of Telecom, or whatever it was in the later years of Labor's administration, focus on getting those prices to start going down to help the people in the bush? 
The member for Lyons is an advocate for people in the bush. Why couldn't he get those prices to come down? Why couldn't his people do it? They absolutely could not. He knows in his guts that he cannot count on the Labor Party to do the sorts of things he really wants to see done in relation to Telstra. They have no guts—that is true—and he cannot count on them doing the things he would really like to see done in relation to bush communities. For heaven's sake; it was a bit of a weak effort criticising rural transaction centres. The member for Lyons would know that is the first thing that is going to go if Labor ever gets in again. There is no hope for getting rural transaction centres off the ground under—what will it be?—the `Beazley administration'—the measly Beazley administration. I am sure they couldn't fund something as important as rural transaction centres. That was the contribution from the member for Lyons. 
Ahead of him we had speaking, and working himself into a lather on behalf of rural communities, an ex-lawyer from Perth, someone who got his masters or something like that in London, a person who would have to be about as far out of touch with the bush as you could possibly get. This is the spokesman they bring forward to raise a matter of public importance in relation to bush services and their confected concerns about Telstra. 
I was reading this MPI because I am here to speak on it—'the threat to communication services', blah, blah, blah. Instead of that, I noticed when I was listening to the member for Perth—that inflated lawyer over there—that his contribution was more directed at the National Party.  
Opposition members interjecting—
—You are criticising me for talking about what the previous speakers have said. In fact, when we started off this debate, supposedly talking about Telstra, what did we wind up talking about?—the National Party. A better form of words than what has gone on today would have been `the threat to Labor's self-indulgence posed by the continued rural support for the coalition government'.
What we are seeing is a whole lot of manufactured concern, a whole lot of blah over there, when in reality the coalition government is doing a hell of a lot of good for rural areas by improving access to telephone services and reducing their cost. That is where I would like to start. What has happened to the cost of telephone services since the coalition got into office? What has happened to the cost of STD calls? What has happened to the cost of local calls? Where are they going? They are going down. Yet we get this confected concern over there that there is some problem in relation to Telstra and these issues. We have heard Ziggy Switkowski say that the level of Telstra services in the bush is not good enough, and the government agrees with him. The government says their services are not good enough. But what was the service they were providing before?—even less. That was the Labor result—even less. 
I would like to speak for a short while about the customer service guarantee because this is something people get under the coalition government that they never got under the hypocrites over there. They have under the coalition a consumer service guarantee, a guarantee which applies to the standard telephone service and sets out time frames within which new services must be connected, faults rectified and appointments made and kept. Was there any guarantee about those things under Labor? No. I remember years ago when Telstra was Telecom and I was trying to get a phone hooked up in Townsville. I have never encountered such an arrogant organisation in my life—people with a monopoly. They basically gave us two to the valley and said: `Your phone will get on if you are lucky, some day, some century. We will ring you up and tell you when your phone is going to be on', something like that. That is the sort of thing they were doing. 
Another element of the customer service guarantee is that in areas with existing telecommunications infrastructure a new phone service has to be installed within five days for urban communities, 10 days for major rural communities, 40 days for minor rural communities and 40 days for remote communities. I think we have actually reduced that figure out there. Were there any of those day limitations under Labor? Was there any guarantee of service under Labor? What was the guarantee you got under Labor? `Get stuffed' was the guarantee of service you got under Labor.
Do we want to go back to the type of Telecom we saw under Labor, the type of Telecom they now say that they are harking back to?
A quorum having been called and the bells being rung—
—On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am asking whether I can be granted an extension of time to continue this important matter of importance.
 (Mr Andrews)— I am afraid the standing orders do not allow that. (Quorum formed)
—It is a crook situation when you cannot get a customer guarantee out of the Labor Party. Some of those people over there are trying to say that what we should do is nationalise Telstra. It is a ridiculous proposition. Is that the alternative that they want to present? If it is not that, then what is it? What is your policy if it is not nationalisation? (Time expired)

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2000-03-16,"—I move:
That the amendments be agreed to.
This bill continues the reform process initiated by the government in response to the recommendations of the Wallis report. During debate in the Senate, the government introduced an amendment extending the period originally contained in the Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993 for foreign authorised deposit taking institutions to obtain a banking authority and effect the transfer from subsidiary to branch structure without incurring the associated tax liability. The government is happy that both the opposition and the Democrats supported this amendment. Further amendments to this bill were moved by the opposition and supported by the Democrats during the course of debate in the Senate. The first of these amendments related to the Reserve Bank of Australia's power to exempt a company registered under the Financial Corporations Act 1974 from providing statistical information.
The opposition's amendment makes any instrument granting, revoking or varying such an exemption a disallowable instrument, requiring it to be tabled in parliament. While the government would prefer not to amend the bill in this respect, we do not oppose the amendment. The remainder of the amendments moved by the opposition relate to the provision of financial assistance to superannuation funds that suffer loss due to fraud or theft. In particular, the opposition objected to the government proposal in the bill that a causal link be established between the source of the fraud or theft which results in the loss and the nature of the investment as a superannuation investment. The government sought to make it clear that only losses arising due to fraud or theft by a person directly or indirectly responsible for the administration of the fund would be eligible for financial assistance. This was designed, as I said, to provide a causal link between the loss and the nature of superannuation, which is an investment administered on behalf of fund managers by third parties such as trustees, custodians and investment managers. Adding this clarification would have imposed a measure of discipline on those involved in the administration of superannuation and reinforced to them the need to exercise prudence and diligence in making investment decisions.
The opposition's remaining amendment requires the tabling in both houses of parliament of the minister's request to APRA for advice, which the minister is required to seek before making a determination on whether to grant financial assistance. It is difficult to see what would be gained by such tabling. The government has some valid concerns that the publicity that might be generated by such tabling, even though it occurs after the minister's determination is made, could nevertheless prove unhelpful to the fund in question or to related funds. While the government considers that the opposition's amendments are generally misconceived and unnecessary, they do not detract from the integrity of the bill. The bill contains a number of important measures that further the process of financial sector reform—reform which continues to deliver benefits to consumers of financial services and to the community as a whole. The government is concerned to ensure that financial sector reform is not unduly delayed or frustrated and, in light of this, has decided to accept the opposition's amendments rather than delay the passage of this bill. I therefore commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM (AMENDMENTS AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL (NO. 2) 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,17,1
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2000-03-16,"—The opposition welcomes the decision by the government to accept the amendments which were agreed to in the Senate. The Financial Sector Reform (Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill (No. 2) 1999 represents the third stage in the series of the Wallis reforms, which Labor has broadly supported. However, we did move amendments to this bill in the Senate—the same amendments I moved to the bill when it was in the House—which excised from the bill an attempt by the government to water down the provisions which protect the superannuation entitlements of employees. 
Let me come in turn to each of the amendments before us. Amendment 1 is simply a procedural amendment. Amendment 2 was moved by Labor and accepted by the Senate to improve transparency. Labor did not oppose the proposed provisions giving the Reserve Bank the power to exempt a corporation from complying with an information provision standard that it makes under the Financial Corporations Act 1974, but we do believe that these provisions should be subject to the scrutiny of parliament. We moved an amendment to make them a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. Government amendments 3 to 9 were moved in the Senate and not opposed by the opposition. Essentially, the amendments give foreign banks and other approved deposit-taking institutions until 30 June 2001 to obtain a banking authority. This is important if they are to be eligible for concessional tax treatment when transferring their assets and liabilities. The original bill gave the banks until 30 June 2000 to obtain a banking authority. That was an extension of the original five years that the Labor government gave foreign banks, which expired on 22 December 1998. It did emerge during the debate that KPMG, acting on behalf of the foreign banks, have approached the government seeking a further extension of the deadline—which is still some three months away—to give them more time to consider the review of business taxation outcomes before deciding whether or not to convert to branch status.
For a group to be able to so easily approach the government to have a legislative deadline extended for a second time is of great concern to the opposition. We have the GST approaching; it is set to come in on 1 July this year. That is a deadline that hundreds of thousands, indeed millions, of Australians are fearful of. You would have to ask the government: are they going to extend the GST start date so that Australians can have more time to consider the review of business tax outcomes? 
On amendments 9 to 12, Labor objects to provisions which attempt to water down the restoration of superannuation benefits in the event of theft or fraud. That is exactly what the government sought to do with this bill. It is not just the opposition claiming that the government's bill was cutting employee entitlements—indeed, the government's own explanatory memorandum said so. Item 5 of schedule 9 states:
This amendment clarifies and limits the object of the financial assistance provisions in part 23 of the SI(S) Act. 
Financial assistance is available to superannuation funds under part 23 of the SI(S) Act where a fund has suffered a loss as a result of theft or fraud. The fund can apply to the Treasurer to have its lost moneys restituted via a levy of other superannuation funds in the industry. This bill, according to the government's own explanatory memorandum, limits the opportunity for funds to apply for financial assistance. We are used to the government cutting employee entitlements; however, after taking an absolute bath in the media for the way in which it handled the National Textiles case and other cases where companies have gone bust and workers have lost their entitlements, including superannuation entitlements, why on earth would the government persist with even more attempts to water down employee entitlements? Labor opposed this part of the bill and we received Senate support for our amendments. We believe that the provisions as they currently stand will provide the Treasurer with the flexibility he needs to make determinations for restitution but allow the Treasurer to fully restore employee entitlements if the need arises, which it has yet to do.
Labor moved amendment No. 13, which the Senate agreed to. It is designed to provide more transparency to the decisions of the Treasurer. In a statement in response to the Wallis inquiry, the Treasurer indicated that he was accepting the Wallis recommendation that restitution to fund members should be limited to 80 per cent. That means that, for every $100 a fund member loses as a result of theft or fraud, the Treasurer would give them back only $80. In our view that is very unfair. While the government has not yet legislated to explicitly give effect to this measure, there could be an attempt to do it through the back door by the provision that requires the Treasurer to seek the advice of APRA prior to making a determination of financial restitution. Labor has successfully moved an amendment to simply require the Treasurer, after the fact, to table the request he makes of APRA before the parliament. (Extension of time granted) So, given that background, the arguments advanced by the government in the Senate about the consequences of this amendment are without substance. 
While I am on my feet concerning these issues, I would raise two related matters. These amendments go, again, to that issue of employee entitlements, and in particular the loss of superannuation moneys. I regret to say that this evening administrators are at a meeting in my own electorate of Wills involving a company called the Fabric Dye Works. There is the prospect that that company will be put into liquidation and that not only will 60 workers lose their jobs but also that accrued employee entitlements, including superannuation—I understand in some cases up to and exceeding two years—are now at risk. Clearly, I will be calling on the government to provide to those employees who are at risk of losing their entitlements the same kind of package that was provided to the workers at National Textiles. I can assure anyone who is interested that employment and other issues of social disadvantage run just as strongly in Coburg as they do in other locations where this sort of situation has befallen workers. I would urge the government, if it is indeed the case that this company goes into liquidation, to act in a way that protects the employees' accrued entitlements. I once again urge the government to consider the issue of quarterly superannuation payments, which would prevent liabilities building up in the way that they have in the Fabric Dye Works case and in a number of other cases.
Another issue that I wanted to mention as well is that, when we were discussing this legislation in the House previously, it came in concert with a number of bills that relate to the supervisory levies for the supervision of the superannuation industry. The setting of those levies has been a matter of considerable concern to the players in the superannuation industry. The funds themselves—the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, the Investment and Financial Services Association and individual funds such as the construction and building industry superannuation fund—all expressed concern about the extent of the levies and the impact of the levies on them, pointing out that, if the Wallis reforms were going to be effective, presumably it would mean that the levies could be lowered, because every dollar that is taken out by way of levies on the funds is one dollar less for the retirement incomes of workers. So, that is a legitimate concern on their part, and I have raised it in the House before.
At the time this legislation went through, the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation had announced a review of current levy arrangements. The opposition accepted this in good faith and did not move any amendments at the time concerning that legislation, although we did put on the record our concern about the way in which the determination of levies issue was being handled. If I recall correctly, that review was scheduled to finish in about October or November of last year. To date, we have heard no word of it, so there has been considerable dissatisfaction within the superannuation industry about the way in which levies were handled in 1998 and again in 1999. There has been inadequate consultation with industry, and there is quite a suspicion on the part of those involved in superannuation that the levy structure was designed to advantage banks, to increase the profits of banks and to improve their bottom line, at the expense of those involved in the superannuation industry. So the fact that we have not yet seen anything coming back from this review of levy arrangements, gives rise to the suspicion that we could again see in the year 2000, as we have seen in the past two years, poor consultation on the part of the government concerning the setting of those regulatory levies. I did want to make that point while I was on my feet. As I have indicated, Labor will support the amendments that are now before the House. Many of them are propositions that we moved ourselves when this bill was here before.

"Gallus, Christine, MP",LP,2000-03-16,"—I move:
That the amendments be agreed to.
The Adelaide Airport Curfew Bill 1999 puts into legislation an administrative curfew which has existed at Adelaide Airport to ensure that the residents of my electorate of Hindmarsh are not subjected to large noisy planes coming in during the night period. In the Senate, the government moved amendments related to the delegation of authority in clauses 21 and 22, which relate to the appointment of authorised person and allow the secretary to the department to appoint an APS employee from the department or an employee of Airservices Australia to be an authorised person for the purposes of this act. This amendment addresses the concerns raised by the Senate committee with regard to the scrutiny of bills.
The other amendment was moved in the Senate by Senator O'Brien for the Labor Party and was accepted by the government. It is a result of a meeting of the Adelaide Consultative Committee, where they agreed to change the curfew hours during the Olympic Games to allow for the airlines to maintain their schedules into Adelaide. I personally was opposed to this. I was unable to attend the meeting but did not inform the consultative committee that I was opposed. It was regrettable that my state Labor colleagues did not turn up and also oppose it, because I suspect it is not actually the wish of the residents to have the curfew changed during this period. However, that was the decision of the consultative committee and that amendment has been moved and agreed to.
At this stage I am aware that the shadow minister will address his remarks to the amendments but, before he gets in any negative remarks, can I say to the shadow minister that I appreciate the assistance that he has given in getting this bill through the parliament. Unlike the previous people who took over the shadow ministry he has been much more agreeable to helping this bill through the parliament, although I do appreciate that, had he not, there would have been a chance for me as the member to criticise the Labor Party for frustrating it. Even with that, I do express my appreciation to the shadow minister. I commend the amendments to the House.",REPS,<title>ADELAIDE AIRPORT CURFEW BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,18,1
"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,2000-03-16,"—I am pleased to indicate on behalf of the Labor opposition that we support the Adelaide Airport Curfew Bill 1998, including the amendments before the House this afternoon. I suppose in recent times the member for Hindmarsh and I have been on a unity ticket not only on the Adelaide Airport Curfew Bill but also on the question of mandatory sentencing. At least on this side of the House I have general support for our common view. 
The Labor Party negotiated amendments with the member for Hindmarsh to significantly improve the bill for residents. There was a real danger that the bill and the amendments put up by the member for Hindmarsh would have created an opportunity for open slather avoidance of the curfew—the very curfew that the bill is to enshrine in legislation. The Labor opposition has supported a legislated curfew for Adelaide Airport for a long time. The residents of Adelaide, and Hindmarsh in particular, have been waiting a long time for effective action on this matter from their federal member and, more importantly, from the government, despite the prodding of the federal member. See how kind I am to you today, the member for Hindmarsh!
Relief from aircraft noise to enable residents a decent night's sleep is the least our parliament can guarantee to a community. Enshrining this relief in law is a protective act by this parliament to ensure that residents get a right to relief from aircraft noise. The member for Hindmarsh promised this bill before the 1993 election and finally introduced it into the House in 1998. It lapsed and was reintroduced last year. It has taken a very long time—too long, in fact—for this to be delivered for Hindmarsh residents. The community of Hindmarsh also shares that view, according to a survey conducted by local Labor Party candidate and resident of Hindmarsh, Mr Steve Georganas.
The Labor opposition also has very strong evidence from the local community that they are not happy with just a curfew. The residents also want insulation for noise affected residents and public buildings. They want insulation of buildings and homes on the same terms that the residents of Sydney enjoy. For seven years, the member for Hindmarsh and, more particularly, the government have prevaricated with respect to these issues. The member for Hindmarsh stood in the House on 28 June 1999 and said:
... insulation is an issue for Adelaide airport residents and deserves more than grandstanding. 
She then unfortunately voted against Labor amendments that would have fixed that issue for residents—I suppose again instructed by the party room, as has been the order of the day this week on other issues. The member also promised the House to:
... work with the community and approach the minister on the community's behalf for appropriate action, including insulation for these homes ...
My colleague Senator O'Brien said in the other chamber that these matters should be pursued, and he pursued them in the last estimates hearings. He tried to ascertain whether the member for Hindmarsh had yet approached the minister about insulation for Adelaide residents. Senator McDonald said:
I am sorry, but we are not in a position to tell you what the government is considering across a range of policy issues at the moment.
Clearly the minister was dodging the issue. I remind the government and the member for Hindmarsh that it is not just the ALP that wants this question answered; the residents of Hindmarsh need to know what the government is doing on this outstanding issue that concerns them as residents. I took it from the answers that the government is not considering a proposal for noise insulation for residents around Adelaide Airport. From that, the residents of Hindmarsh can only deduce that their federal member has either not approached the minister or has been knocked back. 
On 25 January 2000 the Minister for Transport and Regional Services announced insulation for a further 630 homes around Sydney airport. The master plan for Adelaide Airport shows that, by the year 2020, there will be 4,203 residents affected by noise above the 20 ANEF level. It is time for the member for Hindmarsh to deliver a solution to properly address the noise issue for constituents in the same way that Sydney residents have been treated. As we said during the last election, and we say it again, Labor will do something about noise insulation around the Adelaide Airport. Until we win government at the next election, I challenge the member for Hindmarsh to join with the ALP candidate, Mr Georganas, to push to deliver on the issue of noise abatement. The Labor Party support this legislation for a curfew at Adelaide Airport. Each time this bill has come before the House, that has been our position. I am pleased that the member for Hindmarsh and I could actually make some advances for local residents of Adelaide. I hope she joins with me in seeking to overcome the noise problem by getting the government to agree to some noise insulation.

"Gallus, Christine, MP",LP,2000-03-16,"—I was not about to speak again on the Adelaide Airport Curfew Bill 1998, but I feel I do need to address some of the remarks of the member for Batman. For one thing, he gets his facts wrong. Although I do not mind the politicising, it is really disturbing when the opposition cannot get its facts right. Firstly, the member for Batman said that I had promised this bill prior to the 1993 election. Let me tell the member for Batman that, prior to 1993, I was actually the member for Hawker and was not all that aware of the problems in Hindmarsh. It was not until I became a member after 1993 and found out about Labor's 92 years of neglect of this electorate that I realised something had to be done. For the information of the member for Batman, it was just prior to the 1996 election that I first mooted that we would need to get the curfew put into the legislation. I am glad that I did finally achieve that. I point out that this is far more than the ALP achieved for the seat in the 92 years that they held it.
On the matter of insulation, I assure the member for Batman that I fully support the residents in their fight for insulation. I have indeed talked to the minister and his advisers on the subject of insulation, and I am confident that, if I continue to work at the rate I have been, I shall probably achieve insulation for the residents, as I have achieved a curfew bill in legislation.",REPS,<title>ADELAIDE AIRPORT CURFEW BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,18,1

That the amendments be agreed to.
The Customs Legislation Amendment (Criminal Sanctions and Other Measures) Bill 1999, as passed by the Senate, requires procedures to be prescribed for Customs' opening and examination of international postal articles. The government considers that this provides a suitable regime for Customs officers to examine articles if they reasonably believe that the articles contain prohibited drugs or other chemical compounds. The government has, however, noted views expressed during debate in the House of Representatives that the opening of mail intrudes on a person's privacy. The government would like to reassure the Senate, the House of Representatives and the Australian community that they need have no concerns about unnecessary intrusion into people's privacy when Customs goes about its business of protecting the Australian border. 
In order to reinforce the security of the postal environment and to reduce the risk of potential corruption, the government has moved an amendment to the bill as presented to the Senate that will achieve three purposes. Australia Post would remain the sole authority to examine personal correspondence under 25 grams. Customs would have the power to open larger, international postal articles weighing 25 grams or more. A Customs officer who reasonably believed that a postal article contained drugs or other chemical compounds would have to pass the article to another Customs officer who performs duties at a higher classification. This more senior officer would verify the decision and the article would then be opened by this officer with a third Customs officer as a witness.
Customs risk assessed 160 million postal articles imported through Australia Post last year. The low level of complaints about postal examinations shows that Customs treats its responsibilities very carefully. Drugs were found in 6,000 cases. There is a fine balance to be struck between the need to deter people from importing substances that are dangerous to our community and the obligation to protect the privacy of law-abiding citizens. The government considers that it has achieved a suitable balance through the compromises it has offered in relation to Customs opening international postal articles.",REPS,<title>CUSTOMS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CRIMINAL SANCTIONS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,19,1
"Kerr, Duncan, MP",ALP,2000-03-16,"—I am delighted that the government has come forward with the amendments which it places before the House now. I am very grateful that the government has expressed its concern about its responsiveness to the issues raised by the opposition in relation to the House of Representatives debate. My impression was, during the debate in the House, that both the parliamentary secretary and the Attorney-General, who spoke in relation to these matters, were displaying a mite of intransigence in relation to the opposition's very principled objection to the fact that a single undersupervised Customs officer would be entitled under the government's proposals to open the mail coming into this country of any citizen, in a way which we thought raised very significant civil liberties concerns. 
Fortunately, the Democrats happened to also share those concerns. I find it a remarkable coincidence that the government's enthusiastic reconsideration of the priority to be accorded to civil liberties coincided with a phone call from the Democrats saying that they would be supporting Labor's position in relation to this legislation. I thank my friends the Democrats in the Senate for having played some small part in the minister's getting of wisdom. Nonetheless, the wisdom has been got, and the government has put forward these amendments. They do not reflect precisely the safeguards that Labor proposed to include in the legislation, but they do the task and they do it well. It will mean that ordinary postal items—that is, items that weigh less than 25 grams, and that is the ordinary course of post that comes in—will not be able to be opened by Customs. If they suspect that an article contains some illicit substance, they have to take it to an Australia Post official who will open it for them, and that will occur in a way which means that there is always a second party present and the process is supervised. 
Because of the government's concerns regarding the inconvenience of that process in relation to the parcel post—where we concede that there are lesser issues of civil liberties as people usually do not express substantial personal communication in parcel post and larger quantities of drugs may be involved in parcel post—we have consented to the government's proposal that Customs need not take those particular items to Australia Post for opening but can open them themselves. But we are not going to allow—and the government now agrees that it is not going to allow—a single Customs officer to open those items. If, for example, a sniffer dog or an X-ray machine detects something that is believed to be suspicious, the person who finds that item has to take it to a superior Customs officer who then opens it in the presence of a third officer to make certain that there is a check on the kinds of possible abuses that we had averted to. 
Obviously, we alone in this parliament saw the necessity for these safeguards to be inserted. I am surprised that the government brought upon itself some odium for seeking to persist with quite an unprincipled approach to this matter for so long. I did express some surprise to the Attorney-General that he found himself in a position where he was defending the indefensible. I am glad that, whether or not prompted by the fact that the Democrats were going to agree with us, a change of heart has been obtained. Whatever motivates the souls of men in this place, a good outcome is what matters. I am pleased that for once the good guys get a win and that we can be confident that both the law enforcement objectives of this legislation and the civil liberties and privacy objectives of the people of Australia are adequately properly protected. It is one for the Labor Party, one down for the government—a good outcome all round.

That the amendments be agreed to.
The amendments to the Dairy Industry Adjustment Bill 2000 provide for funding of up to $45 million for the delivery of a dairy regional assistance program. The cost of the program will be met from the levy proceeds collected through the dairy structural adjustment fund. There is also a technical amendment on a matter that has been brought to the government's attention since the bill passed through the House of Representatives. This amendment brings this bill into line with Australian criminal law policy in relation to dealing with confidential information. Deregulation of the domestic milk sector by state governments will have significant economic and social impacts on regional communities reliant on dairy farming. While the dairy structural adjustment package will provide significant benefits to producers and, as a flow-on consequence, to regions, this program is specifically targeted to assist regions. This program will assist dairy dependent communities and their members to adjust to the deregulation of the dairy industry.
The Dairy Regional Assistance Program provides assistance of up to $15 million per year for three years beginning on 1 July 2000. The program will be established as a component of the Regional Assistance Program and administered by the Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business portfolio, the responsibility of my colleague Mr Reith. Funding for the program will be provided through the levy of 11c per litre on liquid milk products. This program represents a whole of government approach consistent with the government's rural and regional Australia policies. It will enable dairy communities at risk following deregulation to become self reliant by taking a proactive approach. It is expected that a number of positive outcomes can be achieved through this program for regional communities, such as business and community initiatives to create long-term employment as well as access to retraining and counselling services through the provision of community infrastructure and services. The largest number of the amendments relate to the use of the word `Chairman' and change of that word to `Chair' in a number of places throughout the legislation. I guess those amendments demonstrate that political correctness is alive and well in the Democrats and among some other people in the other place. Whilst the government is not enthusiastic about these sorts of amendments, bearing in mind the Latin derivative of the word `Chairman', we will not be opposing those particular amendments because the legislation is of great significance. I commend the amendments to the House. ",REPS,<title>DAIRY INDUSTRY ADJUSTMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,22,1
"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,2000-03-16,"—The opposition will not be opposing these amendments to the Dairy Industry Adjustment Bill 2000. We will be expediting the passage of these amendments. I note the contribution of the Democrats to this debate and the amendment that they have moved substituting `Chair' for `Chairman'. That is a fairly substantial contribution and I thank them for it. The second one relates to certain legal provisions and we will not be opposing that one.
The third one relates to the creation of a dairy regional communities program worth $45 million—$15 million over three years. I would like to make some comments about this. We ought to look at the time clock: at the eleventh hour plus in this sitting with one of the most rigid deadlines on one of the most complex pieces of rural legislation, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry brings amendments into the House, expecting the opposition to just go along with them and pass them. I say this to you, Minister: if it were not for the fact that you are providing $45 million to the regions of Australia and that you are responding to the pressure that we put on you out in the community, we would be taking a different attitude to this sort of nonsense.
For the public record, let us record what transpired in the development of policy that brings us to the eleventh hour passage of this legislation. This package was put to the government in April 1999. I had discussions with industry before and after that, and I made the point to them that, if you are going to get public acceptance of an 11c a litre levy over a period of eight years and you are expecting the consumers of Australia to buy this, you ought to have a very hard look at the provision of assistance to regional communities that are going to be adversely affected by dairy deregulation. I give credit to the industry because they took our suggestion on board and even presented it to the government, as I understand it, in the proposals that they put in April 1999, or in discussions before the tabling of those proposals. It is a matter of public record that at that time the government rejected all the entreaties from the opposition, from good regional and rural members, from the Democrats and from the industry itself, and they rejected the proposal. Labor continued to mount the public argument, and I pay tribute to the honourable member for McMillan, the honourable member for Braddon, the honourable member for Bass, the honourable member for Lyons and Senators O'Brien and Forshaw, who kept this issue alive in the dairy debate.
When I had discussions with the industry and asked, `How's it going with the minister?' they said, `It's fallen off the back of the truck. The government won't accept what we're proposing, and we won't accept it either—we won't have the moneys come out of the moneys that are going to be raised.' Yet here we are today: the minister and the industry have accepted that these moneys are going to come out of the levies that are raised. It went to the Senate committee. An enormous amount of information was presented to the committee—on which we can presume are good government members, along with members of the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats—and it presented a recommendation, recommendation 4, that this should be included in the package that the government was putting. As we know, the government rejected that recommendation—up until now, up until today. This provision does not have any basis in research; the only research done on the impacts has been done not by the government but by the Bega community. Let me also say that not one centavo of the government's money is in this—this is dairy farmers' money and consumers' money.

"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,2000-03-16,"—I understand that time is short in this debate on the Dairy Industry Adjustment Bill 2000, but let no-one be under any illusion as to why it is we have this $45 million for those struggling dairying communities. It has nothing to do with the National Party over there, who rolled over, or with their city lawyer mates in the Liberal Party, who told them they were not going to get a cent for those regional communities. It has everything to do with the people on this side: the member for Braddon, the member for Lyons, the member for Bass and the member for Paterson—people who are prepared to come into this place and fight for the rural communities which they represent. 
Have a look in the Hansard at what Ian Causley, the member for Page, had to say about this when the debate came up. Referring to the industry, he said: `What they ask for they receive from the federal government.' That is what the industry asked for, not what those rural communities asked for. Every last member in this debate said that they wanted some money for those rural communities that depend on the industry. We stood up for the rural communities—not the National Party. They cannot even stand up to the member for Parramatta. They are a hollow shell of what they used to be, and they stand condemned. This package is here because of our work.

"O'Byrne, Michelle, MP",ALP,2000-03-16,"—It is instructive to note that only a week after the legislation pertaining to this package was in the House the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has finally announced an increase in funding for the restructure, with only a little over a hundred days to go before the whole thing comes into place. It is essential that Tasmania receive its fair share of this $45 million. Tasmanian communities will be severely impacted by deregulation, especially if industry members use their share of the package to retire debt. It is appropriate that communities which rely heavily on the industry are compensated for the reduced income that will affect the communities. The government's action in investigating the impact of deregulation on communities mirrors its approach to everything else to do with deregulation—it has waited too late to act.",REPS,<title>DAIRY INDUSTRY ADJUSTMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,22,1

I remember when I was speaking to this bill that the member for Blair kept saying, `There is nothing in this and the amendments except hot air.' Part of that hot air was $45 million, which is going to go to these communities. Minister, you are not prepared and you do not have a plan. This industry has to worry about itself, and I would like to acknowledge in the gallery today Mr Brendon Thompson of the TFGA in Tasmania, who at least set out to try to do the best thing by his community. One of the things that he talked about was getting compensation for communities. Minister, at least you have acted, but by God it is late.

The government talk about regional Australia and about being a caring government: they did no thinking whatsoever about the dairy areas of this country. They brought in a bill that had been sorted out outside government circles. They gave no consideration to the impact that this is going to have on the dairy areas of Australia. There are going to be people thrown out of work from plants. There are going to be sharefarmers thrown off the land. There will be farmers who will have to leave they land. They do not care about that. They gave no consideration to it whatsoever. We raised restructuring, and now we have some money on the ground.

"Truss, Warren, MP",NP,2000-03-16,"—In view of the time I will not respond in detail to the tirades that came opposite. I am interested in this last-minute support for the dairy industry package from Labor.
—I will not tolerate that level of interjection as the member for Braddon knows, as does the member for McMillan. I expect them to hear the minister in silence.
—Labor are now claiming they have great support for this package. They moved a great stack of amendments in this House and in the Senate to the legislation, but this was not amongst them. They are newly crowned converts to the idea of a regional communities package. I welcome their support. I think it is important that this legislation does receive the support of the House today so that the dairy industry can plan for its future with confidence. 
Can I conclude, as I did at the end of the second reading debate, by complimenting the dairy industry on the way in which they have worked constructively through a very, very difficult period. It will not be easy for the dairy industry in  the years and the months ahead. There are going to be significant changes in their incomes. They can be assured of the government's concern about these issues. The addition of this package will help in that regard. I call also on the state governments, who are actually the ones deregulating their dairy industries, to recognise their responsibilities to their dairy communities and to ensure that they are cared for appropriately as they go through the difficult restructuring phase.

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2000-03-16,"—In question time today the Prime Minister produced a letter which, of course, if the Archives Act and other conventions of the government applied these days as they used to in the past, would never have been before the parliament or anyone else. We note these things and we will deal with that element at a later time. But in the course of question time he had part of a correspondence between the Attorney-General of Western Australia of the time, back in 1990, and the then Attorney-General of the Commonwealth. I, of course, have no recollection of any of the events of that period, although he suggested I should have. I have, however, consulted those who do. I am authorised, on behalf of the Attorney-General of the time, Mr Duffy, to make this statement with regard to what the Prime Minister had to say on that letter on mandatory sentencing and on the Convention on the Rights of the Child. He says this:
I understand that the Prime Minister in Parliament today referred to a letter from the Western Australian Attorney-General to me dated 28 September 1990.
The facts are these. The Australian Government signed the Convention on the 22 August 1990. As noted above, Mr Berinson's letter was dated 28 September 1990. I told Mr Berinson in response to his letter that he was too late and that in any case I would not agree.
I am advised that when The Convention was ratified on 17 December 1990, it contained one reservation relating to Article 37(c) of the Convention which is concerned with the question of separate imprisonment of juveniles and adults. 
In short the understanding set out in Mr Berinson's letter in regard to the Commonwealth's use of the external affairs power was not accepted. 
I reject totally the assertion from the Prime Minister that there was a special deal for Western Australia.
Somebody else who also has a recollection apparently of at least the correspondence of the time is one Amanda Davies, the Acting Assistant Secretary of the Human Rights Branch of the Attorney-General's Department Civil Justice Division, who was invited to answer a question from one Mr Gregory on 2 March this year. The question was: were there any consultations with, or objections by, states and territories to the age of majority in the CROC while it was being drafted or before Australia became a party? That, of course, is not related to the mandatory sentencing part, but the relevant part of the answer to that particular question is as follows:
In consultations during the drafting process there were discussions about the implications of proposed articles of the Convention, including the age of majority. The Convention was ratified—
That is, the whole convention—
without objection from the states and territories.
So the fig leaf which the Prime Minister sought to draw in front of him to excuse himself from not acting in regard to the states, though of course it is no excuse in regard to not acting on behalf of the Northern Territory, now falls away. There was no secret agreement, or anything resembling a secret agreement, with the government of Western Australia that meant that somehow or other there was an exemption being given to either the Commonwealth or the states, or they were taking on themselves an exemption, in regard to the full operation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. I remind the House that that convention goes to things like ensuring that in all imprisonment or punishment arrangements associated with any juvenile offences there should be a capacity for them to be reviewed by a higher judicial authority. Of course, where a mandatory sentence has been applied there is no capacity to review it by a higher judicial authority. Elsewhere in that convention it also states that imprisonment as regards children should be regarded as a matter of last resort—not first resort as it is in the case of the Northern Territory legislation.  
So we have here a situation where the Prime Minister has no defence in past practice on this and he now has an opportunity to act, as he was prepared to act as an individual in relation to euthanasia, and collectively on behalf of his party in relation to homosexuality in Tasmania. If it was good enough, and it was right to do so, to protect the human rights of homosexuals in Tasmania, it is right to protect the position of children in this country now. Now that the Prime Minister can settle his mind about the status of that correspondence, he can change his mind.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child</title>,Adjournment,26,1
"Cox, David, MP",ALP,2000-03-16,"—There are many inconsistencies in the government's GST package and not all of them result from Mr Howard's deal with the Democrats. As we draw closer to 1 July, the number of inconsistencies is growing. The inconsistency I raise today is entirely of the government's own making and demonstrates its indifference to the fact that by its deliberate action it will increase the number of young Australians who will at some stage in their life experience skin cancer. The inconsistency is in the government's decision to continue the tax-free treatment of sunscreen but impose GST on sun protective clothing. This is of particular concern to me for two reasons.
My electorate has 30 kilometres of Adelaide's finest beaches, including Aldinga, Christies Beach, Hallett Cove, Maslin Beach, Moana, O'Sullivan Beach, Port Noarlunga, Port Willunga, Seaford, Seaford Rise, Southport, Silversands and Sellicks. My constituents are, therefore, frequent beach goers and users of sun protective clothing. A significant Australian producer of sun protective clothing, Solarsuit, is based in my electorate. Solarsuit's sunsuits are made from Chloresist, a fabric developed to resist 98 per cent of UVA and UVB rays for at least one year's exposure to the sun and chlorine. The company began 10 years ago and has grown to supply hundreds of thousands of sunsuits throughout the world. Its products are endorsed by the Anti-Cancer Foundation of Australia and available in each of its 26 shops Australia-wide.
Australia has the highest rate of skin cancer in the world. The Anti-Cancer Foundation predicts that at least half of Australia's population will be affected by skin cancer. Fortunately, skin cancer is preventable. Education campaigns by anti-cancer groups have succeeded in changing the community's attitudes to sun protection. That any government would act to discourage the use of preventative measures is astounding.
My family visited the beach frequently this summer and my kids, like most kids at the beach, swam and played in their sunsuits. I have been advised by Solarsuit that 70 per cent of children between two and 12 wear sun protective swimwear. The reason for the popularity of sunsuits is that they offer greater protection than even the strongest sunscreen. Given the impact of skin cancer on the lives of so many Australians and the fact that skin cancer treatment costs about $300 million per year, sun protective clothing should be GST exempt, just like sunscreen. As vital and tax free as sunscreen is, it is not cheap. A large bottle of UPF 30+ sunscreen retails for about $15 to $20, whereas a child's neck to knee sunsuit costs only about $40 and lasts for a couple of years unless they are growing by a foot a year. Sun protective clothing makes financial sense for families on low incomes.
I raised this anomaly with the Treasurer in a letter dated 28 September 1999. It has been 5½ months but the Treasurer is yet to respond. The letter makes it clear that the anomaly is of particular concern to Solarsuit, which is an employer of 27 workers in my electorate. That the Treasurer has not had the courtesy to respond in almost six months demonstrates the height of absolute arrogance and the fact that the Liberal Party is not the party of small business.

"Mr Stephen Smith, MP",ALP,2000-03-16,"—The opposition supports the passage of the Telecommunications (Numbering Charges) Amendment Bill 1999. The bill proposes changes to the Telecommunications (Numbering Charges) Act 1997. That act dictates the method by which sets of telephone numbers are allocated to carriage service providers—known as carriers—and how they are charged for that service. The numbers are allocated and administered by the Australian Communications Authority, the ACA, which in turn charges carriers for this service. Numbers are held by both primary and secondary carriers. Secondary carriers are resellers of carriage services and obtain their numbers directly from the primary carrier whose services are being resold. 
The act currently determines that, despite the numbers having been originally allocated to the primary carrier, the secondary carrier is still responsible for numbering charges on services that have been transferred to it from the primary carrier. The bill seeks to clarify aspects of that process and simplify the collection of numbering charges. The bill also provides a limited flexibility for the ACA in determining the date on which numbering charges will be imposed. That flexibility is provided to allow the ACA to determine a date in order to address exceptional circumstances which might arise. This is a simple bill which improves the administration of telecommunications and the relationship between carriers in our nation. It is a simple measure but one which will enhance the effectiveness of our telecommunications operations. On that basis, it is supported by the opposition.",REPS,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (NUMBERING CHARGES) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1
"Neville, Paul, MP",NP,2000-03-16,"—The telecommunications industry is rapidly advancing in new technology, services and efficiency. The deregulation of the telecommunications industry in 1997 has seen Australia move from one all-purpose carrier, Telstra, to 30-plus carriers, 100 service providers and more than 800 Internet providers. This is of significant benefit to users, though the introduction of new and improved services and lower prices have also played their part. It has also seen the proliferation of new telephone numbers and call centres assisting customers through the minutiae of the Australian telecommunications system.
The Telecommunications (Numbering Charges) Amendment Bill 1999 amends the Telecommunications (Numbering Charges) Act 1997, which essentially taxes carriage services provided on a certain range of telephone numbers. In 1998-99 about $60 million in revenue was collected from numbering charges. The charges apply to certain numbers—for example, the 13, 1300 and 1800 numbers and some mobile services. I would like to make it very clear, lest there be any misunderstanding in the community, that these charges do not apply to the standard eight digit numbers that people use in their homes and businesses.
The carriage service provider may hold a number as a result of being allocated the number by the Australian Communications Authority or through the transfer of a number as a result of a commercial resale arrangement. The number of transfers from primary providers, those who have been allocated numbers, to secondary providers—in other words, the resellers—makes the collection of the annual charge administratively complex. In 1997-98 the ACA had to deal with 102 carriage service providers, 83 of whom were secondary suppliers paying only six per cent of the total revenue, with most invoices being less than $120.
The bill provides two minor amendments to enhance the act's operation and simplify the administration for service providers. Firstly, the act will be amended to explicitly define what are transfers of numbers for the purposes of the act. As a result, certain types of number movements would not result in the liability for charges being transferred. The liability remains with the primary service provider, which may collect the charges from the secondary providers. The ACA has advised that all the companies that transferred numbers in 1998-99—namely, Telstra, Optus, Vodafone and AAPT—support the proposal because it will simplify administration. The overall effect will be to reduce the number of invoices issued by the Australian Communications Authority.
Secondly, the act will be amended to move the date on which the charges are imposed from 22 May to a date in April, as determined by the ACA. This will give the ACA some flexibility in setting the date and give it at least three additional weeks to undertake its tasks. Providers will also have six to 10 weeks notice of the charge date and will have a minimum of 30 days in which to pay their invoices. The amendments today reflect the government's aim to ensure that the administration of number charging arrangements is done in an efficient, effective and timely manner. It is heartening that a bill like this needs to be introduced. Significant numbers of telecommunications providers have entered the marketplace and this has necessitated the bill. 
Deregulation has benefited consumers because other carriers have created an increased focus on the efficiency, timeliness and competitiveness of which I spoke. During our time in government, untimed local calls have come down as low as 15c, STD charges have dropped by as much as 45 per cent and international charges have fallen by as much as 80 per cent. Telstra's monopoly-like grip on the $5 billion local call market is being challenged. Optus is charging 20c with cheap line rentals and, in recent months, we have seen AAPT, RSL Communications and Primus undercutting Telstra's untimed local call charges with offers between 15c and 17½c. Telstra has responded to this competition by reducing its standard call rate from 25c to 22c, and a 15c call within a local exchange area has been offered. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Chairman, Alan Fels, says that he thinks there will be further reductions in the near future. `This is not the end of local telephone call competition but the beginning,' Mr Fels said. And most welcome it will be for my constituents in regional and rural Australia.
In addition to the local call market, we have also witnessed significant price competition in the mobile market, with cheaper pricing packages on offer from a range of existing and new entrants. I think it is now time to introduce a tender system for the universal service obligation. For those who are not adept in this field, this is a legal obligation that states that every Australian, wherever they live or work, should have reasonable access to a standard telephone line service. Currently, Telstra is the USO provider and therefore has to provide these services—namely, standard telephones, pay phones and digital data service. The USO works in practice by forcing all telecommunications carriers to contribute—based on their eligible revenue—to the cost of providing services to rural and remote areas. The government also provides a substantial subsidy, as honourable members will be aware.
The National Party is absolutely committed to the best possible services for regional and rural Australia. We are determined to maintain the momentum that has occurred since the visit here by the Telstra executives last Thursday of focusing on service standards in the bush and, even beyond that, on a timely, efficient and cost- Honourable members will also be aware that the National Party has a very strong view on the 49.9 per cent private ownership of Telstra. It does not wish that percentage to go beyond that until a certain set of conditions apply. Those conditions include a rigorous and searching inquiry into Telstra's performance, which is a very important aspect. With respect to Telstra 2, the social bonus arose out of a resolution of a National Party central council meeting in Bundaberg two years ago this month. I might add that I was the mover of that motion. That mandated what the National Party saw as seven major areas that needed to be looked at in providing basic broadcast and telecommunications services to regional Australia. That was brought to Canberra by Senator Boswell and negotiated with the Prime Minister and Senator Alston. They came to a very amicable arrangement which was welcomed by National and Liberal country members alike—and, I am sure, by country Labor members, such as they are.
—How many?
—Few and far between. It provided $762 million worth of additional services to regional and rural Australia. It has since become known as the Bundaberg resolution. What I am about to say might, to some of my colleagues, seem to be heresy. There are some matters in addition to mandating that Telstra provide connections, reconnections, service and maintenance to all Australians, but particularly to those in isolated areas where telecommunications are part of their lifeblood. In these areas you cannot run up the street and pick up the payphone, and many areas do not have access to mobile telephony, so the phone line is a very important thing. I am not minimising the importance of that for one moment, but I think we have to look beyond that to the new horizon. The new horizon is a range of satellite-provided services, the like of which we have not seen anywhere in Australia, much less in the bush. It is an opportunity, for the first time since the introduction of very basic telecommunications—the old wind-up phones and the party lines—for regional and rural Australia to get on the front foot and have a service which is equal to, if not better than, that which exists in the capital cities. This week a number of companies have visited the parliament. Optus have been here. 
—It is good to hear one of my Labor colleagues supporting this very important change in direction. Another company, the Farmwide and Heartland consortium, which have also been active in the parliament this week, have offered two models. One model, for example, offers 1.2 metre dishes, a number of phone lines, access to Austar or Optus pay television, free-to-air television and, in the next few years, interactivity with digital television. They would undertake to keep those calls at the same price as the USO price—22c or less. They would also undertake not to charge connection fees in excess of what Telstra is currently providing. They could provide data at 64 kilobytes. That is one offer. The Optus offer is that it would take over the USO. I have one problem with that: even if that were the case, there would still be a requirement for Telstra to maintain basic services to some areas. Whether there would have to be two levels of USO would need to be looked at by the government.
Going to the Farmwide and Heartland proposals, theirs is that they would require a one-off payment from government of about $240 million and that they would put all Australia under a satellite umbrella, so to speak. They could provide up to four phone lines to each home, access to free-to-air television and pay television, access to high-speed data, and they are willing to match, or more than match, the current charges that Telstra is charging in the bush. For example, their maximum local call charge is 20c; their STD call connection is 15c; their maximum STD call per minute is 20c; their Internet connection cost is zero; and they use a more innovative form of Internet usage charge based on $5 for the first 25 megabytes and then 20c per megabyte thereafter. It is interesting stuff. I am not speaking today to favour any of those, but I would like them to start coming into the consciousness of members from both sides of the House.
What we have to be careful of—and I am passionate about this—is that in focusing on copper cable and on the minutiae of the ownership of Telstra we may lose a great opportunity. Hand in hand with that, the DCRS technology of Telstra is not the greatest technology in the world. It has served us well, it is microwave technology, and for the people in remote areas it has been providing a very good service. I do not speak for the government; I speak just as a private member on this issue, but what we have to ask ourselves is whether we are going to allow regional and rural Australia to lock itself into that technology which will require a fairly high USO to back it, or are we going to look more innovatively into putting the whole of Australia, or certainly the whole of remote Australia, under a satellite umbrella? Within two years this technology will be at our doorstep, so to speak. 
Just to illustrate the point on how costs are coming down—although this is not germane to my current argument—just two years ago in this place I saw a demonstration by Iridium. They showed us the first satellite phone. It looked about the size of a stubby; it even looked like a stubby with the phone recessed into this rather bulky looking round thing that was mainly batteries and aerials. Within 15 months we saw one that was not much bigger than the mobile phones we are using today. The price had come down from $5,000 for the stubby style thing to $2,000. The cost of usage had come down from over $2 a minute to $1.40 a minute. And now we have seen one, smaller still, at $1,200, with a commensurate drop in the usage charge. If that can happen with mobile telephony, which of itself is a more expensive medium than the normal household phone, imagine what satellite technology can do to connecting those in the bush.  
I am not saying that Telstra's repairs, service, maintenance and connection are not important; in fact, I think they are very important. In fact, I would go so far as to say they are so important that we should even boost the service guarantee levels to make it less attractive for them to be indolent about it. I am not saying that the 49.9 per cent is not an important point for a lot of rural Australians, especially at national and at some rural levels. It is very important because it is the great dividing line that says that up to this point the government still has notional control and therefore we want to see Telstra perform. The National Party has said that we will not go beyond that point unless there is a rigorous and searching inquiry into Telstra and that that T2 social bonus is delivered. 
Beyond that—and I reiterate my original premise—it is vital that we do not just fixate on copper cable, that we do not fixate on the old microwave technology and have a huge USO around it to the exclusion of all others, and that we do not fixate on the minutiae of the ownership of Telstra. We must lift our sights over that horizon, and to get over that horizon we are going to need a satellite up there. 
We talked today at the start of this debate about the numbering charges, but they are just one small symbol of efficiency the government is giving to the telecommunications industry. I urge the government and I urge members of goodwill in all three major parties in this House of Representatives to lift their vision and let us make sure that the whole of Australia gets on the front foot; but, more particularly, that for those people in regional and rural Australia who have been told that they have to be efficient, that they have to get on the Internet, that they have to be able to interact with their agents and so forth overseas, they do not try to do this through antiquated technology but through the most modern technology.",REPS,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (NUMBERING CHARGES) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2000-03-16,"—I would like to start my speech on the Telecommunications (Numbering Charges) Amendment Bill 1999 by supporting a lot of what the member for Hinkler has just said. These services are very important to Australia. But, of course, you know our position in the ALP: we do not want to see any further privatisation of Telstra. I understand the position of the National Party. As someone who was born and bred in a rural part of NSW, in a little country town called Dunedoo, I know how important telecommunications services are. To that extent, I just hope that the government does deliver those services to the bush, to areas like Dunedoo and to where the member for Hinkler comes from in Queensland, because it is terribly important for those people. In my speech I will go into some detail about the provisions. I know the points that the member for Hinkler was making here this morning for the benefit of his constituency, but I want to balance that by putting on record the ALP's complete opposition to any further privatisation of Telstra. 
The amendment bill before the parliament this morning was introduced into the House on 9 December last year. Principally, it proposes changes to the Telecommunications (Numbering Charges) Act 1997. That act stipulates the method by which sets of telephone numbers are allocated to the carriage service providers and the methods for charging for the service. The purpose of the bill is to change the method for the collection of the annual numbering charge by the Australian Communications Authority. The ACA is responsible for administering and allocating the numbers and then charging the carriers for this service. 
The Telecommunciations (Numbering Charges) Act 1997, the principal act, imposes charges on the carriage service providers for the numbers they are allocated under part 22 of the Telecommunications Act 1997. The principal act also imposes an annual charge on providers for the numbers they hold after 1 July 1997. This bill is concerned with the collection of the annual charge. In 1999, carrier liability for the charge was assessed to be approximately $60 million. A carriage service provider may hold a number as a result of being allocated the number by the ACA or through a transfer of the number by way of a commercial resale arrangement. The numbers of transfers from primary providers—those who have been allocated numbers by the ACA—to secondary providers, the resellers, makes the collection of the annual charge administratively complex. The explanatory memorandum reports that in 1997-98 the ACA had to deal with 102 carriage service providers, of whom 83 were secondary suppliers who paid only six per cent of the total revenue, with most invoices being for less than $120. In some cases resellers are not aware of their liability or they dispute liability, resulting in increased collection costs.
This bill inserts a more restrictive definition of the circumstances in which number charge liability may be transferred, with the intention of reducing the complexity of collecting the charge for the ACA. Numbers are held by both `primary' and `secondary' carriers. Secondary carriers are `resellers' of carriage services and obtain their numbers directly from the primary carrier whose services are being resold. The act currently determines that, despite the numbers having been originally allocated to the primary carrier, the secondary carrier is still responsible for numbering charges on services that have been transferred to it from the primary carrier. The bill seeks to clarify aspects of that process and simplify the collection of numbering charges. The bill, if enacted, would make a number of changes to the act, and for the benefit of the parliament I will go into some detail on the various sections which are subject to the amendments.
The bill will alter the definition of the word `transferred' in section 5 of the Telecommunications (Numbering Charges) Act 1997, which sets out the definitions of key terms used in the act. The word `transferred' is currently defined, in relation to a number, to mean transferred between carriage service providers in accordance with the ACA's `Telecommunications numbering plan 1997'.
Proposed subsection 5A(1) of the bill provides that a number is transferred when it is ported from one carriage service provider who holds the number to another carriage service provider. The new definition is also designed to include, but not be limited to, rules for portability established in accordance with section 455(5)(d) of the Telecommunications Act 1997. For the purposes of this act, a carriage service provider who holds the number refers to a carriage service provider who, at the time of the port, holds both the number to be ported and the numbering charge liability of the number to be ported.
Proposed subsection 5A(2) also provides that a number will also be taken to be transferred if there is a binding written agreement to that effect between the two carriage service providers that jointly provide the ACA with written notification of the agreement. The transfer will come into effect either on the day the ACA receives notification of the agreement or on a later day specified in the written notification. Proposed subsection 5A(3) provides that, if a number is ported while subject to a written agreement providing for its transfer at a particular time, the porting takes precedence. The number will be taken to have been transferred from the time at which it was ported, rather than the time specified in the written agreement. Proposed section 5A will permit a carriage service provider to move a number to another carriage service provider without necessarily moving the numbering charge liability attached to that number. 
Item 3 inserts additional words at the end of section 17(1)(b)(iii) of the act which will mean that only transfers of numbers from carriage service providers that hold the numbers for the purposes of the number charge count as transfers for the purposes of the act. This ensures that, should a number be ported or moved in some other fashion from a carriage service provider that did not hold the numbering charge liability, the number movement shall have no impact on the numbering charge liability.
Item 4 repeals section 18 of the act and replaces it with a new section 18, which provides for the determination of the date upon which numbering charges are imposed. Proposed new section 18 of the act does three things: it provides for the ACA to determine the date on which numbering charges will be imposed, this date being a day in April and the ACA's determination of this date occurring before 16 February each financial year; it states that, if a carriage service provider holds an allocated number at the beginning of the day determined under section 18(2), a numbering charge will be imposed on the number; and it requires the ACA to publish its determination of the numbering charges date in the Gazette prior to the determined date.
The new section will also provide limited flexibility to the ACA in determining the date on which numbering charges will be imposed. The flexibility is provided to allow the ACA to determine a date in order to address exceptional circumstances which might arise from a Y2K type problem. The opposition is very happy to support this amendment bill because it improves the relationships between the carriers and it certainly improves the efficiency of the numbering charges and the administration. We supportthe bill and commend it to the House.",REPS,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (NUMBERING CHARGES) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1
"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,2000-03-16,"—I am delighted to rise to speak on the Telecommunications (Numbering Charges) Amendment Bill 1999. It is yet another one of the many sensible measures that this government has undertaken over the past four years in the vital new business area of telecommunications. Firstly, I turn to the member for Lowe's contribution and state that he has shown to the House a far greater understanding of the matter before us than the poor old member for Perth, who sort of blew in and blew out in a matter of 90 seconds, such was his interest in the matter. I congratulate the member for Lowe for proving his credentials in this area.
I suggest also that the member for Hinkler should be roundly congratulated by all members of the House for his very commanding understanding of this area, and I think his speech today was, in fact, one of the landmark addresses. I believe that he has, given the urgency of the current debate, shown that he is prepared to nail very high on the mast his colours on this matter and he should be congratulated.
The bill before us is all about trying to sort out matters in this incredibly emerging telecommunications environment, where we have dozens of providers of telecommunication carrier services and 800 or more people or organisations who are providing Internet services. The 1300, the 13, the 1800 and the mobile service numbers are all intersecting and crossing all those various service providers. This bill before us attempts to try to sort out some of the complications of this multifaceted telecommunications industry in a sound and practical way, so that the Australian Communications Authority will have a far more streamlined process than would have been the case had this matter not been dealt with. The bill understandably has the support of both sides of the House.
This morning's Australian newspaper sets out, if you like, some of the environment in which we are currently operating in its story headed `Airwave sale nets bonanza', pointing out that this new business has provided an extra $1.3 billion to government revenue. That front page story underlines the sort of industry that we now have operating in this country, where we have a Hong Kong based company like Hutchison willing to spend more than $670 million, and One.Tel has `splurged'—in the Australian's words—$523 million to buy up licences in five major markets, Adelaide, Brisbane, Perth, Melbourne and Sydney, with Telstra and Vodafone also buying licences—paying a big something for what really seems like nothing—for access to the spectrum. That is, according to the Australian this morning, the biggest price ever paid anywhere in the world for spectrum. That in itself is a very big tick from this market in a worldwide sense for this government and its policies and the growth that we are experiencing in telecommunications in this country. This spectrum, while it may be especially used for mobile phones, is also going to be part of the new generation of telecommunications, for which this government is constantly revising legislation to ensure that more people have access to it at an affordable price. So it is not just about mobile phones. 
Of course when you contrast that to the previous government's stewardship in this area over 13 years, the one big hallmark failure of the Australian Labor Party would be their very narrow-minded decision to sign away analog telephone usage in this nation as part of a deal to get a little extra competition into the country. As a consequence, we have had tens of thousands of Australians tossing their analog telephones in the bin. The Telstra CDMA rollout has caused a number of problems in a few people's minds, but every bit of that pain can be simply put back straight onto the Australian Labor Party, because Telstra contractually were unable to run the analog system any more and CDMA, as an emerging technology, was something that had to be introduced.
At the heart of all of this, though, is not just the telephone; it is not just simply being able to call someone. At the heart is everything to do with the computer industry and the IT&T industry. Information technology and telecommunications are tied hand in glove. The words of Lachlan Murdoch come to mind. In a conversation I had with him some years ago he said that the two big issues as far as he, as someone involved in the number one media company around the world, is concerned are content and access to means of distribution. That means broadcast distribution and access to the telephony systems. In fact the two major technologies that exist in this world by his estimation—and I suspect there is a lot to be said for his estimation—are the television and the mobile phone, because everything else plugs into them. So what we have before us today is yet another matter of trying to sort out some of the issues involved in that access and that distribution of content. 
We are dealing with new technology day in, day out. Again, I reward the member for Hinkler with my appreciation for his contribution today. He is quite right that telecommunications in this country are no longer just about copper wire. For many years Telstra, that 800-pound gorilla of telecommunications kicked sand in the face of anybody who dared to try to get access to its copper wire. Its big boast was that it had a copper wire pair going into every home and business in Australia. But of course we are now seeing, through this government's deliberate encouragement of competition in telecommunications, that the supplanting of copper wire is the means of technology used. Consumers are now benefiting from the types of services they are now getting and from the cost of the services they can now use. One.Tel charges 17½c for an untimed local call, and Telstra has responded by lowering the local call cost. This is all due to the fact that technology is supplanting the plain old copper wire. Of course out in rural and regional Australia, where there is a lot of angst and, quite frankly, a lot of hyperbole about the way Telstra should be the only means of trying to provide telecommunications, there is understandably a copper wire system that in too many cases strings from tree to tree, or from dead tree to dead tree. 
Just like the member for Hinkler, I am also rather excited about a couple of the contributions and suggestions that we have seen from some of the innovative companies in our nation. The Farmwide and Heartland Communications offer of taking on the availability of access to telecommunications in remote rural and regional Australia for a one-off $240 million charge paid for from the social bonus from the partial sale of Telstra and using satellite to provide the range of services that we in the city are awfully used to, is something that is definitely worth looking at. That particular proposal would see the end of the universal service obligation, and of course that in itself would provide a greater sense of efficiency in this entire sector. 
Likewise, the Cable and Wireless Optus submission, which is again using greatly underutilised satellite infrastructure that is floating around thousands of miles off the surface of the earth and is not used to the capacity that it could be, is also worth looking at. Cable and Wireless Optus have put a submission to the government saying, `We'll take over the USO. We'll take over where Telstra are currently demanding that they have complete control, and we can provide untimed local calls to customers in rural and remote areas who currently only receive pastoral rate calls.' Forty thousand customers in regional and remote areas would get access to an array of broadband, pay TV, free-to-air and telephony services all through one dish, and they will provide the dish. These are the sorts of innovative ideas this nation needs to not just simply play catch-up in rural and remote Australia but to put rural and remote Australia clearly on the map as the best region in the world as far as telecommunications are concerned.
So 40,000 customers in rural and remote Australia—and probably a lot more people—are currently, understandably, feeling quite left behind. But as a direct result of this government's determination to provide them with Internet access at a fast rate, anything up to 64 kilobytes, all those sorts of things are being promised and offered from technology that exists at an affordable price now. Frankly, I find the confirmation by the member for Lowe of Labor's opposition to selling off any more of Telstra quite passe at best. I believe that, because the Australian Labor Party members are against the continuation of the government's privatisation of Telstra, they are therefore against the continuation of the government's liberation of the resources that we can use to provide the bush with the services they should have. Therefore, Labor want to hold the bush back. It is a very simple analogy.
What is the government doing each time we have sold off a bit of Telstra? We repay debt. We liberate the budget from the burden of debt repayment, which means we can refocus our efforts in other ways. Also, we are putting deliberate amounts of money into improving the services that those who do not have good services would expect. At the same time, this government is continuing to legislate, just as it is doing in this bill before us today, that everybody plays by the same rules, that all telecommunications carriers—and there are over 30 of them, and 100 service providers and 800 ISPs—are playing by the same rules and regulations. 
Also, it is a very pathetic argument that unless it is badged `Telstra' it cannot be communications. It is a convenient argument for this 800-pound gorilla of the telecommunications industry as they attempt to try to cement market in the Australian industry. It is a very convenient argument because, if they get it in the lexicon and in the mind-set of everyone in Australia that `unless you see a Telstra badge on it then it is not worth having', we may jeopardise some of the great advantages we are currently seeing. We are getting lower call costs. We are getting a greater range of services. We are getting new technology being used to try to improve the services for people who desperately need that improvement in services, not because Telstra is doing it but because innovation through competition is doing it.  
I welcome all attempts by this government to bring Telstra to book. They currently have a range of fines which in a lot of cases do not work because Telstra, as large as they are, say, `We're better off copping the fine than doing the work.' So weeks and months go by before certain tasks are undertaken. But I know this government is setting in place the rules and the regulations that demand results and that Telstra is continuing to be put under great pressure. The great competitive advantage that Telstra has—the size of its network and its standing in the community—means that nothing any of us could say about Telstra would ever devalue its price as far as a saleable commodity is concerned. But I also understand that Telstra is running at something like 10 to 15 per cent behind world's best practice as far as efficiency is concerned. 
Back in the days when opposition leader Beazley was the minister responsible for telecommunications in this country, back in the days when he signed analog phone users away into the oblivion they have just suffered, we saw a drop of 17,500 workers from the old Telecom work force. A lot of those who went were hangovers from the old PMG days. Again we are seeing Telstra rightly saying, `If we are running 10 to 15 per cent behind world's best practice, we are going to have to look at using technology to create the greater efficiency that we need.' But what is particularly interesting is that when the 17,500 were axed by Beazley all those years ago there were something like 24,000 new jobs created in the entire industry. If you run that analogy today, given that technology is growing at an exponential rate, proportionately there will be an even greater number of jobs created as a result of any changes Telstra may bring to the size of its work force.
We have an industry that is growing. We have an industry for which the world, according to today's paper, is giving us a big tick in this country. It is willing to invest $1.3 billion just to buy spectrum for tomorrow's use, not just for what we are doing today. We have an industry that is hiring more people. We have an industry that is growing new businesses all around this nation. We have an industry that is offering people in rural and remote areas greater possibilities as far as access to world's best telecommunications practices are concerned. We do not just need Telstra to keep doing those things that they were doing. 
I must say that Telstra is a fine old Australian institution. Telstra is something which is worth getting value for. Unlike those opposite, when they floated for sale things like the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas, Commonwealth Serum Laboratories—and we heard a question in the House yesterday in regard to the partial sale of Telstra being factored in to this year's budget, to prove my point further—we do not need to sell off things like Telstra to meet today's expenditure. We do not need to sell off the family car to pay for the groceries, as those opposite did over their 13 years in government. When we sell off worthwhile community infrastructure and assets like Telstra, we repay public debt—debt clocked up by those opposite. We naturally want the best price, and we will get the best price, because nothing can really devalue Telstra as it is such a dominant player in such a major and growing industry. 
Like the government, and like the Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation, who is at the table, I am concerned that people get results, that the service quality that people expect is guaranteed. That is why I have always been pleased to contribute to debates in this place and to endorse the government's efforts to ensure that it does not matter who owns the phone company as long as the phone service is the right service, that people are getting what they expect. The key point of my contribution today is that you do not need a Telstra badge on technology, you do not need a Telstra badge on the things that you expect to have in your home in order to get the best service. In fact, as long as there are the same rules for all, and as long as each of these many telecommunications service providers now working in Australia understands that they have to conform to the government's expectations or they will be severely fined or dealt with in other ways, then I think we are going to get a good result for consumers.  
It is important that telecommunications consumers come first. It is important that the people of Australia have a great sense of satisfaction that they are able to access the sorts of facilities that they want. But it is very important also that, when you sell off important assets such as Telstra, people feel very well satisfied that the results of that particular sale are turned into the right areas as far as this nation is concerned. 
This is an industry that is growing at an exponential rate. It is an industry that is difficult to legislate for because day in, day out technology is keeping ahead of all of us as legislators. It is an industry that does not need an opposition running an `opposition for opposition's sake' approach and using hoary old union chestnuts of keeping public ownership and public ownership is the only way to go. It is an industry that demands that the public ownership factor be taken off, that this shackle be taken off it. It is an industry that wants this government to continue its proactive and demanding role in this area which puts the consumers first and gets the best result for the industry, especially keeping an eye on those who do not have the sorts of services that they would like to have, all because Telstra has been holding them back.
This is a very important debate because it strikes me that those opposite—and there are the odd one or two on the government side as well—are helping Telstra's cause in this `Telstra badge is best' analogy. What is happening as a direct result is that those who claim that they want good results for their constituents by trying to protect Telstra are in fact providing extra featherbedding for an organisation that needs the big shake-up, that needs the big hurry-up that new technology and new players are currently providing. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (NUMBERING CHARGES) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1
"Gibbons, Steve, MP",ALP,2000-03-16,"—I notice that four of the five speakers listed on the speakers list for this debate are members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and the Arts.
—And coherent contributors, too.
—Yes, it is a very hardworking committee, and I enjoy working with them enormously. I would also like to thank the member for Moreton for his courageous speech. Whenever I hear government spokespersons singing the praises of Telstra's privatisation, I cannot help thinking that they are very courageous people because, when you come from Bendigo or any other part of regional Australia, to talk about privatisation of Telstra means that you will probably lose your seat immediately, instantly. The member for Moreton was painting this wonderful picture of the communications industry, and indeed a lot of what he said is right. It is a very exciting industry that moves very quickly, but there are major problems in regional Australia, as I am sure the minister at the table—the Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation, who represents the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts—would be aware of and would have heard of quite often.
One of the major problems in my electorate of Bendigo was caused by the decision by Telstra to opt out of the paging service. This is causing major concern, especially for the Victorian State Emergency Service. For example, I received representations from people who are as far away as Rochester—which is not in my electorate—who have been trialing a new service in place of the Telstra service, and it does not work nearly as well. For example, they trialed the Orange service or the link service. The pagers were tested on 25 and 27 February. Tests were carried out at different locations, covering an area from Bendigo to Echuca. Of course, the main area of interest for these people was the Rochester area. As the results of the test revealed, five key locations within the Rochester township were not able to receive the signal. Specifically, the Rochester State Emergency Service's unit controller was not able to receive the service at all. That is quite dangerous for emergency services. That service is going to be phased out by, I think, the end of June. This is an example of Telstra pulling much needed services out of regional Australia and that, in my view, could be quite dangerous. 
One of the other areas of concern to me is that Telstra made much fanfare about its new charging rates—25c phone calls down to 22c. Telstra made a big announcement about that. On the surface it appears to be quite good, but it is actually a double-edged sword because the line rental will increase from $11.65 up to $13.85 as a result of that reduction. An increase of $2.20 erodes gains in the reduction of the local call rate. For example, 50 calls at 25c each equals $12.50; 50 calls at 22c each equals $11. You have a saving of $1.50, but you add the extra $2.20, which gives a net loss of 70c. So Telstra is clearly trying to get people to use the phone more often by offering them a cheaper call rate, but with a bit of a spike to make sure that people use the telephone even more.
One of the other areas of concern to me is that there are quite a lot of areas in my electorate which still do not have a local call rate for Internet access. Indeed, Senator Lundy, the shadow minister, met with some people at Newbridge last year. Newbridge is about 25 to 30 kilometres from Bendigo. Bendigo is a major regional centre, with a population of 60,000 to 80,000, and yet 30 kilometres away there is no local call access to the Internet.
It is great to see government spokespersons giving these courageous speeches about the privatisation of Telstra. I have to admire their courage because, if you talk about the privatisation of Telstra in Bendigo or in other parts of regional Australia, people just shake their heads. In Bendigo we have seen the loss of between 250 and 300 jobs as the government prepares Telstra for the full sale. That is about $12 million a year which has been taken out of that region's economy. It is very hard to replace those jobs, although it has been done with AAPT, and I have already spoken about that in the House before. I commend the government members for their courage. I am sure that, come the next federal election, Telstra will be a big issue and we will all be behind a Beazley-Labor government to ensure that Telstra remains connected to regional Australia's future.",REPS,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (NUMBERING CHARGES) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1
"McGauran, Peter, MP",NP,2000-03-16,"—in reply—I wish to thank all members who contributed to this debate on the Telecommunications (Numbering Charges) Amendment Bill 1999. The members for Hinkler and Moreton are invariably committed to participating in these debates. It does not matter if it is in the House or the Main Committee, they will participate and put their point of view. It is always innovative and, at times, courageous, as the member for Bendigo mentioned, but it is always thoughtful. Both of them again took a very pragmatic approach to the issues of telecommunications. They are not ideologically hamstrung, as is the member for Bendigo, who thinks that maintaining Telstra in public ownership is the solution to the array of problems he raised. He totally confuses the ownership of Telstra with the range of service and the efficiency of its delivery and, consequently, that you can separate the two. You need a regulatory legislative framework for Telstra to provide the types of services and you need funding to provide Internet access, the local call rate for Internet access and the like. That is what we have done under Networking the Nation, which I am afraid the member for Bendigo and his party have opposed completely.
But of all the points—political, unfortunately, though they were—that the member for Bendigo made, he did raise a genuine concern that rural people have about Telstra closing down their radio paging service on 30 June. Some communities and emergency services have expressed concern about the loss of the paging service. I have sought advice from Telstra and they have advised that they will close their radio paging service in view of significant reductions in the size of the paging market as well as developments in mobile phone technology and associated messaging services which they believe have largely overtaken the paging market. They argue that new products and services now on offer through mobile phones provide better services and more features. Of course, the full service and the full provision of services of the network will continue to 30 June.  
Telstra further advised me that existing paging customers who want to switch to a Telstra Mobile Net service will receive free connection and two months free access to the memo messaging service. Telstra is negotiating with Link Communications to transfer customers in most parts of the country who wish to retain traditional paging services. The government, I assure the member for Bendigo, are very aware of community concern and we are in close contact with Telstra to monitor developments and make sure efforts are undertaken to ensure community concerns are met.
I again thank members who have contributed to the debate on the Telecommunications (Numbering Charges) Amendment Bill 1999, which makes minor administrative changes to improve the efficiency with which the Australian Communications Authority collects annual number charges.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2000-03-16,"—I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to this report on the review of the Reserve Bank of Australia annual report 1998-99. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration is a committee which I have the privilege to have served on in this parliament and also in the previous parliament. I would like to begin by expressing my gratitude particularly to the staff of the committee, in particular the secretary, Bev Forbes, and Tas Luttrell, who made a major contribution to putting the report together. 
The report highlights the fact that, whilst our differences within this place are often stressed in the media, some of the best work in the parliament is done through its committees. The deliberations of committees such as the one chaired so well by the member for Wannon and the outcomes we have from reports such as this make a valuable contribution to the parliament's analysis of directions for the Australian economy.
Discussion of this report gives an opportunity to put a viewpoint as to the current economic direction in Australia. I want to make a contribution on one particular aspect of economic policy and, indeed, economic development that is occurring: globalisation. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration is currently undertaking an inquiry into international financial markets and the impact that globalisation is having, particularly on the ability of domestic governments to make policy decisions which will impact on the people in nation states. 
One of the concerns that I have about globalisation is the growing evidence of an expansion of income inequality occurring in advanced countries such as Australia and the United States—and, indeed, on a global scale, if you compare rich countries and poorer countries. To discuss wealth distribution in Australia in 2000 is perhaps to risk being branded old-fashioned. Paddy McGuinness has asked, `Why are the chattering classes so obsessed with the inequality of incomes?' The answer to that is that it matters to many more than the chattering classes. It is not just a case of growth and economic expansion; it is a matter of what happens to that growth in terms of whether the benefits of economic growth are shared fairly.
Certainly, disparities in wealth distribution matter to workers such as those at National Textiles and Braybrook, who have struggled for their meagre entitlements at the same time as the failed chief executive of AMP can get a $13 million payout as reward for failing in his job. Income disparity certainly matters to rural and regional workers who are dismayed by the Treasurer's call for them to be paid even lower wages. It certainly matters also to those lower and middle income Australians who will pay a GST on the essentials of life while tax avoidance by the wealthy remains a growth industry.
According to the last Business Review Weekly Rich 200 survey, in three years the total wealth of the rich 200 has jumped $21 billion, or nearly 60 per cent. The share of wealth for the top 10 per cent of people has risen from 43.5 per cent in 1983 to 48.6 per cent at the end of 1998. The 10 richest Australians were 15 times better off than they were in 1983. At the other end of the scale, a significant portion of Australians are wondering where the economic growth is. The Bureau of Statistics has estimated that the bottom half of Australians own just five per cent of the national wealth. One example is the alleged revolution in share ownership. Largely, that is a result of the privatisation—by governments of both persuasions, it must be said—of publicly owned assets.
Privatisation of national institutions such as the Commonwealth Bank is something that I opposed and continue to oppose. Privatisation of Telstra, just up to 49 per cent of it, we have seen—as the member for Bendigo eloquently pointed out in this speech earlier today—has resulted and is continuing to result in a loss of services. But, as a result of that and as a result also of superannuation investment in shares, we have seen a growth in share ownership. But when you actually compare the reality with the rhetoric of the government, you get a very different picture. When the 1985 decision to introduce imputation credits for fully franked dividends occurred, Treasury estimated a cost of $250 million in the first year and $500 million thereafter. Those figures have proven to be absurdly low. In 1997-98, the figure was $3.8 billion for individuals, with an additional $1.77 billion for the trusts, such as those which most of the frontbench members of the government have.
The regional dimension of inequality is evidenced by comparing suburbs in Sydney. Bellevue Hill's 5,625 residents shared more than $28 million in imputation credits, representing shares worth $1.43 billion, an average of $713,433. Compare that with Mount Druitt in Sydney's western suburbs: in Mount Druitt there were 24,577 taxpayers of whom only 831 owned shares. The total amount of shares owned was $26,640 and they received an average imputation credit of just $666. Class is alive and well in Australia in the year 2000.
The tax office has estimated that 100 wealthy individuals continue to avoid about $800 million in tax. In recent years, one of Australia's five billionaires claimed a taxable income of $12,524—a weekly income of $241, this gentleman would have us believe, at a time when ordinary Australians are doing the right thing and paying their tax through the PAYE system. You have this sort of obscenity continuing to occur. And it might not be fashionable in this place to raise Kerry Packer and his case, but it is an outrage that Australia's richest individual is not prepared to make the appropriate financial contribution to society. 
The passive resentment I feel turns to anger when battlers struggling to pay their mortgage view traders cheering as interest rate increases are announced. The paper profit for these traders, like the growth in speculative derivatives, has an almost surreal element to it from the perspective of so many Australians, for whom an interest rate increase dramatically impacts on their supermarket purchases. Concentration of the benefits of growth is not just confined to income. At a time when there is growing generational unemployment in some suburbs and regions of about 25 per cent, the average working week has grown to more than 43 hours. While weekend papers highlight the happy sellers of inner Sydney properties achieving six figures above reserve prices, homelessness is growing rapidly. More than 100,000 Australians have a very different perspective of the trickle-down effect when they are sleeping in parks and struggling to gain shelter each night.
It is not just groups or individuals traditionally associated with the left of politics who are concerned about this. In his The Crisis of Global Capitalism, billionaire international speculator George Soros criticised the system he has profited on by saying:
Lasting relationships have been replaced by individual transactions. A transactional society undermines social values and loosens moral constraints. Social values express a concern for others. But a transactional economy is anything but a community.
Globalisation does offer enormous potential opportunities, but the challenge for governments is to ensure that the benefits are not concentrated with the few. In my view, there is nothing inherently wrong with the growth in the number of millionaires, but it is very hard to be proud of this when, at the same time, there are increasing numbers of Australians living in poverty.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Economics, Finance and Public Administration Committee</title>",Committees,30,1
"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2000-03-16,"—I always enjoy listening to the member for Grayndler, but I have to admit that today I was not quite sure what inquiry he was talking about. The hearings that I attended on 29 November and also in February dealt with the issues of the Reserve Bank report and the globalisation of international markets, and these issues are the subject of a current inquiry the House Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration is undertaking. To my knowledge, I was not aware that that inquiry had come to a conclusion or that a report had been presented. So it was quite interesting to listen to the member for Grayndler speaking about globalisation and not touching on aspects of monetary policy, financial systems stability, current account deficit, bank fees and credit charges. He did speak in depth about Kerry Packer, however, but I do not think taxation was one of the issues looked at in the Reserve Bank report. I was quite bemused to hear him speaking about globalisation and all of these other issues. At first I thought that maybe I was in the wrong place or had been put down to speak on the wrong report.
I am happy to speak today on the Reserve Bank report and to add to some of the sentiments expressed earlier by the member for Grayndler. The report was tabled in the main chamber on Monday by the chairman of the committee, Mr David Hawker. On that day, the deputy chair and member for Isaacs, Greg Wilton, and the member for Burke spoke about the review of the Reserve Bank's annual report 1998-99 interim report. 
Firstly, though, I would like to congratulate the chairman for the professional, inclusive and bipartisan way in which he has managed the review. A number of speakers have commented on his fine work. The work of the committee secretariat can never be underestimated. We were supported by a really top-class team of Bev Forbes and Tas Luttrell. It was wonderful to have such dedicated people to assist with this inquiry.
The report was followed yesterday by some very good news that the Australian economy continues to grow strongly with growth of one per cent in the December quarter and 4.3 per cent throughout the year. We should be proud that the government has maintained a very low inflation rate and that inflationary pressures will continue to remain low. The December quarter figures—and I have a press release here that was issued by the Treasurer yesterday—have to be commended, because they show yet again that the government has a commitment to sustained and strong economic growth in a low inflation environment. The Australian economy has reflected this strong growth in private consumption over recent quarters, reflecting the growth and household income and wealth. This means that there will be continuing levels of consumer confidence. 
Business investment did drop slightly, though, and it is felt that this was a consequence of a number of things, including the introduction of tax reform and immediate resources being directed to implementation issues. But business investment will continue to grow and respond well in the year 2000-01, generally reflecting what is a growing world economy. The removal of business imposts in Australia will also occur and increase business investments. It is also important to note that net exports will continue to grow and rises in export volumes are already offsetting increases in imports.
There has been a improvement in economic conditions worldwide, and the current account deficit has also improved, as predicted in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. So in this environment where inflationary pressure remains at the minimum level there is some indication that the household consumption deflator fell by 0.1 per cent in the December quarter and increased by 0.9 per cent throughout the year. Wage pressures have been well controlled and the Australian economy has to be congratulated for weathering that turbulent Asian crisis.
It is in the current context that I speak about the hearings with Reserve Bank Governor Macfarlane in Sydney in November last year and in February this year. It was good to see in its bi-annual report that the Reserve Bank offers opportunities for greater understanding behind the decisions made on monetary policy. In terms of growth, everything that was mentioned earlier by me was also highlighted at those hearings—that Australia continues to exceed growth rates of beyond four per cent and that inflation is low. The review of the Reserve Bank is based on the bank's semi-annual statements on the conduct of monetary policy and its annual reports. The bank is anticipating that this growth rate of four per cent will continue throughout 1999-2000. The government is well on target, and in fact is probably exceeding its target, and needs to be congratulated.
The Governor also predicted the continuing growth of domestic demand ignited by strong household consumption. This was due to growing incomes, sustained high levels of confidence, low borrowing costs, wealth gains over a large range of assets, recovery in the household sector, and the prospect of increasing investment and spending over the next 12 months. Australia's growth prospects continue to strengthen and astound the world. We are now experiencing something like nine consecutive years of economic expansion. A CPI rate of inflation of 2.75 per cent is anticipated, with an underlying rate of inflation of approximately 2.25 per cent. 
The good news continues to grow. At the moment, employment figures show that the unemployment rate has dropped to 6.7 per cent, with 653,800 new jobs created. Much of this review of good news comes not only from Australian sources. For example, recently the International Monetary Fund's analysis of the Australian economy suggested that the economy has the potential to grow in the next four to six years at a rate of 3.2 per cent to 4.3 per cent. If the IMF's predicted growth rate is achieved it will further reduce current levels of unemployment. Unemployment is definitely going to go down a lot lower than it is, and that is great news. 
The IMF also said of Australia that productivity growth of the Australian economy has increased to rates not seen since the golden age of 1960, and that the unemployment figure for 1999 was at its lowest since June 1990. What that equates to in domestic terms is that full-time employment rose by 34,000 jobs and part-time employment was up by 25,100 jobs. That is fantastic. Teenage full-time employment has shown great improvement as well. It has gone up by 13,000 over the last 12 months. And there has been a three per cent seasonally adjusted employment growth over the last year. So, all in all, employment has risen in each of the last 33 months in trend terms. That is fantastic news.
The Reserve Bank has confirmed this trend by reporting that employment growth has strengthened to an annual rate of 3.5 per cent in the December quarter, its strongest performance in four years. In the February Reserve Bank Bulletin it was noted that unemployment was just under seven per cent. As I said earlier, that was predicted in that quarter. It has gone even lower and is at its lowest level in a decade.
I would like to turn briefly to a few other areas, one being the current account. The bank produced a current account figure of six per cent of GDP. This level was reached in the June quarter and should remain so for the current financial year. In summary, the Governor said that the bank is expecting that the current financial year will be a good one for the economy.
With respect to interest rates, the Governor was asked about the reasoning behind the current increase in basic interest rates from 4.75 per cent to 5.5 per cent. The reason given was that Australia has an independent policy. International factors such as the change in world economic outlook and the effects of the Asian crisis had produced a weak performance in the world economy in 1998. But the world economy generally recovered strongly in 1999-2000 and is expected to be stronger. He also noted that, as a result of stronger world growth, interest rates had been pushed up in most industrial countries. Australia's tightening of rates was accompanied by similar occurrences in the USA, the UK and the European Central Bank, in Canada and in New Zealand.
Household debt continues to increase. It is of some concern and will be monitored very closely. Another area touched on was bank fees and charges. The Reserve Bank Governor was questioned in depth about bank fees and charges. He drew a number of conclusions. He said that there had not been a systematic increase in fees charged and that in some cases larger loan fees seemed to have fallen. He mentioned that accounting service fees had fallen a little and the number of free fee transactions had increased. That has certainly been the case with a number of the banks, which have increased competition by offering, for example, 50 free transactions. There are a number of other examples of free transactions. 
Fees for transactions have increased for high-cost transactions. For example, cheques are still the most expensive method of doing business. They represent older technology, whereas the ATMs are being used more frequently. Fees for own-bank ATMs have been steady and fees for newer services have fallen. Total fees increased by 15 per cent in 1998. The increase, however, is in line with the increasing transaction levels and the per unit cost. One of the matters mentioned by the Governor was that it was unlikely that the increases in fees charged to small business had offset the benefits received when interest margins fell. That was an interesting point to note. An area of concern, though, as always, is that businesses have been paying the fees for some time and smaller businesses have been catching up with the level of some of the fees that have been paid by large businesses. The area of fees is still a sensitive one for households. That area was highlighted by the Reserve Bank Governor.
All in all, banks are maintaining their profits, either by holding up their margins or by putting up their fees. He mentioned briefly that the offset in the reduction in margins has been very small—the increase in fees compared to the reduction in margins. Another area highlighted at the hearings was frequent flyer points and bonus card systems. The Reserve Bank Governor mentioned that frequent flyer points and loyalty programs were not free and that somewhere in the system somebody had to pay for those. He made the point—and I quote: 
Somewhere in the community some prices are reflecting that so that that value can be transferred across to the people who earn the bonus points. Yes, that is true. ...  Is paying by credit card the most efficient way of paying, or is it simply being done because people get their points? In some cases, there are more efficient and cheaper ways of paying for the economy as a whole.
There is some irrational behaviour occurring out there. I asked the Reserve Bank Governor about the reasoning behind an incident that I knew of, involving a woman buying a washing machine from a retail outlet where the washing machine was $100 dearer than elsewhere, so that she could obtain the frequent flyer points. He indicated to me that such behaviour was highly irrational but that it does occur. One of the benefits of these loyalty programs—as a former marketer—is the fact that all sorts of information is recorded as a result of the purchases people make. Their purchasing habits, such as the last time they purchased a stereo, et cetera, provide valuable marketing information, but the benefits to the consumer have yet to be shown. The most important thing that was highlighted was that frequent flyer and loyalty programs are not free and that somewhere in the system, in order to implement these programs and offset the increase in administrative costs, someone has to pay for them.
I conclude by saying that the current economic growth will continue. We have much to be proud of at the moment. We have low inflation. Our unemployment rate is continuing to decline. I want to emphasise a comment made by the Reserve Bank Governor when he said that he is expecting the current financial year to be another good one for the Australian economy. So we have much to look forward to.

It is also important to note that net exports will continue to grow and rises in export volumes are already offsetting increases in imports.
There has been a improvement in economic conditions worldwide, and the current account deficit has also improved, as predicted in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. So in this environment where inflationary pressure remains at the minimum level there is some indication that the household consumption deflator fell by 0.1 per cent in the December quarter and increased by 0.9 per cent throughout the year. Wage pressures have been well controlled and the Australian economy has to be congratulated for weathering that turbulent Asian crisis.
It is in the current context that I speak about the hearings with Reserve Bank Governor Macfarlane in Sydney in November last year and in February this year. It was good to see in its bi-annual report that the Reserve Bank offers opportunities for greater understanding behind the decisions made on monetary policy. In terms of growth, everything that was mentioned earlier by me was also highlighted at those hearings—that Australia continues to exceed growth rates of beyond four per cent and that inflation is low. The review of the Reserve Bank is based on the bank's semi-annual statements on the conduct of monetary policy and its annual reports. The bank is anticipating that this growth rate of four per cent will continue throughout 1999-2000. The government is well on target, and in fact is probably exceeding its target, and needs to be congratulated.
The Governor also predicted the continuing growth of domestic demand ignited by strong household consumption. This was due to growing incomes, sustained high levels of confidence, low borrowing costs, wealth gains over a large range of assets, recovery in the household sector, and the prospect of increasing investment and spending over the next 12 months. Australia's growth prospects continue to strengthen and astound the world. We are now experiencing something like nine consecutive years of economic expansion. A CPI rate of inflation of 2.75 per cent is anticipated, with an underlying rate of inflation of approximately 2.25 per cent. 
The good news continues to grow. At the moment, employment figures show that the unemployment rate has dropped to 6.7 per cent, with 653,800 new jobs created. Much of this review of good news comes not only from Australian sources. For example, recently the International Monetary Fund's analysis of the Australian economy suggested that the economy has the potential to grow in the next four to six years at a rate of 3.2 per cent to 4.3 per cent. If the IMF's predicted growth rate is achieved it will further reduce current levels of unemployment. Unemployment is definitely going to go down a lot lower than it is, and that is great news. 
The IMF also said of Australia that productivity growth of the Australian economy has increased to rates not seen since the golden age of 1960, and that the unemployment figure for 1999 was at its lowest since June 1990. What that equates to in domestic terms is that full-time employment rose by 34,000 jobs and part-time employment was up by 25,100 jobs. That is fantastic. Teenage full-time employment has shown great improvement as well. It has gone up by 13,000 over the last 12 months. And there has been a three per cent seasonally adjusted employment growth over the last year. So, all in all, employment has risen in each of the last 33 months in trend terms. That is fantastic news.
The Reserve Bank has confirmed this trend by reporting that employment growth has strengthened to an annual rate of 3.5 per cent in the December quarter, its strongest performance in four years. In the February Reserve Bank Bulletin it was noted that unemployment was just under seven per cent. As I said earlier, that was predicted in that quarter. It has gone even lower and is at its lowest level in a decade.
I would like to turn briefly to a few other areas, one being the current account. The bank produced a current account figure of six per cent of GDP. This level was reached in the June quarter and should remain so for the current financial year. In summary, the Governor said that the bank is expecting that the current financial year will be a good one for the economy.
With respect to interest rates, the Governor was asked about the reasoning behind the current increase in basic interest rates from 4.75 per cent to 5.5 per cent. The reason given was that Australia has an independent policy. International factors such as the change in world economic outlook and the effects of the Asian crisis had produced a weak performance in the world economy in 1998. But the world economy generally recovered strongly in 1999-2000 and is expected to be stronger. He also noted that, as a result of stronger world growth, interest rates had been pushed up in most industrial countries. Australia's tightening of rates was accompanied by similar occurrences in the USA, the UK and the European Central Bank, in Canada and in New Zealand.
Household debt continues to increase. It is of some concern and will be monitored very closely. Another area touched on was bank fees and charges. The Reserve Bank Governor was questioned in depth about bank fees and charges. He drew a number of conclusions. He said that there had not been a systematic increase in fees charged and that in some cases larger loan fees seemed to have fallen. He mentioned that accounting service fees had fallen a little and the number of free fee transactions had increased. That has certainly been the case with a number of the banks, which have increased competition by offering, for example, 50 free transactions. There are a number of other examples of free transactions. 
Fees for transactions have increased for high-cost transactions. For example, cheques are still the most expensive method of doing business. They represent older technology, whereas the ATMs are being used more frequently. Fees for own-bank ATMs have been steady and fees for newer services have fallen. Total fees increased by 15 per cent in 1998. The increase, however, is in line with the increasing transaction levels and the per unit cost. One of the matters mentioned by the Governor was that it was unlikely that the increases in fees charged to small business had offset the benefits received when interest margins fell. That was an interesting point to note. An area of concern, though, as always, is that businesses have been paying the fees for some time and smaller businesses have been catching up with the level of some of the fees that have been paid by large businesses. The area of fees is still a sensitive one for households. That area was highlighted by the Reserve Bank Governor.
All in all, banks are maintaining their profits, either by holding up their margins or by putting up their fees. He mentioned briefly that the offset in the reduction in margins has been very small—the increase in fees compared to the reduction in margins. Another area highlighted at the hearings was frequent flyer points and bonus card systems. The Reserve Bank Governor mentioned that frequent flyer points and loyalty programs were not free and that somewhere in the system somebody had to pay for those. He made the point—and I quote: 
Somewhere in the community some prices are reflecting that so that that value can be transferred across to the people who earn the bonus points. Yes, that is true. ...  Is paying by credit card the most efficient way of paying, or is it simply being done because people get their points? In some cases, there are more efficient and cheaper ways of paying for the economy as a whole.
There is some irrational behaviour occurring out there. I asked the Reserve Bank Governor about the reasoning behind an incident that I knew of, involving a woman buying a washing machine from a retail outlet where the washing machine was $100 dearer than elsewhere, so that she could obtain the frequent flyer points. He indicated to me that such behaviour was highly irrational but that it does occur. One of the benefits of these loyalty programs—as a former marketer—is the fact that all sorts of information is recorded as a result of the purchases people make. Their purchasing habits, such as the last time they purchased a stereo, et cetera, provide valuable marketing information, but the benefits to the consumer have yet to be shown. The most important thing that was highlighted was that frequent flyer and loyalty programs are not free and that somewhere in the system, in order to implement these programs and offset the increase in administrative costs, someone has to pay for them.
I conclude by saying that the current economic growth will continue. We have much to be proud of at the moment. We have low inflation. Our unemployment rate is continuing to decline. I want to emphasise a comment made by the Reserve Bank Governor when he said that he is expecting the current financial year to be another good one for the Australian economy. So we have much to look forward to.

"Mr Albanese, MP",ALP,2000-03-16,"—I rise today to address the issue of mandatory sentencing. This is an issue which has been unable to be addressed in the main parliamentary chamber due to the intransigence of the government and the refusal to have a proper debate on the bill carried by the Senate this week. This is a tragic debate which we should not be having in the year 2000. 
The Northern Territory's Juvenile Justice Act provides that a 15- or 16-year-old youth found guilty of a property offence for the second time must be detained for 28 days. There are economic costs but, more importantly, human costs to this tragedy. The costs to society in economic terms are that it costs taxpayers about $170 a day to detain a person in the Northern Territory. For example, Jamie Warramurra was jailed for the theft of biscuits and cordial on Christmas Day—one year's detention for that, $62,000 for that year. Kevin Cook was jailed for one year for stealing a towel worth $15—another $62,000 of taxpayers' money. Margaret Wynbyne was detained for 14 days for stealing one can of beer—a cost to taxpayers of $2,400 for stealing the equivalent of $2.40. The Wurramarrba boy who died in custody was detained for stealing goods worth approximately $50—he was detained more than 1,200 kilometres from his family. He was isolated. 
David Anderson from the Northern Territory Attorney-General's Department stated that there have been only 113 juveniles convicted of a mandatory sentencing offence. That is 113 young Australians who have been jailed for minor offences who will now have a criminal record. According to the Northern Territory Legal Aid Commission, the Northern Territory imprisoned more than twice as many people per head of population as any other Australian jurisdiction. A study by the North Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service showed that 68 per cent of detainees sentenced under this system had a first language other than English. It showed that 63 per cent of detainees had an education level less than year 8 and 75 per cent of detainees were indigenous Australians. It is not hard to see where this is heading. Poverty and injustice are always companions. 
Overriding Territory laws is not without precedent. This parliament did it on the issue of voluntary euthanasia, led by the Prime Minister. Why is the government dragging the chain now? There are real humane alternatives. In New South Wales because of the Labor government we have judges and magistrates given the discretion as to imposing sentences, using guidelines handed down by the New South Wales Court of Appeal. These principles do not dictate the appropriate sentence but permit the judge or magistrate to consider all relevant facts. Mandatory sentencing was introduced in Australia before in 1883, but the laws were scrapped the following year because they were an abject failure. How can this parliament refuse to overturn these laws in the year 2000? This is inconsistent with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which Australia is a party to. It is inconsistent with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which Australia is also a party to, and it is inconsistent with common human decency to jail young people for stealing a biscuit, for stealing a texta or for stealing a towel. This is an outrageous law and it must be overturned. It is a populist stunt, nothing more and nothing less, which does not even achieve the objectives which it sets out. Quite frankly, the gutlessness of those people, such as the member for Hughes, who said that they were going to take action this week but did not have the guts to carry out their convictions, in spite of making themselves heroes in the press this week, just makes me feel embarrassed to sit in the same parliament as they do.
