"Howard, John, MP",LP,2002-05-14,"—I move:
That:
An Address to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in the following terms be agreed to:
YOUR MAJESTY: 
We, the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia received with great sorrow the news of the death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. On behalf of the Australian people, we express deep sympathy to Your Majesty and other members of the Royal Family, and give thanks for a remarkable life dedicated to service, duty, support and her family.
When someone who reaches the age of 102 dies, and when that person has lived a very full life and has a personality of great exuberance, it is not a tragedy. Although there is inevitable sadness for the people immediately bereaved by that death, it is an occasion to mark and celebrate not only a long life but, in the case of the late Queen Mother, a quite remarkable life. It was a life that spanned the entire history to date of the federated Commonwealth of Australia—a period of time that saw the reigns of six monarchs, 25 Australian prime ministers and all of the great traumatic events which have shaped the world that we live in and the life that we experience. 
Born the Hon. Elizabeth Angela Marguerita Bowes-Lyon on 4 August 1900, during the reign of Queen Victoria, she was the youngest daughter and ninth child of Lord Glamis and, ultimately, she became the last surviving Victorian. World War I broke out on the Queen Mother's 14th birthday and Glamis was to become a convalescent hospital for the sick and wounded. It was that facility that brought her first into contact with many Australian soldiers who had been wounded in the battles on the Western Front.
The late Queen Mother married the Duke of York, as he then was—the second son of King George V—on 26 April 1923 at Westminster Abbey—the first royal wedding to take place there, I understand, for more than 500 years. They had two children: the present Queen, born in April 1926 and later their daughter Princess Margaret, who predeceased the Queen Mother by a small number of weeks. 
1936, as students of history will know, became the year of three kings: George V died; Edward VIII assumed the throne and was soon to abdicate; and then, in December, Prince Albert, ascendant of the throne, became George VI and his wife became the Queen. So it was that Elizabeth unexpectedly became Queen and eventually the longest lived of all of Britain's royals to carry the title of Queen. Her coronation took place in May 1937. George VI, who was a much loved monarch of the United Kingdom and of the other nations that recognised him as head of state, died unexpectedly in his sleep after a long illness in 1952. After a period of withdrawal from public life, it was at the urging of the then British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, that the Queen Mother returned to public duties. She entered what was a second and quite remarkable phase of her life and an opportunity of influence on her family and her people.
To many Australians, the most impressive part of the long life of the Queen Mother was the role she played beside her late husband, King George VI, during the darkest days of the Nazi assault on Britain in World War II. Under the political leadership of Winston Churchill, Britain was also rallied by the king and queen. Her refusal to leave London during the Blitz is now legendry and served as a great example of courage for the British people. The most memorable of her utterances was in response to a suggestion that she and the children should leave Britain and go to Canada. Her very memorable response was: `The children will never leave without me, and I will never leave without the king, and the king will never leave.' Those remarks and the spirit that they represented had a powerful impact on the British people in their darkest days of despair and encirclement. She spent nights in air-raid shelters and took revolver lessons in the grounds of Buckingham Palace. She is well remembered for her visits to the East End of London during the Blitz. Thirty thousand Londoners were killed during the war. Of the Blitz and the carnage, she said:
The destruction is so awful, and the people so wonderful they deserve a better world.
She was a source of hope, encouragement and inspiration to the British people at that time. Hitler was said to have remarked that she was the most dangerous woman in Europe, having observed a newsreel clip of her laying a poppy on a First World War memorial.
On the death of King George VI exactly 50 years ago, Sir Winston Churchill said of the king and queen during the war that the fate and fortunes of the whole nation and of his realms were centred not only in his office but in his soul—that was an ordeal which he could not have endured without the strong and loving support of his devoted and untiring wife and consort. Appropriately, our own Prime Minister at the time, Robert Menzies, in February 1952 said:
All those who saw England under daily and nightly attack in the great battles of 1940 and 1941 were stirred by the spectacle of an embattled nation normally not unacquainted with internal divisions and hostilities, in which there was unity, cheerfulness, courage and a common resolution which ran through factory and farm, which made the King and his humble subject feel a deep and human brotherhood.
King George VI and his Queen Elizabeth were among the great architects of that brotherhood. The Queen Mother's life was governed by her sense of commitment to her family, to her nation, to a way of life and attitudes and values which many would regard today as quaint and old-fashioned, but she held to those values and attitudes in the constancy of her loyalty and her commitment. Those attitudes and values earned her very great respect. She was a person with an immense sense of fun; she was a great lover of racing. It is not surprising that the Racing Post, a British horse racing publication, at the time of her death said:
The Queen Mother should be wished a sunny day with the going good.
The Queen Mother's connection with Australia was very regular. She visited here in 1927 with her husband, the then Duke of York, to open the first and temporary Parliament House. She returned to Australia in 1949, 1958 and 1966.
The Queen Mother had an immense influence on her family and, as she grew older, her esteem and affection in the hearts of people all around the world grew. I had the privilege to represent Australia at the Queen Mother's funeral, along with, amongst others, the prime ministers of the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand. The lying in state in the Hall of Westminster was salutary and significant. As thousands of people filed by, they represented all generations and a very wide cross-section of the British people. They were not all elderly; they were of all ages. They came from different backgrounds and different races, and they came to honour a quite remarkable life. It is an extraordinary achievement alone to live to the age of 102, but to have lived through the experiences that she had—to have adjusted her life at various stages, despite the obvious privileges and comfort of having been born into the circumstances in which she was born—nonetheless demonstrated great strength of character and flexibility, a capacity to respect and keep what was good of one's history and one's past whilst, at the same time, demonstrating a capacity to adapt and be contemporary and relevant to current circumstances. She was a well loved member of the royal family, a deeply revered lady around the world and a gracious and impressive person.
I know the House will join me in extending our condolences to the Queen and to the other members of her family in marking, as we appropriately do in this place, a great life that touched this country and lived through extraordinary events that continue to shape us to this day.
Honourable members—Hear, hear!",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother</title>,Condolences,1,1,speech
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2002-05-14,"—I join the Prime Minister in support of this motion before the House and, in doing so, on behalf of the opposition express our deepest sympathies to the Queen and her family on the death of the Queen Mother. The death of the Queen Mother, of course, was a double tragedy for the Queen, who also lost her sister, Princess Margaret, earlier this year. This was supposed to have been a year of celebration for her, as indeed it will be, because it is her Golden Jubilee. What should have been a year of great celebration for the royal family has been tinged with sadness.
The Queen Mother was a much loved and admired figure. She passed away peacefully after a long and full life—a life which spanned, as the Prime Minister has indicated, the entire history of Australia as a federation. She was born on 4 August 1900, five months before we became a sovereign nation. When the Australian troops stormed Gallipoli on 25 April 1915 she was 14 years of age. She was 26 when she and her husband, the then Duke of York and the future King George VI, participated in the opening of Parliament House here in Canberra and the true birth of our nation's capital. It is interesting that the 75th anniversary of that event was celebrated just last week.
She was in her thirties during the Great Depression and the bodyline series when popular sentiment about our relationship with England began to be transformed. And during the battle of Australia in 1941-42, when Australia's destiny began to move away from the empire, she was already in her forties and five years the Queen of England. Prior to that, of course, she had helped to rally the people of Great Britain during the Battle of Britain and the Blitz. With the outbreak of war in 1939 there was some suggestion that the queen and her daughters should evacuate to North America or Canada, something that the Prime Minister has referred to. That famous quote finishing with the words `the king will never leave' showed the stoicism with which she became noted. She did, in the process, expose herself to real danger, having been in Buckingham Palace when it was bombed during the Blitz.
It would have been easy for someone who was already in her sixties when the Beatles first toured Australia to have been completely out of step with the times, but that was not her way. The Queen Mother was always very accessible. She took her public duties seriously right until the end, not only with dignity but with a great sense of humour. She knew how to charm an audience. Her 100th birthday was celebrated with great panache.
Her Majesty was patron or president of some 350 organisations. She was commandant-in-chief of the women's services of the Army and Air Force and for women in the Royal Navy. She also held other significant service appointments. For many years she was President of the British Red Cross Society and she was Commandant-in-Chief of the Nursing Division of the St John Ambulance Brigade. She was also colonel-in-chief or honorary colonel of many UK and overseas regiments and Commandant-in-Chief of the Royal Air Force Central Flying School.
Her reign and our federation have seen the profound transformation of the monarchy. The Queen Mother was the last English monarch to have the title of the Empress of India. When she was young it was still common for people to hold her and the monarchy in awe, but today we are a much more egalitarian and democratic society. The monarchy has been transferred into the first family, but it is the first among equals, worthy of respect but a respect which must now be earned. The Queen Mother did earn that respect and for that we honour her.
We do acknowledge still the monarchy as the symbolic head of our Constitution, but the loyalty we once invested directly in the royal family now, of course, rests where it should properly rest: in our own institutions through the directly elected Australian parliament through which governments are formed. We are proud of these developments and of the independence that we assert through them. But we can also respect traditions and the processes that have evolved in them over the century since Federation. So it is against that background, on behalf of the opposition, that I convey my deepest condolences to the royal family and to all Australians who, like me, had a great respect for the Queen Mother.

"Anderson, John, MP",NP,2002-05-14,"—Mr Speaker, I rise to support the address moved by the Prime Minister and, with your indulgence, to note the presence in the gallery of the British High Commissioner, Sir Alastair Goodlad. I trust that he will convey the thoughts and spirit of today's motion to the people of his homeland.
Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother was a symbol of stability in a tumultuous century. She lived through the collapse of empires, desperate wars and rapid technological change. At the time that she was born the motor car was a quaint toy, by law—even in this country—required to be preceded by a man waving a red flag. Even in those days, fortunately, it was not often enforced. The Wright Brothers had not made their inaugural flight. The war to end all wars was yet to come. Nuclear bomb technology was beyond imagination. Terrorism of the sort that we now confront was beyond anybody's comprehension.
She became an immensely popular figure in the 1920s, particularly after the birth of Princess Elizabeth, and was loved by the British and the Australian people in particular, and more generally by many others, for the whole of her very long life. She was born on 4 August 1900, the last year of the 19th century. Her family's principal seat was Glamis Castle, the oldest inhabited home in Britain. Shakespeare wrote about it in Macbeth. There was a time when the thanes of Glamis fielded their own armies. During the First World War, Glamis was turned into a convalescent home for wounded soldiers while the 14-year-old Lady Elizabeth assisted with managing the castle and, indeed, she ran it by herself after her mother fell ill in 1918.
In 1923 she married Prince Albert, the second son of King George V. It proved to be a happy, stable and successful union. Prince Albert, as has been referred to many times in recent documentaries and media stories, was a shy and reserved man. Lady Elizabeth was an outgoing and strong woman who brought out his best, certainly his very great courage. She made her first visit to Australia in 1927, as has been referred to here, as the Duchess of York. The duke opened our first Parliament House, now celebrating its 75th anniversary. Her strength, of course, was to be greatly tested in 1936, the year of the three kings. It began with the death of the old king, George V, and it ended with the abdication of Edward VIII and the accession of Prince Albert to the throne as George VI.
The king and queen did indeed become symbols of hope and resistance during World War II when they remained in Buckingham Palace throughout the Blitz. Queen Elizabeth famously, as has been noted in this place, rejected proposals to evacuate Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret to Canada. She said, `The princesses will never leave without me, I will not leave without the king and, of course, the king will never leave.' The Luftwaffe bombed Buckingham Palace on 13 September 1940 and she subsequently told a policeman—again words that have echoed down through the years—`I'm glad we have been bombed. It makes me feel I can look the East End in the face.'
The Queen Mother retreated briefly from public life after the death of the king in 1952, but then resumed her public duties as well as becoming a key adviser to the Queen and to Prince Charles. The Queen Mother was patron or president of some 350 organisations, colonel-in-chief or honorary colonel of many United Kingdom and overseas regiments, Chancellor of London University for 25 years. For many years too, she was President of the British Red Cross Society. As has been noted again in this place, she particularly enjoyed horseracing and was a leading owner of steeplechasers. 
The Queen Mother was officially mourned with all of the ceremony of British royalty. However, her most important memorial is not to be found in the 40-gun salutes or the glittering symbols of empire; the pomps of this world crumble quickly and we are all, in time, to the dust returned. As she herself might well have seen it, her greatest memorial was her family. I am reminded of the sad eulogy of Prince Charles, her grandson, who said:
She was quite simply the most magical grandmother you could possibly have and I was utterly devoted to her.
I commend the address to the House.
—As is evident from the statements made by all speakers, this House is joined in the motion of condolence to the Queen on the death of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. The statements have also had an underlying note of celebration as we recognise a remarkable life lived to the full. All previous speakers have also commented on the remarkable link between Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, this institution and its home in that she was present 75 years ago last Thursday when her husband, in his role as the then Duke of York, declared the provisional Parliament House open. I invite all members, as a mark of respect to the memory of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, to rise in their places and so pass the motion moved by the Prime Minister. 
Question agreed to, honourable members standing in their places.
—As a mark of respect to the memory of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, the sitting is suspended. The sitting will be resumed in one hour.

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2002-05-14,"—My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of concerns widely reported of changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme? Prime Minister, is it not the case that, if reports in today's paper are correct, a family whose three children get sick at the same time will be forced to pay $85.80, or an increase of $18.60, from their family budget for just three lots of medicine? Prime Minister, will you rule out putting Australian families under more financial pressure when their kids get sick?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget: Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Howard, John, MP",LP,2002-05-14,"—I could be wrong, but I suspect that the question is, in part, based on budget speculation.
Opposition members interjecting—
—No, there is another part of my answer. I would invite the Leader of the Opposition to turn up at 7.30 tonight. He will learn a lot, and he will hear an excellent budget speech. Could I also take the opportunity to remind the Leader of the Opposition that the family with three children for which he professes such concern and compassion is infinitely better off now than it was six years ago.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget: Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,answer
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2002-05-14,"—Mr Speaker, on 13 February this year I put question No. 1 on the Notice Paper to the Prime Minister, as well as questions Nos 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 11—
—The member for Lowe—
—to the Prime Minister, dealing with cross-media ownership laws—a very important question—and I would like an answer. I also put questions Nos 20 and 34 to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services; questions Nos 36, 37, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 46, 47 and 48 to the Treasurer; questions Nos 58, 59 and 60 to the Minister for Finance and Administration; question No. 69 to the Minister for Health and Ageing and question No. 74 to the Minister for Ageing. It is now some 90 days since those questions—
—I point out to the member for Lowe—
—first appeared on the Notice Paper and I would like you to facilitate answers under standing order 150. I have to keep going, Mr Speaker, because—

—I am very happy to be interrupted.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER</title>,<title>Questions on Notice</title>,Questions to the Speaker,4,1,question
"SPEAKER, The",N/A,2002-05-14,"—The member for Lowe will resume his seat, if he is being interrupted. I point out to the member for Lowe that, while I have allowed him to continue drawing my attention to this matter and I will take action under standing order 150, in fact the suspension of standing orders that was moved earlier today—as the clerk has pointed out to me—did not accommodate this facility. I have allowed the member for Lowe to continue and I would invite him to very quickly return to the issues that he wants addressed under standing order 150 because we are both—he and I—outside the standing orders.
—I am always grateful for your accommodation, Mr Speaker, and so I will be very brief and will not even name the ministers. It has been some 83 days since question No.167 appeared on the Notice Paper; 64 days for questions Nos 187,188 and 191; 63 days for question No. 211; and, finally, 61 days for questions Nos 229 and 230.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2002-05-14,"—by leave—In accordance with the provisions of the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951, the committee is required to make recommendations to both houses of parliament and to the Prime Minister on the draft budget estimates of the Australian National Audit Office. The committee, having considered the draft budget estimates for 2002-03 submitted by the Auditor-General, is able to advise parliament that it is satisfied that the estimates are sufficient to enable the Auditor-General to properly exercise his functions and powers under the Auditor-General Act 1997. The estimates specifically refer to the provision of assurance audit services, performance audit services and information services.
The budget allocation the ANAO is seeking for 2002-03 is $53.34 million determined in accordance with the outputs/outcomes budget framework and parameters specified by the Department of Finance and Administration. The Auditor-General told the committee that the ANAO's financial position had been prudently managed so that there were sufficient cash reserves to meet ongoing liabilities and to fund future capital acquisitions. However, last year's foreshadowed possibility of being able to return $1 million to the budget in 2002-03 and 2003-04, based on financial projections at the time, will not be met, and the 2002-03 budget figures and forward estimates have been adjusted accordingly.
Since last financial year, there have been some unforeseen increases in the ANAO's financial statement responsibilities, primarily in relation to the Telstra group. Further, ANAO's recruitment and work force planning initiatives to recruit and retain the required staff for the audit program have resulted in a growth in the work force within the planning framework, with a commensurate increase in ongoing employee expenses. ANAO's financial strategy also involves maintaining cash reserves sufficient to meet future liabilities as they accrue and the required asset replacement program. Future liabilities which are not fully funded through annual appropriations include employee leave liabilities and the increasing cost of the Centenary House lease.
The increased budget appropriation for 2002-03 reflects the need to meet ANAO's additional financial statement audit responsibilities and the increased level of resources necessary to deliver the performance audit program, including some capacity to meet requests for particular audits from the parliament and ministers, as has been occurring in recent years.
The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, in line with its statutory responsibilities as audit committee of the parliament, will continue to monitor closely the demands placed on the Auditor-General's resources by way of ad hoc audit requests. This will ensure that the Audit Office's wider scheduled performance of audits is not compromised.
