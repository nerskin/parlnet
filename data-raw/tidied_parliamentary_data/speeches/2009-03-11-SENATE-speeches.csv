"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2009-03-11,"—I rise this morning to continue my contribution in this chamber on the Fair Work Bill 2008. This bill is of course based on the corporations power, not the conciliation and arbitration power as was previous industrial relations legislation in this country. This means that the new workplace relations system will cover all employees of employers who are trading corporations. Awards will no longer be the result of the arbitration of interstate industrial disputes but common rules for industries or occupations. Also, unions will not have to apply to vary every award each year for a national wage case.
I now turn to some of the main issues that I have heard my colleagues opposite raise. Perhaps two most significant areas were raised during the hearings of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee. Bear in mind that, out of all of the chapters of the legislation and all of the changes that are proposed under this system, it is interesting that the opposition chose to home in on the right of entry and access to records. Let me address those two areas. The Work Choices legislation clearly marginalised unions—there is no doubt about that—and it clearly alienated workers in the workplace who wanted to or would have liked to join a union. Work Choices clearly impinged on the employee’s freedom of association rights, but the Fair Work Bill enshrines in law what was allowed before Work Choices came into force, though with strict rules regulating it. It gives right of entry for unions to hold discussions with members and potential members, and this cannot be removed by a non-union agreement. There is no such concept as a union or a non-union agreement under the Fair Work Bill. It states that employers must respect an employee’s right to be represented and enhances protections for freedom of association. It ensures that rooms for meetings during workplace visits must be fit for purpose and not be intended to intimidate and discourage attendance.
My office received complaints regarding a workplace in the seat of Solomon, where a trade union official visiting a workplace in Palmerston was invited to sit in what was no more than the cleaner’s closet in order to try and meet with trade union members. Under this bill that will not occur. A submission to the Senate inquiry into the Fair Work Bill by the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia detailed an instance where a union organiser was directed to meet workers in the female toilets area, forcing the organiser to stand in the doorway of the toilets in order to have access to female workers at that workplace. This legislation will ensure that ridiculous and inhumane situations such as those experienced by trade union organisers, delegates and their members around this country do not happen again.
The right of entry provisions in the bill were a point of contention. As I said, that was brought up by employers during our Senate hearings. We heard that some employers see union involvement in the workplace as potentially destructive, either by unions competing with one another for potential members or simply by unions being able to enter the workplace. The committee majority believes, and I agree, that this concern is unfounded. There is no evidence, and there was no evidence provided, to show that that is the case. In fact, we had evidence to the contrary. Section 480 of the bill states:
… establish a framework for officials of organisations to enter premises that balances:
the right of organisations to represent their members in the workplace, hold discussions with potential members and investigate suspected contraventions of:
this Act and fair work instruments …
It also balances:
the right of employees to receive, at work, information and representation from officials of organisations; and
the right of occupiers of premises and employers to go about their business without undue inconvenience.
This bill does that; it balances the rights of the trade union organisation, the rights of the employee in a workplace to seek to be represented by that trade union and the rights of the employer—quite legitimately so—to not have their business interrupted during the day or during the evening for that matter. Throughout the committee hearing process, we did not hear any substantial evidence to the contrary. In the first instance, there are strict compliance rules that unions must follow if they wish to enter a workplace. The legislation specifically states the entry rules that unions must comply with. These rules include that, if a union wants to enter the workplace, the individual must be a valid permit holder, must provide the employer with at least 24 hours notice and must comply with the conditions on entry. The bill protects and puts in place what Work Choices did away with: an organisation’s right to represent its members in their workplace, an employee’s right to be represented by their union and the employer’s right to be able to continue to conduct their business without interruption.
It is no secret that the former government sought to eradicate unions from the workplace. It is not a line that is popularly swallowed by the majority of people out there. A lot of people may not choose to join a union, but a lot of people certainly respect and appreciate the work that trade unions do. Work Choices proved, though, that the clear intention and main aim of one of those bills was to diminish the effectiveness of trade unions representing their members. Work Choices thoroughly restricted union entry and inspection rights, with the aim of preventing unions from accessing and helping their members in the workplace. It even removed an employee’s right to meet with their union in their workplace if they were covered by an AWA or a non-union agreement. The Australian Council of Trade Unions point out in their submission to the Senate committee:
The right of workers to have access to their representatives is recognised by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) as an integral element of the right of workers to freedom of association and collective bargaining.
The right-of-entry provision in this bill ensures that this right is protected. Unions have a proven history of helping their members ensure that their rights and entitlements are protected. In order to achieve this, unions must have access to their members in their workplace, and this bill will guarantee that.
I will now just touch on access to records, another area that was raised during the Senate’s hearings. The committee heard from employers voicing concerns that allowing unions access to employee records would breach the privacy of non-union members or of the members themselves. There is the view among some employers that, under this legislation, unions are given free reign access to employee records and that that is open to abuse. That view is, in fact, incorrect. If you read the legislation, you will see that there are very strict rules that unions must comply with when accessing employee records. With regard to the second concern, I quote the committee majority report:
The committee heard of no instance—
absolutely no instance; on the committee hearing days that I attended, when I asked employers to provide me with examples of where access to employees’ records had been abused, nobody could provide me with examples of that—
of misuse or abuse of employee records …
No allegations were put before us. The majority report goes on to say:
The committee majority also notes that the protections for personal information are stronger and more comprehensive under the Fair Work Bill than under WorkChoices and there are also heavier penalties for the unauthorised use or disclosure of employee records.
During the Senate committee hearing on the 27 January, I asked an advocate from the Queensland Council of Unions if, to their knowledge, there had been a misuse of records obtained by trade union officials in Queensland. The response from Ms Deborah Ralston was this:
No, and what is important to bear in mind, as I indicated earlier, is that in the Queensland context authorised officers are not subject to a fit and proper person test. Yet the authorised officers that operate within the Queensland environment indirectly apply such a test because they adhere to very high standards in relation to the rights and responsibilities they have in accessing a work site.
I then asked again:
So you are not aware of any allegation or case or proceedings or complaints whereby a person has misused employee information?
I asked if anybody was aware of any allegation, case, proceeding or complaint whereby a person had misused employee information, and the answer was no. Union access to employee records was in place prior to Work Choices; the government has simply protected this in legislation and, in fact, gone further. This government has put in place strict rules that unions must follow if they wish to access employee records.
The Fair Work Bill before us today balances the needs of employers, employees and unions. This bill will ensure that Australia is competitive and prosperous without compromising workplace rights and guaranteed minimum standards. It will ensure that employees’ freedom of association in the workplace is protected. But it will also ensure that employers and employees have access to transparent, clear and simple information about their rights and responsibilities. On that basis, I commend this bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2009-03-11,"—I also would like to make some comments on the so-called Fair Work Bill 2008. I can stand here and insist that Senator Farrell, for instance, is the Chesty Bond of the Senate. I can stand here and insist that I am the Nicole Kidman of the Senate. But simply saying it does not make it so. The Fair Work Bill is not about fairness. The Fair Work Bill is not fair. It does not matter how many government members say that it is; saying it does not make it so. Saying it is fair does not make it fair. Amending the bill can make it less unfair, but that is all. In fact, in the form that the government said that the bill absolutely had to be passed—that is, the Fair Work Bill mark I—it was about reintroducing the very worst of adversarial industrial relations to Australia and to Australian workplaces.
Now the demure Deputy Prime Minister is saying—though just saying it does not make it true—that she will accept some amendments to the Fair Work Bill. Of course, she has not yet provided the amendments that she is intending so that they can be scrutinised or checked for unintended consequences. She would just like a blanket approval. We in the coalition, however, are very happy to spell out the amendments that we believe would assist in improving the fairness of the so-called Fair Work Bill. We are seeking amendments to the clauses relating to union access to non-union member records, the expanded right of unions to enter workplaces, compulsory arbitration provisions when enterprise bargaining fails, the right of multitudinous unions to participate in greenfields agreements, and the transition of business provisions and the unfair dismissal provisions that are included in the bill. If our amendments are accepted, some of the more combative, adversarial aspects of the bill will have been removed. Then and only then will the bill begin to approach fair.
Just as pathetic as the word games that the government has been trying to play with the word ‘fair’ have been the attempts of the demure Deputy Prime Minister to play mind games with the word ‘mandate’. Every time the government says mandate, the coalition is supposed to throw up its hands in defeat and accept the bill as though it were holy writ. Even the amendments to the supposedly unchangeable holy writ are supposed to be accepted holus-bolus, without examination, without any forethought. As Senator Humphries so ably explained yesterday, that was not the attitude that the Labor Party adopted to ‘mandate’ when they were in opposition. Back then, the Labor Party had a bit of a ‘mandate, schmandate’ attitude. They had not yet discovered their reverence for mandates. The Howard government had a mandate for the sale of Telstra, for the introduction of the GST and for the introduction of our unfair dismissal legislation more than once. I am afraid I have to say that back then the Labor Party did not revere the mandate; in fact, they opposed our mandated legislation at every turn. Whenever they could, they even—shocking as this may now seem to the current government members—delayed and blocked legislation that was there because of a mandate.
Could the government please stop playing silly games with this legislation? In any economic climate, the consequences of this dramatic change to the workplace relations landscape would be serious. We have stories in the press today of restaurants that are unlikely to succeed because of the changes that are proposed and of many other small businesses that are likely to fail in the coming months, when we already have enough potential failure around us. Right now, with rising levels of unemployment and increasing numbers of company failures, it is irresponsible and disgusting that the government wants to continue to play games around this legislation. There is no doubt whatsoever that this legislation can be improved, that the Fair Work Bill can do a much better job of approaching fairness. I attended a number of the Senate committee hearings into the bill as a participating member. The evidence of dozens of witnesses was that the bill could be improved, that the bill could be less lopsided and less adversarial. For Australia’s sake, let us make it better.
When the ALP took office, the budget was $19.7 billion in surplus, the government had no debt and held net assets of $42.9 billion. Importantly, the economy of Australia was experiencing its 17th year of growth. Gross domestic product was growing at just under four per cent per annum. After just 15 months of the Rudd government, we had had our first quarter of negative growth in 17 years. Economists across Australia are already claiming that we are in recession, yet we have had no recognition from the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations that Australian employers and Australian workers are even facing difficulty. Newsflash to the government: if you make workplace relations just another red taped jackboot that you can kick small business with, in the current circumstances a lot of those employers will simply stop employing. They will themselves join the growing queues of the unemployed.
As an indication of what may be to come, we have the ANZ job data for February, which came out yesterday. The data provides proof that job advertisements in newspapers and on the internet fell by 10 per cent in February when compared to January, which is generally one of the slower months. They are down by almost 40 per cent when compared to February 2008. This is the biggest drop in advertisements in the history of the ANZ job advertising survey. It seems that many employers will lay off workers that they currently have. It does not matter how much so-called fairness the government tries to pile onto employers; the bald fact is that, if you make sacking staff too difficult, companies will simply shut up shop.
The latest Dun and Bradstreet National Business Expectations Survey, which came out today, shows that 27 per cent of firms said they plan to cut back staff in the June quarter this year. What is this government doing to assist those people other than putting up wages and creating conditions that make it impossible for employment to continue? The Dun and Bradstreet survey reports that businesses are being prepared for worse times ahead. Clearly, many businesses are looking at the actions of the government and showing no confidence whatsoever that they will be able to employ workers or even retain current workers. In this climate, in the midst of this uncertainty, the government has chosen not to approach this bill with goodwill or with an attitude of negotiating the best outcome. It has stuck resolutely to its election promises—in fact, it has gone past its election promises, stressing its mandate. It has gone much further than the policies that were outlined in Forward with Fairness.
Other coalition senators yesterday did an outstanding job of spelling out the amendments that we seek and why it is in Australia’s best interests that they be accepted, so I would like to spend a little bit of time looking at the so-called unfair dismissal provisions in this so-called Fair Work Bill. The bill would give businesses with fewer than 15 staff a 12-month exemption from meeting the government’s dismissal code when they dismiss a staff member. The Senate hearings that I attended heard evidence that these changes to the unfair dismissal provisions would be a serious disincentive to employment and almost impossible to implement in industries where labour demand is prone to fluctuate or is seasonal. In fact, even the unions had concerns about the unfair dismissal provisions.
Firstly, the figure of 15 staff includes all workers; it is a head count. It is not just the number of full-time equivalent workers. So you have the crazy situation where a busy sandwich bar with just two full-time staff, for example, would not fit the exemption criteria if they employed 13 part-timers—a very common experience in small businesses which have peak times of busyness and otherwise. The Local Government Association of Queensland noted that our workplace relations system should not discourage employers from increasing their workforce beyond 15 for fear of attracting unfair dismissal claims. Many, many business groups raised concerns about this definition and all manner of suggestions were made, from the very basic suggestion that the number of 15 should at least apply to full-time equivalent staff right through to the idea that the current figure of 100 should be retained.
Let’s look at why we have those figures. Where on earth did they come from? What are we trying to achieve with this? The exemption from unfair dismissal for small business was meant to recognise the fact that many smaller businesses simply did not have the resources to check legislation, to see that they had it right, to understand the regulations and to work their way carefully through the provisions—and often this required legal advice. It was meant to be a recognition that without those resources small businesses in particular were fearful of taking on extra staff. Evidence has suggested that the relaxation of the unfair dismissal laws to incorporate the concerns of small business led to an increase of about 7,000 jobs per year—7,000 people became full-time workers when in other circumstances the small business operators may have decided to just work longer hours themselves and not expand their businesses as quickly as they might have. I thought the idea of exempting small business was about accepting that small business simply does not have the same resources as big business.
The question then becomes: when does a company begin to reach critical mass and have the resources to be confident that they understand the regulations and that they understand how to meet them? We are not talking about employers who are sacking for the hell of it. Certainly during the times of high employment that we had under the Howard government no employer in their right mind sacked someone for the hell of it, because they knew how difficult it would be to replace them.
Our definitions of small, medium and large business are certainly something of a mishmash at the moment. The Bureau of Statistics defines a small business as one with fewer than 20 full-time equivalent employees. That is a start, but what the hell has it got to do with the figure of 15? Absolutely nothing. Where the number 15 was plucked from is still something of a mystery if the objective of this is to assist small business. We need to define small business. By international standards, the figure of 20 in our definition of small business is very, very low. The World Bank, the OECD, the European Union and even the ACTU’s favourite organisation, the ILO—which is hardly a bastion of neoliberalism—define a small business as one with fewer than 50 full-time equivalent employees and an annual turnover of less than about A$20 million.
The coalition leader, Mr Turnbull, has said we will work with the non-government senators—and with the government if they can wake up and pay attention—to arrive at the best possible result for Australian small business in this legislation. I would personally like to encourage the use of the overseas definition of a small business—that is, one with fewer than 50 full-time equivalent employees and a turnover of less than $20 million—not just because it would be good for international consistency but because it would be good for Australia and for the creation of Australian jobs, which is what one hopes this parliament is all about.
I note that the Deputy Prime Minister this morning claimed that she was not prepared to negotiate on the head count of 15 for exemption from the unfair dismissal laws. You have to ask why—what is she trying to achieve? Is the true agenda here simply to make the number as low as possible so that as many people as possible are caught by this net? It is certainly not about trying to assist small business to go about doing its job of employing Australians in the particularly difficult economic situation we are in. At a time of economic crisis such as we are experiencing, this government should be doing everything to protect the jobs and livelihoods of Australian workers. If the Senate passes the bill in its current state, any job lost as a result of the new system will not be ‘fair’; it will be a dark stain on the hands of this government. Any employer who decides that the transaction costs of employing have risen so dramatically that he or she cannot afford to engage new employees and thereby add to the productivity of the economy can rightly lay the blame for that inability at the door of this government. We urge the government to consider our amendments and to negotiate fairly for a fair outcome on a bill that currently is certainly not fair.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2009-03-11,"—Like Senator Boyce I had the opportunity to participate in the committee hearings examining the Fair Work Bill 2008. I went to almost all of the hearings around the country, and it became particularly apparent that this bill represents nothing less than an attack on jobs. Senator Boyce referred to how employers in recent times would be out of their mind to remove employees, because it was actually hard to find replacements. Sadly, it appears that under this Labor government that is not the same problem that it once was. This Orwellian-titled Fair Work Bill should actually be called the ‘ACTU Thank You Bill’ or the ‘Union Return-the-Favour Bill’ because what this bill represents is an attempt to use the force of law to breathe life into a movement that is dying of irrelevance, with roughly one in six private sector workers being a member of a trade union. This represents an attempt by the ALP to put their paymasters back in the box seat and to effectively coerce members of the Australian workforce into once again being supporters of the trade union movement. Importantly, as Senator Boyce and other speakers on this side have outlined, the bill does not enact what Labor promised before the election. That is clear. It goes a lot further. I will mention a few of those examples this morning.
Firstly, with respect to right of entry, this bill goes substantially further than was promised by the Labor Party before the last election. As has been outlined in the committee report, in a speech delivered in April 2008 the minister stated:
… the current rules in relation to right of entry will remain. With the right to enter another’s workplace comes the responsibility to ensure that it is done only in accordance with the law.
And another example:
We will make sure that current right of entry provisions stay. We understand that entering on the premises of an employer needs to happen in an orderly way. We will keep the right of entry provisions.
What happened in the committee hearing is that the department itself conceded:
The bill removes the existing requirement for a union to be bound to an award or agreement applying in the workplace as a condition of entry.
That is a substantial change from the law as it existed several years ago. When it comes to accessing employees’ records, the coalition firmly believes that those records should only be accessed, as we outlined yesterday, if they relate to members of unions or people who give their permission or where a tribunal orders such access. It should not be as of right for a trade union. The bottom line here is that, if the Commonwealth Bank cannot get access to those records, why on earth should the CFMEU be able to? That is a major inconsistency in this bill and it is a substantial change from previous law.
Secondly, we have transmission of business. Hidden away in the back of this bill and retitled ‘Transfer of business’ this represents a fundamental change to settled law that has over decades gone right to the High Court of Australia. It represents an attack on the settled law to the extent that we heard evidence that it will directly cost jobs. It changes what was an asset test and a test based on business character to a transfer of work. We heard from the Australian Industry Group unequivocally that the provisions are anti-employment and would create a huge incentive for companies not to employ workers of businesses they take over. I cannot think of a worse measure to introduce in the current economic environment than to actually provide a disincentive for companies to take on employees of businesses that are taken over or that otherwise change hands through contracting arrangements. For the party that talks about the need for an independent umpire: there is an independent umpire in the High Court of Australia. It has settled this law over and over again. In essence, what this bill does, when the unions have not been able to get their case up through the courts and tribunals of Australia, is say, ‘We’ll change the rules.’ For the party that talks about an independent umpire, that represents a spit in its face. What it does is say, ‘We are just going to change what the umpire said.’
Thirdly, we have compulsory arbitration. We heard that there would be no compulsory arbitration. It was not vague; it was explicit. We were told that people would not be forced to sign or adopt agreements to which they did not concede. This bill does not do that. This bill allows Fair Work Australia to make orders to force people into agreements that they otherwise do not concede to, and that represents a retrograde step. Through that provision and others this bill will cost jobs.
We hear much confected, contrived outrage from the Prime Minister and the government, but it is nothing more than spin. We hear more about the previous government’s policies than we do about the detail and impact of their own—they do not want to discuss them, they do not want to defend them and they do not want to be held to them. The coalition will do just that. Unlike our opponents, we will not stand in the way of the electorate—and that has been made clear—but we will hold the government to account and we will hold them to that which they promised in their policy.
The ultimate test of this legislation is: does it create jobs? Does it support job creation? While the previous government oversaw the creation of two million jobs, this government will oversee job destruction—as we heard in evidence to the committee. Quite frankly, that is consistent with the history of the labour movement in this country, who have never cared about unemployed people. Over many years they have sought to hold conditions at the expense of jobs. I recall an example from my youth, when the then Secretary of the Victorian Trades Hall Council went to the Shepparton Preserving Company in the last recession that Labor oversaw in this country—which hit particularly hard in my home state of Victoria. Rather than allow the workers at SPC, as it was, to voluntarily alter their conditions, in came the Victorian Trades Hall Council. With state government support, it actually prohibited them from changing their working conditions to keep their jobs through what was then the worst recession since World War II. That shows the intent of the labour movement, and that is actually reflected in this bill.
Senator Farrell last night specifically spoke about trolley collectors and how the SDA had apparently saved trolley collectors, which I found interesting. I was once a trolley boy. I spent several years at high school and university as a trolley boy, and when I was not a trolley boy I was a freezer boy at the local Safeway or independent supermarket. Do you know what the SDA did for me? The SDA ensured, because it did not like youth wages, that when one turns 21 one had to graduate to adult wages. The SDA made sure that everyone lost their job when they reached 21. The day I turned 21, up went my pay rate and the supermarkets all said, ‘Thank you very much.’ I was only a casual. All the SDA represented was a notice board in the tea room or lunch room of a supermarket. I never saw nor heard from them. When I turned 21, I lost my job. I lost my job because of the unions not allowing flexibility in the workplace. I had no say in that; I had to go and find something else. Maybe some 15- or 16-year-old kid got the job. But how on earth is that job growth? That does not represent job growth. That goes to show what the labour movement has been about: protecting conditions of existing employed people at the expense of those who have no job. And that is exactly what is being undertaken in this bill.
This government says one thing and does another. It says that this bill represents a forward step. The department admitted in the first committee hearing here in Canberra a fact that was very interesting. This bill removes a right of employers that was granted by the Laurie Brereton act of 1993. In 1993, both unions and employers were given the right to take protected industrial action. Under this bill, the right of employers to do so is limited. It is limited so it can only be done in a reactive sense. This bill does not just take us back beyond the Workplace Relations Act 1996; it takes us back beyond 1993. That is another example of how, despite the government using the word ‘fair’ over and over again, as currently constructed the bill is simply not fair.
The bill uses award modernisation as the excuse to govern the union right of entry rules. The unions get to define when they are eligible to go into a workplace. One day, you could have the AWU knocking on the door; the next day, you could have the AMWU; and on a really bad week you might get the CFMEU. The unions can change their own rules to determine which workplaces they cover. That is a not a recipe for industrial peace, that is not a recipe for cooperation in the workplace and it is not a recipe for jobs.
This morning when I was preparing my speech, my attention was brought to the Forward with Fairness document, dated April 2007. The interesting thing is that if one searches through this document, apart from a very obscure reference to trying to promote economic growth and the future economic prosperity of our nation, there is nothing about promoting jobs. There is no promise here that this will deliver economic growth and 10, 20 or 50 thousand jobs—or maybe even two million jobs, like the previous government did. There is nothing in here about a test that will define the success of this policy by whether people keep or get jobs. That goes to show just how far removed from economic reality this government is. It simply does not understand that in changing economic circumstances, whether they are good or not so good, having flexible employment arrangements and ensuring workplace cooperation is the best way to ensure employment growth. It was not a Liberal, I believe, who said that fairness starts with a job; I think that was former British Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair. This policy fails that most basic test.
We often hear from people a sentiment, with which I disagree, about our horse and buggy Constitution. This is a horse and buggy industrial relations policy. It is a throwback. As we have seen, it goes back beyond the 1996 Workplace Relations Act in so many ways, which the government will not admit. It goes back even beyond the Laurie Brereton Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993. The Australian people will not fall for the sort of Peter Mandelson-New Labour inspired spin and newspeak of this government. Just by putting ‘fair’ in front of something does not make it so. It will not work. This bill represents overreach from this government. The scoreboard of jobs growth will be the test against which it fails. Taking a modern application of George Orwell, this government’s slogan might well be that unemployment means jobs, unfair is fair and some workers—some jobs—are more equal than others.
The amendments that the coalition will move to the provisions of this bill will strengthen its ability to support jobs growth. The test for this place has to be: are we putting anyone out of work? If there is a single provision in this bill that will cost someone in Australia their job, that will affect a family. They could lose their home. That is something which we should eternally oppose.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2009-03-11,"—There are no further speakers. I rise to sum up on the Fair Work Bill 2008. If a democracy is to mean anything, this debate on the Fair Work Bill 2008 can only be judged by how it answers this basic question: will the Senate respect the overwhelming call of the Australian people given to this parliament in November 2007? The Australian people voted for the balanced workplace relations policy set out clearly in the Forward with Fairness document. This bill delivers on each and every commitment in that policy. The bill finally removes the extreme Work Choices laws that were overwhelmingly rejected by the Australian people.
The bill creates a fair and simple workplace relations system that strikes the right balance between employers and employees. The bill will bring our workplace relations system back to the centre, where Australians clearly want it to be. Consistent with the government’s commitment to cooperative workplace relations, a thorough consultation process was undertaken to assist the government in developing the bill. This included providing the committee on industrial relations—comprising unions, employers and government representatives—a thorough opportunity to examine the draft bill in detail. The government considered all feedback received as a result of these extensive processes in the course of developing the Fair Work Bill.
The final stage of the consultation process for this legislation was the recently concluded Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations inquiry. The government welcomes and supports the Senate inquiry process, which both complemented and completed the extensive consultations conducted in the development of the new laws. The government has carefully considered the Senate inquiry committee report, as well as each of the 154 detailed submissions to the committee’s inquiry.
The government has consistently indicated its willingness to consider technical amendments that are consistent with the policy that would improve the operations of the Fair Work Bill. As senators are aware, the government has recently announced its intention to make a number of technical amendments to that bill that improve the operation of the new system. The government’s amendments will improve the operation of the new system by removing uncertainty and unintended consequences while ensuring consistency with the policy mandate given to the government to implement Forward with Fairness.
However, let me state this very clearly: we are committed to implementing the Forward with Fairness policy, which was approved by the Australian people at the last election. We are not prepared to bargain away the will of the Australian people. No one stakeholder group—employer or employee—will be 100 per cent satisfied with every provision in the bill, but the government’s aim from the beginning has been to get the balance right on workplace relations. We need a stable, balanced and truly national system to meet the needs of the country in the decades to come.
I will now turn to the debate that was had over the past two days. Senators have debated the bill, obviously vigorously, and, while there has been much debate of a rhetorical nature, a few matters of concern have been identified. However, some of the claims made in the debate are quite frankly without substance or are plainly misleading and I cannot let them stand unchallenged on the public record.
One of those claims—we will call it claim 1—is that the Fair Work Bill will increase unemployment. I will first respond to claims that the Fair Work Bill will endanger job creation. There are a variety of factors that affect employment levels in our economy, but what the government is saying very clearly is that we are not immune from the global financial crisis and everything we have done has been intended to keep this nation in front and to protect jobs. But one of the things we also need to do is ensure that we do not leave employers and employees in legislative limbo and uncertainty about what the workplace relations laws of this country will be. In these difficult times we should be delivering certainty, stability, productivity and flexibility, and that is what this bill does.
Employees need to have confidence that their pay and conditions are secure, and this bill guarantees just that. The Fair Work Bill sets out a fair and balanced system that is designed to meet the country’s needs both in the good and the bad times. Businesses and employees need a fair and effective enterprise bargaining system and the support of Fair Work Australia to help them negotiate creative and flexible arrangements that can help business through the difficult times ahead so that the employees can keep their jobs. During these difficult times Australian families need to know that their basic workplace rights are secure and certain. They need the security and protection against unfair dismissal, they need a fair safety net of basic wages and employment conditions that cannot be stripped away and, if the worst happens, they need redundancy pay to tide them over. The government does not believe that providing a fair safety net for employees with basic minimum standards like redundancy pay, public holidays, rest breaks and penalty rates for weekend work will result in increased unemployment. Employers make decisions to hire employees based on a range of reasons related to the needs of sustaining and growing their businesses. This will not change under the new system.
Turning now to claim 2, which is that unfair dismissal laws cost jobs. The employment related concerns about providing proper protection against unfair dismissals are not supported by the empirical research in this area. For example, the OECD has found that there is no clear link between stricter employment protection legislation, including unfair dismissals, and employment.
We make the shape of our new unfair dismissal system crystal clear in Forward with Fairness and we believe that it strikes the right balance between providing an avenue for unfair dismissal claims and certainty to business on potential claims arising from dismissal. Requiring employees, before being able to claim unfair dismissal, to serve the minimum qualifying period of six months for large businesses and a full 12 months for small businesses balances the right of employees to have protection from unfair dismissal with the need for employers to have an adequate opportunity to determine whether or not an employee is suited to their job and to the employer’s business. Additional special arrangements will apply for small businesses, including the Small Business Fair Dismissal Code. Small business employers will be fully supported under the Fair Work Bill to make reasonable and fair decisions in managing their employees. And we make it clear in Forward with Fairness that the small business arrangements will apply to businesses with fewer than 15 employees. Senators should note that Forward with Fairness did not define a small business as 20, 25 or 50 employees. Under the Fair Work Bill good employees who have proved themselves under a full six or 12 months of service will have the right to challenge a dismissal that is harsh, unjust or unreasonable.
Looking now at claim 3, which concerns the Fair Work Bill and compulsory arbitration. Compulsory arbitration is not a feature of the new system—far from it. The focus of the new system is to encourage employees and employers to bargain in good faith and reach agreement voluntarily. This is the way that most bargaining takes place, quite frankly. Employers and unions must bargain in good faith and this means that they must meet, exchange positions and refrain from capricious or unfair conduct. But good faith bargaining does not require either side to make concessions or to make an agreement. The new system is not about delivering access to arbitration at any time that parties get into a disagreement during the bargaining process—far from it. Parties can take a tough stance in negotiations.
Workplace determinations can only be made in limited and clearly defined circumstances: for example, when industrial action is causing significant harm to the national economy or threatening the health and safety of the community; or where a protracted dispute is causing significant economic harm to the bargaining participants; or in the low-paid bargaining stream, subject to very strict criteria; or where a party has engaged in serious and sustained breaches of good faith bargaining requirements and is, quite frankly, flouting the law.
We know that numerous studies show that collective agreement making is good for business and good for employees. Bargaining allows employers and employees to examine ways to improve productivity and efficiency and make workplaces more flexible. This encourages growth in real wages and living standards through bargaining underpinned by real labour productivity growth, which of course helps to control inflation. Work Choices coincides with a poor productivity performance. Annual productivity growth averaged only 1.2 per cent between March 2006 and September 2007, compared with the annual average over the previous two decades of 2.3 per cent. This bill delivers to the Australian people what we promised them: fair bargaining and a productive workforce.
Another claim made during the debate on this bill was that low-pay bargaining will drive up costs for employers. We will keep tabs on that, claim 4. There is a clear commitment in Forward with Fairness to help low-paid employees and their employers to gain access to enterprise bargaining and the benefits it brings. We want to allow as many Australian employees and employers as possible to receive the benefits of enterprise bargaining. We know that there are people who have been left behind in sectors like cleaning, community work and security. Fair Work Australia will be able to convene conferences, help identify productivity improvements to underpin an agreement and generally guide parties through the negotiating process. This process is not about building another safety net on top of the modern award safety net; it is about helping those employers and employees who we know have had difficulty getting into a bargaining culture to generally make enterprise agreements. Agreements in this stream will be the subject of genuine negotiation and exchange, where a wage increase is given in exchange for changes in work practices that deliver productivity or improved service delivery. When bargaining fails and agreement cannot be reached for a particular employer or employers, then Fair Work Australia, in very limited circumstances, can make a workplace determination to resolve the issues in bargaining. But, in doing so, Fair Work Australia must give consideration to issues of workplace productivity and the competitive position of the employer. This framework delivers on our election commitment and, quite frankly, could only be opposed by those who are not at all distressed by the circumstances of the low paid in our community.
I will turn to another claim that has been made during the debate: the bill gives unions excessive rights in bargaining. We are now up to claim 5. Forward with Fairness outlined that we would fully respect the rights of employees to join and be represented by a union or not to do so—as they wish, quite frankly. We are implementing our policy to the letter. There are no longer union or non-union agreements. All agreements will be made directly with employees. Where 50 per cent of employees approve an agreement, the agreement is made even where a union representing some of the employees may have urged a vote against it. Employees can, of course, be represented in the bargaining process by their union or by any other person they nominate.
Another claim made in the debate: the bill opens up a union right of entry to workplaces. That is claim 6. The government outlined our right of entry commitments in detail in the Forward with Fairness policy implementation plan. We promised that our right of entry laws would strike a balance between the right of employees to be represented by their union and the right of employers to run their business. Forward with Fairness set out in considerable detail that the bill would, first, ensure that only fit and proper persons hold a right of entry permit and that permit holders understand the right to enter premises comes with significant responsibilities. We are doing just this. Second, it would ensure that there are appropriate arrangements in place to enable duly authorised permit holders to meet with those workers who are eligible and who want to meet with them. We are doing this. Third, it would allow union officials who have a right of entry permit from the Australian Industrial Registry to visit employees in three circumstances: to investigate breaches of industrial laws, awards or agreements, to hold discussions with employees who are members or are eligible to be members of the union or to investigate breaches of occupational health and safety law. The bill does all of this. On any reasonable examination, arguments that the bill does not comply with our election policy are plainly false. We make no apology for respecting the fundamental right of employees to join and be represented by a union. This means having access to advice and information from a union. No-one can be made to join the union; no-one can be made to attend a meeting. Our right of entry policy was detailed and is being implemented, and it is a policy that is essential to meet the most basic principles of freedom of association. Employees are entitled to join and be represented by their union.
Another claim, claim 7, was about inspection of nonmembers’ employment records. A significant amount of debate has occurred on the question of whether a union permit holder should be permitted to inspect employment records relating to nonmembers. Much of the debate was ill-informed and inaccurate and requires correction. Laws that ensure compliance with awards and agreements are important both for employees and for the vast majority of employers who comply with the law. Employees should not be underpaid, and employers doing the right thing by their workers should not be undercut by competitors who are not. Unions have a longstanding role, going back many decades, in ensuring compliance with awards and agreements—and this is provided for even under Work Choices. Subject to strict requirements, union permit holders are currently entitled to enter work premises in order to investigate suspected breaches of awards and agreements and to take recovery action to ensure employees receive their correct entitlements. To carry out this compliance role, unions must be able to examine relevant workplace records.
We have heard in the Senate today and yesterday wild and, quite frankly, hysterical prophecies of union officials dancing through bedrooms with photocopiers under their arms or jumping out of people’s cornflakes. Claims have been made that a union permit holder can look at every employee’s pay records, from the managing director down, to satisfy some intellectual curiosity. Let us take a reality check here. Of course under the Fair Work Bill a right to investigate breaches of the law should come with strict responsibilities, and it does. The bill retains the right of entry permit system, and strict obligations apply concerning the giving of notice to the employer and the permit holder’s conduct while on the premises.
The bill also strengthens the existing provisions by introducing for the first time the application of the Privacy Act regime to the handling of documents and information obtained under the provisions and by introducing new penalty provisions for any misuse of records. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner made a submission to the Senate committee suggesting some amendments to the bill to improve its operation. The Deputy Prime Minister has foreshadowed that the government will move amendments that fully address the issue raised by the Privacy Commissioner on how the operation of the provisions can be best improved. The amendments will include a new broad antidisclosure penalty provision which will impose heavier penalties if any information obtained in the course of right of entry is misused. Amendments will also make it clear that the right of entry for the purpose of holding discussions may only be exercised for the purpose of talking to employees and not independent contractors.
In order to correct the record I will now clearly set out the operations of provisions of the bill concerning the inspection of documents and what a union permit holder can actually do and not do under the bill. First, to enter premises the permit holder must reasonably suspect that a contravention of an award agreement or the act is occurring or has occurred and that a breach must actually affect a member of the union. Let us be very clear: the union cannot enter a workplace or look at any record unless the union reasonably suspects a breach of the law that affects one of its members. There are serious penalties if a permit holder makes any representation that he or she suspects a breach when he or she does not, or that the union has a member affected by a suspected breach when the union does not. The onus of proving that a person has a reasonable suspicion of such a breach falls on the permit holder.
Second, before seeking to enter, the permit holder must give written notice to the employer, including details of the alleged breach. The employer is able to challenge this notice to Fair Work Australia if it does not believe that the strict criteria I have outlined are satisfied. It is only once these strict requirements are met that we even get to the question of what documents can be examined by the permit holder in order to investigate the alleged breach. A permit holder is able to inspect documents directly relevant to investigating the alleged breach that affects their members in respect of which they hold a reasonable suspicion, a suspicion they carry the onus of proving and in respect of which they have given notice and particulars to the employer.

Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Hanson-Young’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2009-03-11,"—I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Political Donations and Other Measures) Bill 2008 [2009] this morning. The first thing that I will say about this is that I think it is entirely inappropriate that we are debating this matter today. In fact, I think that it is totally inappropriate that we are debating it at all prior to comprehensive electoral reform. I remind the Senate that back in March last year it was the coalition which initiated a comprehensive terms of reference to go to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which was supported by the then Democrats, the Greens, Family First and us, and opposed by the Labor Party. I am not going to go through that again because I have done that in this place ad nauseam but it was a comprehensive proposal which addressed all the matters which we believe need to be included in a comprehensive campaign finance reform. Again I put on the record that we are very, very strongly supportive of comprehensive reform. I put on the record that it was actually the coalition parties that initiated this process with the reference to the joint standing committee. I reiterate the point that it was the Australian Labor Party that opposed that. So anything that they are doing at the moment has to be seen through the prism of March 2008 and what has been done from there.
I take the government at face value—that they are committed to campaign finance reform. I assume that they also acknowledge that we are likewise. But, as the minister knows and as the chamber knows, we have objected quite passionately over a number of months—in fact nearly 12 months now—because this cherry-picked campaign finance reform is an animal that has come with many coats, initially in relation to the tax deductibility part of a bill that was introduced as part of another package and then that was withdrawn and introduced on its own. The tax deductibility question and the disclosure question are two issues that the government has chosen to pull out of comprehensive campaign finance reform for its own purposes.
I will not go through the reasons again because I am on the public record in relation to this matter. But the question has got to be: if you are convinced about comprehensive finance reform, why were we debating the tax deductibility bill previously, why would we be debating this bill today, when these measures clearly should be part of comprehensive reform?
I have got some other things to say about those who might have influence in relation to the Labor Party but it begs the question, when every commentator in this country has talked about the level of influence of unions, third parties and large corporate donors, of why those issues were not also a part of these measures. The reason that was not done was that the Labor Party views these two isolated pieces of campaign finance reform as good for them and bad for everyone else in the political process. Well, so be it. But why not just be upfront about it and say, ‘Well, we’re trying to get a couple of bits of reform through which we think will be bad for the opposition parties and good for us.’ Just say it, because we all know it is true. Just acknowledge it and say, ‘Despite that, we’re now convinced that we should have comprehensive campaign finance reform.’
I will indicate at the outset that the opposition will be supporting the government’s suite of amendments, the great bulk of which came out of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I will have more to say about that because we do indeed have some concerns about administrative burdens. Nevertheless, despite the issues in New South Wales in relation to reporting dates et cetera, which we understand both major parties are finding very difficult to manage, we are prepared to see whether it can work any better in a federal sense.
We also believe that there should be stronger penalties for infringements of the Commonwealth Electoral Act but we note that most of these electoral abuses are actually committed by the Australian Labor Party itself, such as the multiple cases of electoral fraud in Queensland which resulted in the Shepherdson inquiry, the Gino Mandarino fraudulent enrolment, the Christian Zahra fraudulent enrolment and the Wollongong council sex and bribery scandal. Indeed, when you look at what started the frenetic media attention to this long overdue requirement for campaign finance reform, it was actually the Wollongong sex and bribery scandal—the most obscene abuse of responsibility, the most obscene abuse of matters of principle, the most obscene abuse of a whole range of acts you could ever see. The Wollongong sex and bribery scandal is up there in shining lights, showing what is wrong with the system. But do we get any response to the Wollongong sex and bribery scandal in these two cherry-picked pieces of legislation? No, we do not. Do we see anything in relation to the excessive influence of the trade union movement on the political process? No, we do not.
I note with great interest, just to reinforce the point, that it is now common knowledge that the Australian Labor Party received in excess of $30 million from the trade union movement in the run-up to the last election, and, of course, if you look at the government’s so-called Fair Work Bill, guess who picks up $30 million worth of thanks? It is the union movement. What we have objected to in relation to the government’s bill is the right of unions to come in and demand access to records. If you look at all those issues which we object to, which were not in the government’s initial procrastinations in relation to their changes to industrial relations, all of them not part of the mandate, they revolve around giving to the union movement 30 million bucks worth of thankyous.
I have a lot of friends in a whole variety of places and I have been very lucky to be given some financial statements of the New South Wales branch of the AMWU—very lucky, from off the back of a truck. Under the heading ‘National Council Political Fund’, it is all neatly typed out with some nice green on it indicating the stuff I am going to talk about today; it is all there and all public. On page 3, I note the following item: affiliation fees, $401,846. Now I might be terribly wrong—and I will be publicly flogged if I am—but I would hazard a guess that that was not affiliation to the Liberal Party or affiliation to Family First, probably not even affiliation to the Greens. We know who those affiliation fees were paid to. Donations, $209,591. Again, at the risk of a public flogging, I suspect that those donations were not made to the Liberal Party, or the Greens or Family First. Election advertising, $8,120. That brings in total, in one year, overtly political expenditure to over $620,000. But the best is left till last because there is a specific line in these accounts which says: ‘Marginal seat campaign’, $150,352. I will say that again. From a leaked document from the New South Wales branch of the AMWU under ‘National Council Political Fund’ there is $150,352 in marginal seat campaigning alone for the Australian Labor Party. Quite frankly, as I have said before, who pays the piper? This is what we have seen now for some time.
—Julian McGauran pays the piper.
—Senator Conroy can jump in as much as he likes. I think he would be better employed spending a bit of time with Senator Feeney and others and perhaps trying to convince me and others that he and Senator Carr are not the bosom buddies they are alleged to be, because no-one believes that. I rather suspect that even Senator Conroy himself does not believe that, because they would be the strangest of bedfellows.
So there is $30 million going to the Australian Labor Party. It is so overtly in this document for marginal seat campaigns. You do not need to look any further than the Fair Work Bill 2008 to see that it is all coming home. It is all coming home because all of the non-mandated part of this bill just happens to be about excessive union powers and giving the rights to unions to interfere in the lives of Australian workers and their employers. This is just the $30 million square-off for the union movement’s massive financing of the Australian Labor Party in the run-up to the last election. The question is: why was this not part of some cherry-picked legislation before comprehensive campaign finance reform was addressed by this chamber and indeed the other place as part of a comprehensive piece of legislation? No-one believes that the status quo is appropriate. Everyone believes that we need to do something. The fact that it was sparked by an incident such as the Wollongong sex and bribery scandal is probably neither here nor there. But it does indicate some of the bona fides in relation to this matter.
We put again on the public record that we want to work with the government to make sure that we get something decent out of this. We have an unprecedented opportunity to make dramatic improvements to the system of electoral funding. With a broad consensus across the political system that our electoral funding system requires serious reform, substantial enhancements to the transparency and credibility of our political system are within our reach. But this bill does nothing to account for or limit the influence of trade unions—or indeed industry associations, advocacy groups or other well-funded third-party entities—on the political process. Regardless of who is in government or in opposition, the Electoral Act needs to be fair, open and neutral, as it outlasts governments and oppositions as well as political parties. It should serve as a facilitator of democracy, not as a government’s prejudicial tool.
I again ask the government, the Greens and the Independents to give this bill the opportunity to be debated when we have in front of us comprehensive legislation for campaign finance reform. I do not in my heart of hearts believe that the Greens or the Independent senators believe that it is appropriate in any measure to be debating this matter outside the context of comprehensive finance reform. We have an opportunity still to delay this bill until after that has been put on the table. It should be put on the table and we believe that there is no reason that, with appropriate levels of goodwill, we cannot collectively get a system that will make it better for the Australian community now and into the future.
I want to make a couple of other comments. The amendments that will be moved by the government—as I said earlier on—are supportive. We also have to make sure that what we do enables the system to be workable, because unworkable systems are often the systems that get abused. This is not just about a set of principles; comprehensive campaign finance reform is actually about making sure that all the dots are joined up, because when the dots are not joined up someone will join them up somewhere else. That is why we saw things like the Wollongong sex and bribery scandal, where someone got the dot and drew it elsewhere, and abused the system.
Let us work collectively in relation to this. Let us not allow the government to cherry pick parts of that reform for its own cheap political purposes. This issue is too serious to be debased by having cherry-picked legislation. I repeat my call to the Greens and Independent senators to make sure that this bill does not proceed today and is debated in the context of comprehensive reform, because in my view, quite frankly, to do otherwise would limit an enormous opportunity for this to be done in toto and not with pieces pulled into it and out of it. I end where I started: we are committed to comprehensive campaign finance reform. We are willing and anxious to work with the government and other parties in this place to ensure it, but can it please be done on the back of legitimacy? It is not legitimate to pull pieces out of campaign finance reform. If it is going to be done legitimately then let us do it in toto.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT (POLITICAL DONATIONS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008 [2009]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-03-11,"—The Greens will support the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Political Donations and Other Measures) Bill 2008 [2009]. I listened carefully to Senator Ronaldson’s plea that the legislation not be supported until we get comprehensive legislation into the parliament, but that is not the example that was set by the Howard government over the previous 12 years. In fact, piecemeal legislation which increased the ability of donors to the political system to be hidden and not identifiable was the order of the day. It is a good thing that we now have legislation that is reversing that order.
We look forward to consequent legislation in this parliament, and I hope that will be this year, to clean up the electoral processes in Australia, and that means quite massive and comprehensive changes to electoral laws. The Greens would like to see Australia going in the same direction as Canada, which effectively banned political donations—except those with a limit of $1,000 from individuals, but it banned those from corporations, unions and all the entities that Senator Ronaldson listed—back in the 1990s, following a series of corruption scandals in that country. It is a pretty sad thing that the current conservative government in Canada apparently wants to unwind that electoral system. The quid pro quo for getting rid of the corrupting influence of donations—and they are effectively utilised by the lobbyists who come into this parliament—as a lever is, I have no doubt, public funding. That is always a big matter for governments to take up, but it would improve the electoral system if we had a wholly publicly funded electoral system. It would provide a much less corruptible and much more accountable electoral system for voters.
We are in a world in which wealth is power, and that power is leveraged right around the world to buy democracies. The most insidious thing that democracies face is, effectively, a plutocracy which buys political favour and political leverage through making massive donations to political parties and individuals. It is something that we have to bring to an end. If we really believe in the fundamental principle of democracy being one person, one vote, one value, then we have to ensure that people have an equal say in a democracy. You cannot do that if millions of dollars are being passed into the political system and that ultimately means that those who have the most money have the most power. That defrauds democracy. There is a very big challenge here to stop that process. This planet is in real trouble because of the power of the wealthy elites. They have their sway not only through autocracies, and that means through political systems that have dictatorships or police state regimes, but also through democracies.
It is a massive challenge for us, a century later, to act on the fears of American President Cleveland when he saw the mounting influence that corporations were having on Washington. One has to worry about President Obama, and all the hopes of the world that go with his new presidency, as he faces 80,000 political lobbyists, backed by a huge amount of money and not least by entities like the armaments industry. They pervert and corrupt the political system and the ability of democracies to carry out the highest tenet of the inherent hope of democracy—which is to give some sense of equality and a fair go to all citizens who work and live under a democracy and whose hopes are based on the democratic system.
This legislation lowers to $1,000 the threshold for donations which have to be disclosed. The Howard government lifted it to $10,000 and, through indexation, it is now at over $10,500. As we know, people could donate to each of the state and federal entities and get away with donating more than $100,000 to political parties without it being made public. The new threshold will put an end to that and the Greens support it. The legislation removes the loophole for donation splitting so that donations to political parties have to be put forward as having been made to a single entity and not eight or 10 as I just described. It would make foreign donations unlawful. I do not think there is anybody in this place who wants to oppose that. The bill also introduces new offences to the reporting and disclosure regime and increases the penalties for those offences. It tightens up public disclosure and the framework for lodging returns and disclosing gifts and expenditure by donors, candidates, political parties, associated entities and third parties.
Then there is something you have to put a lot of thought into while we have a system supported by donations, and that is anonymous donations. The Greens supported this amendment by the government, though it does impose quite onerous accounting mechanisms. The smaller parties and Independents standing for electoral office will know that you depend on a lot of donations. If you are going to run a campaign, you have to get money. There is not the great wherewithal of the big parties, with huge corporate and union donations. It depends on raising money from the public and on lots of little gifts coming in. We saw Obama take the path of appealing to the public rather than to the big corporate sector, and his campaign was massively based upon $5, $10, $20 or $100 donations. Here a limit of $50 has been set before the donors must be revealed. The fundraisers—people taking around the bucket, for example, at a public meeting—must take responsibility for ensuring that no-one attempts to donate more than $50 or they risk strong penalties. At fundraising dinners, the organisers must ensure that the amount raised does not exceed a donation of $50 multiplied by the number of people present. If you have 1,000 people, you must make sure that there is not more than $50,000 raised or obviously you are infringing upon the restriction of $50 per person without the donations being specified. That is a rule that will need to go out. You can see the difficulties for people handing around the bucket at public meetings or at some sort of fundraising concert in making sure that nobody puts $100 in the bucket. It is going to be interesting to see how well that is governed.
Then there is the claims based funding framework for public electoral funding. The Greens understand the purpose of the measure and support its intention, which is to address the problem of profiteering, which can occur under the current system. However, the claims based system, and, in particular, the time frame—that is, you can only claim public funding for election expenditure after the writs are issued and during the actual election period—is very restrictive for smaller parties in particular. The big parties can claim the full limit of their public expenditure by simply putting their TV advertising bills in and saying: ‘Pay for this. Out of our own private funding, we will pay for all the administration.’ For the smaller parties and Independents, that is not the case. They do not have massive media advertising campaigns, because they cannot afford them. But they do have comparatively large administrative expenses. They have to have offices, pay for office equipment and employ people during campaigning times. This will prohibit claims being made for parties that set up an office, employ somebody and get in computers and phones before the writs are issued for an election. It is quite obvious that we are going to have an election within the next 18 months—those are the electoral rules in this country—but if a political party moves now to set up an office and get the bones of a campaign going, and all parties know that you need to do that not when the writs are issued but months or years out, the smaller political parties will not be able to claim that expenditure. It does not affect the big parties, because, as I said, they will simply put in their maximum claim with their media advertising receipts, but it will affect the smaller parties.
I move the following second reading amendment:
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate calls on the Government to introduce truth in advertising measures in relation to elections so that voters are not deceived”.
I am very keen that we do not permit the current system, whereby people can attack candidates or parties at election time using lies and deception, to continue. There used to be a truth filter. If you wanted to put an ad on TV 10 years ago, that ad had to go to the regulatory authority set up by the private networks and you had to be able to show that it was truthful. I know that, because there were very contentious forestry issues in Tasmania. Every time the Greens put up an ad talking about the destruction of forests that was going to occur if the Labor or Liberal parties were elected—and that is still going on—we would have some objection from the logging industry. We had to be able to show that the claims were true and that the area that was flattened and that the smoke rising from the previous life-filled rainforest was, in fact, dinkum. We could do that.
But that has been removed. There is no longer any arbiter. Senator Fielding’s Family First party ran a series of ads the election before last claiming that Senator Brown—that is me—wanted to give drugs to children. That was an outright lie—it was defamation—and it was played hundreds of times across television networks in this country. Effectively, there was nothing I could do about it. But I have broad shoulders, and I have tackled Senator Fielding on that in private since then. He has made no correction, and the onus is on him to accept or reject that. However, what is wrong is that electors are deceived by such advertising on the way to the ballot box. If a democracy is going to be healthy, it has to ensure that the advertising that informs people about the competing claims is true. The Greens want to see in the more comprehensive legislation coming down the line—and I hope it will be this year, Senator Ronaldson, so that we can look at it and pass it into law before the next election—the Electoral Commission, or a body set up under the aegis of the Electoral Commission, vet contentious advertising to make sure that it is true. Surely that is fundamental if you are going to have a fair dinkum and honest political campaign.
There is a matter at hand that I address in the time left to me: the article in today’s Mercury under the headline ‘Labor smear bid backfires’. This is by Sue Neales, chief reporter. Yesterday in the state parliament, the Attorney-General, the chief law officer of Tasmania, made a series of allegations about a donation to the Greens from some very decent people that I know in New South Wales—Susie Russell and Greg Hall—who have been forest campaigners for decades. They are very committed to the protection of forests and have been successful in helping, for example, the World Heritage rainforest areas of northern New South Wales to be protected. They made donations to the Tasmanian Greens because of the campaign against the Gunns pulp mill, which would, were it to be built, log some 200,000 hectares of Tasmanian forests full of wildlife.
These are good people who are motivated and see that, if they can help protect forests elsewhere, other than in their own neighbourhood, they would do that; but, according to the Attorney-General of Tasmania, their donations to the Greens at the last election left ‘serious and unanswered questions’. This is a $45,000 donation. Amongst the claims were that Ms Russell was an employee of Ian Cohen, the upper house MLC in New South Wales—she had been till 2003 but has not been since then, so that claim was true—and that the address given on the donation disclosure form was for a vacant bush block. It happens to be the home address of these two very fine people in northern New South Wales. Ms Giddings made implications as to whether the names of the real donors had been disguised, and yet they are there on the donation forms.
I have things to say about this. First, yes, let us get rid of private donations—but you cannot expect any political party to survive without them, and under our current system good people will be open in putting forward the money they can get. Apparently this money from Susie Russell and Greg Hall came from an inheritance. Most people would think about spending that money on themselves. They put forward what for individuals is a large amount of money to help save Tasmania’s forests. They put it into the public good out of their own private domain and, as a result, the chief law officer ran a smear campaign through the parliament yesterday, apparently on the basis that if you throw enough mud some will stick. I would have thought much better of the Deputy Premier of Tasmania; I held her in higher regard than this. It was a cowardly thing to do, and it is ultimately counted against the chief law officer of Tasmania. What a sad reflection it is that it turns out that Labor Party operatives had spent some time digging all this up to put falsely before the parliament a claim against two very fine people who should never have been subjected to that sort of false vilification by an Attorney-General in Tasmania—or anywhere else in a democratic system. Yesterday was a pretty sad day for the Tasmanian government and the Tasmanian Labor Party.
By the way, the Tasmanian Greens leader, Nick McKim, was hit with that without warning and did a remarkably fine job of defending these people. I know them; I do not know whether Nick McKim knows them, but I hope one day he gets to meet them. I rang Ms Russell this morning, and she has invited me to come and stay at their place, because they bought a couple of photographs out of an exhibition I had in Hobart over the weekend—let me disclose that right away. I had great pleasure telling her I would love to come and stay at her place. I think they are fantastic people who do not deserve the treatment that Lara Giddings dished out yesterday.
That said, I am glad this legislation is here. It is a big step forward. I hope the opposition will reconsider any potential for opposing it, because it is a step forward. It may be cherry picking, but they are important cherries. I look forward to the more comprehensive legislation. Finally, I pay tribute to Senator John Faulkner. He is driving a review of our electoral laws, which do need fixing up. That is tough. There will be huge debate within all political parties—I have no doubt there will be within his party, as there is within the Greens and as there will be everywhere—about the pros and cons of any move to change the electoral system, but it must be changed. He has the courage and tenacity to make that change. I appreciate that. He is the right person to be doing this, and I wish him great success.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT (POLITICAL DONATIONS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008 [2009]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2009-03-11,"—Today I rise in support of the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Political Donations and Other Measures) Bill 2008 [2009]. This bill is part of a series of Rudd government measures that are designed to clean up government in this country. We cannot have clean government unless we have a strong and healthy democracy, and we cannot have a strong and healthy democracy unless we protect the integrity of the Australian electoral system. We cannot protect the integrity of the Australian electoral system without robust and transparent public funding for election candidates and robust and transparent regulation of political donations. Our commitment to better regulation of public funding and private donations was made crystal clear prior to the last election. The government has put forward these objectives, and they will be furthered in the bill that we have before us today. However, today I would like to focus my comments specifically on political donations. Perhaps the most significant of the reforms before us is our proposal to reverse the Howard government’s cynical attempt to hide donations and thus undermine the integrity of the electoral process by lifting the disclosure threshold from $1,500 to $10,000 and then indexing the threshold. On this point, the policy Labor took to the election could not have been clearer:
Labor supports public transparency of political donations. Labor will therefore reverse the outrageous changes instituted by the Howard Government to limit public disclosure of political donations. Labor will not support millions of dollars being hidden from public scrutiny.
Indeed, this policy cemented Labor’s position in relation to the Howard government’s mistitled Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Electoral Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2006, which raised the disclosure threshold. In this place, my colleague Senator Carr was categorical in his rejection of the coalition’s bill, stating that it should be rejected out of hand. The dissenting report on the bill by Labor members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters stated the reasons for our objection. As the dissenting report outlined, the underlying principle behind our opposition to the Howard government’s bill was that the public has a right to know who is donating to political parties. Support for this principle entails support for all practicable measures that further it. It is clearly possible for political donations of $1,000 or more to be disclosed. It may be found inconvenient by some parties and candidates to have to disclose all donations above this threshold, but it is not impractical. Prior to 2006, the disclosure threshold was $1,500, and this did not prove impractical. I know—I have done the paperwork. In addition, most other states and territories, including my own state of WA, have similar thresholds, and these do not prove impractical.
The simple fact is that the Howard government did not want to be embarrassed by its donors for fear of the political consequences and it did not want its donors embarrassed by their donations for fear that they would stop donating. So the Howard government was prepared to sacrifice the principle that the public has a right to know who is donating to political parties to save embarrassment all round. The fact that the existing act allowed donors to donate to more than one branch of a political party provided each individual donation was under the threshold meant that an individual could contribute tens of thousands of dollars to a political party without being identified. Once again, there is no need for this loophole, and I am delighted that the Rudd government aims to close it via this bill.
Indexing the threshold also had an obvious, immediate and practical impact on disclosure—namely, it became harder for those making and receiving donations to be sure what the threshold was. Every year the threshold changed when indexation was applied, and after the first year it was no longer a round figure. To meet their obligations under the act, those collecting donations, many of them volunteers, must keep in mind this very difficult to recall threshold level—a threshold level that, what is more, keeps changing. Furthermore, potential donors, who have a right to know whether or not their donations are going to be made public, must be made aware of this difficult to recall and frequently changing figure. Once again, this is directly contrary to the principle that, when it comes to political donations, the public’s right to know should be protected by taking practical steps to facilitate disclosure.
I have worked on returns under both the Howard government’s system and the previous system and, from my point of view, it is much easier to have a transparent relationship with campaign donors—one where they are clear in their expectation that their donation will be disclosed and fundraisers are not obliged to have the conversation with them, ‘If you donate this much you are over and this much you are under.’ Such conversations are, frankly, better avoided. They are easier to avoid when the threshold is a fixed, round and low figure. So I say the expectation of disclosure from the outset is a good thing. Furthermore, having people split up donations to avoid disclosure makes a mockery of disclosure rules. Any substantial donor that does not want to be on the public record should not be making a donation.
Once again, I am delighted that the bill before us will remedy the Howard government’s defective approach to this issue. The Howard government’s arguments in support of raising and indexing the threshold were weak indeed. The Liberals argued that the old, low, flat threshold of $1,500 discouraged donations from small businesses and ‘ordinary individuals’. Yet these are the very donors likely to be put off by the confusion caused by indexation. The Liberals also argued that 90 per cent of donations received would still be disclosed under the new regime. This argument was based on the total amount of funds received and not on the number of donors. It was calculated to present a reassuring picture to the public of the impact of the changes. However, the public wants to know who all of a party’s significant contributors are, not just who contributed the largest amounts. Recent figures released by the AEC on donations have confirmed that, under the Howard government’s new threshold, the number of donor returns has plummeted.
Finally, the Liberals argued that $10,000 was really not enough to buy political influence. With respect, that is not something politicians should be judging. We all need to acknowledge that we have a potential conflict of interest here. It is far better to set the threshold as low as is practically possible and then let the public decide whether or not a donation is sufficiently large as to warrant concern regarding undue influence.
Once again the Liberals seem to be missing the point on these issues. They seem to be missing the very principle at stake—one hesitates to say, perhaps deliberately. So let me repeat it: when it comes to political donations, as far as is practicable, the public has a right to know. If the Liberals’ arguments in favour of raising and indexing the threshold are weak, the opposition’s arguments against this current bill are no more credible. The Liberals argue that Labor members are hypocrites in supporting this legislation because it seeks to ban overseas donations and the ALP has accepted overseas donations. Yes, like many branches of the Liberal Party, some branches of the ALP have received overseas donations. But the opposition raise a completely specious argument. It is a red herring. Just because a team plays by the existing rules does not mean that those rules are ideal. Nor does it mean that a team cannot credibly argue in favour of reforms to the rules to make the rules fairer. It is ridiculous to say that we have somehow ‘accepted’ existing laws by working within them and therefore we should not argue for reform. Senator Bob Brown and I agree on this point. That argument could be used against any reform of any law.
The opposition also argues that Labor members are not serious about campaign finance reform because Labor relies on union donations. Again, yes, Labor receives union donations and indeed affiliation fees. It also receives corporate donations, as does the Liberal Party. And, yes, Labor benefited from the union movement’s Your Rights at Work campaign, just as the Liberal Party stood to benefit from campaigns by big business in favour of Work Choices. In fact, returns show that the National Business Action Fund spent $13.2 million in political expenditure in 2007-08 and the Business Council spent $2.3 million. The fact is that the Australian public simply was not convinced by your arguments in favour of Work Choices. Why don’t you accept the fact that you fought a fair fight and you lost? Again, this is just a red herring. The proposed changes will affect union and corporate donations equally. The only difference is that the Liberal Party does not support these changes and the Labor Party do—because we are serious about campaign finance reform and the Liberal Party is not.
After this bill was introduced in May last year the opposition endeavoured to delay its passage by 12 months by sending it to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for report in June this year. The stated justification for this? The Rudd government’s own green paper on electoral reform. The Liberals argued the bill should be delayed, that it should be sent off to a committee until the green paper process was complete. Indeed, Senator Ronaldson was arguing this just now. Never mind that the green paper process is designed to look at reform of political donations, funding and expenditure from all angles and to consider the options for electoral reform both in the short term and in the long term. Never mind that the bill before us is designed to fix a significant and very specific set of problems created by the coalition’s recent changes; it is not about implementing a wide-ranging reform program. Never mind that not being able to implement a perfect system now is no excuse for not repairing obvious and damaging holes in the existing system immediately. And never mind either that the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters had already canvassed most of the issues pertaining to donation and disclosure during its previous inquiry into the Howard government’s changes to the threshold.
It is little wonder that when the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters called for submissions on the bill before us, only one stakeholder other than the Liberal Party responded—and they supported the bill. The few, relatively minor issues arising from the committee’s report have been addressed by the government’s own proposed amendments. As for submissions to the green paper process, the deadline for submissions on donations funding and expenditure was the 23rd of last month. Forty-nine submissions were received from organisations and individuals. As expected they put forward a wide range of possible options for future reform in this area, most of which went beyond the scope of the bill we have before us today. Where submissions did touch specifically on proposals that pertain to this bill, the response was generally positive—although, as expected, many of those submitters expressed their hope that this bill will represent the beginning and not the end of a much needed reform process. The government agrees with that sentiment. But it is not an argument against this bill; it is an argument in support of further reform.
I would like to sum up by using the words of Professor George Williams of the Centre for Public Law at the University of New South Wales. He concluded his submission to the green paper process:
In regard to the reforms already proposed, I strongly support the measures set out in the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Political and Other Measures) Bill 2008.
These measures are essential reforms that should help pave the way for larger reforms to bring about a fairer electoral system in Australia.
This bill is one step in an ongoing process to help strengthen Australia’s democracy. I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT (POLITICAL DONATIONS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008 [2009]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2009-03-11,"—I rise on this occasion in the Senate to speak on the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Political Donations and Other Measures) Bill 2008 [2009]. We are a proud nation blessed with a democratic system of government, a system that allows all voters to express their wish without fear of retribution. Many nations throughout the world strive to achieve the freedom we have in terms of the right to free speech and the right to contribute to electing a government to rule their land. The concept of democracy allows for the formation of political parties and for their respective members and other Australian citizens to contribute to the process. This, however, comes with responsibilities and the need for transparency in the eyes of the Australian public to ensure that the funding for political parties is an open process and not secretive or deceptive—hence the need for these amendments. This bill is needed because of another example of the cynical political exercise of the former Liberal Howard government.
Over many years, there has been criticism from the Australian population regarding the amount of money donated and spent during election campaigns. In order to ensure that this process is open and transparent, certain standards are necessary to ensure that the declaration and reporting of donations is honest and fair. The Australian population deserve to know where donations have been received from, be it from public or private sources. As many Australians are also shareholders in Australian companies, they also have a right as shareholders to know whether the company concerned has donated to a political party.
The bill endeavours to ensure that the Commonwealth Electoral Act is respected as a means to maintain transparency, accountability and integrity in the eyes of the Australian population. The proposed amendment bill will come into effect from 1 July 2009. The bill has several main features. It is proposed that the donation disclosure threshold be reduced to a flat rate of $1,000. Presently, that threshold stands at $10,900—$10,000 plus CPI. The threshold previously stood at $1,500. However, that was lifted to the $10,000 level by the previous Liberal government, without explanation. It can only be assumed that this was done to hide away small donations from the eyes of the public, thus thwarting fair review and discussion by them.
Donations made to different state branches of a political party should be accumulated to determine the true amount being donated by that person or organisation. This will prevent the situation of persons or organisations splitting their donation to the non-declarable amount and then donating to several branches, thus negating the need for declaration and reporting. These actions can only be seen as a measure to avoid the existing requirements of the act. This action also denies the Australian public the opportunity to see the true value of donations from these sources as they are omitted from the reporting radar. This is why I have been cynical in some of my previous comments about the actions of the former Liberal government.
Under the existing legislation, it would be possible for donors to contribute almost $100,000 by splitting their donation amongst state and territory branches without having to declare them. I believe that the majority of the Australian public would view this action as dishonest and a means to conceal the true value of the donation. It is an example of utilising loopholes within the law to achieve a solution that is not in the essence or spirit of the existing law. The purpose of the bill is to provide valuable information to the Australian population for their own information and consideration. This type of action does not display the honest and accountable behaviour the Australian people deserve.
Presently, political parties have up to 20 weeks from an election date to meet reporting obligations. It is proposed that this period be reduced to eight weeks. This change aims to ensure that the Australian public receive more timely information for perusal and consideration. Access to up-to-date information is essential for the many decisions we make in our lives, and this case is no exception. Potential investors may wish to know whether an organisation in which they intend to invest their valuable resources has been associated with a political party. This information should be easy to find and in a format that is easy to understand. This proposed change to the act ensures that it is also available to be considered.
The existing act requires ‘donors, political parties, associated entities and people who have incurred electoral expenditure to furnish returns within eight weeks of the end of the six monthly reporting periods’. At present, donors, political parties and associated entities and people are required to report annually, and this can be done up to 20 weeks after the end of the financial year. The current guidelines meant that the reporting from the 2007 federal election needed to be submitted by 2 February 2009—that is, 14 months after the date of the election. This does not provide timely information for decision making to the Australian public and other key stakeholders.
The bill seeks to ban donations from overseas. This area can be broken into several aspects, each requiring consideration. The banning of donations from overseas seeks to ensure that all parties and candidates commence campaigning on a level playing field. In Australia’s quest to be seen as a fair and just nation, all candidates should have access to the same level of support. Whilst this in reality is not the case, donations from overseas could significantly distort the final outcome of campaigning during the intense time leading up to a federal election.
The Australian public are hungry for information to enable them to vote in the knowledge that they are selecting the party and candidate who will best serve them. Should, for example, overseas donations enable the disproportionate advertising of a particular party’s policies, then the information the voter may receive could be distorted in terms of quantity and quality. It could also be argued that Australians would expect that funds for political expenditure be generated from their own economy and not brought in from overseas. Overseas donors, no matter how good their intentions may be, should not have the ability to give any party an advantage over another, especially given that a party’s ability to ultimately form government could be affected.
This change seeks to bring Australia into line with other countries—for example, the United States—where overseas donations are unlawful. There have been cases where overseas donations have been received by associated entities and other third parties purely for the purpose of incurring political expenditure. Whilst I acknowledge that several of the major parties received overseas donations—including the Labor Party, as was declared in the returns released on Monday, 2 February—the Rudd Labor government wants to put an end to this practice. At the appropriate time, it would be enlightening to find out where the opposition now stands on this matter.
A further change included in the bill is the requirement that public funding be genuinely associated with campaign expenditure and genuinely incurred during the period of an election campaign. This could be defined as the period from the issuing of the writs to the close of polls. The inadequacy in the existing law has resulted in some political parties and candidates making a profit from public funding. This unfair practice would be frowned upon by the community and would be seen as a rort. Given that public funding is derived from taxpayers, the public have a legitimate expectation that it be expended on genuine campaigning costs associated with the election. They would also expect that funding be provided only to the extent that it covered the actual cost of running the campaign. With good reason, the Australian people expect sound financial management of the funds to which they have contributed through taxes from their hard-earned income.
This bill also introduces changes to the offences and the levels of penalties under the existing act. Some of the new offences cover areas such as failing to lodge returns, lodging incomplete returns and providing false or misleading information for the purpose of increasing the level of public election funding. The current penalties have remained unchanged since 1983 and over time have become an inadequate deterrent against not meeting the current requirements of the act. In addition, the current penalties no longer reflect the magnitude and seriousness of the offences. As Australians are expected to be honest with the submission of their tax returns and associated income declaration and expense claims, a corresponding standard is being placed on political parties and candidates to ensure the same level of honesty and integrity is maintained. The Australian public deserve nothing less.
The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters report delivered in October 2008 recommended several amendments. One of these was the issue of anonymous donations and whether or not they could be accepted. The committee recommended that some small, low-scale, anonymous donations be allowed and this recommendation has been accepted by the government. Anonymous donations of an amount up to $50 may now be received at public fundraising activities such as fetes and street stalls or at private fundraising events such as trivia nights, barbeques and dinners. Various records are required to be maintained for provision to the Australian Electoral Commission for these types of events. These include the nature of the event, the total number of attendees, the total amount of the donations collected and details regarding the personnel collecting the money. It will also be an offence to knowingly create or keep misleading or false records of these facts.
An additional amendment has been proposed to ensure that third parties cannot receive anonymous donations purely for the purpose of avoiding the existing reporting requirements, yet it will allow the recipient to incur expenditure directly related to an election campaign. Organisations that incur particular types of political expenditure above the threshold level in a reporting period will be required to declare anonymous donations targeted towards the purposes of conducting a political campaign.
A further aspect of debate has been the element that may be legitimately included as political expenditure for the purpose of claiming public funding. This was the other main recommendation of the committee, and the government has since approved it. There are several additional approved expenditures that are now able to be offset by public funding. The first is the rental cost of premises dedicated solely to the running of the campaign. This may be a commercial office or a shop located in a major shopping centre or strip. The location of a campaign office or shop can be crucial to increasing public awareness of candidates and the party and policies they are supporting. A constituent may feel more comfortable asking a question in a friendly, campaign environment rather than approaching the office of a local member of parliament. The second is the employment cost of hiring staff who are dedicated to working on the campaign. This may include people with media and public relations skills, secretarial skills, project management skills and general organisational skills. Campaigns as we all know are extremely busy times, usually with tight time frames and much work to be completed. The ability to hire staff with professional skills allows the campaign to run more smoothly whilst providing a better service to constituents and more effective publicity throughout the electorate.
The third is the provision of office equipment, whether by purchase, hire or lease. As each of the senators in this chamber would be aware it is a necessity that the campaign office be able to produce local media publications, constituent brochures, information leaflets, policy fact sheets, letters and a myriad of other material for distribution to their electorates. The timely production and distribution of these items is critical in providing information to the voting public, who wish to make the best informed choice of a member for their respective electorates. Reliable office equipment is essential for the sound operation of any office, particularly during times of high stress levels such as election campaigns. As is the case where the government is providing public money for other purposes, the Australian people should expect nothing less than transparency, integrity and accountability when providing public funds for the purpose of electoral campaigning.
In summary, the general public have a right to know where their contribution, through taxes to the government, is being directed and how it is being expended and, in addition, they have a right to information regarding the amount and the source of donations. I reiterate that this information is also of more value if it is provided to stakeholders in a more timely manner, hence the changes to the reporting period time lines. Australia is a great nation with a fair system of government. The strengthening of laws in regard to the declaration and reporting of political donations can only serve to provide a better level of information to the Australian people. I would like to commend Minister Faulkner for his leadership in this very important area and I commend this bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT (POLITICAL DONATIONS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008 [2009]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-03-11,"—I can indicate that I will be supporting the second reading of the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Political Donations and Other Measures) Bill 2008 [2009] and am quite supportive of the measures contained in it. I acknowledge the concerns of the coalition: they say that it is a piecemeal approach and that we should wait until the more significant, comprehensive changes are dealt with. Whilst I understand that position, I think it is preferable to deal with the issues contained in this bill now. I note that it is the intention of the government to bring in legislation in the coming months and I look forward to this matter being dealt with by no later than the end of this year.
I am on the record as being a strong supporter of electoral finance reform. Amongst my proposals on this to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I suggested that there ought to be a mechanism in place so you could have continuous online disclosure of donations. I think that is the preferred course. It gives a level of transparency, particularly in the course of an election campaign, when I think the public ought to know who is donating what and in what amounts. That is quite important. I also think that public funding should be linked to expenditure and having restrictions on donations.
I have spoken publicly about the need for sensible approaches to disclosure and tax exemption for political donations to candidates, Independent members and parties. That is why I support the Greens amendments, proposed by Senator Ludlam, for a $1,500 ceiling for tax deductibility but that it would only apply to individuals and it was not appropriate for it to apply to corporations. Political donation schemes need to be transparent and they must be structured in such a way that they foster democracy. They should not be an avenue to give incumbents and political parties an unfair advantage, nor should they be a mechanism for donors to exert undue influence on decision making.
Can I indicate in relation to the issue of donations at the last election that I offered, after getting advice from senior counsel, a moneyback guarantee to donors so that they would receive a proportion of their donations back as a proportion of the level of federal funding I received. I did in fact refund a significant amount of money to donors in accordance with that guarantee. Some did not want their money back, and that was used to run a skeleton office from the time of the election to the time I started in this place. I think that is important. I also think it is important to address the concern about rorts with respect to some candidates whose campaigns may have cost them next to nothing but who then pocket the windfall. That is inappropriate, and I welcome the reforms with respect to avoiding those windfall payments.
In relation to foreign donations and gifts from foreign companies, I think it is appropriate that those donations be excluded. I note that in other jurisdictions such as the United States that is banned. The provision relating to more frequent disclosure—from 15 weeks to a period of eight weeks after polling day—is appropriate, as is the requirement for disclosure twice a year. You often get the situation where people do not know who has made a donation for 15 months or thereabouts, depending on when the election was held, because of the time lags involved. I think that is inappropriate. I look forward to discussing with the government the possibility of having more continuous disclosure mechanisms.
I believe we need to get on with these particular amendments, which I welcome, but we also need to look at the big picture in terms of comprehensive reforms. Even Senator Faulkner’s critics would acknowledge that he has been very genuine and has put in an enormous amount of work on reforming electoral laws in this country on donations and funding, and that is welcome. I think our current laws are inadequate. This is one step that will make a difference, and that is appropriate. I do not want us to go further down the path of the United States, where you have the best democracy that money can buy. The enormous amounts of money that are involved in US election campaigns, even for Senate or congressional races, are just mind-boggling. We need to have a good hard look at that, otherwise only the very wealthy will be able to run. We also need to look at the issue of public funding and donations in the context that if you take public funding you then elect to be circumscribed in the level of donations you receive, both the quantum of donations overall and the individual donations. I do not think you should have your snout in both troughs, so to speak, in terms of public funding and non-public funding from private or other sources.
With those few words, I indicate my support for the second reading of this bill. I look forward to the committee stage. I am also looking forward to further and comprehensive reform of electoral funding and disclosure laws in the coming months.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT (POLITICAL DONATIONS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008 [2009]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2009-03-11,"—Australia is often described by people as ‘the lucky country’. Unlike many other nations, since Federation the Australian people have known only one form of government—democracy. Even though there are plenty of countries around the world that are democratic, our democracy is special. Just like anything special in life, we need to protect it from harm’s way and make sure that it is safe and sound. That is why we have laws regulating how democracy works. It is too important to be left to operate without boundaries or controls. Power is vested in political parties, and these same parties are responsible for setting the rules for themselves. This makes it all the more important that, as self-regulators, we do everything we can to retain the public’s trust. The Australian people place a lot of trust in their elected representatives and we owe it to them to demonstrate the principles of responsible government.
A vibrant democracy is a democracy where people have confidence in the system. It is a democracy which is free from corruption. That is why I joined the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission. Rooting out corruption is something I feel very passionate about. I have always taken a strong stand on this issue because, for me, it is black and white; there can be no grey. Corruption must be exposed, no matter what shape or form it comes in.
One of the biggest opportunities for corruption arises under public funding for federal election campaigns. Without proper controls it can easily turn into a set of kickbacks for the major political parties. Public funding of federal election campaigns began for a legitimate reason: to provide for the reimbursement of legitimate campaign expenses—and fair enough. The key word here, of course, is ‘legitimate’. But since this legislation was introduced in 1984, it has been rife with rorting, rife to the degree that public funding of federal election campaigns has skyrocketed by more than 55 per cent over the last four elections. In real terms that means that public funding for the major political parties has spiralled. It was $28 million of public funding—and that was excessive enough—but it has jumped to an obscene $43 million of public funding for election campaign spending. That is $43 million of hard-earned taxes paid by ordinary Australians that is spent by political parties to brag about themselves and what they have done and what they are going to do. It is all about them.
Times are enormously tough for so many in Australia and our leaders are telling us to expect tough times to continue. We have even heard the grim news from one of the Rudd government ministers that no job is safe. So how can political parties justify taking that money given to them by hardworking Australians and then excessively spending that money to tell those same Australians how fantastic their political parties are? If political parties want to spend huge amounts on election campaigns they can dig into their own pockets and get their hands out of the public purse. Australian families should not be expected to fund excessive spending by the major political parties. We are sick and tired of being bombarded with excessive TV ads every night and having our letterboxes stuffed full of excessive campaign mail during every election especially when we end up paying for it—that is, taxpayers are paying for it.
The government’s Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Political Donations and Other Measures) Bill 2008 [2009] fails dismally to address this rorting. Labor has only proposed to limit public funding of political parties to actual campaign expenses. This will stop profiteering but will do nothing to rein in the excessive campaign spending. That is why Family First is moving to cap the amount that each major political party can claim from the public to fund their election campaign to a maximum of $10 million.
Let us be real: $10 million is more than enough for any one political party to spend in each election. Having this cap of $10 million will save the taxpayers over $20 million per election. So by capping how much each political party can claim to be funded by taxpayers to $10 million, this will result in stopping political parties rorting the system and will save taxpayers $20 million per election. This saved $20 million could be spent on giving a fairer go to veterans and pensioners and giving more funds to hospitals and schools. All Australians would agree it would be better to spend the $20 million on these services rather than seeing it spent on politicians telling us again and again how good they are. Let us stop the real political rort and stop political parties from spending excessive amounts on the election at taxpayers’ expense. Ten million dollars is enough money for that. Let us use the rest for something much more important.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT (POLITICAL DONATIONS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008 [2009]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2009-03-11,"—I thank all those senators who have contributed to the debate on this important piece of legislation, the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Political Donations and Other Measures) Bill 2008 [2009]. In March last year, the Prime Minister told the 7.30 Report that the ‘time has well and truly come for Australia to have comprehensive campaign finance reform’. This bill is the start of the process.
The first group of measures to start this process concerns the disclosure threshold and reporting periods. This bill will reduce the disclosure threshold from the current CPI indexed amount of $10,900 to a non-indexed amount of $1,000. This will restore proper public scrutiny to donations of this size. The bill will improve transparency in the funding and disclosure regime by requiring participants in the electoral process to report every six months rather than every 12 months.
The bill will also provide consistency by reducing the deadline when the participants in the political process have to lodge disclosure returns with the AEC to a consistent period of eight weeks. This measure will replace the haphazard deadlines currently in the Electoral Act which range from 15 weeks, 16 weeks or 20 weeks, depending on the person or the entity.
To ensure that the new $1,000 disclosure threshold is not avoided by a person giving multiple amounts below the threshold to various branches or divisions of the same political party, the bill will treat donations to different branches of a political party as if the donations were given to the same political party.
The second group of measures concern from whom donations may be received. The bill prohibits the receipt of a gift of foreign property or an anonymous gift outright for some people and entities while for other people and entities it will be unlawful to receive a gift of foreign property or an anonymous gift if that gift is used for political expenditure.
In response to a recommendation from the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, the government’s amendments will allow low-level anonymous donations—that is, anonymous donations of $50 or less—to continue where they are received through fundraising activities or events.
Finally, the bill seeks to prevent the possibility that some candidates and other groups may obtain a windfall payment of election funding by tying electoral funding to the actual electoral expenditure incurred. Again, in response to a recommendation from JSCEM the government has expanded the definition of ‘campaign expenditure’ to ensure that it does not favour one form of campaigning over another.
As I have outlined, the bill contains urgent measures to address critical weaknesses in the Commonwealth Electoral Act relating to the funding and disclosure regime. I provided details of these measures as long ago as 28 March last year. These measures are very critical and important reforms, although small in number, and they are targeted to deliver a more transparent and accountable electoral system in this country.
In terms of the second reading amendment that Senator Bob Brown has moved on behalf of the Australian Greens, I acknowledge the interest that has been consistently demonstrated by Senator Brown in addressing issues about our electoral system. I acknowledge also Senator Brown’s and the Greens’ interest in this particular issue over a long period of time. It is also true to say that the concept of truth in advertising has had a long and complicated history. Indeed, previous reports of JSCEM have identified the difficulties of legislating in this area and have argued that voters remain the most appropriate arbiters of the worth of political claims that are made. That is just one of the reasons the government does not support this amendment at this time. I do acknowledge, as I think senators would expect me to, that this is an issue which warrants further and detailed consideration for this reason: the question of truth in advertising is being examined as part of the second green paper on electoral reform, which will be released later this year.
I commend to the Senate the government’s view that the green paper process—in other words, considering this issue as part of a raft of broader issues surrounding the campaign process and then having these issues subject to consultation with the public, the states and territories, political parties and others involved in the political process as well as other interested people—really is the best way forward to deal with this important issue. I can indicate to Senator Brown, the Australian Greens and of course to the Senate that the government will examine the question of truth in advertising in that green paper process. As I indicated earlier in my contribution, the government does believe that this bill is a critically important first step in the electoral reform process and I have much pleasure in commending the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT (POLITICAL DONATIONS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008 [2009]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2009-03-11,"—by leave—The opposition fully understands the principle behind Senator Bob Brown’s comments. It is potentially an extremely difficult area and it is probably something better dealt with in the fullness of time as opposed to through this very simple amendment. The opposition does not support Senator Brown’s amendment, although we do support the principles that underpin his amendment.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2009-03-11,"—I rise to indicate that the coalition will be supporting the Tax Laws Amendment (Taxation of Financial Arrangements) Bill 2008. This bill clarifies the tax treatment of financial arrangements such as futures, options and forward contracts which have been developed over the last two decades. This bill is the final part of the former coalition government’s taxation reforms into financial arrangements. The reforms were modelled in four stages. Stages 1 and 2 were legislated under the coalition government. Legislation for stages 3 and 4 was introduced by the coalition government but lapsed due to the 2007 election.
The bill provides certainty on the tax treatment of financial arrangements. Currently the tax treatment of financial arrangements is based on the legal definition rather than the economic reality of the financial arrangement. The differential tax treatment between revenue and capital often causes financial arrangements with a similar economic outcome to in fact be treated differently. This has reduced the efficiency of financial markets as some financial arrangements are more attractive due to their more favourable tax treatment. Currently there are no specific rules for treating financial arrangements for tax purposes. Entities must determine whether a financial arrangement is capital or revenue according to the legal nature of the arrangement. This can often be different to the way the arrangement is treated for accounting purposes. This bill removes the requirement to make such a distinction. This bill introduces rules for treating financial arrangements for tax purposes. As a result of this bill, financial arrangements will be taxed based on their economic substance rather than requiring a complex legal distinction between capital and revenue. This will align the tax treatment of financial arrangements with the accounting treatment of financial arrangements used by entities.
Financial arrangements may be entered into for revenue purposes or capital purposes. To use an example, shares purchased and sold by a bank may be treated as revenue or capital depending on the purpose and legal form of the arrangement. Generally, the shares would be treated as revenue for accounting purposes. However, often the shares are legally determined as capital for tax purposes. This results in a discrepancy between the accounting treatment and the tax treatment of shares. This occurs because the tax law as it currently stands has not accommodated the evolution of financial arrangements and their use. This bill will remove this discrepancy by aligning the tax treatment with the accounting treatment of the shares—that is to say, the shares would be treated as revenue for tax purposes and accounting purposes.
The bill provides six methods for determining the treatment of gains and losses arising from financial arrangements. The bill removes the distinction between revenue and capital as the deciding factor in determining tax treatment of financial arrangements. These are broken down into two general classes: elective and non-elective. There are four elective methods and two non-elective methods. The four elective methods are the elective hedging method, the elective financial reports method, the elective fair value method and, finally, the elective foreign exchange retranslation method. For those who do not choose to make an election, the non-elective methods apply and they are the accruals method or the realisation method. These reforms will be compulsory for some taxpayers, such as approved deposit-taking institutions and superannuation funds and managed investment schemes that have assets over $100 million. Taxpayers who are not required to adopt the TOFA rules may elect to do so voluntarily.
As mentioned previously, these reforms were initiated by the previous coalition government. The whole TOFA process of reform is a decade in the making. Stage 1 of these reforms, which related to debt and equity measures, was legislated back in 2001. Stage 2, which related to foreign currency conversion rules and the realisation of foreign currency gains and losses, was legislated in 2003. The previous coalition government released the draft legislation for the final stages in 2005 and then engaged in an extensive consultation process with relevant taxpayers, industry groups and professional associations.
As the Senate will appreciate, this is a very complex and somewhat esoteric area of the tax law that has taken some time for stakeholders and successive governments to progress to this final stage. The final reforms were introduced in a bill into the other place in September 2007. As mentioned, however, the previous bill lapsed because of the federal election. So there have been a number of years of extensive consultation. They have been necessary and have resulted in the reforms that this bill seeks to finalise. These reforms reflect the coalition’s longstanding commitment to ensuring the integrity of the operation of our tax system.
I will mention very briefly an issue that I know my colleague Senator Joyce may raise further in more detail shortly. The coalition, whilst we are supporting this bill, do flag a concern about the broadening of the aggregated turnover threshold test. As noted in the coalition senators’ additional comments in the report of the Standing Committee on Economics into this bill:
Coalition Senators are concerned that the expansion of this test into three threshold tests may unintentionally burden small to medium sized entities (SMEs) with increased compliance costs. As many SMEs across Australia are currently challenged by the fallout of the Global Financial Crisis, it would be wrong for government to burden them further with inappropriate reporting requirements.
So I do flag these concerns for the attention of the Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Law, Senator Sherry, and ask that during the committee stage he indicate the rationale for broadening the aggregated turnover threshold test. I would also ask him, if he would, to detail for the chamber what assessment of the regulatory burden has been undertaken by the government and/or Treasury in this regard. That being said, and as I have said before, this is a supported piece of legislation and I commend the bill to the Senate.
 (Senator Hurley)—Senator Coonan, could I clarify whether you want to have a committee stage or third reading stage of the bill.
—No, not really. I have flagged it as a matter for the minister. I am not seeking a committee stage.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (TAXATION OF FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2009-03-11,"—I am going to give one of the briefest speeches in the history of the parliament. I would just like to concur with the comments made by Senator Coonan on the Tax Laws Amendment (Taxation of Financial Arrangements) Bill 2008. I look forward to the committee stage of the bill for reasons of fleshing out some of the issues that she brought up.

—If you are just going to clarify them, that will do.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (TAXATION OF FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2009-03-11,"—As Senator Coonan said, the taxation of financial arrangements has been a longstanding area of reform for consecutive governments. The changes in the taxation of income from financial arrangements were first announced by the Keating government in 1992. Then in 1999 the review of business taxation, the Ralph review, recommended that the taxation of financial arrangements be changed. Stage 1 of those reforms, distinguishing between debt and equity, was introduced in 2001. Stage 2 of the reforms, clarifying the taxation of foreign currency gains and losses, was introduced in 2003. Further reforms recommended by the Ralph review concerning the tax treatment of commodity hedges were announced in 2005. The Tax Laws Amendment (Taxation of Financial Arrangements) Bill 2008 implements stages 3 and 4 of the taxation of financial arrangements reforms dealing with hedges and tax timing of other arrangements. It is a complicated but important part of fiscal law. Treasury believes it will bring our treatment of taxation of financial arrangements up to par with other major developed countries.
For the purposes of this bill, a ‘financial arrangement’ is a right to receive or an obligation to provide a benefit that is monetary in nature, non-monetary in nature but may be settled by money or a money equivalent or is in substance and effect monetary in nature. The above definition seeks to cover the elements common to a wide range of modern financial instruments such as futures, options, credit swaps, forward agreements and other financial products. It also covers more established arrangements like loans, promissory notes and debentures. Notwithstanding some of the problems that those instruments have created recently, I am sure that the financial markets will make full use of these and other instruments in future. New financial products have been devised and used by business and industry at a rapid pace over the past two decades. The use of modern financial instruments such as futures, or hybrid debt/equity securities, has increased as business has sought new ways to protect itself from the risks of an increasingly global market. It is recognised that innovations in financial markets have outpaced the taxation framework governing them and that what is required is a reform of tax laws that shifts the emphasis from the legal form to the substance of financial arrangements. The current emphasis on the legal form of the arrangements has favoured the use of some types of financial arrangements over others due to more favourable tax treatment, adversely affecting pricing, risk management and the efficient allocation of financial resources.
This bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 so that the taxation of various financial arrangements occurs by an appropriate method. I will not go into the specific ways in which the legislation does this. I simply say that the legislation does not generally apply to individuals or superannuation funds with assets under $100 million. It does not apply to authorised deposit-taking institutions with an annual turnover under $20 million and other entities with an annual turnover under $100 million, financial assets under $100 million and total assets under $300 million. The ATO estimates that there are around 1,800 businesses with turnover exceeding $100 million to which this legislation will apply. Whilst they may incur some initial costs in changing software and paying advisers, they should also reap gains from aligning tax and accounting reporting and from hedging arrangements being less subject to disruptive tax effects.
The committee considered the impact of this legislation on smaller businesses. Government members of the committee think that these kinds of arrangements and the limits set are sufficient to deal with concerns expressed during the committee process. The government undertook an extensive consultation process over a 12-month period before the committee process. The government listened during that consultation period and that resulted in a number of changes to the legislation that effectually dealt with a lot of the concerns arising out of the bill. The bill is very complex; however, it affects only large taxpayers and, given the extensive consultation process that was implemented, those affected will have gained some familiarity with it. The ATO is putting in place procedures to advise on and assist taxpayers in complying with the new requirements.
Most of the people consulted during the committee process were very supportive of the immediate passage of the bill. Many submitters to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics inquiry noted that some review process of the bill should occur after implementation to allow for later technical amendments. This has been acknowledged by the government, with the minister noting that, given the complexity of the law, monitoring the implementation of the reform would be required and any refinements needed would be dealt with as they arose. The Tax Laws Amendment (Taxation of Financial Arrangements) Bill introduces a comprehensive new framework for the taxation of financial arrangements. It is designed to reduce tax induced distortions in investment and financing, facilitate efficient risk management and reduce compliance and administration costs. It is a significant bill which will provide certainty, clarity and equity to the tax treatment of financial arrangements. It represents the final stage of reform in this area undertaken by two previous governments. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-03-11,"—in reply—I thank senators for their contribution to this debate. The Tax Laws Amendment (Taxation of Financial Arrangements) Bill 2008 represents an important reform of Australia’s financial taxation system. Firstly, the passage of this bill will enhance efficiency in financial decision making by taxing financial arrangements according to their economic substance rather than their legal form. Secondly, it will reduce tax distortions to managing financial risk by introducing extensive tax-timing and character-hedging rules. Thirdly, it will reduce compliance costs by increasing the certainty of tax treatment of financial arrangements and by more closely aligning tax and financial accounting outcomes. The TOFA rules will not be applied on a mandatory basis to individual and small-business taxpayers, except where significant tax deferral is involved.
The bill has benefited from extensive consultations with industry and professional associations and is much anticipated by the business sector. As Senator Coonan touched on in her contribution, the bill had its genesis under the former Liberal government. We acknowledge the extensive work that commenced, as I recall from Senator Coonan’s contribution, as far back as 2003. So there have been some five to six years from the original announcement of these proposals through to the very extensive consultation. One of the results of recent consultation was the government’s decision to implement a soft and hard start date. Entities keen to receive the benefits of the reduction in compliance costs can elect to apply the new tax rules for the income year starting on or after 1 July 2009. Other entities may need more time to prepare for the new rules, which will apply to affected entities on a mandatory basis for income years starting on or after 1 July 2010.
This is a significant bill which will provide improved and needed coherence to the tax treatment of financial arrangements. As has been pointed out by Senator Coonan and other contributors to this debate, the bill is a complex one, and it will need very careful monitoring. There are likely to be issues that need to be considered. Certainly industry in their consultation, while broadly welcoming and supporting the legislation and the detail, nevertheless rightly pointed out that, as is often the case with changes to tax treatment, there is a series of complex issues that will need careful consideration. The government understands this and industry understands it. Those who wish to apply the rules do understand the complexities of the process that is going to flow as a consequence of this legislation.
I think it was Senator Joyce—I was not here but Senator Coonan flagged it and I want to take this opportunity to discuss the issue—who expressed the concern of the coalition, the Liberal and National parties, whilst supporting this particular piece of legislation, of the broadening of the aggregated turnover threshold test and the related issue of the compliance application and the impact that would have on business as a consequence of the broadening of that aggregated turnover threshold test.

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2009-03-11,"—Today I take the opportunity to refer to aspects of the Fair Work Bill 2008 that has been introduced into the Senate in the last few days. I did not have an opportunity to speak in the second reading debate, for a variety of reasons—as I think you would know, Madam Acting Deputy President Brown, being a government senator. One of the things I did have a chance to do was have a read of some of the coalition’s contributions—particularly Senator Fisher’s contributions to the legislation last night—and it struck me that they are like the Bourbons. Talleyrand said the Bourbons ‘have learned nothing and forgotten everything’ once they were restored to power. That is what happened. The coalition have learned nothing and forgotten everything.
One of the main reasons that Labor won power at the last election was not the power of the trade union movement or its mobilisation—did we not mobilise in 2004, 2001, 1998, 1996, 1993 and 1990? Why could we not then shift the population that shifted in 2007? One particular individual contributed to that shift. That is a lady called Annette Harris, who is now retired and who worked at Spotlight, up in Coffs Harbour in New South Wales. Mrs Harris worked at that company and had worked there for some years but, as a result of the introduction and passage of the coalition’s workplace legislation in the last government, her employer presented her with a document to sign which allowed her to receive, in exchange for $90 a week that she would lose, 2c an hour extra. This is what the document that she was asked to sign had in it: all penalty rates on late nights and weekends would be abolished, all penalty rates on public holidays would be abolished, all overtime penalty rates would be abolished, all tea breaks would be abolished and some public holidays and rostering rights would be abolished.
Mrs Harris was a member of the Shop Assistants Union. She was, like some union members, though not all of them—a majority of them are not—a lifelong Liberal voter. This is what Mrs Harris said to the Australian in July 2007:
… John Howard was always my hero. I thought the world of him. I thought he was a good prime minister. But now it has totally changed my way of thinking as far as he’s concerned …
As I said, the opposition have learned nothing and forgotten everything. They do not understand that people like Mrs Harris, lifelong Liberal voters, voted for us for the first time in their lives last election. Why was that? The answer is clearly that the former government decided to move away from state intervention into the workplace and leave it up to whatever happened there—the weak would look after themselves. Once they moved away from state intervention, lifelong Liberals deserted them en masse.
They get themselves tangled up with the trade union campaign. They think the trade union campaign contributed to their defeat. What contributed to their defeat was the fact that they walked away from intervening in the workplace, which we had done in a bipartisan way in this country for almost a century. This had been done by both our side of politics and theirs. They were committed to the compulsory arbitration system almost right up until John Howard got in in 1996. They were well aware and did that opportunistically. What was the reason that these conservatives were prepared to go into the workplace to employ state intervention? You can take a look at history. Particularly in Europe, conservative parties saw the results of the chaos and crisis that were caused by civil unrest. They did not want that to occur in their country. In many cases they introduced some of the welfare state provisions that we enjoy today. They were introduced and sustained by conservative governments.
When you look at Mrs Harris, who said she was a lifelong Liberal voter, why did she desert the party that she had been voting for all her adult life? The reason is clearly that they abandoned the workplace to people who were unscrupulous. There were too many employers being unscrupulous in the use of the Work Choices legislation. Almost immediately after the legislation was passed, a Cowra abattoir wanted to sack all their workers and rehire them on less wages and conditions. That happened because this parliament passed legislation to make it possible to take those conditions away from those men and women and their families. I imagine that a number of those people out there were probably lifelong National Party voters, and they walked away from their party as well. The coalition walked away from these people. For a century, the coalition or their equivalents elsewhere in the Western world were quite prepared for the state to intervene to regulate. Whether it was the introduction of free education, universal medical services or social security, all of these matters were introduced often in a bipartisan way or through pressure from conservative governments.
I go back to why. For most of the 19th and 20th centuries, conservatives were looking at the chaos and crisis that had occurred as a result of the dislocation from the French Revolution and then, in the 20th century—from 1917—from the Russian Revolution. They did not want that chaos, that violence, occurring in their country. So they made concessions. But John Howard and his ilk walked away from that intervention. That is why people like Mrs Harris and the Cowra abattoir workers—after seeing what these workplace changes did in some of those places—walked away from voting for the party that they had been voting for for many years.
When I look at the coalition’s contribution I get a little confused because, as I said, they have homed in on the trade union movement’s campaign. I am an ex-trade union official. I contributed to trying to unseat the coalition at the last election and at every one I could from the time I was able to vote, in 1974 or 1975. Since then I have done everything I have been able to to make sure that they have not been on this side of the chamber. I am not proud to say this—and the coalition are still wrapped up in this—but at the height of the Your Rights at Work campaign, when there was so much money being spent on advertising and workplace visits, union membership declined. At the same time as union membership was declining, our votes were going up. Why was that? I go back again: the coalition walked away from ‘Howard’s battlers’. They walked away from them in droves, and they were repaid for that.
In my contribution today I want to commemorate Mrs Harris, who probably more than any other individual in this country contributed to the coalition being on that side of the chamber. A lifelong Liberal voter, she was being asked to exchange her penalty rates and conditions for 2c an hour. She walked away like many others did in that period. We are seeing again the terrifying spectacle of the coalition not understanding that they have had for almost a century this compact to be involved in the state, to support regulation. They have walked away from it. Look at the doormats in the National Party and some of the things that they put up with from their Liberal colleagues. Jack McEwen would be turning in his grave over some of the things that the National Party allow the Liberals to stand over them on. Mrs Harris should be commemorated not just by the labour movement but by Australians generally for ensuring that this government will re-enter the workplace to make sure that there is no unfairness, there is no injustice and people are not bullied or bludgeoned into accepting conditions that they do not have to. For that, we owe Mrs Harris a deep debt of gratitude.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Workplace Relations</title>,Matters of Public Interest,5,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2009-03-11,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Climate Change and Water (Senator Wong) and the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research (Senator Carr) to questions without notice asked by Senators Abetz, Trood and Boswell today relating to employment and the proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.
We have now learnt from question time today the enormous bureaucracy that will be set up to administer the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. If there are to be any jobs at all made out of the emissions trading scheme, quite clearly they are going to be in the Public Service. Senator Trood’s question very skilfully highlighted the enormous bureaucracy that will be built up around the emissions trading scheme. As we have come to expect here, the Minister for Climate Change and Water was simply incapable of answering any of the questions today, as she has been incapable of answering any questions in relation to the climate change legislation. It is quite clear that the correct amount of work has not been done—there has been no modelling on the jobs that will be lost. The minister knows best, so she thinks, but those of us who get out and about in public understand that there are real job losses in this legislation.
We have heard the Labor Party in the Senate this afternoon rabbiting on about Work Choices, the Fair Work legislation and building up jobs. The emissions trading scheme proposed by the Rudd government will cost more jobs than any other single event that has ever occurred in Australia’s history. I mentioned before that at Senate committee hearings we have been told that up to 216,000 jobs in the mining industry could be put at risk by this emissions trading scheme. I ask Labor speakers who might follow me to tell me where the benefit to Australia is when Sun Metals, a zinc processing company in Townsville, have to close down because of the taxes put on their industry in Australia that do not apply to any other industry anywhere else in the world. They will close down. They will dismiss all of those workers that are currently employed there. They will move offshore to a country which does not have an emissions trading scheme. They will then emit even greater greenhouse gases. Tell me where the winds are.
We have sacked, done without or thrown on the employment scrapheap hundreds of workers in one city alone, and has it made any difference to the changing climate of the world? Not one iota. Go through the facts wherever you look in the state of Queensland. I am particularly concerned about the state of Queensland, and I am particularly concerned that the Premier, Anna Bligh, has not stood up for Queensland workers by taking on Mr Rudd, Mr Swan and Senator Wong in relation to the job losses in Queensland from the emissions trading scheme. At any number of Senate inquiries we have had evidence from the cement industry, the coal industry and the aluminium industry—companies involved in providing real jobs for Australian workers—that this scheme will cause their demise. Why? Let me give you the example of the cement industry. You can import cement into Australia. The Australian cement industry will have to compete with that. The cement comes in from Indonesia. There is no CPRS or emissions trading scheme there, so the Australian industry is lumbered with a $20-a-tonne tax. How can the Australian industry possibly compete with the Indonesian cement industry in Australia when one is subjected to a $20-a-tonne tax and the other gets away scot-free?
The biggest competitor of the Australian black coal industry is Indonesia. As the Australian coal industry has tax after tax from the CPRS imposed upon it, our coal will become uncompetitive. Where will the buyers go? To our competitors in Indonesia, which does not and never will have an emissions trading scheme. I cannot understand why the unions and the Labor Party members here do not stand up for those workers in the Queensland coal and mining industries. They are about to lose their jobs because of this Labor government, and it is about time the unions and Labor Party members had some courage and stood up to the Prime Minister and Senator Wong over a flawed scheme that will cost jobs.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Emissions Trading Scheme</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,9,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2009-03-11,"—The opposition’s answer of course is to do absolutely nothing about the impact climate change is having on this country and internationally. They have gone from being a party of climate sceptics who would not even look at the Kyoto protocol, let alone sign it, to a party that is now just objecting, obstructing and denying that this country needs to move forward in being part of an international solution to the climate change problem.
We put out a green paper on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. After months of consultation, that became the white paper. Then there were concessions and changes made to the white paper. Now we have draft legislation, and we have a minister who has accepted and encouraged the fact that this chamber will look at that draft legislation. There are never any solutions or any alternatives from the people opposite me—only difficulties, objections, obstructions, negative comments and scaremongering. There is never a proposal, because they do not actually have a proposal. They do not have an agreement about where they are moving on this; they do not have an alternative policy that they can put to the Australian people.
Our Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will start in 2010. We are committed to that deadline. We went to the election on this promise, and the Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator Wong, has worked incredibly hard for the last year or so, tirelessly consulting with businesses, stakeholders and those that have concerns about this. Our scheme will put a cost on carbon pollution—that is for sure—but it will also encourage major polluting businesses to lower their emissions. We need to sign up to this, to be committed to this, as part of a global and international solution. Our scheme will start reducing Australia’s carbon pollution from next year; that is what we need to do as a country. We will use the funds raised to assist households to adjust to the scheme, making sure that Australian families do not carry the cost of climate change. We will build on our investment in renewable energy to create low-pollution jobs into the future in solar energy, wind energy and new technology like clean coal and geothermal energy. Taking action on climate change will actually see the renewable energy sector grow to 30 times its size by 2050, so in fact under our scheme we will be creating thousands of jobs.
The Treasury modelling released in October last year showed that these measures will see the renewable energy sector grow, as I said, but we also know that if we do not act Australia’s economy will be left behind, because the low-pollution jobs that we need for the future will not be created. The modelling released last year showed that, for economies and countries that defer action, sit on their hands, do nothing and produce no alternative models—or no models at all, which is what the opposition want—the long-term costs will be around 15 per cent higher than the costs for those that take action now. The people opposite me want to sit on their hands and do nothing. They do not want to create new industries in the renewable energy target but actually want to postpone the costs so that in later years we will be faced with a cost that is 15 per cent higher and escalating.
Their solution to this is to make sure that they put up whatever brick wall, whatever nonsolution, whatever non-alternative-policy they can. From those opposite we have seen no consistent position, alternative policy or idea brought to the table and no positive discussion. Theirs is a party that simply wants to deny that there are future industries, technologies and jobs out there, a party that would like to defer the cost of this so that it becomes 15 per cent higher in years to come.

When they make that decision the blue-collar workers will be glad, but at the moment the blue-collar workers—the people in the coalmines, the people at Pacific Brands, the good people that pay their union fees—are being sold out by the Labor Party. The Labor Party have deserted them, run away from them, and are now backing the Greens, the people in the leafy suburbs and the doctors’ wives.
Government senators interjecting—
—That is who you represent. You have wiped your hands of the blue-collar workers, the people that have stuck with you for years and years. They are going to realise it very soon. Eighteen hundred jobs went from Pacific Brands. I ask the Senate: how many more jobs are going to go when there is an emissions charge on every sewing machine? Every electric motor in every factory will attract a charge. Do you think that is going to make Australian industry more competitive? Do you think that is going to give the blue-collar workers a job? I can tell you it will not—and the unions know it. The Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change, Mr Combet, is going to be like a one-armed paper hanger in a high breeze, because the union movement is going to go to him and tell him what you guys are doing to them and the blue-collar worker.
I hope the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, has the decency to pick up the phone and ring Golden Circle, the biggest employer in Brisbane, employing around 1,800 workers in his electorate. Last year they had to reduce the intake of pineapples from Queensland growers because they were under attack from imported product—imported pineapples, imported home brands. How much less competitive is this ETS going to make them when they have to pay an emissions charge on all their outgoings, all their plant, all their equipment? It is going to be a huge charge that none of their overseas competitors will have to pay.
This is giving a free kick to overseas manufacturers. It is hard enough to make a quid manufacturing in Australia, with the high costs. Why put another eight pounds of lead in their saddle? What are you guys doing? Don’t you understand? How can you sit there and let this happen to Australia? How can you sit there and let this happen to your blue-collar workers? You’ve deserted them; you’ve ratted on them; you’ve—
—Order! Senator Boswell, would you please address the chair and not the people opposite.
—I am sorry, Mr Deputy President, but I can see the disaster coming and I get excited about it. I can see the loss of jobs that these guys are going to put on the decent blue-collar workers who have always supported them. They have ratted on them. They have walked away from them. It would not be so bad if everyone else was going to do it. But President Obama has said, ‘We’ll do it when everyone else does it.’ Mrs Clinton has said, ‘We’ll do it too, but everyone’s got to follow.’ Their envoy Senator Kerry said, ‘We can’t do this unless everyone else is doing it.’ Why are you leading Australian industry like lambs to the slaughter? That is what is happening to this industry: it is being treated like lambs to the slaughter. No-one else is going to do it—they have said they are not going to do it. China have said they are not going to do it. India have said they are not going to do it. America have said they are not going to do it. Who has said they are going to do it? And, when they have said they are going to do it, they are going to do it in 2027. We are going to start next year, in 2010. Why are you doing this? Don’t you care for Australia? Are you going to just let them sink?
Every one of you over there—apart from Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator Wong—please help us; please let the Senate defeat this bill. Please get us off the hook by letting the Senate defeat this bill. You can go to your green voters, who you love—you have deserted your blue-collar workers—and say, ‘Oh, we tried; those rats in the Senate blocked us.’ And then you can go to the blue-collar workers and say, ‘Yeah, we knew it was going to happen; we were always on your side.’ The hypocrisy of the Labor Party on this ETS is unbelievable; it has never been seen before. And that is not Ron Boswell saying that; it is all the economists in Australia. (Time expired)

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2009-03-11,"—I rise to take note of the same answers as the previous speaker. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme—and the emissions trading system—is only one of several great public policy challenges that sit in front of the Senate at this time. We have the global stimulus package, we have the CPRS legislation and most recently we have had the Fair Work Bill. These are all enormous and important pieces of legislation for this Senate to consider. They all have one thing in common: those opposite do not have a clear policy, a clear approach or indeed a clear response to any of them. With the CPRS that is very clear. The Leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Turnbull, has said in his public utterances, both last year and again recently, that he is in favour of an emissions trading system. Those opposite have been completely unable to keep faith with Malcolm Turnbull’s utterances and they have been unable to give those utterances any shape or direction. This is a public policy challenge of enormous complexity and the other side have written it off as simply too hard.
This debate is typical of what has now become known as the Malcolm Turnbull three-step, which he has deployed for every major challenge that has confronted him since he became leader. Step 1 of the Malcolm Turnbull three-step is to support a Labor initiative, to drape himself in the flag of bipartisanship and to try and win a day’s media for himself as a constructive statesman. Step 2 of the Malcolm Turnbull three-step is to cast doubt upon the Labor initiative. We have seen those opposite for many, many months snipe and undermine and run a guerrilla war against the Labor Party’s emissions trading initiatives. Finally, step 3 of the Malcolm Turnbull three-step is outright opposition, the cynical exploitation of the issue for those few votes they can harness from it.
But this is a debate that is very important for this country. Notwithstanding the Turnbull three-step there are some clear indicators about where this debate is going. Our side’s position, the position of the Labor Party, the position of this government, the position of the minister, has been very clear from the moment we were sworn into government. One of our very first decisions was to move to ratify the Kyoto protocol. After 11 years of inaction, after 11 years of climate change scepticism, this government moved immediately and decisively to take hold of the issue and started building solutions. The CPRS has now been announced in large form, and there are some very important features of it that those opposite are unable or unwilling to come to terms with. At its heart the CPRS is aimed at managing a transition—a transition from our contemporary economy to a post-carbon economy. In managing that transition there are certain features, such as the permit regime, and other features such as how the coal industry is being dealt with—

Senator Cormann interjecting—


Senator Fisher interjecting—

—Order! Those on my left!
—Those features, such as permits, are all about protecting the jobs of today while transitioning the Australian economy over the long term towards a 2050 ambition of us becoming a post-carbon economy. This is a challenge Australia must face—but, it is understood by us on this side, it is also a challenge that the world must face. So we are crafting public policy here to account for two important issues: the long time frames we are talking about here—that is, that the mission must be accomplished by around 2050—and developing a scheme that encompasses and understands the fact that we are working in an international, multilateral environment.
That is why the scheme recognises the fact that we have made important progress with our international trading partners. We now have the 27 countries of the European Union in an emissions trading system. We have 27 states of the United States. Canada and New Zealand are considering moving into an emissions trading system. And Obama’s United States are considering that, too. As with all the other major public policy issues that are confronting us at this time, whether it be the global financial challenge— (Time expired)

"Trood, Sen Russell",LP,2009-03-11,"—It may well be that an emissions trading scheme is a matter of some importance, but in question time today I asked the minister responsible a very specific question. I asked the minister what the cost of this scheme would be in relation to the various elements which she argued were necessary to maintain the integrity of the scheme. I asked what it would cost to create the climate change regulatory authority and what it would cost to administer and establish many of the elements of the scheme. And she was unable to tell me. She was unable to provide an answer to this elementary question about the ETS. She was unable to provide this answer after nearly two years of work on the topic.
The government went into the last election promising some action on climate change. They could not possibly have given any thought to the possibility that there would be a need for some kind of bureaucracy to be established. During the period of time since they won office, they have spent numerous hours, spent a large amount of money and used a great deal of staff in trying to establish and set up this scheme. They have employed Professor Garnaut to provide a lengthy report, at vast expense to the taxpayer, on the scheme. So they have had plenty of time—Professor Garnaut has had plenty of time—to quantify the costs involved in this. The Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator Wong, came into the chamber today and when I asked a very specific question was unable to answer.
This raises a critical question, not just about the ETS but about the entirely cavalier attitude that the government seems to take to the management of the public purse. This has parallels elsewhere around the Commonwealth. In particular, I cannot help but think that it has parallels in my own state of Queensland, where the Beattie-Bligh government has been in office for nearly 20 years—over a long period of time—and has failed to adequately and properly administer the public purse. During good times, during times of plenty, the Labor government in Queensland has received mountains of money. It is has received money into the Treasury from large amounts of conveyancing; it has received large amounts of money from payroll taxes; it has received massive royalties from the mining industry—in fact, so much so that the government not long ago increased the proportion of royalties—and it has received masses of money from the GST.
I have done a quick calculation. Over the last seven years, it has received something in the vicinity of $53 billion in revenue raised by the Commonwealth through the GST. In the year 2007-08, it received $8.3 billion in revenue. We—not just Queenslanders but Australians—are entitled to ask where that money has gone. Why is it not reflected in the building of infrastructure around the state of Queensland? Why is it not reflected in the progress of reducing hospital waiting lists? Why is it not reflected in the improvement of education standards in relation to numeracy and literacy in Queensland? In particular, since we asked Senator Wong this question, because she is the Minister for Climate Change and Water, why is it not reflected in the administration of the state’s water security?
Prior to the last election, in a panic because it had failed to do anything about this issue over a long period of time, the Queensland government decided to propose a new dam. This was only necessary because the former public servant K Rudd had cancelled the Wolfdene Dam in December 1989. That dam would almost certainly be overflowing to this very day. South-East Queensland’s water needs would have been more than well provided for. The cancellation of that dam resulted in a panicked development of public policy which has cost the state of Queensland billions of dollars. We have had a desalination plant proposed, which is now well behind budget. (Time expired)

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2009-03-11,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

In tabling the Committee’s Alert Digest No. 3 of 2009, I would like to draw the Senate’s attention to several provisions in both the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2009 and the Transport Safety Investigation Amendment Bill 2009.
With respect to the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill, the Committee has sought the Minister’s advice on provisions dealing with:
entry and search powers of investigators;
exemption of certain directions given by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) to investigators from the operation of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003;
application of the demerits points scheme for holders of a ‘civil aviation authorisation’; and
the automatic stay of certain ‘reviewable decisions’ taken by CASA for a period of five days after such decisions have been taken.
In relation to the Transport Safety Investigation Amendment Bill, the Committee has noted that proposed new subsection 63E allows the Chief Commissioner of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) to appoint special investigators if they satisfy criteria specified by the regulations. A person to whom a power is delegated (including powers delegated to special investigators) under new subsection 63B is a staff member of the ATSB (see item 16 of Schedule 1 which amends section 3) so certain benefits follow, including legal representation at coronial inquiries (proposed new section 68).
While the bill provides for an annual report by the ATSB on various matters, including prescribed particulars of matters investigated and a description of investigations (proposed new section 63A), there appears to be no specific mechanism in the bill which provides for any reporting to the Parliament on the use of special investigators. The Committee has therefore sought the Minister’s advice in relation to whether heightened parliamentary scrutiny might be appropriate in the circumstances. In particular, given the breadth of the bill’s delegation power in relation to special investigators, the Committee has inquired of the Minister whether a specific reporting mechanism – for example, a separate document tabled in both Houses of the Parliament on an annual basis containing details of all relevant activities of special investigators – might be considered in order to promote transparency and openness in this area.
Items 71 to 103 of Schedule 1 of the Transport Safety Investigation Amendment Bill contains amendments to the Inspector of Transport Security Act 2006 and concerns the transfer of powers and functions from the Executive Director of Transport Safety Investigations to the ATSB and the Chief Commissioner.
Item 89 refers to proposed new subsection 64(5) which provides that the Minister must not give a person or government agency, or table in the Parliament, any part of a final report that contains restricted information given to the Inspector of Transport Security by the ATSB without the prior ‘agreement’ of the Chief Commissioner if the disclosure may compromise an investigation or have a substantial adverse effect on the conduct of operations of the ATSB. Similarly, item 84 refers to proposed new subsection 52(5) which repeats the requirement that the Minister obtain the ‘agreement’ of the Chief Commissioner before giving information in any part of an interim report to a person or government agency or tabling the interim report in the Parliament in similar circumstances.
The Committee considers that there is some limit on the exercise of the Minister’s discretion in these circumstances. Therefore, the Committee has sought the Minister’s advice as to whether these provisions contain an unnecessary fetter on the Minister and, if so, whether ‘advice’ or ‘recommendations’ from the Chief Commissioner to the Minister might also be considered.
I commend the Committee’s Alert Digest No. 3 of 2009 and Second Report of 2009 to the Senate.

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2009-03-11,"—by leave—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the Republic of Serbia and to the 119th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Geneva, Switzerland, which took place from 4 to 18 October 2008. I seek leave to move a motion to take note of the document.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
It was my very great pleasure to be a member of the Australian parliamentary delegation which visited Serbia and Geneva on the dates I have mentioned. We also spent one night in Vienna in transit. I was fortunate to have the company of the Hon. Roger Price, who was the leader of our delegation, and Mrs Price, the Hon. Danna Vale and Mr Vale and, in Geneva, Senator Claire Moore.
We were fortunate to visit Serbia as the first Australian delegation and the first to visit after the formation of the new Democratic National Assembly earlier in 2008. The new government, which was approved in July 2008, is dominated by the pro-European Democratic Party in coalition with the Serbian Socialist Party of the former Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic. As senators will be aware, the new Republic of Serbia was formerly a part of the state union of Serbia and Montenegro, which was dissolved in 2006 and, prior to 2003, was part of Yugoslavia. The former Yugoslavia was the third largest source of migration from continental Europe for Australia. The 2006 Australian census recorded 17,330 Serbian born people in Australia with 95,364 people identifying themselves as of Serbian origin.
In February 2008, Kosovo, formerly an autonomous province within Serbia, declared its independence and Australia recognised the bid for independence two days later. Negotiations between the Serbian government and the new administration of Kosovo have continually stalled and, at the time of this delegation’s visit, Serbia was seeking agreement in the United Nations General Assembly to request the International Court of Justice to provide an advisory opinion on the legal status of Kosovo’s declaration of independence.
Serbia is moving towards European Union membership, and only the Dutch parliament has failed to ratify the documentation which Serbia has produced so far on a range of political, trade and economic issues. One international obligation with which Serbia must fully comply is to make all possible efforts to arrest and transfer named indictees under the International Criminal Tribunal jurisdiction. There are two remaining fugitives which Serbia must deliver.
There is no doubt that Serbia faces significant challenges. By the year 2000, gross domestic product had dropped to 50 per cent of the 1989 level and 60 per cent of the population was living in poverty. The NATO military action in 1999 destroyed or damaged a substantial part of industry and economic infrastructure. Serbia must establish a functioning market economy. There has been improvement in foreign reserves and the level of indebtedness, and the banking sector and state owned enterprises are slowly being privatised.
The delegation was very impressed by the younger, well-educated, progressive and professional generation of ministers and political leaders. Serbia has turned its face towards Europe, and the delegation was very sympathetic to the admission of Serbia to the EU as an important step towards stability in the region.
Australian interaction with Serbia is reasonably low. Trade offers scope for development. There is potential for healthcare agreements, and the scientific, technological and educational sectors are areas where we could take advantage of exchange of information and expertise, which would provide significant benefits and developments to both countries.
Culture and the arts are also areas that could benefit from Australian support and assistance, both financial and otherwise. We met a number of extremely motivated and dynamic people in this sector and, on my return to Australia, I conveyed these thoughts to the Australian Ballet, to which I am a subscriber, and I am hopeful that more interaction between our two countries in that particular area may be possible.
We are pleased to note that after our visit the Ambassador of Serbia has now returned to Australia. There was a short time when he was not here because of our approval of the independence of Kosovo, but he has now returned. During our visit we were extended hospitality and courtesy at every level by our Serbian hosts. At short notice, Ambassador Claire Birgin arranged a comprehensive program of meetings which covered the highly coloured tapestry of Serbian life. The ambassador went to great lengths to make us feel personally welcome, and we do thank her and the entire embassy staff.
The delegation also had a productive visit to the Inter-Parliamentary Union conference in Geneva, where we were joined by Senator Claire Moore. We attended groups of the 12 Plus Geopolitical Group. With 45 members, it is the geopolitical group centred originally on EU membership but now includes several other countries. We also attended the Asia-Pacific Group with 26 members, of which naturally we are a member. Senator Moore and I attended the meetings and discussions of the IPU Committee on United Nations Affairs and I am delighted to say that today, along with many other members and senators, I attended the inaugural meeting of a United Nations parliamentary association which is to be based here in Canberra.
We held bilateral discussions with delegations from Iraq and Timor-Leste. Mrs Vale, Senator Moore and I attended the meeting initiated by women parliamentarians. In addition, we gave strong support to the candidacy of Speaker Laksono from Indonesia for the position of President of the IPU. Senator Moore participated in the workshop on ensuring transparency in parliamentary processes and we met many of our parliamentary counterparts in official ceremonies and social functions hosted variously by France, Indonesia, Korea, Namibia, Parliamentarians for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament and 12 Plus.
I should add that Mr Price, our delegation leader, presented a draft report to open the panel discussion on the subject to be considered by the first standing committee on advancing nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament and the role of parliaments in that process. I would like to thank particularly Mr Elton Humphery, the delegation secretary, who was extremely efficient and practical, and also Ms Alison Purnell, the adviser from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, who provided professional advice and assistance to the delegation during the IPU meeting. This was the first delegation meeting that I had attended as a representative of the parliament, and to see our country take its place among an assembly of a very large number of nations made me feel very proud. I think we can make our mark very strongly in that gathering, and I look forward to further meetings. The next one is to take place in Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, early in April, and I will look forward to reporting further to the parliament on the delegation’s activities.

I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate. The Tax Laws Amendment (Taxation of Financial Arrangements) Bill 2008, commonly known as the TOFA bill, is a significant bill which will provide much needed certainty and coherence to the tax treatment of financial arrangements. The bill will reduce tax distortions by generally ignoring the capital revenue distinction and by taxing financial arrangements based on economic substance rather than legal form.
The bill is the final stage of the TOFA reforms which were first announced in the 1992 budget. The reforms have progressively been implemented, with stage 1 legislated in 2001 and stage 2 in 2003. This bill implements stages 3 and 4. I note that the bill has been examined by the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, which recommended that the Senate pass the bill. Additional comments by coalition senators did raise concerns about the impact of a broader aggregated turnover threshold test compared to the draft legislation that was developed by the previous government.
Senator Coonan has asked for an explanation to the Senate of the reasoning behind the broadening of the aggregated turnover threshold test. The aggregated turnover threshold test was broadened because it relies on the ordinary income that an entity derives in the ordinary course of carrying on a business. If reliance were placed solely on an aggregated turnover threshold test, an entity that does not carry on a business or has only statutory and no ordinary income but has substantial assets could escape accruals tax treatment on its income from financial arrangements. Thus the threshold test was broadened to bring within the TOFA rules entities that have substantial assets. In particular, TOFA will apply to an entity if it has assets of $350 million or more or has financial assets of $100 million or more. Such entities would be expected to have a relatively substantial capacity to defer tax in the absence of the TOFA provisions. They would also be sufficiently sophisticated to deal with the TOFA provisions.
Senator Coonan also asked for details on any assessment of the regulatory burden that the government and Treasury have undertaken. I can advise that public consultation in October 2008 identified the anomalous and unintended outcomes that were mentioned above. The additional tests were incorporated to ensure that the TOFA rules apply to the taxpayers intended. The design of the TOFA rules, which have been the subject of extensive consultation over a very long period, has taken into account the cost of complying with the rules. Comments during consultation indicated that the various optional methods in TOFA have the potential to substantially enhance the compliance task of businesses in dealing with TOFA rules. Since the TOFA bill was introduced into parliament in December last year, the Investment and Financial Services Association, for example, has said that it will ‘act to reduce compliance costs for the financial services industry’.
More generally, the explanatory memorandum to the bill contains a detailed regulation impact statement which sets out the compliance advantage of the TOFA rules, including closer alignment with financial accounting and policy coherency. Compliance costs will also be reduced due to increased certainty of tax treatment. The regulation impact statement also notes that the Australian Taxation Office estimates that taxpayers affected by the TOFA rules will experience a medium decrease in compliance costs during the ongoing stage. The government has embarked on considerable consultation on this bill over the last 12 months and it is much anticipated by the business sector. As this is a complex area of the law, the government intends to monitor the implementation of this reform to Australia’s financial taxation system and will consider the need for any refinements. I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (TAXATION OF FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2009-03-11,"—I commence by stating that the opposition supports these amendments, with some qualification. The purpose of the Defence Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2008 is to make amendments to the Defence Act 1903 for three separate measures. The first of these three measures will amend the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 and the Criminal Code Act 1995 to implement the third protocol to the Geneva conventions in Australian legislation. The second measure will amend section 124 of the Defence Act 1903 to explicitly enable the making of regulations to cover the provision of medical and dental treatment, including pharmaceuticals, to an ADF member or cadet or a member of the family of an ADF member. The third measure amends the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952 to insert a new part to provide specific arrangements for the joint defence facility at Pine Gap.
The bill was read for the second time in the House of Representatives on 3 December 2008 and subsequently passed through that House on 10 February without amendment. The bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and the report was dated 20 February 2009. The first schedule of the bill makes amendments to the third additional protocol to the Geneva conventions and is supported by the opposition, as I have indicated. On 8 March 2006, Australia signed the protocol additional to the Geneva conventions of 12 August 1949 relating to the adoption of an additional distinctive emblem for the Red Cross‑Red Crescent Movement, which is called protocol III. On 9 May 2007, the treaty on the protocol additional to the Geneva conventions of 12 August 1949 and relating to the adoption of an additional distinctive emblem, protocol III, at Geneva on 8 December 2005 was tabled. The treaty proposes that Australia takes binding treaty action to ratify the protocol additional to the Geneva conventions of 12 August 1949 and relating to the adoption of an additional distinctive emblem. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties reviewed the treaty and conducted a hearing on 18 June 2007. The committee’s report to parliament was tabled on 16 August 2007.
The Red Cross has extensively lobbied many senators to support this legislation. This part of the legislation amends the third protocol, as I have indicated, so as to recognise the red crystal in situations where the red cross could be considered culturally inappropriate, obviously predominantly in Islamic countries. The red crystal emblem has no religious, ethnic, racial, regional or political connotations, and the amendment ensures that the new emblem is used only with the consent of the Minister of Defence. The bill also amends the Criminal Code Act 1995 to ensure that the new Geneva emblem is covered by existing offences relating to the improper use of emblems of the Geneva conventions. The protocol includes a description of the new emblem, indicative and other uses of the emblem and, annexed to the protocol, a pictorial representation of the red crystal emblem.
Schedule 2 of the bill amends the Defence Act 1903 to explicitly enable the making of regulations to cover the provision of medical and dental treatment, including pharmaceuticals, to an ADF member or cadet or a member of the family of an ADF member. At present the Defence Force regulations contain a limited provision that merely recognises the provision of medical and dental treatment to members of the Australian Defence Force so that they are healthy for the purpose of discharging their duties, as well as cost recovery in specific, named circumstances. Medical and dental treatment includes the provision of services or goods, including scheduled pharmaceuticals, related to medical and dental treatment for an ADF member or cadet or a member of the family of an ADF member. In relation to pharmaceuticals, it is intended that the regulations will cover the possession, storage, supply, dispensation and administration of scheduled pharmaceuticals by ADF pharmacists, ADF medics, ADF nurses and civilian health professionals engaged by the Australian Defence Force. The effect of the amendments will ensure that the Australian Defence Force and its members are not hindered in the uniform application of their duties here and overseas by competing state or territory laws.
The contentious part of this schedule relates to a broken promise—an election promise—of the Rudd government. The health care commitment for ADF family members was set out in Labor’s plan for defence under the heading ‘Free medical and dental care for ADF families’. The promise stated:
ADF families can face significant difficulties obtaining access and to general medical and dental care for dependants, especially in regional and remote localities.
Posting to a remote location can mean that ADF families struggle to access the sort of health care that Australians enjoy.
A Rudd Labor Government will progressively extend free health care currently provided to ADF personnel to ADF dependent spouses and children.
Labor will begin this with a $33.1 million investment starting at 12 Defence Family Health Care Clinics, with a focus on remote bases locations and major regional centres.
This commitment was clearly—and has been acknowledged to have been—broken with the announcement of the government’s 2008-09 budget, which has only funded the new entitlement as a trial, allocating a mere $12.2 million over four years to trial the provision of free basic GP services and limited dental care to families of ADF members in rural and remote areas such as Singleton, New South Wales; Katherine, the Northern Territory; East Sale, Victoria; Cairns, Queensland; and Karratha, in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. The amount allocated for 2008-09 is a paltry and quite outrageous $2.4 million, with dental care limited to $300 per annum per dependant. Only five of the 10 rural and remote defence locations were mentioned—that is, excluding Townsville and Darwin. Rather than defence families attending defence family healthcare clinics at these locations, families are to ‘select the doctor or dentist of their choice’.
Changes to the commitment to provide defence healthcare clinics in Townsville and Darwin were also reportedly being considered, with the possibility that two defence family healthcare clinics promised in the campaign—those at Lavarack Barracks in Townsville and Robertson Barracks in Darwin—would be replaced by defence families accessing health department GP superclinics in Townsville and Darwin. No doubt in reaction and response to the public outcry from defence families that they had been completely misled by the Rudd government’s promises during the election campaign, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel announced in October 2008 that the free ADF family healthcare trial would be expanded to include Townsville, Darwin and, in Victoria, Puckapunyal. He said:
The trial is being expanded to fully test the delivery model, and ensure the development of evidence based policy to implement the Government’s commitment to progressively extend free basic health care for ADF dependants.
The initial phase of the trial is set to commence in early 2009 for 2,700 ADF dependants within the Singleton (NSW), Cairns (QLD), Katherine (NT), East Sale (VIC) and the Karratha/Pilbara (WA) regions.
…            …            …
Under the trial, ADF dependants will be able to visit general practitioners at no cost for standard consultations.
ADF dependants will also receive a benefit of $300 per dependant per annum for basic dental services.
When the trial is expanded in late 2009, it will provide for a total of approximately 16,000 ADF dependants.
While government statements have clearly limited ADF family dependants’ entitlements to visits to general practitioners at no cost for standard consultations and benefits of $300 per dependant per annum for basic dental services, this is not stated in the proposed legislation, the explanatory memorandum or the minister’s second reading speech. The bill provides for the making of regulations about medical and dental treatment for a member, a cadet or a member of the family of an ADF member. Details of the medical and dental treatment available to ADF members are contained in defence instructions issued under the authority of the Secretary of the Department of Defence and the Chief of the Defence Force.
It is not clear, however, if the nature and extent of the medical and dental treatment will be detailed in the proposed regulations or whether it will be left to the discretion of the Secretary of the Department of Defence, the Chief of the Defence Force or the individual service chiefs, as is the case currently with the relevant defence instructions. In the interest of transparency and accountability, it would be appropriate if the government would give an assurance on behalf of the minister that any medical and dental care entitlements for non-ADF personnel—that is, the families—and thus expenditure be contained in regulations subject to disallowance under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 rather than in internal defence documents, such as defence instructions. I think that is a very clear and salient point. If anything, the recent fiasco with the SAS soldiers pay dispute highlights the fact that all of these things happening behind closed doors means that the service personnel and their families have no rights unless, as a last resort, they can come to parliament and have matters disallowed.
Turning to the last schedule of this omnibus bill, schedule 3 makes minor but important amendments that affect the joint defence facility at Pine Gap in the Northern Territory. As I have indicated, this is supported by the opposition. In the late 1960s, Prime Minister Harold Holt entered into an agreement with the United States which led to the establishment of the Joint Defence Space Research Facility, a top-secret base 20 kilometres south of Alice Springs at Pine Gap. Minister for External Affairs Paul Hasluck, as he then was, signed the agreement in December 1966. Pine Gap is run by Raytheon. As at 14 May 2008, there were 50 Australian Federal Police Protective Service officers stationed at Pine Gap. This schedule, which contains amendments to the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952, has been developed to explicitly provide that the joint defence facility at Pine Gap is a special defence undertaking and a prohibited area, and it inserts a purposive clause to make it clear that the defence power is not the only constitutional basis relied upon to support the act. This measure has been developed as a consequence of protestors questioning the Commonwealth’s ability to successfully prosecute the existing offences under the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952 in relation to the joint defence facility at Pine Gap.
The Pine Gap facility has been the site of many protests over some long time, generally anti‑nuclear or anti United States in nature. Protesters attempting to enter the facility have generally been charged with minor summary offences. However, in May 2007, four pacifists who cut through wire fences to access the facility in December 2005 faced court charged with indictable offences under the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952. They were the first to be charged upon indictment under the act. The four were convicted in June 2007 in, I think, the district court of the Northern Territory and together were fined over $3,000. But, in February 2008, their convictions were overturned by the Northern Territory Court of Criminal Appeal and His Honour Mr Justice Brian Martin found that there had been ‘a miscarriage of justice’ and that the defendants were deprived of a possible defence, namely establishing that the facility was not necessary for defence purposes, which is a threshold issue within the terms of the act. I pause to say that, having read the case, I think it would have been quite obvious to any jurist that that defence was available to the defendants and was erroneously removed from consideration by the jury.
The amendments contained within this part of the bill proceed by (a) specifically declaring that the joint defence facility at Pine Gap is, without question, a special defence undertaking and a prohibited area for the purposes of the act, leaving no matter now open to question and (b) inserting a purposive clause to make it clear that the parliament’s power to legislate with respect to the defence of the Commonwealth is not the only constitutional basis relied upon for the act. The amendments will specifically declare the facility a special defence undertaking and a prohibited area directly under the act rather than by the existing process—which requires a ministerial declaration—and will provide a firmer basis for any future prosecutions by removing the opportunity for argument about the validity of a declaration, as I have indicated. These protections are essential for a facility of such sensitivity and importance to Australia’s national defence and external relations in order to deter mischief makers and those with other, more sinister intent. I commend this bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION (MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2009-03-11,"—It is with a certain degree of alarm that I rise to speak on this bill this afternoon. Two-thirds of the Defence Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2008 is entirely sensible, for many of the reasons Senator Johnston has just outlined; one-third of the bill is patently ridiculous. It is sensible to establish the red crystal as an alternative symbol to the red cross and the red crescent. The red crystal does not have any religious, cultural or political connotations. It is equally sensible for the members of the ADF and their families to have dental care, for many of the reasons Senator Johnston has outlined in detail. The Greens support those two-thirds of the bill.
Schedule 3, relating to Pine Gap, is the part of this bill that I describe as ridiculous because the Australian parliament is being asked to legislate to further protect a facility about which parliamentarians know and are allowed to know virtually nothing. The 1999 report No. 26 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties testifies to this fact. What we are witnessing today is not informed democratic policymaking. Because of the substantial secrecy surrounding this facility and its protection from parliamentary oversight, Australians have been told very little, or else have been told lies and misinformation, about the history of this facility. In 1966 Australians were told the facility was to be a weather station. Later, the official cover, which still resides in the name, was that it was a space research centre.
In fact, Pine Gap is a ground receiving station for space based intelligence gathering. It is the most strategically important United States base in Australia and is probably a vital component of fighting the illegal war against the people of Iraq. Its monitoring of radar, cell phone, radio and long-distance telephone communication enables it to provide targeting information for US air and ground forces. When the United States launched the shock and awe bombardment of Iraq, it is very likely that information from Pine Gap pointed the missiles and so-called smart weapons toward Iraqi military targets—and also toward the many thousands of civilians who died in that initial phase of the Iraq war and in the long years since then. Now that the United States is attacking so-called insurgents, information from Pine Gap tracks and monitors telephone communications, identifying and tracking suspects and leading troops, missiles and munitions to the houses and neighbourhoods in which they live. Many thousands of civilians continue to be killed as collateral damage in these campaigns.
Pine Gap is also a major component of the proposed missile defence shield—the so-called ‘Star Wars’ project. This shield proposes using satellite based weapons and ground based interceptors to shoot down incoming missiles. It has been described as attempting to hit a bullet with a bullet. The United States has spent billions developing this system, but it is still a long way from making it work. Both China and Russia, predictably, have strongly denounced the project as threatening a new arms race. The Senate is being asked this afternoon to enact legislation that would protect the United States’s spy facility from Australian citizens, citizens who might dare to have an opinion about infrastructure on our soil being used to kill civilians in an illegal war or about our population becoming a nuclear target because of this vital component to the United States’s nuclear-war-fighting machine being on our soil—or citizens who might have an opinion about whether a peppercorn is enough rent for the price that our country pays for hosting Pine Gap.
The second reason that schedule 3 of this bill, the part relating to Pine Gap, is ridiculous is that it is putting a very old Cold War piece of legislation on life support. In my role as Australian Greens heritage spokesperson, I wonder whether it would be possible to heritage list legislation like this and then set it aside like the relic that it is. The Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952 became law in our country to secure the sites for British atomic weapons testing. The law protected nuclear test sites ‘from observation by any unauthorised person’ so that the nuclear tests could release massive and harmful quantities of radiation off the coast of my home state of Western Australia and in South Australia. A very long way from decision makers in London, the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act ensured that these bombs were safe from observation, from demonstrators and from Australian citizens—apart from those who found themselves unlucky enough to be deliberately exposed.
I am interested to know why the Attorney-General thinks this 1952 piece of legislation demands beefing up. The reason is very interesting. It is because when Attorney-General Philip Ruddock used the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act for the very first time in its history in trying to send four Christian pacifists to jail for seven years Attorney-General Ruddock lost and the Howard government set this train in motion. Four Christian pacifists entered Pine Gap on 9 December 2005 after informing the Minister for Defence and the media of their intention to conduct a peaceful and non-violent citizens’ inspection of the facility. Despite engaging an army of QCs at taxpayers’ expense to inflict the maximum punishment and place the maximum limitation on the courts hearing the defence’s justification and legal argument, Philip Ruddock lost that case. The Northern Territory Court of Criminal Appeal quashed the convictions of the Christian pacifists. The court found that citizens had the right to challenge whether the prohibited area was necessary for the purpose of the defence of Australia.
It is very unfortunate that Attorney-General Robert McClelland is following his predecessor’s lead, finishing what Mr Ruddock started by amending the law to further crack down on peaceful protest. Given this series of events, the amendments proposed in this legislation can accurately be described as retrospective revenge that would ‘punish and frighten those thinking about engaging in non-violent resistance against Pine Gap’s role in war making’, as a number of the submissions to the inquiry stated. The amendments would inhibit citizens from ever challenging whether Pine Gap is necessary for Australia’s defence in future, which is an erosion of the democratic rights of which Australians are proud. This schedule of the bill is unnecessary because adequate legislation, in particular the Crimes Act 1914, already exists to protect Pine Gap from trespass or from acts of aggression. If it is such a core element of Australia’s national security, what Pine Gap does not need is legislative protection; it needs perimeter patrol—especially when Christian pacifists have politely provided forewarning of their intention to non-violently enter the facility to pray. If it is indeed such a sophisticated intelligence-gathering facility, the capacity to gather intelligence about its immediate environment should perhaps be enhanced.
Amendments to the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952 making Pine Gap a special defence undertaking and a prohibited area are excessive, are corrosive of democratic principles and should not be supported. I foreshadow that the Australian Greens will make amendments to remove this schedule of the bill, retaining the red crystal and dental components but deleting the elements relating to Pine Gap.
Before I take my seat, I would like to put on the record what is probably a correction to one of Senator Johnston’s comments about people who have a long history of demonstration at Pine Gap—and that includes me—and who attended the Pine Gap demonstration in 2002. In my experience, these people are not anti the United States; they are anti war. They were there, we were there, to protest the coming bombardment and the loss of life of tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians, and they will be back whether or not this bill is passed into law.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION (MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-03-11,"—I rise in support of the Defence Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2008. The purpose of the bill, as has been outlined, is to address three separate policy measures. The first amendment is to the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 and the Criminal Code Act 1995 to incorporate protocol III to the Geneva convention. As has been said, protocol III recognises the red crystal as being a third distinctive emblem of the International Red Cross, in addition to the Red Cross and the Red Crescent. The second amendment is to the Defence Act 1903 and provides regulations for the possession, storage, dispensing and administration of pharmaceuticals by Australian Defence Force healthcare professionals. Its effect will be to standardise regulations to overcome state-based irregularities and discrepancies.
Finally, the bill will amend the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952 to ensure that the Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap is adequately protected under legislation to prevent unauthorised access. This final amendment follows deficiencies identified during the trial and appeal of four activists who broke into the facility in 2005. This bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for inquiry and the committee received 11 submissions. The committee reported in February 2009 and recommended that the bill be passed without amendment.
I would like to address the most controversial aspect of the bill—namely, as addressed by Senator Ludlam and relating to the third amendment, the provision of protection against unauthorised entry to the Pine Gap facility. As I think is generally acknowledged, protests at Pine Gap have occurred relatively regularly over recent decades. Any attempts to enter the facility have generally resulted in minor charges being brought. However, in December 2005, as outlined, four self-described—as I understand it—‘Christian pacifists’ armed with boltcutters entered a technical support area of the base. It reminded me of a section in Matthew in the Bible:
Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s and unto God the things that are God’s.
Apparently, it might be suggested, that is respected by some in theory but not in practice. After all, I think it is acknowledged that the Christian pacifists were trespassing with clear intent to challenge the authority and existing law that regulated the facility.
In June 2007, they were convicted of the offence of entering a prohibited area and were fined over $3,000, but they did not receive a custodial sentence. The Director of Public Prosecutions appealed the leniency of the sentence and the protestors appealed their convictions in turn. The result, as has been outlined, was the acquittal of all four defendants. At issue in those proceedings was whether the facility at Pine Gap was a defence facility for the purposes of the act. The amendments in this bill seek to clarify that position. I acknowledge at the outset that it is an emotive and emotional issue. Joint facilities raise questions of sovereign rights at the best of times. They also raise questions of the right of Australians to know what is going on within them. However, it is also fair to say that opponents of joint facilities, whether Christian pacifists or not, are generally strong supporters of disarmament, often unilateral disarmament. For this reason we need to separate fact from fiction.
If you google ‘Pine Gap’, you will find a massive amount of information on this facility which is either unsubstantiated or just plain wrong. To get at the facts we need to go back to the beginning. During the Second World War, Labor Prime Minister John Curtin changed Australian strategic priorities. In a statement to the Melbourne Herald in December 1941, following the attack on Pearl Harbor and amid fears about the imminent fall of Singapore, he made the much quoted comment:
Without any inhibitions of any kind, I make it quite clear that Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom.
From that time, our forces fought side by side in the South Pacific, and our fleets fought together in the Battle of the Coral Sea. It is also important to note that allied intelligence organisations were established at this time. At the end of the war, the Chifley Labor government put in place a permanent collaborative arrangement for our intelligence links. In 1951 our links in defence and security were formalised in the ANZUS treaty under then Prime Minister Menzies. For over 50 years since, the ANZUS treaty has been the cornerstone of our strategic relationship with the United States. That treaty is founded on our common values of democracy, freedom and the rule of law. It is also—arguably more importantly—based on our shared interests globally as well as in the Asia-Pacific region.
Fast-forward to the 1960s and Australia agreed to play host to joint facilities at North West Cape, Pine Gap and Nurrungar. Pine Gap, along with the other bases, was a project conceived and developed in the Cold War era to support global security. In 1966 the then Minister for External Affairs, Mr Hasluck, on behalf of the Australian government signed an agreement with the United States. That agreement was to establish the Joint Defence Space Research Facility. The head agreement, as it is known, came into effect on 9 December 1966. Significantly, it was amended in 1988. I will return to that milestone and set of negotiations later. Initially, the agreement was terminable at one year’s notice by either side. Since 1988 three years notice has been required to terminate the agreement. The agreement has also been subject to review, on average every 10 years.
Pine Gap was billed as a top-secret base. However, it did not take long for Australians to become aware that it was located 20 kilometres south of Alice Springs. Construction began in early 1967 and the infrastructure was completed in 1968. It began full operations in June 1970. Although the head agreement is not a public document, it is known that the agreement required that the Australian and US governments would establish, maintain and operate in Australia a facility for general defence research in the space field; the Australian government would provide the land for the facility and it would remain vested in the Australian government; the US government would be accorded ‘all necessary rights of access to, and joint use and occupation of, the land’; and the land would ‘be considered a secure area’. Initially, there was not a genuine joint arrangement in the management and operations of the facilities, although, it must be stated, there was an unusually high level of Australian knowledge of the more sensitive operations and of the satellite and communications systems they supported.
Today, the role and functions of the facility are known. Firstly, the facility collects intelligence and provides an early warning system for the launch of ballistic missiles. Secondly, the facility aids in the detection of the proliferation of ballistic missiles and can help to identify surprise or accidental nuclear missile attack. That means the facility makes a vital contribution to the deterrence of conflict. It also contributes to efforts to halt the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. I cannot overstate the importance of this function to Australia and our allies. International verification of arms control is a means to achieving agreements between nations to limit, reduce and over time eliminate their arsenals of nuclear weapons. For that reason, effective verification is a key component in the disarmament process.
We cannot hope that nations will agree to strategic arms reduction agreements if their success cannot be measured and verified. If agreements fail it is generally because stringent verification requirements cannot be met to the satisfaction of both sides. Through early warning, communications and other functions, this facility promotes confidence in the balance of deterrence. This confidence must be maintained if superpowers such as the United States and Russia are to keep disarming. It is a contribution we must continue to make to our national as well as our global security.
The agreement as it stands today does not in any way impinge on our sovereign rights. This is a recurring theme in criticisms of the facility. I believe it stems mainly from the secrecy which shrouded the project in its early days. Since 1988 our relationship with the United States with respect to the joint facility has matured. Under the terms of the 1988 agreement, negotiated under the aegis of Prime Minister Hawke by, I believe, then Defence Minister Beazley, we are engaged in a policy of ‘full knowledge and concurrence’. As I said previously, this was not always the case. In the early seventies and early eighties only a handful of Australian personnel were directly involved in the central work of the facility. There was also a significant degree of secrecy surrounding the work of the facility.
However, following the negotiations in 1988, much of that changed. As a result of the new agreement Australian commanders are in charge of shifts and an Australian holds the position of deputy commander of the facility and becomes acting commander in the absence of the commander. That was not always the case; it is now. Also, there are now Australian personnel and contractors on every shift and, most importantly, we use the capabilities of the facility for our own national security priorities without United States veto powers. So we have control of the facility, command of the facility and sovereign rights over the facility, while we maintain an independent and highly valued contribution to the work of the facility.
All this points to the fact that the Australian government has full visibility of the role and functions of Pine Gap. Of the 800 personnel at the base, over 60 per cent are Australian government employees or contractors. Our personnel includes members of the AFP as well as members of the ADF. The work of our senior officials ensures our full knowledge and concurrence will continue. More importantly, the new agreement heralded a commitment by the Hawke government to inform the public as fully as possible about the facility. The thinking behind that policy shift in 1998 was and is simple: if there is a better understanding of the role of the facility, there may well be increased public support for it. There are of course limitations on what can be revealed publicly. Successive Australian governments in practice have not commented on intelligence matters. There is, however, enough information publicly available on the importance of Pine Gap, an importance based not only on our obligations to our allies but also on our national aims for the reduction of arms and nuclear weapons.
On Pine Gap’s 40th anniversary in 2007, the then defence minister said:
Our intelligence relationship already strong has been reinforced over the past five years. This co-operation, which now borders on seamless, has seen an increase in information exchange, technical cooperation and embedded liaison officers.
He went on to say:
The public can have confidence that its elected representatives are responsibly and accountably overseeing such activities.
Our alliance with the US provides us with crucial military benefits such as unique intelligence; sophisticated weaponry, technology and equipment; logistics, training and operational experience through exchange programs and exercises; and defence research and technical cooperation. The history of this interaction means that we now make a significant military contribution to our own national security.
The question then becomes whether as a society we are confident in the protections afforded by our democratic institutions. It is a debate that will no doubt continue as long as the need for alliances and treaties between nations exists. I acknowledge that not all Australians will support the existence of this joint facility. However, as we all know, terrorism is a global challenge and we must continue to play our part. I would like to reiterate that intelligence collected at Pine Gap contributes to the verification of arms control and achieving disarmament agreements. Verification is vital to the arms control process. Therefore, the importance of our contribution should not be underestimated. In this respect, we should all be aware that, if you will the outcome, you need to will the means.
The joint defence facility Pine Gap makes an important contribution to the security interests of both Australia and the United States. It serves a modern purpose. Pine Gap is an outstanding illustration of the commitment and level of cooperation that has been achieved in Australia’s close defence relationship with the US. It is also an Australian defence base. The changes to the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act will maintain an appropriate level of protection for the facility Pine Gap. The protections are in line with those in place for our other defence bases. We need to ensure that Pine Gap continues to make significant contributions to our national and global security.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2009-03-11,"—In summing up the debate on the Defence Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2008, I want to thank all participants in this debate from all sides—and I know that they were not all singing from the same song sheet—for the very informed contributions that each senator has made to this discussion.
The bill amends three separate acts. The first set of amendments amend the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 to specifically incorporate a reference to and description of the red crystal emblem and a reference to protocol III in part IV of that act and annexing protocol III as a schedule to that act. The bill further amends the Criminal Code Act 1995 to specifically incorporate protocol III and the red crystal in the dictionary to the Criminal Code and ensures that improper use of the red crystal is caught by the offence of improper use of the emblems of the Geneva convention. The amendment also ensures that the new emblem is used only with the consent of the Minister for Defence.
The red crystal will be of significant benefit to combat zones to help secure the safety of eligible humanitarian workers from all countries, regardless of their location or political situation. Incorporation of protocol III would be consistent with Australia’s longstanding support for the Geneva conventions and their additional protocols. The new emblem is unlikely to be used in Australia for either indicative or protected purpose, given the longstanding recognition accorded to the red cross emblem. The new emblem may, however, be used by the ADF in certain regions overseas. Incorporation would further demonstrate and enhance Australia’s credentials in international humanitarian law. It would also enable Australia to encourage states, both within our region and beyond, that are not yet a party to the protocol to ratify it.
The second set of amendments are to the Defence Act 1903 to explicitly enable the making of regulations to cover the provision of medical and dental treatment, including pharmaceuticals, to an ADF member or cadet or member of the family of an ADF member. The amendments to section 124 of the act enable a more comprehensive regime in the Defence Force regulations. In relation to pharmaceuticals, it is intended that the regulations will cover the possession, storage, supply, dispensing and administration of schedule pharmaceuticals by ADF pharmacists, ADF medics, ADF nurses and civilian health professionals engaged by the ADF. The effects of the amendments would be to create a regime that would ensure that the ADF and its members are not hindered in the uniform application of their duties overseas by competing state and territory laws.
The third issue covered in the bill relates to the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952 to explicitly provide that the Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap is a special defence undertaking and a prohibited area. The bill will insert a purposive clause to make it clear that the defence power is not the only constitutional basis relied upon to support the act. These protections are essential to a facility of such sensitivity and importance to Australia’s defence and external relations to deter mischief makers and those with more sinister intent. I once again thank honourable senators for their support for the bill and commend it to the chamber.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2009-03-11,"—The Aviation Legislation Amendment (2008 Measures No. 2) Bill 2008 continues the work on aviation safety and security commenced by the coalition government, and generally speaking it will be supported by the coalition. Amending the Aviation Transport Security Act to expand the range of information that the department is able to collect is, we believe, a sensible step in ensuring that aviation security is as effective and efficient as possible for all parties. In addition to monitoring compliance with the act, the department will be able to gather information that will enable them to make better informed decisions on security matters.
As the challenges facing aviation security change it is important that our responses adapt so that measures taken to ensure the safety of Australian skies are as effective as possible and do not impose undue costs on industry players, which is of course of paramount importance. The coalition are happy to help ensure that this is the case. The key to the new powers being legislated for in this amendment will be the scope of information collected. I want to assure the Senate and the aviation industry participants that the coalition will ensure that the supporting regulations are subject to scrutiny before they are finalised.
The amendments permitting the secretary of the department to delegate his authority are, we think, a sensible step towards ensuring that the government is able to respond to emergencies in a timely fashion. Thankfully, Australia has had a relatively peaceful record when it comes to aviation security. This is due in no small part to the vigilance of those charged with ensuring a secure environment in the skies and the actions of past governments from both sides of politics over the years. It would be imprudent to discount the possibility of an emergency situation arising in the future. In any such emergency the demands on the secretary would be immense and, in a rapidly developing situation, action may be required without delay. The current legislation only allows the secretary to delegate his authority under the act to another officer within the department. This legislation would enable the secretary to delegate his authority to an officer in any other department with national security responsibilities. Such a delegation would not be taken lightly. The secretary can still retain overall authority under the proposed legislation, can set restrictions on the delegation and can withdraw it when the emergency passes. These amendments would ensure that if Australian skies faced a prolonged emergency, whether it was a pre-planned situation or not, our aviation security apparatus would not be left in a position where decisions vital to national security could not be made.
There are amendments allowing for copying of cockpit voice recorder information for testing and maintenance purposes, and we believe that that deserves bipartisan support. The proposal is the result of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau’s investigation into the tragic Lockhart River air crash up my way in Cape York in 2005. The cockpit voice recorder on the crashed plane was found to be faulty. As a result, no audio recovered from the recorder could be confirmed as having been recorded during the accident flight. The bill will clear any doubt that the copying of cockpit voice recorder information for maintenance purposes is permissible and will enable these kinds of faults to be discovered and dealt with more easily. These amendments were first proposed when the coalition were in government and we are still happy to support them. I understand there may be an amendment in relation to this aspect of the bill; perhaps I will speak more about that in the committee stage.
Finally, the changes proposed to the reporting of aviation incidents and penalties associated with the failure to report such incidents are another idea that the coalition will support. Allowing the executive director of the transport safety investigation to require further information after receiving a report on an immediately reportable matter or a routine reportable matter will ensure that the accident and incident database contains accurate and sufficient information on each immediately reportable matter and routine reportable matter. The penalty for failing to report an immediately reportable matter will be raised to 12 months imprisonment and, as a result, will bypass the statute of limitations and mean that there is no limit to when a prosecution can be instigated. Given the current penalty under the Crimes Act, prosecutions must occur within one year. It can take many years for unreported incidents to be discovered and, as a result, these breaches cannot be prosecuted.
Additionally, under the proposed legislation failing to provide a full written report of an immediately reportable matter or a routine reportable matter will attract a penalty of six months imprisonment and prosecution could begin at any time within six years of the offence. In the case of the Lockhart River air crash in 2005, the failure to report the routine reportable matter was not discovered until many years after the alleged commission of the offences. Failing to report these immediately reportable matters or routine reportable matters can be indicative of a culture that gives safety a low priority. It is important, therefore, to deter such a culture. Increasing the penalties for failing to report or provide full details regarding aviation incidents will maintain this deterrence.
We do have a good aviation industry in Australia and have had for some time, but there are some difficulties with the industry. Certainly the Labor government’s increase of the passenger movement charge from $38 to $47 in Mr Swan’s first budget did cause some difficulties in the airline industry and particularly in the tourism industry up my way around Cairns. Cairns is already struggling with difficulties associated with the cutbacks in both domestic and international services. The global financial crisis, which has been amplified by Kevin’s financial crisis, as I call it—the KFC—has really made it very difficult for the tourism industry, particularly around Cairns. I am distressed that this increase in the passenger movement charge, this additional tax on tourists entering Cairns, has made the industry less competitive and certainly has not been appropriate for the time.
Furthermore, our aviation industry is in many instances typified by the Royal Flying Doctor Service. It celebrated its 80th birthday recently, but during the celebrations the government scrapped critical funding earlier announced by the coalition that would have enabled its services to be expanded. I suspect the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, who has an inner-city Sydney electorate, does not really understand the importance of the Royal Flying Doctor Service to those of us who do not live in the fortunate cities of Australia, but it is a real difficulty. Cutting back its funding was, indeed, unfortunate. Certainly in Queensland the Royal Flying Doctor Service has a major impact on the health and safety of regional communities. We are distressed that there was not more consultation. I am very disappointed that the Queensland Premier, Anna Bligh, did not make more of a song and dance about the cutback in the budget of the Royal Flying Doctor Service.
I am also very disappointed that the Queensland Premier, the Queensland Treasurer or any of the three members of state parliament who represent the Cairns area—or, indeed, the state member who represents the Whitsunday area—did not make more of an objection to Mr Swan, the federal Treasurer, also a Queenslander, about the increases in taxes. One would have thought that the members for Whitsunday, Mulgrave, Cairns and Barron River, who are all Labor members, would have been able to use their personal influence with Mr Swan to stop the impost of this additional tax, which would have such a big impact on the aviation industry and therefore the tourism industry of North Queensland and the Whitsundays.
While we do have a very good aviation industry in Australia and our pioneers—Charles Kingsford Smith, Bert Hinkler, the Reverend John Flynn—did a great deal to bring Australia closer to the world, aviation is a much-needed service for the bush. I am concerned that the Queensland government’s penny-pinching attitude to a regional airline called MacAir has led to its demise. MacAir had the Queensland government contract for servicing remote parts of the state, but they were going broke because the subsidy given by the Queensland government simply was not sufficient to make ends meet. I know that MacAir approached the Queensland government, but to no avail. As a result, MacAir closed its doors and that left many parts of Queensland without a regular air service. Now there has been emergency action taken to try to get a service back, and there has been a replacement service, but all of this would have been unnecessary had the Queensland government had the understanding and fortitude to do something about that before the collapse happened. But it is just another indication of the way Queensland has been mismanaged for several years now.
I want to now talk a little bit about another important aspect of aviation—again, you will excuse me if I relate it particularly to my home state of Queensland. I come from the north. I am familiar with a little town on the Gulf of Carpentaria called Karumba, a great town, a great tourist destination. The so-called grey nomads head there in droves. It is a great fishing spot for recreational fishermen, but a very significant commercial fishing industry also operates at Karumba. It is a community which, with the floods, has been out of road contact with the rest of Australia for almost two months now, I think. If it was any other town in Australia that was cut off by road from the rest of Australia, there would be outrage. You would have the Prime Minister visiting there and making one of his very special media announcements. But this has not happened in the case of Karumba. Karumba is where it is and people understand that, and they do put up with a lot of difficulties because of this. But those difficulties could be overcome if there were a decent airstrip there.
—Ah, the Conroy runway!
—Indeed, Senator; we have raised this at estimates. I would call the runway anything, even after a nice guy but a failed communications minister! I would still call it after him if we could get the Commonwealth to commit some money to it. But I am disappointed. It is not something that the Commonwealth in the past has dealt with, but under the so-called stimulus package here is a great opportunity for that money to be spent. The surface needs to be sealed, and it also needs to be extended.
Now the Queensland government, who do have a responsibility in this area, have been approached for years by this community to do something to provide a decent service into Karumba to support the tourism industry, support the fishing industry and help in times like these when you cannot get road access there. But the Queensland government have done very little over the years. Just recently they said, ‘Look, we’ll put in one‑third of the cost of resealing if the council puts in one‑third and the Commonwealth puts in one‑third’—a total sum of a massive $360,000-odd, as I recall.
What it needs is a much larger commitment of $5 million or $6 million to extend the runway and to seal it. I would have thought that would have been a high priority for the Queensland government over the last four or five years. Regrettably, it has not been, and again I can only express concern that the local state member, the member for Mount Isa, who just happens to be a Labor member, has not been able to get the Queensland government to deal with this airstrip over that period of time. Why this would be I cannot understand. Of course, now, a couple of weeks before the election in Queensland, we are getting promises flying right, left and centre. But I think the locals would be thinking a bit like me: if you are going to express some concern about it, then why didn’t you do it during the past 10 years when you have been in government, rather than leaving it until the last two weeks? I do hope at least the federal government, with all of this money they have available and will be splashing around everywhere, could use some of it for a decent infrastructure project to help the Karumba people with an extended and sealed runway.
While I am on that, I want to briefly mention another runway that desperately needs assistance. It is on Horn Island, which, as many senators would know, is in the Torres Strait. It is the entry into the straits and all of those communities up there. It is used by any number of Commonwealth and Queensland government agencies. But this airstrip needs a massive upgrade of some $12 million to make it serviceable. Again, you cannot drive to Thursday Island. You cannot drive to the island communities of the Torres Strait. The only way you can get there is by an aircraft into Horn Island and the ferry across to Thursday Island, or a smaller plane from Horn Island out to one of the outlying communities. And yet this airstrip, which was built during the war—that is how long it has been around—desperately needs strengthening and upgrading. The result, according to Sinclair Knight Merz, is that the current pavement of the runway does not have structural capacity to cater for the continual use of the aircraft Qantas want to fly in there—the Q400. There is serious rutting and cracking and this has resulted in a situation where there is a medium to high risk of a crash or a serious incident occurring if that aircraft continues to be used.
A recommendation has been made for the runway to be extended and upgraded, as per a Queensland Transport report, but unfortunately there has not been any assistance from the Queensland government. This part of Queensland is represented by a member of parliament who, unfortunately, is another Labor member, but nothing seems to have been done about this most important piece of infrastructure. I want to repeat this: we want this airstrip not just because we want everyone to have an airstrip; this is a vital means of entry—the only means of entry—into the Torres Strait, not only for the convenience and ongoing daily work life of the inhabitants but also for any number of important Commonwealth and Australia-wide border protection issues. But nothing has been done. It is a Queensland airstrip. It should have been upgraded by the Queensland government well prior to now. I regret that neither the local member nor, it seems, the Premier have had the fortitude to do anything about it, even though the campaign for upgrading it has been going for a number of years.
There is a lot of money splashing around in the Commonwealth’s coffers these days with the so-called structural package. I will not go into who is going to pay for that. Someone will have to pay for that in the future, but we do not seem to worry about that. We opposed it, but it is there. A good use of some of that money would be to help the Queensland government upgrade the airstrip. I will keep calling for the upgrade. Quite clearly, neither the local, state nor federal members, regrettably all Labor, seem to have been able to use their influence. I will keep calling for this.
None of that alters the fact that the coalition will be supporting this bill that is before the parliament. We think it is an important update. It will build on the strong foundations left by the previous government and will enable us to maintain a solid aviation security apparatus in an efficient and effective way.",SENATE,<title>AVIATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 2) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-03-11,"—I thank Senator Ian Macdonald for his comments and contributions to this debate on the Aviation Legislation Amendment (2008 Measures No. 2) Bill 2008, although I have to disagree entirely with his argument concerning Queensland and the stimulus package. I note that he has made these comments in the weeks before a Queensland state election.
This bill makes four key amendments to aviation security and safety legislation. The amendments to the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 will expand the information collection and delegation powers of the secretary of the department. The sort of information to be collected may include information relating to the screening of people, vehicles, goods or cargo. The other amendment to the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 will improve the robustness and flexibility of the aviation security framework to ensure a timely response to threats of unlawful interference with aircraft.
The amendment to the Civil Aviation Act 1988 will improve the reliability of cockpit voice recorder information for future safety investigation purposes by clarifying the legality of necessary maintenance practices. On many occasions cockpit voice recorder information is the essential piece in the puzzle for determining why an accident occurred. We must make sure that the source of this information is functioning and reliable and that the information is only used for legitimate testing and maintenance purposes.
Lastly, the amendments to the Transport Safety Investigation Act 2003 will improve the workability of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau’s accident and incident reporting scheme. It is essential that safety data is recorded on accidents and incidents for the improvement of future transport safety. The amendments contained in this bill will further enhance Australia’s aviation security and safety regime.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2009-03-11,"—I want to speak this evening about a newly formed organisation called the Pacific Friends of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. It is a very important new initiative in the fight against three terrible diseases which cause extraordinary suffering and very significant numbers of deaths in our region particularly, which is a matter of great interest to this organisation. I acknowledge that Senator McLucas, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing, was also present at the launch of the Pacific Friends in Sydney the week before last. It was a very impressive occasion.
Each year, the combined toll of HIV-AIDS, TB and malaria is around five million people worldwide. The poorest people in the poorest communities are the worst affected, and children in particular suffer as victims of disease or as the orphans left when their parents die. The statistics for each disease are beyond alarming. It is estimated that, in relation to HIV-AIDS, 33 million people worldwide are infected with HIV, 95 per cent of whom live in developing countries. In 2007, approximately 2½ million people were newly infected with the virus. In the same year, more than two million people died of AIDS related causes. Indeed, HIV-AIDS has killed more than 25 million people world wide. AIDS is the leading cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa and the fourth-leading cause of death worldwide. Since just 2005, the number of women and girls infected with HIV has increased in every region of the world, with rates rising more rapidly in Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America. In fact, women and girls account for 50 per cent of all people living with HIV worldwide and 61 per cent of HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa. The estimated number of children living with HIV increased from 1½ million in 2001 to 2½ million in 2007. Almost 90 per cent of all HIV-positive children live in sub-Saharan Africa. Globally, over 15 million children under the age of 18 have lost one or both parents to AIDS. It is estimated that per capita growth in half of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa is falling by 0.5 per cent to 1.2 per cent each year as a direct result of the impact of AIDS.
In relation to TB, more than 2 billion people—that is, one third of the world’s population—are infected, over 90 per cent of them in developing countries. Globally, 1.7 million deaths from TB occurred in 2006. Due to a combination of economic decline, the breakdown of health systems, the insufficient application of TB control measures, the spread of HIV-AIDS and the emergence of multidrug-resistant TB, the rate of TB infection is not declining in many developing countries. Unfortunately, HIV and tuberculosis form an absolutely lethal combination, each speeding the other’s progress. In 2006, more than 700,000 people living with HIV were infected with TB and 200,000 HIV-positive people died from TB. In 2007, the African, South-East Asian and western Pacific regions accounted for 83 per cent of total TB cases. The vast majority of deaths are in the developing world, with more than half of all deaths occurring in Asia. More than 75 per cent of TB related disease and death occurs amongst relatively young people—those between the ages of 15 and 54—which is also the most economically active segment of the population. TB is consequently estimated to deplete the incomes of the world’s poorest communities by a total of US$12 billion.
Finally, the third disease which the global fund addresses is malaria. Each year, malaria causes nearly one million deaths, mostly among children under five years of age, and an additional 189 million to 327 million clinical cases, the majority of which occur in the world’s poorest countries. Almost half the world’s population—3.3 billion people—is at risk of malaria, and the proportion increases yearly due to deteriorating health systems, growing drug and insecticide resistance, climate change and, of course, war. In 2006, 86 per cent of malaria cases occurred in Africa. Each day, approximately 2,200 Africans die from malaria; 85 per cent are children under five years of age. Of those cases that occurred outside Africa, 80 per cent were in India, Sudan, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Pakistan. It is rural and poor populations which carry the overwhelming burden of malaria, because access to effective treatment, which is so simple, is extremely limited. Malaria has been estimated to cost Africa more than US$12 billion every year in lost GDP, even though it could be controlled for a fraction of that sum.
The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria was established in 2002 as a unique, global public-private partnership dedicated to attracting and disbursing additional resources to prevent and treat HIV-AIDS, TB and malaria. It was developed after the action of the United Nations and, in particular, then Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who called for the creation of a global fund to channel additional resources to fight those three diseases. The UN General Assembly committed to it and, soon after, the G8 endorsed and helped finance it. It was launched in 2002, and the first round of grants was then approved to 36 countries. Since then, the global fund has become the main source of finance for programs to fight these three diseases. In fact, it has committed more than $15 billion in 140 countries for prevention, treatment and care programs. It is designed to be a new and better approach to international health funding. It is a partnership between governments, civil society, the private sector and affected communities. It works in close collaboration with other bilateral and multilateral organisations, supporting their work through substantially increased funding.
The fund is guided by seven important principles, which I would like to briefly enunciate: to operate as a financial instrument, not an implementing entity; to make available and leverage additional financial resources, as I have said; to support programs that actually evolve from national plans and priorities; to operate in a balanced manner in terms of different regions, diseases and interventions; to pursue an integrated and balanced approach to prevention and treatment; to evaluate proposals through independent review processes; and to operate with transparency and accountability. In all its work, the global fund seeks to ensure the effectiveness of its financial aid, modelled closely on the principles of the Paris declaration. These principles are helping the global fund to achieve its vision. It is a pretty simple vision, but a pretty compelling one: a vision of a world free of the burden of HIV-AIDS, TB and malaria.
As part of this collective effort of the global fund, a new initiative was launched on 23 February this year: the Pacific Friends of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. It is the seventh friends group of the global fund around the world. It is an advocacy organisation in its own way, founded to create awareness of the global fund and its work across the Pacific region. It aims to build very important political and financial support for the fund’s fight against the three diseases, to mobilise regional awareness of the threat posed by these three pandemics to societies and, importantly, to economies in the region and to mobilise support for the global fund in its vital role resourcing effective country based plans to reduce the impact and spread of the diseases.
The global fund benefits very much from the work of the friends organisations, and this one hopefully will be no exception. It is chaired by Wendy McCarthy and includes amongst its number Andrew Forrest, the Rt Hon. Helen Clark, Professor Tony Cunningham from Westmead Hospital, the Hon. Michael Kirby, Dr Nafsiah Mboi from the Indonesia National AIDS Commission and Sir Peter Barter, the former health minister of Papua New Guinea, to name just a few. It is a group of very determined people who are committed to ensuring that it does an effective job in its advocacy. I am very honoured and very pleased to have been invited to join this group as one of the inaugural Pacific Friends of the Global Fund.
—Congratulations.
—Thank you. It would not have been possible without the support of the Lowy Institute for International Policy or the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The support of the foundation in particular is beyond invaluable; it is almost incalculable. The Pacific Friends is based at the Lowy Institute in Sydney. Its inaugural executive director is Bill Bowtell, known to many of us in this parliament. He is also the Director of the HIV-AIDS Project at the Lowy Institute. I know Bill, I know his commitment and I know he will do an outstanding job. The work of the fund is in all of our interests and worthy of our strong support. It is a very important regional initiative and one of which I am delighted to be a part. I thank the inaugurators of the Pacific Friends of the Global Fund for that opportunity.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,"<title>Pacific Friends of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria</title>",Adjournment,36,1
