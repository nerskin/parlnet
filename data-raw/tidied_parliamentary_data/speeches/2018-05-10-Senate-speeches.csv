Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (09:32):  Senator Fifield, to get back to where we were last night before we moved to the adjournment, the Greens amendment was before us, and Senator Hanson-Young was asking you a number of questions about the ABC. It's clear that, in the last 48 hours, the impact of the further cuts to the ABC has become quite a significant part of the public conversation. Certainly, Friends of the ABC are very concerned about this continuing attack on Aunty, our great institution the ABC. I would like to ask you a few questions around the nature of the efficiency studies et cetera that you have indicated will be part of your further action with regard to the ABC. Firstly, Senator Fifield, do you think that the government's 2014 ABC and SBS efficiency study was effective in getting the ABC to become more efficient?

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (09:33):  If you believe that it was effective, Minister, I'm having a bit of trouble understanding why you need a further efficiency study and review now.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:33):  That was 2014. This is 2018. All Commonwealth entities should continually strive to make sure that they are the best stewards of taxpayer dollars, and I think it's a matter of good practice to have periodic reviews of efficiency in organisations. I think this will be to the benefit of the public broadcasters.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (09:34):  Are you aware of the impact of the efficiency measures that were undertaken then, and what part of the ABC's budget is actually purely for operational reasons—what percentage?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:34):  I did happily respond to questions from Senator Hanson-Young last night in relation to the ABC, although it's not directly related to the bill, and I am doing so with Senator O'Neil—again, although the ABC is not related to this bill. But if Senator O'Neil or other senators are wanting to go into detail about the ABC's operational arrangements, then those are matters that I would suggest are best saved for the ABC when they appear before estimates. As colleagues know, the ABC has operational independence and is best placed to talk about its operations and the components of that.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (09:35):  Thank you for reminding us of the upcoming opportunity of estimates. And I have to say, the acquired taste is very much one that I enjoy now, and I'm looking forward to the opportunity to get more information from the ABC about what they think the impact of your $83.7 million efficiency cut in the recent budget will be. My understanding is that the ABC's overheads are only eight per cent of its overall operational budget. How much further would the government like to push that efficiency beyond eight per cent?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:36):  As the government has indicated, there is an indexation pause for the ABC in the next triennium. The current triennium has a year to go. We have announced that there will be an efficiency review, and we will have more to say in the near future about that efficiency review. But obviously I can't pre-empt what the efficiency review will find before they have undertaken their work, and I'm sure that those who conduct that review will work cooperatively with the ABC and that the ABC will work cooperatively with them.

 (New South Wales) (09:36):  Just to be clear, you said that you'll have more to say about the efficiency review. Did you mean after it's undertaken? Or will there be more about the efficiency review before it commences?

 (New South Wales) (09:37):  Senator Fifield, do you concede that the ABC will not be able to find $83.7 million in efficiencies without staffing or content cuts?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:37):  I'll just put the ABC indexation pause into context. It represents the equivalent of about 2.6 per cent of the ABC's budget. That's 2.6c for each dollar that the ABC receives. It's important to bear in mind that, over the next triennium, the ABC will receive $3.16 billion, and what we are talking about here is $85 million. I have confidence that the ABC, following the work of the efficiency review and their own efforts, will be in a position to be even better stewards of taxpayer dollars.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-05-10,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (09:38):  I have a question for the minister on the same type of subject. We're dealing with the Communications Legislation Amendment (Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund) Bill 2017. Is there any prospect of ABC rural and regional—which is mainly radio but some TV—having anything to do with the regional innovation fund? That's one question.


The other question is related to that but also related to what my colleague opposite has been asking about. As I often point out, the ABC operates across a range of areas—triple j for the young people, and classical music, which is something I really enjoy; they have a range of different radio stations and television outlets. But a lot of them, of course, are concentrated in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide—the capital cities—where there are an enormous number of other opportunities for the listeners or the viewers to hook into other news, information and entertainment outlets. Where I am, in Townsville and Ayr, we do have some opportunities for commercial operations but, when you get a bit further out into the country, as far as radio is concerned the ABC is the principal source of information, and it does a wonderful job. It does a wonderful job with weather, with market reports, with information about what's happening around particular communities. So it's a very, very valuable service. But often it's the only one. Whilst I approve the efficiency—and, as you say, it's a 2c-in-a-dollar saving, which I think even I could save in my own household, and I'm sure the ABC will be able to do it, particularly under the new management—I am concerned that very often when there are cuts to the ABC, or very often when there aren't cuts to the ABC, you'll find that some of those in Ultimo who really don't know Australia, apart from three blocks from the Ultimo headquarters, don't quite understand the importance of the regional services of the ABC. I'm just after some sort of assurance—and I appreciate the ABC is an independent body—on that. That's my second question.


The third question: has any thought ever been given by the government to setting up, with independent budgets, not just ABC and SBS but ABC, SBS and, for want of a better term, 'ABC Regional', as a separate entity with a separate budget and separate management, which will concentrate on this vital service to many people who live outside the capital cities and ensure that it is always there? That's the third question. Has any thought ever been given to that? Is it something that the minister or his department might sometime have a look at, without diminishing services anywhere and leaving the ABC in its current form to continue doing the work it does—some of it good, most of it, I think, questionable, but let's not get into that; that's a matter of opinion. But the certainty of an ongoing service for regional Australia is something that exercises the minds of many people outside the capital cities.

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2018-05-10,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:43):  Thanks, Senator Macdonald. To your first question, as to whether any of the innovation fund that this legislation will allow ACMA to administer will be available to the ABC, the answer is that it won't be. The innovation fund is targeted essentially at private publishers in regional areas and small publishers. I should point out, though, that the ABC have, over the last year or so, identified further efficiencies, which demonstrates that that can be done, and the ABC have set up a content fund. Different parts of the ABC organisation can pitch innovative ideas to that content fund that the ABC have established. So there is that avenue there.


Through you, Chair: Senator Macdonald raises a very good point about the important role that the ABC plays in rural and regional Australia, which is why the government has legislation before the parliament to put into the ABC's act a specific reference to rural and regional Australia, which is something that people assume is already there. People assume that the ABC charter already has specific reference to an obligation to rural and regional Australia. It doesn't. We will be seeking to legislate that here, and I hope that will enjoy the support of all colleagues.


In the same bill, we also have a measure which would require the ABC to always have at least two board members from rural and regional Australia. That is a measure that we have already met, because I have appointed to the board of the ABC Georgie Somerset, who is a beef producer from Kingaroy, and Vanessa Guthrie—no relation to the MD—who is the chair of the Minerals Council of Australia. It's very important that we have that representation on the board. The board is the ultimate editorial and operational authority. So, to ensure that rural and regional Australia get the resources that they need through the ABC, that representation on the board is extremely important. That bill also contains a measure to establish an ABC rural and regional advisory committee, which the ABC would be required to consult if there were any decisions that they were taking that had a significant effect on rural and regional Australia. They are some of the safeguards that we are putting in place for rural and regional Australia.


Often, as I move around the community—and, I know, as Senator Macdonald moves around the community—while Australians have a wide range of views on the ABC, as they're entitled to do as taxpayers and consumers, I universally hear very positive things about ABC rural and regional radio. I think one of the reasons is that the ABC are close to the community. They live in the community. They get that constant feedback from the community. It's a good and important service that the ABC provide.


Coming to Senator Macdonald's third question on the ABC's structure and whether thought has been given to having a separate ABC rural and regional entity, it's not something that the government has looked at in terms of legislation. Under the current legislative framework, how they structure themselves is a matter for the ABC board. But I think that the measures in the bill that we have before the Senate to establish in the ABC Act a particular obligation for rural and regional Australia are important and will go some way towards those objectives, as will mandating that there be two people from rural and regional Australia on the board and establishing the ABC rural and regional advisory committee. Senator, I know that you will continue to put propositions forward, and I think, as the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment (Rural and Regional Measures) Bill 2017 demonstrates, we are open to doing whatever we can to further reinforce the ABC's role in rural and regional Australia.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (09:48):  Thank you for your answers this morning, Senator Fifield. You indicated that you felt that the efficiency study from 2014 was quite effective at that point in time and, if I heard you correctly, you indicated that it was time for another efficiency review. One of the consequences of the efficiency review that was undertaken was that 800 staff have left the ABC in recent years. Do you concede that jobs will be lost as a result of the government's budget cuts of $83.7 million from the ABC?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:49):  As I said in response to an earlier question, I can't and wouldn't seek to pre-empt the work of the review or the decisions that ABC management might take in the wake of the review and their own efforts. So I can't assist you beyond that.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (09:49):  Minister, it's not too much of a stretch to indicate, on the public record, that the result of your last efficiency cut efforts was very significant loss of jobs and loss of capacity. In your response to Senator Macdonald, you indicated that you were putting people on the board. The fact that people in particular positions make a very big difference to what an organisation can do is well known to you and I and every Australian who's interested in the ABC. We have a situation where the public broadcaster is now 800 jobs short of what it was when you arrived, despite your jobs and growth narrative. How can you possibly stand here in the chamber and pretend that a further cut, a further efficiency dividend—a cut of $83.7 million—will not drive further job losses at the ABC?

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2018-05-10,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:50):  I think there's a false assumption in your contribution, Senator O'Neill, and that is that every decision by the ABC to change their employment configuration is a result of funding decisions of the government. As I pointed out earlier, the funding in the current triennium is not being altered. The ABC board and management decided six months or a year ago to reduce middle-management positions in the ABC, I think by about 200. That was a decision of the ABC to free up resources for more content—for a content fund. That decision by ABC management had absolutely nothing to do with resourcing decisions by the government. It happened in the middle of a triennium where funding in that triennium had not been altered. That was entirely a decision of ABC management. ABC management have, over decades, made decisions about employment configuration which were not a result of funding decisions by the government. In fact, Mark Scott made very clear, when he made some changes to employment in the ABC around the time of the last efficiency review, that he had decisions already in train in relation to how the ABC would configure itself and the employment consequences of that. So it is not correct to assert that every decision that ABC management makes in relation to employment matters is a function of efficiency reviews or resource decisions of government. The ABC have always changed the way that they operate as technology has evolved. They have always changed the way that they operate in the wake of their own internal decisions, separate to decisions of government in relation to resourcing.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Communications Legislation Amendment (Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2018-05-10,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (09:53):  It's hard to see how 800 people losing their jobs from the national broadcaster is a model of improving access to great news, great journalism and the sort of community representation of ideas heralded and applauded by Senator Macdonald in his contribution. Whether it's in the city or whether it's in the country—and I see we have a delegation of young people here—getting the correct news, and getting people in the profession who have certainty of employment and an opportunity to grow their skills and to serve the nation through our national broadcaster, is a very, very important part of what this country has thrived on. It's an important part of our democracy. It's not like the ABC's a new thing. It has been around for a very, very long period of time and, over that period of time, it has been able to build its reputation to a point where the Australian people hold it in high regard, whether they're from the city or the country.


But I'm sure that the young people here today would be able to understand, Minister, that the loss of 800 jobs from the national broadcaster is a very, very significant loss. And it has happened on your watch. It happened after your first efficiency push in 2014, and here you are proposing another efficiency push, taking $83.7 million out of the budget of the ABC, and that is absolutely going to cause job losses. The minister may dance around it and try to prevent any blame from attaching to him, but the Australian people are too smart to buy that, Minister. They know that the ABC is under attack from this government. Mr Abbott, the member for Warringah, knew this when he was running to become the Prime Minister of this country in 2013, and stood at that stadium in Western Sydney in Penrith and said that there will be no cuts to the ABC or SBS—yet the whole legislative process of this parliament under the Liberal-National government has been cuts to the ABC and cuts to SBS. That's just the historical reality of it. You can't keep cutting the ABC and continue to argue that you're providing sufficient funding for job security, for quality journalism and for the retention of this significant part of the democratic conversation in our country.


In my contribution yesterday at the second reading stage I talked about another matter more specifically related to this particular bill, which I indicated was the result of a deal stitched together with Senator Xenophon. I recall on the evening as the bill was going through, Minister, asking you a number of detailed questions about how this particular bill was going to operate. As I recall, on many occasions you answered the questions with the support of your team in the advisers box, but there were a few where you just didn't know the answers, because Senator Xenophon was still cooking up the scheme. Indeed, in the estimates period that followed, Senator Xenophon tried to get on the record a number of changes, because, after the consideration of a few nights sleep, despite the deal being done, he figured out that there were a few mistakes and was trying to correct them on the run. That's the nature of the bill we're debating today. That's its origin and how it came to be. According to the Bills Digest:


The Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee considered the Bill and noted that 'none of the substantive requirements and criteria for eligibility [for grants of financial assistance] are set out in statute'. It stated:


It therefore appears that neither the criteria for the award of a grant nor the purposes or conditions for which grants may be awarded are included in the bill. Instead, these matters are to be determined by non-statutory policy or included in individual agreements. The practical effect of this approach is to delegate general criteria and conditions for the award of a grant to ACMA. It is also noted that if general non-statutory rules are not developed, then the legislation confers on ACMA an extremely broad discretionary power to allocate a substantial sum of money.


The Scrutiny of Bills Committee sought the Minister's advice as to 'why the criteria for the award of the grants and the standard terms and conditions to be imposed are not included in the bill or subject to any other appropriate level of parliamentary scrutiny'.


At the time of writing this Digest, the Minister's response had not been published.


Has the minister supplied a response to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:58):  I have, and let me share it with you. What I conveyed to the committee was:


It is common practice for the details for a competitive grant program, including any criteria relating to eligibility, to be set out in the program's guidelines, as part of a call for grant applications. The Government has determined a set of eligibility criteria for grants under the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund, which forms part of the Regional and Small Publishers Jobs and Innovation Package. Whilst the program guidelines are under development, these eligibility criteria have already been made public and will be incorporated into the guidelines for the grant program. In addition, the guidelines will specify a set of merit criteria against which the Australian Communications and Media Authority will assess the relative merits of applications.


It is expected that the guidelines for the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund will be released in the first quarter of 2018, following a process of consultation with industry and key stakeholders.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (10:00):  I have been listening to this exchange between the minister and Senator O'Neill with interest, and I find myself agreeing with parts of what Senator O'Neill says—




Senator Hanson-Young:
  Shock, horror!




Senator BERNARDI:
  Yes, shock, horror indeed, Senator Hanson-Young—in that the political ghost of former Senator Xenophon lingers large over this place. The price of a hastily cobbled together deal for much-needed media reform is incumbent and evidenced by this bill, which is why it is entirely wrong. The horsetrading only costs Australian taxpayers hundreds of millions, sometimes billions, of dollars, and the cumulative efforts of Senator Xenophon over the years have, I think, only added to our national debt, which is why we should be voting down this bill. It was cobbled together very late at night, if I recall, and I see that it serves no meaningful purpose other than to disrupt the budget repair that is so necessary.


I also happened to agree with Senator O'Neill when she was referencing the young people and the obligations we have to them—perhaps for a different reason, because Senator O'Neill did reference the young people who were in the gallery and spoke about their opportunities. Well, we are squandering their opportunities by saddling them and burdening them with a massive debt load. And that debt load is going to have to be repaid by them. No matter how many jobs you create at the ABC, which seems to be Senator O'Neill's great wish, that debt load is not going to be removed—that will only add to it. So this is where I depart from Senator O'Neill's contributions. Cutting spending to the ABC is in our national interest, quite frankly. If you go back through the rich heritage that the ABC has and the important role it has played in our country and continues to play, you will recognise that it's morphed from a radio station available nationally to a television station available nationally to now the largest media empire in the country. It has four television stations. It has, I think, maybe five national radio stations plus its regional outreach. It has a commanding presence in the newspaper of the 21st century, which is the online media portal, which is not paywalled or firewalled; it is cannibalising the commercial media operations.


The media landscape is undergoing radical change, and the ABC is at the centre of it. It is simply too big. It is simply too outrageous. It doesn't comply with its charter. Indeed, the latest managing director, Ms Guthrie, has basically levelled a threat against the government saying that the ABC will use its voice to showcase and highlight the damage that's been done to the ABC and that it wouldn't be able to comply with its charter. Well, here's news for you, Ms Guthrie: you're not complying with the charter now. It is appalling. And I say this not in a partisan sense, but it is appalling that the ABC will defend the use of the c-word on its own shows directed at political candidates in the name of humour yet won't allow that great other c-word to be used—the Conservative!—to get a fair and reasonable platform on the ABC. And congratulations to you, Minister, for not accepting that ridiculous response from Ms Guthrie—a form of which I received as well, where they review themselves and say, 'No, we've done nothing wrong'—and pursuing it with ACMA.


We had a Senate inquiry into commercial broadcasting standards, because other networks were broadcasting similar language in inappropriate timeslots. I don't think it's appropriate at any time, quite frankly, but nonetheless they came to that same conclusion. Channel 9, I recall, wrote a letter or made a public statement that they would not allow that sort of language to be broadcast at any time on their network. And yet somehow the ABC, which is meant to be reporting news and current affairs for all Australians, thinks it's okay—that it's good sport—to just allow all that sort of language; it doesn't matter if it's a Labor candidate, a Conservatives candidate, a Liberal candidate or anyone. They defend it. They are out of control.


If you want to do something serious about the ABC, Minister—$80 million cut, good. Thank you. For the young people of Australia, thank you for applying those funds to debt recovery, to budget repair and to preserving the future of our young people. If you want to do something serious about it, think about allowing our national broadcaster to consolidate, to merge, with SBS, to encourage them to provide a single news and current affairs channel and a single national radio network, or maybe two, to provide news and current affairs for all Australians. I do believe it is important for all governments—we don't know what's going to come down the pipe in the future—to be able to communicate with all Australians, and that includes in areas where market failure means that there are no other, rival services available. I do think the ABC fulfils an important role, but get it to consolidate.


If you don't want to do that, let's make the ABC accountable. Why not provide every Australian with shares in the ABC and allow them all to chip in their 8c a day, if that's what they want to do, or maybe hand in their shares to someone else who wants to pay their 8c or 11c a day. Let all Australians have a stake in it, rather than fund it and simply be told one version of news or current affairs, according to the partisan, cheerleading nature of the zeitgeist within the ABC. It is out of control, Minister, and I continue to encourage you to pursue media reform in this sense.


Returning to the substance of the political ghost of former Senator Xenophon: this bill is ridiculous. It's ridiculous because, as some regional media operators suggest to me, it will allow them to maybe upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10, or something along those lines. I just think it's a complete shemozzle and a waste of taxpayers' money. I believe that this is how we get into the problems in our parliamentary system, when the price of enacting important media reform—which you have achieved, Minister—is reflected by additional spending that is not going to make any difference to anyone except the poor taxpayers, who will end up having to pay it back. Minister, I won't be supporting this bill, but I want to go on the record saying that I congratulate you for your media reforms, I congratulate you for making a small start on the ABC and I'm sad that you've attached your name in any way, shape or form to endorsing this bill. Anything I can do to scupper it, I probably will, which may entail supporting some radical amendments from the Greens to make it completely unpalatable. But let's see what we can come up with.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:09):  I'll just make the observation that the program that this bill will enable is modest, time limited and targeted. I think it will make a positive contribution. There are media organisations in the regions that do welcome what we would like to put in place, but I also acknowledge that this is a product of the discussions which occurred through media reform and we have always been upfront about that.


Just touching on the earlier part of your contribution, Senator Bernardi, for the sake of completeness, because I haven't mentioned it in my responses to Senator O'Neill, the government has initiated a competitive neutrality review into the public broadcasters to look at the questions that are raised about whether those organisations in any way use their status as government organisations to compete unfairly with commercial broadcasters. The commercial broadcasters have their view and public broadcasters have their view, and what a competitive neutrality review will do is flush out those issues so that they can be canvassed in an open way. The people we have doing that work are: Robert Kerr, the former head of office of the Productivity Commission, who is chairing that review; Sandra Levy, the former head of ABC TV; and Julie Flynn, the former head of Free TV Australia.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:11):  I would just like to ask the government a question in relation to the bill before us, to clarify the total amount of funding per year that is set to go to regional publishers. Can we just get some clarification around it not being less than 25 per cent of the non-regional publishers, the conditions for access to that funding and some clarification around the fact that the primary operations must be located in the regional areas. Could the minister give us some clarification around the total funding per year for these grants?

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:13):  The minister didn't answer my question in relation to how much it is going to cost to ensure that people are abiding by the prescribed criteria. The reason for this, of course, is trying to work out if it's really worth the taxpayers' money to be funding these grants if, indeed, it's going to be clogging up other administrative time in the department. I say this as I have just sat here and heard the minister talk about the need for efficiency dividends across various different government agencies, and we know the minister likes to keep taking the axe to the ABC. Could the minister explain how much money from his department is being spent on administering this grant? Also, how much money will be spent administering it and monitoring it from ACMA, and what are any other administration costs that might be included?

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2018-05-10,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:17):  Thank you. I'd just like to draw the committee's attention to the fact that I have circulated a new amendment on sheet 8432. This is a tweaked version of the amendments that were previously circulated on sheet 8373. The amendment goes to the fact that we are extremely concerned that the government has just made a blind and ideological attack on news agencies that don't fit their political agenda. We know that this government, particular members of its frontbench and particular members of its backbench don't like media organisations like The Guardian, BuzzFeed or, let's face it, all the ABC or SBS. This government has a problem within its ranks—thinking that just because it's in government it should be able to pick and choose which journalists and which media outlets it supports, based on whether these agencies give it a good run or not, based on whether they ask tough questions or not and based on whether they're just prepared to swallow the government spin day in, day out.


I concur with many of the things raised by Senator O'Neill in relation to how this bill was constructed and put together as part of a pretty shabby deal with former Senator Nick Xenophon and the Centre Alliance team. It's the whole reason we're even discussing this piece of legislation. The legislation itself is just one of these ridiculous, slap-it-together, 'She'll be right, mate' kinds of legislation that's come out of a deal negotiated by former Senator Nick Xenophon. Despite all of the hoo-ha, he's never been a really good negotiator, has he? 


He spends a lot of time putting himself in the kingmaker position. But, when it comes to the crunch, what does he actually ever get? It ends up being pieces of legislation, or amendments, with unintended consequences or, indeed, not much more than a handshake and a promised word. At the end of the day, that is a bit disappointing when he is not even here now to have responsibility for it and be accountable.


The whole point of this package was to support small and regional publishers and help them to continue to have a role and to do a good job in underpinning public interest journalism in Australia. We have one of the most highly concentrated media markets in the world. Here we have a bill that is meant to do something to help support those smaller players, but it is just so ideologically bound and blinded by this government. The amendments on sheet 8432 that I have had circulated—




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator O'Sullivan
):  Senator Hanson-Young, I'm loath to interrupt you, but I would like to seek clarification. There has been another set of amendments circulated on sheet 8434.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Yes, that's an additional amendment. Perhaps I should clarify it from the beginning. I shall withdraw the set of amendments on sheet 8373 revised. There are two other amendments that have been circulated and there'll be a third one coming. The first one that I'm talking to is on sheet 8432. Then there is a second amendment, on sheet 8434, which is the one you have just referred to, Temporary Chair. And at some stage I imagine—



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  We don't need to deal with the withdrawal as you had never moved those amendments. So we will set them aside. So the clarification is that 8432 will be the subject, I understand, of a motion from the senator but there are additional amendments on sheet 8434.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Yes.




Senator Fifield:
  Temporary Chair, I seek clarification as to whether 8432 won't be proceeded with and 8434 is replacing it. It looks as though there are common elements to 8434 and 8432.



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Minister, 8432 replaces a set of amendments that were never moved, which were described on sheet 8373. So, to assist the chamber, we ought to ignore 8373. Senator Hanson-Young has just mentioned amendments which I assume are described on sheet 8432. So that's the contemporary set before us. The senator has circulated in the chamber amendments that are described on sheet 8434, which it is her intention to move, and she has foreshadowed that there will be a further set of amendments circulated. So we'll be dealing with three sets. If we can just treat them in order—




Senator Fifield:
  On my quick examining of the two, 8432 looks to be a subset of 8434. So 8434 has some amendments which are the same as 8432, but 8343 has what 8432 has plus further amendments. So is 8434 ultimately going to replace 8432?




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  This is the way the Clerk's office has decided to circulate them. I'm happy to take some advice as to why they have done it in this particular way.



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Before I give you the call, Senator Bernardi: Senator Hanson-Young, they are your amendments; so, while Senator Bernardi makes a contribution, you might be encouraged to do a comparative on those two sheets and then guide us as to what you'd like to happen. Senator Bernardi.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (10:24):  Thank you, Temporary Chair. I'm conscious that I'll be relieving you in a few minutes, and I suspect these amendments will be discussed when I won't be able to make a contribution. In the event that 8435 is proceeded with, I would like to telegraph a question to Senator Hanson-Young about amendment (3) on sheet 8435, dealing with the grant schedule in subsection H. It says:


(g) the person does not receive financial assistance from, and does not carry on its business with regard to the interests of, any of the following:


It then lists a range of entities, including political parties, trade unions and so forth.


My question is with respect to the definition of 'financial assistance'. Does 'financial assistance' mean entering into any commercial relationship with any of those entities—such as for paid advertisements if a trade union or a political party enters into a commercial relationship with one of these publishers? It's quite a genuine question about what the definition of that is. Should you be proceeding with those amendments, I'd be interested in a response.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2018-05-10,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (10:26):  In the interests of collegiality—we've all been in a situation where we're trying to figure out exactly what's going on. What I can say, for those who are here, is that one of the concerns I have as a senator in this place—and I have lived most of my life outside the political world—is what happens when you get all of these Independents in here. There's a sense in the media, the champion of the Independents, that this is going to provide fantastic scrutiny and it will be a wonderful thing. What we're actually doing today is cleaning up after the party. We've all been in that situation, where there's been this great big party and there's a big mess and you've got to come in the night after and do the cleaning up. The cleaning up is pretty hard sometimes. This is the cleaning up that's being done because the government wanted to get rid of the two-out-of-three rule—to make sure that, if you live in a particular media market, no one company can get in there and have a massive say about the kind of news and information that you get.


The government did a deal. They did a whole lot of deals, actually. It took quite a degree of contortion to make deals with multiple people. One was with Pauline Hanson's One Nation party. But the deal that we're discussing today is the deal that was done with former Senator Xenophon. The way that it's characterised all the time in the media is that the government are pushing for this deal and they're going to deliver this reform. What did they trade off? In the case of this particular piece of legislation that we're cleaning up here today, we're doing it in the absence of former Senator Xenophon, who actually did the deal. The deal went through very late in the evening. Sometimes when you're not here in the chamber you'll hear that we worked until one or two o'clock in the morning. The debate was continuing, but the deal was so uncertain and we had many questions that couldn't be answered. Senator Xenophon left the chamber, the vote was taken and the government got their multiple deals sorted—there were enough votes for their legislation. And now we get this clean-up job to sort out what they actually agreed to. We understand that it was very dynamic that night, and the deals weren't clear and the questions weren't able to be answered. But, when we get to this point and we're about to make legislation, we would hope that everything would be in order.


This morning I asked Senator Fifield a number of questions about what's been going on, particularly with regard to the cuts to the ABC—$83.7 million. I'm very concerned about that, but I have to say I'm very concerned about what this piece of legislation is seeking to do. Increasingly, I'm also a little uncertain about what it is that we're supposed to be debating right now. There are a number of pieces of legislation that get amended and, at the moment, with many amendments coming from the Greens, we're not quite sure where we are. That's as I see it at the moment, and I think that's a fair characterisation.


Senator Fifield, how many publishers do you understand will be eligible for the fund? I note that, in response to a question from Senator Hanson-Young, you read quite a long list of supporters of this short-term injection of funding into the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund, but, from the advice that you've received from your department, how many people exactly do you think will actually be eligible for this fund?




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  For the benefit of the chamber, we are having a general discussion about the bill. There have been no amendments formally moved. The reason for that confusion may be because I addressed an amendment, given I was going to be in the chair shortly.

 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:31):  The list of organisations that I referenced before were those which were consulted in relation to the package, which has three elements: the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund, the Regional and Small Publishers Cadetship Program and the Regional Journalism Scholarships. That range of organisations would have had interest in each of those, not necessarily all of them. Some of the organisations may have only had an interest or potential eligibility for some of them. Some of them are organisations which make contributions to public policy and so were interested from that point of view. So that was the list that I referred to before.

 (New South Wales) (10:32):  In terms of eligibility, there's a reasonable degree of certainty about what you think's going to happen there.

That's something that is beyond my knowledge, and it is up to each individual media organisation to assess whether they're eligible to make application and whether they wish to make application. But we are confident that the $2.1 million that is part of the $50 million for the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund will be appropriate to administer the applications that are received, and ACMA is also of that view.

Senator FIFIELD:
  I'll endeavour to be of assistance to colleagues, because we operate in real time in this place and we could all find ourselves, when presenting amendments, in a situation where the machinery is racing to catch up. I wonder if this may be of assistance: just looking at these two amendments sheets here, it looks to me as though it may have been the intention of the Australian Greens that the third amendment on sheet 8434 be circulated as a separate amendment, so that sheet 8432 stood as it was. If that's the case, then it might be possible for 8432 to be moved while amendment (3) on sheet 8434 comes as a separate amendment. I just offer that as a suggestion, as it may have been the intention of the instruction that the Greens gave.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:38):  Thank you, Minister, for that. Yes, I think what has happened is that these have been put up as separate sheets when really they should have been on one sheet and then we could move the three blocks of amendments separately. I understand that the Clerk is just circulating a revised sheet that puts it all together, and then we can discuss each amendment as we go. So we now have a sheet in front of us, sheet 8435, which includes amendments in relation to making sure that we can get the maximum amount of effectiveness out of this fund. I would like to suggest that we move amendments (1), (2) and (3) on sheet 8435. And if we can have a bit of a conversation about those things, that would be good. 



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Senator Hanson-Young, are you seeking leave to move amendments (1), (2) and (3) on sheet 8435 together?

The following criteria are specified in relation to a person for the purposes of paragraph 205ZH(2)(a):


(a) the person carries on a business that in the financial year commencing on 1 July 2016 had a turnover of between $300,000 and $30 million;


(b) the primary activity of the business is journalism that investigates and explains, from an Australian perspective, public policy and issues of public interest or significance;


(c) the primary activity of the business is carried on by individuals resident in Australia;


(d) each senior manager of the person is resident in Australia;


(e) either or both of the following apply:


(i) the person is a member of the Australian Press Council;


(ii) the person has in place a process for the making and handling of complaints made to the person in relation to the person’s business;


(f) the person has in place a code of conduct, editorial guidelines or other framework directed at the provision of quality journalism;


(g) the person does not receive financial assistance from, and does not carry on its business with regard to the interests of, any of the following:


(i) a political party;


(ii) a trade union;


(iii) a superannuation fund;


(iv) a financial institution;


(v) a non-government organisation;


(vi) a policy lobby group.


Basically, what these amendments do is correct the problem that we have had with this piece of legislation from the beginning: that there is an ideological blindness that's been drawn into this bill. We want to make sure that if you're an Australian publisher, if you're an Australian news outlet, if you employ Australian journalists, if you're reporting Australian news and you're doing it for an Australian audience and you're within that small sphere as outlined by the criteria, you have access to this fund. It shouldn't matter whether you are friends with the government ideologically or not. The issue in relation to this would mean that we can ensure that the applicants, to be able to access this fund, must have a body corporate controlled by Australian residents. That is of course important. In this way it ensures that eligible applicants must have Australian management and Australian control with independent Australian editorial direction. But it is not based on whether it is from the right-wing media or the left-wing media—that shouldn't matter. It should be about whether the editorial control and the management are within Australia. It is Australian taxpayer funds, so let's ensure that we are supporting and that this fund can support agencies and news outlets that report Australian stories and employ Australian journalists. 


One of the key elements of this whole debate that came out of the media reform package was: how do we protect Australian journalists' jobs? We know that it is becoming a tougher and tougher gig to be a journalist in Australia. The margins to be able to keep funding organisations are getting harder and harder to work within. We know that the 24-hour media cycle has an impact on that. These are all of the different elements that we have covered over the months and years that we've been debating this issue in a broad sense. The whole objective is to protect Australian journalism, because it's in the public interest to have good journalists writing about Australian stories and what's going on, informing the Australian public, reporting on what we do here in this parliament, at a time when trust in politics is so low. It is a matter of having good support for the journalists who scrutinise us, question what we're doing and make sure that, as a government and as parliamentarians, we're upholding our obligations to the public properly. These are all important roles in relation to why we want a strong journalism sector in Australia. If that's the case, let's make sure this fund actually does that: supports Australian stories and Australian journalists and gets away from just saying, 'Well, it's only available to these people because they fit certain criteria.' The criteria should be that it is Australian managed, that it has Australian editorial control and that they're employing Australian journalists for an Australian audience. I don't see why this chamber should have any issues in relation to that.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:43):  The bill that we have before us is intended to be a simple amendment to give legislative authority to ACMA to independently administer the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund. We have set down a number of eligibility criteria. They are outlined in the explanatory memorandum to the bill but aren't proposed to be legislated. It is normal practice for guidelines and eligibility criteria to sit outside legislation. 


The other point I would make is that if the grant criteria were to be legislated it would mean that the government wouldn't be able to make minor tweaks to the criteria in a straightforward fashion—based on feedback from industry—in light of the administration of the fund, which is something that I think would be helpful.


The final point I'll make is that the Greens amendment does clear the way for outposts of large foreign media outlets to be eligible for funding, and that would mean less funding available for Australian publishers.

It is often the lifeblood of the community—the heartbeat of the community—to know what's going on and who's saying and doing what. Surely, the government must believe that those entities, if they put their hand out for public money, should have independent Australian editorial control?

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:47):  Temporary Chair, I'd just like to answer one of the questions that was asked by you during the committee stage, before you entered into the chair, in relation to clause 3 of the amendments on sheet 8435. From memory, you were asking about the types of things that this money could be spent on and the grant criteria. This is probably a question that needs to go to the minister in some respects, because we need to make very clear that this money is being spent on public interest journalism. This is what this is for; it's not to offset the budgets that bigger organisations perhaps have from their parent bodies in the city. This is about supporting journalists here in the regions, to ensure that those regional communities get the news and the analysis that they deserve. Just to be clear: we need to make sure—and it is in here—that the following criteria are specified in relation to a person for the purposes of this grant:




(g) the person does not receive financial assistance from, and does not carry on its business with regard to the interests of, any of the following:





(i) a political party;





(ii) a trade union;





(iii) a superannuation fund;





(iv) a financial institution;





(v) a non-government organisation;





(vi) a policy lobby group.



This money needs to be spent on journalism. This money should be being spent on what it takes to make sure Australian communities know what's going on in their communities and what their government is doing, and to underpin their ability to do that. Most newspapers or radio stations have advertising and sell ads to keep the newspapers in print or the radio stations on air. Their advertising revenue is up to them, but how do we ensure the money from this bill is being spent on journalists and journalism?

Examples might include commissioning feasibility studies or planning work; commissioning IT builds or installations; acquiring intellectual property or installing new technology, plans and equipment; acquiring assets that are directly and solely employed to achieve the project outcomes, which might take the form of acquisition or lease costs; training staff that directly support the achievement of project outcomes; and defraying the costs of financial auditing of project expenditure.

Have you done any work in your consultation as to how many organisations might apply? You said you've done some consultation. You must have an idea of how many applications you're going to get. The reason I'm interested in this is that it helps us to understand how effective this is going to be as an innovation fund. If there are dozens and dozens of organisations that would be eligible under the criteria, how on earth will you determine which organisations in which locations will get access to this support? Would we be in a situation where Queensland, for example, gets nothing but your home state of Victoria and the regional newspapers in Victoria get a lot? Or, indeed, would it be that the media agencies in Queensland would get a lot and, say, those in my home state of South Australia will not?


You said to me you didn't want to explore, in this place, why $50 million was put on the table. You're now telling me that dozens and dozens of agencies would be eligible.

I know she tried to address one that I foreshadowed earlier, but I don't believe it was adequately clarified for me. I'm specifically referring to amendment (3) on sheet 8435, in which there are very specific grant eligibility criteria. One of them is subsection (g): 'the person does not receive financial assistance from'—and then it lists political parties, trade unions and so forth. My question specifically is: what is the definition of 'financial assistance' in this case? If a political party undertakes a commercial contract with a person, as defined by this schedule, for advertising services or other engagement of a commercial nature, does that rule the person as described ineligible to apply for the grant?

For the benefit of you and your advisers, amendment (3) on sheet 8435 lists a range of grant criteria which Senator Hanson-Young has advised are directly out of your explanatory memorandum. I'm interested in the definitions of several clauses and several words in there. The one I particularly raised was financial assistance. What denotes financial assistance from one of those political entities? Is a regular commercial contract engaged, say, between a publisher and a political party or a financial institution deemed to be financial assistance because they are, in effect, giving money to the publisher?

There are questions around the phrase in the Greens amendment: 'each senior manager of the person is resident in Australia'. A 'person' being, let's presume, a corporate entity, does that mean each and every director? Does it mean the editors? Does it mean any senior personnel within the organisation? These are very specific questions because they go to the ability to implement the amendments that Senator Hanson-Young and the Greens have put forward. I'm just seeking some sort of assurance that Senator Hanson-Young has received the appropriate advice and is ready to respond, which I believe she is.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (11:11):  I regret that I can't just accept the buck-passing to ACMA. I do note that the other amendments deal with ACMA dealing with it, but these are very specific issues because the description of each senior manager of the person is one that could lead to ongoing legal dispute, if I may say so. What is deemed a 'senior manager'? Is it a director? Does having one foreign director on your board in a corporate entity contradict the grant criteria, if you've got some international expertise? These are quite genuine questions because they go to the workability of it. Similarly with 'financial assistance': I could mount an argument that financial assistance is a regular commercial contract. If you're preventing small publishers from entering into a commercial contract with a financial institution, a political party. a trade union, a superannuation fund, a policy lobby group or a non-government organisation you're probably killing their business. I'm sure that's not the intention, but I've learned in my time in this place that you're better off being quite specific and resolving these issues now rather than leaving it to an outside entity to interpret them, because they're prone to problems later on. I'm trying to avoid the problems.

The argument about a regular commercial contract and advertising—I don't believe that is caught by this at all. The point is that this is about the interests of these political organisations or trade unions or superannuation funds or whatever and the rest of that group.

What is a senior manager?


Is it a director in a corporate entity—as most of these small publishers would be for liability reasons? And if they had a foreign director, even if there were only one of them, would that deem them ineligible? What if they had an editor in an offshore post somewhere, maybe in the Pacific or in an Asian country, and the editor were effectively deemed to be a senior manager? Where do the criteria begin and end?

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2018-05-10,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (11:17):  No. It's fine with us if they're moved as a block. I just want to put some comments on the record, as it looks like we're about to go to a vote—I think we are. Labor will support this amendment, which seeks to ameliorate one of the flaws with the fund—that the grant criteria is ideologically motivated.


Public interest journalism, the fourth estate, is a key pillar in our democracy. Support for public interest journalism in our democracy should not be ideologically motivated. We had several things to say about that on the night the bill came before us for the first time. It was sadly ironic that the two-out-of-three cross-media control rule, which acted as a democratic safeguard in promoting media diversity in Australia, was done away with through a deal that was conducted behind closed doors and away from democratic scrutiny.


Labor understands and shares the sentiment behind this amendment. On the night the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund was announced in this place, Labor decried the government's ideologically motivated exclusion of certain innovative publishers from the fund. That included The Guardian Australia, BuzzFeed and The New Daily. The concerns we have about those very important parts of the media, which we have access to every day as citizens of this country, are the key motivation for our support of this amendment. Labor will continue to hold the government to account for the deal, and we'll monitor the uptake of this fund. We will be watching who applies for it, we will be watching who accesses it and we will certainly be watching to see what, if anything, it achieves.


Labor are aware that the government has valid concerns with the drafting of this amendment, such as concerns that there are technical defects. I have to say that we do share some of those concerns, but we do not think that these concerns are insurmountable, and we believe that the government will have the opportunity and resources to remedy them as the bill progresses through the parliament.


Labor is also conscious that legislating the eligibility criteria will mean that any changes to the criteria in future would require legislative amendment. For example, if the minimum revenue threshold of $300,000 were too high, it would be necessary to return to parliament to amend the criteria. To the extent that flexibility to tweak the criteria is desirable should the government discover along the way that the criteria are not fit for purpose, Labor notes that the government took the decision to forge these criteria behind closed doors, away from parliamentary scrutiny. That the government is making this fund up as it goes along is a matter of concern for the government and it is certainly of concern to us. While, as the minister outlined, it is standard practice to include criteria in guidelines and not legislation, the government has, unfortunately, acted to create a fund that is ideologically motivated, and has thus motivated the amendment that is now before us. Labor notes that, without legislating the criteria, it would be open to future governments to revisit the eligibility criteria. But the issue before the Senate with this amendment is whether the overarching criteria are actually suitable. As the criteria are ideologically motivated, we believe they should not be supported because they are not suitable.


I want to close by putting on the record that Labor has sought consultative engagement with both the Greens and the government with regard to this particular amendment. There are many unanswered questions on this bill and on the amendment. The amendments circulated by the Greens today are many and, in our view, they are not drafted perfectly. Yet, on balance, Labor believes that this does address an ideological attack on a vital part of the media landscape of this country and the amendment goes a significant way to redressing that balance. So, on balance, Labor will support this amendment on 8435.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:22):  I would make two quick observations. Firstly, it's very interesting if the Labor Party are saying that, henceforth, they believe program criteria and guidelines for grants should always be legislated. That's very interesting. That seems to be the Labor Party's new position across programs and portfolios. We'll be watching that with interest. Secondly, Labor themselves have conceded that there are errors and difficulties in the Greens amendments. It's very odd that the Labor Party, recognising that, are proposing to support the amendments and are saying that it's somehow the government's job to clean up inadequate amendments to give effect to something that is not government policy.

This is a bill with guidelines that you constructed that excluded key participants in the media landscape of this country. This amendment is important in that it seeks to redress that ideological attack. This is an extraordinary situation, not business as usual, Minister.

 (New South Wales) (09:32):  Senator Fifield, to get back to where we were last night before we moved to the adjournment, the Greens amendment was before us, and Senator Hanson-Young was asking you a number of questions about the ABC. It's clear that, in the last 48 hours, the impact of the further cuts to the ABC has become quite a significant part of the public conversation. Certainly, Friends of the ABC are very concerned about this continuing attack on Aunty, our great institution the ABC. I would like to ask you a few questions around the nature of the efficiency studies et cetera that you have indicated will be part of your further action with regard to the ABC. Firstly, Senator Fifield, do you think that the government's 2014 ABC and SBS efficiency study was effective in getting the ABC to become more efficient?

Senator FIFIELD

All Commonwealth entities should continually strive to make sure that they are the best stewards of taxpayer dollars, and I think it's a matter of good practice to have periodic reviews of efficiency in organisations. I think this will be to the benefit of the public broadcasters.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:34):  I did happily respond to questions from Senator Hanson-Young last night in relation to the ABC, although it's not directly related to the bill, and I am doing so with Senator O'Neil—again, although the ABC is not related to this bill. But if Senator O'Neil or other senators are wanting to go into detail about the ABC's operational arrangements, then those are matters that I would suggest are best saved for the ABC when they appear before estimates. As colleagues know, the ABC has operational independence and is best placed to talk about its operations and the components of that.

Senator O'NEILL

And I have to say, the acquired taste is very much one that I enjoy now, and I'm looking forward to the opportunity to get more information from the ABC about what they think the impact of your $83.7 million efficiency cut in the recent budget will be. My understanding is that the ABC's overheads are only eight per cent of its overall operational budget. How much further would the government like to push that efficiency beyond eight per cent?

The current triennium has a year to go. We have announced that there will be an efficiency review, and we will have more to say in the near future about that efficiency review. But obviously I can't pre-empt what the efficiency review will find before they have undertaken their work, and I'm sure that those who conduct that review will work cooperatively with the ABC and that the ABC will work cooperatively with them.

It represents the equivalent of about 2.6 per cent of the ABC's budget. That's 2.6c for each dollar that the ABC receives. It's important to bear in mind that, over the next triennium, the ABC will receive $3.16 billion, and what we are talking about here is $85 million. I have confidence that the ABC, following the work of the efficiency review and their own efforts, will be in a position to be even better stewards of taxpayer dollars.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-05-10,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (09:38):  I have a question for the minister on the same type of subject. We're dealing with the Communications Legislation Amendment (Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund) Bill 2017. Is there any prospect of ABC rural and regional—which is mainly radio but some TV—having anything to do with the regional innovation fund? That's one question.


The other question is related to that but also related to what my colleague opposite has been asking about. As I often point out, the ABC operates across a range of areas—triple j for the young people, and classical music, which is something I really enjoy; they have a range of different radio stations and television outlets. But a lot of them, of course, are concentrated in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide—the capital cities—where there are an enormous number of other opportunities for the listeners or the viewers to hook into other news, information and entertainment outlets. Where I am, in Townsville and Ayr, we do have some opportunities for commercial operations but, when you get a bit further out into the country, as far as radio is concerned the ABC is the principal source of information, and it does a wonderful job. It does a wonderful job with weather, with market reports, with information about what's happening around particular communities. So it's a very, very valuable service. But often it's the only one. Whilst I approve the efficiency—and, as you say, it's a 2c-in-a-dollar saving, which I think even I could save in my own household, and I'm sure the ABC will be able to do it, particularly under the new management—I am concerned that very often when there are cuts to the ABC, or very often when there aren't cuts to the ABC, you'll find that some of those in Ultimo who really don't know Australia, apart from three blocks from the Ultimo headquarters, don't quite understand the importance of the regional services of the ABC. I'm just after some sort of assurance—and I appreciate the ABC is an independent body—on that. That's my second question.


The third question: has any thought ever been given by the government to setting up, with independent budgets, not just ABC and SBS but ABC, SBS and, for want of a better term, 'ABC Regional', as a separate entity with a separate budget and separate management, which will concentrate on this vital service to many people who live outside the capital cities and ensure that it is always there? That's the third question. Has any thought ever been given to that? Is it something that the minister or his department might sometime have a look at, without diminishing services anywhere and leaving the ABC in its current form to continue doing the work it does—some of it good, most of it, I think, questionable, but let's not get into that; that's a matter of opinion. But the certainty of an ongoing service for regional Australia is something that exercises the minds of many people outside the capital cities.

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2018-05-10,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:43):  Thanks, Senator Macdonald. To your first question, as to whether any of the innovation fund that this legislation will allow ACMA to administer will be available to the ABC, the answer is that it won't be. The innovation fund is targeted essentially at private publishers in regional areas and small publishers. I should point out, though, that the ABC have, over the last year or so, identified further efficiencies, which demonstrates that that can be done, and the ABC have set up a content fund. Different parts of the ABC organisation can pitch innovative ideas to that content fund that the ABC have established. So there is that avenue there.


Through you, Chair: Senator Macdonald raises a very good point about the important role that the ABC plays in rural and regional Australia, which is why the government has legislation before the parliament to put into the ABC's act a specific reference to rural and regional Australia, which is something that people assume is already there. People assume that the ABC charter already has specific reference to an obligation to rural and regional Australia. It doesn't. We will be seeking to legislate that here, and I hope that will enjoy the support of all colleagues.


In the same bill, we also have a measure which would require the ABC to always have at least two board members from rural and regional Australia. That is a measure that we have already met, because I have appointed to the board of the ABC Georgie Somerset, who is a beef producer from Kingaroy, and Vanessa Guthrie—no relation to the MD—who is the chair of the Minerals Council of Australia. It's very important that we have that representation on the board. The board is the ultimate editorial and operational authority. So, to ensure that rural and regional Australia get the resources that they need through the ABC, that representation on the board is extremely important. That bill also contains a measure to establish an ABC rural and regional advisory committee, which the ABC would be required to consult if there were any decisions that they were taking that had a significant effect on rural and regional Australia. They are some of the safeguards that we are putting in place for rural and regional Australia.


Often, as I move around the community—and, I know, as Senator Macdonald moves around the community—while Australians have a wide range of views on the ABC, as they're entitled to do as taxpayers and consumers, I universally hear very positive things about ABC rural and regional radio. I think one of the reasons is that the ABC are close to the community. They live in the community. They get that constant feedback from the community. It's a good and important service that the ABC provide.


Coming to Senator Macdonald's third question on the ABC's structure and whether thought has been given to having a separate ABC rural and regional entity, it's not something that the government has looked at in terms of legislation. Under the current legislative framework, how they structure themselves is a matter for the ABC board. But I think that the measures in the bill that we have before the Senate to establish in the ABC Act a particular obligation for rural and regional Australia are important and will go some way towards those objectives, as will mandating that there be two people from rural and regional Australia on the board and establishing the ABC rural and regional advisory committee. Senator, I know that you will continue to put propositions forward, and I think, as the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment (Rural and Regional Measures) Bill 2017 demonstrates, we are open to doing whatever we can to further reinforce the ABC's role in rural and regional Australia.

You indicated that you felt that the efficiency study from 2014 was quite effective at that point in time and, if I heard you correctly, you indicated that it was time for another efficiency review. One of the consequences of the efficiency review that was undertaken was that 800 staff have left the ABC in recent years.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (09:49):  Minister, it's not too much of a stretch to indicate, on the public record, that the result of your last efficiency cut efforts was very significant loss of jobs and loss of capacity. In your response to Senator Macdonald, you indicated that you were putting people on the board. The fact that people in particular positions make a very big difference to what an organisation can do is well known to you and I and every Australian who's interested in the ABC. We have a situation where the public broadcaster is now 800 jobs short of what it was when you arrived, despite your jobs and growth narrative. How can you possibly stand here in the chamber and pretend that a further cut, a further efficiency dividend—a cut of $83.7 million—will not drive further job losses at the ABC?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:50):  I think there's a false assumption in your contribution, Senator O'Neill, and that is that every decision by the ABC to change their employment configuration is a result of funding decisions of the government. As I pointed out earlier, the funding in the current triennium is not being altered. The ABC board and management decided six months or a year ago to reduce middle-management positions in the ABC, I think by about 200. That was a decision of the ABC to free up resources for more content—for a content fund. That decision by ABC management had absolutely nothing to do with resourcing decisions by the government. It happened in the middle of a triennium where funding in that triennium had not been altered. That was entirely a decision of ABC management. ABC management have, over decades, made decisions about employment configuration which were not a result of funding decisions by the government. In fact, Mark Scott made very clear, when he made some changes to employment in the ABC around the time of the last efficiency review, that he had decisions already in train in relation to how the ABC would configure itself and the employment consequences of that. So it is not correct to assert that every decision that ABC management makes in relation to employment matters is a function of efficiency reviews or resource decisions of government. The ABC have always changed the way that they operate as technology has evolved. They have always changed the way that they operate in the wake of their own internal decisions, separate to decisions of government in relation to resourcing.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (09:53):  It's hard to see how 800 people losing their jobs from the national broadcaster is a model of improving access to great news, great journalism and the sort of community representation of ideas heralded and applauded by Senator Macdonald in his contribution. Whether it's in the city or whether it's in the country—and I see we have a delegation of young people here—getting the correct news, and getting people in the profession who have certainty of employment and an opportunity to grow their skills and to serve the nation through our national broadcaster, is a very, very important part of what this country has thrived on. It's an important part of our democracy. It's not like the ABC's a new thing. It has been around for a very, very long period of time and, over that period of time, it has been able to build its reputation to a point where the Australian people hold it in high regard, whether they're from the city or the country.


But I'm sure that the young people here today would be able to understand, Minister, that the loss of 800 jobs from the national broadcaster is a very, very significant loss. And it has happened on your watch. It happened after your first efficiency push in 2014, and here you are proposing another efficiency push, taking $83.7 million out of the budget of the ABC, and that is absolutely going to cause job losses. The minister may dance around it and try to prevent any blame from attaching to him, but the Australian people are too smart to buy that, Minister. They know that the ABC is under attack from this government. Mr Abbott, the member for Warringah, knew this when he was running to become the Prime Minister of this country in 2013, and stood at that stadium in Western Sydney in Penrith and said that there will be no cuts to the ABC or SBS—yet the whole legislative process of this parliament under the Liberal-National government has been cuts to the ABC and cuts to SBS. That's just the historical reality of it. You can't keep cutting the ABC and continue to argue that you're providing sufficient funding for job security, for quality journalism and for the retention of this significant part of the democratic conversation in our country.


In my contribution yesterday at the second reading stage I talked about another matter more specifically related to this particular bill, which I indicated was the result of a deal stitched together with Senator Xenophon. I recall on the evening as the bill was going through, Minister, asking you a number of detailed questions about how this particular bill was going to operate. As I recall, on many occasions you answered the questions with the support of your team in the advisers box, but there were a few where you just didn't know the answers, because Senator Xenophon was still cooking up the scheme. Indeed, in the estimates period that followed, Senator Xenophon tried to get on the record a number of changes, because, after the consideration of a few nights sleep, despite the deal being done, he figured out that there were a few mistakes and was trying to correct them on the run. That's the nature of the bill we're debating today. That's its origin and how it came to be. According to the Bills Digest:


The Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee considered the Bill and noted that 'none of the substantive requirements and criteria for eligibility [for grants of financial assistance] are set out in statute'. It stated:


It therefore appears that neither the criteria for the award of a grant nor the purposes or conditions for which grants may be awarded are included in the bill. Instead, these matters are to be determined by non-statutory policy or included in individual agreements. The practical effect of this approach is to delegate general criteria and conditions for the award of a grant to ACMA. It is also noted that if general non-statutory rules are not developed, then the legislation confers on ACMA an extremely broad discretionary power to allocate a substantial sum of money.


The Scrutiny of Bills Committee sought the Minister's advice as to 'why the criteria for the award of the grants and the standard terms and conditions to be imposed are not included in the bill or subject to any other appropriate level of parliamentary scrutiny'.


At the time of writing this Digest, the Minister's response had not been published.


Has the minister supplied a response to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:58):  I have, and let me share it with you. What I conveyed to the committee was:


It is common practice for the details for a competitive grant program, including any criteria relating to eligibility, to be set out in the program's guidelines, as part of a call for grant applications. The Government has determined a set of eligibility criteria for grants under the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund, which forms part of the Regional and Small Publishers Jobs and Innovation Package. Whilst the program guidelines are under development, these eligibility criteria have already been made public and will be incorporated into the guidelines for the grant program. In addition, the guidelines will specify a set of merit criteria against which the Australian Communications and Media Authority will assess the relative merits of applications.


It is expected that the guidelines for the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund will be released in the first quarter of 2018, following a process of consultation with industry and key stakeholders.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",AC,2018-05-10,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (10:00):  I have been listening to this exchange between the minister and Senator O'Neill with interest, and I find myself agreeing with parts of what Senator O'Neill says—




Senator Hanson-Young:
  Shock, horror!




Senator BERNARDI:
  Yes, shock, horror indeed, Senator Hanson-Young—in that the political ghost of former Senator Xenophon lingers large over this place. The price of a hastily cobbled together deal for much-needed media reform is incumbent and evidenced by this bill, which is why it is entirely wrong. The horsetrading only costs Australian taxpayers hundreds of millions, sometimes billions, of dollars, and the cumulative efforts of Senator Xenophon over the years have, I think, only added to our national debt, which is why we should be voting down this bill. It was cobbled together very late at night, if I recall, and I see that it serves no meaningful purpose other than to disrupt the budget repair that is so necessary.


I also happened to agree with Senator O'Neill when she was referencing the young people and the obligations we have to them—perhaps for a different reason, because Senator O'Neill did reference the young people who were in the gallery and spoke about their opportunities. Well, we are squandering their opportunities by saddling them and burdening them with a massive debt load. And that debt load is going to have to be repaid by them. No matter how many jobs you create at the ABC, which seems to be Senator O'Neill's great wish, that debt load is not going to be removed—that will only add to it. So this is where I depart from Senator O'Neill's contributions. Cutting spending to the ABC is in our national interest, quite frankly. If you go back through the rich heritage that the ABC has and the important role it has played in our country and continues to play, you will recognise that it's morphed from a radio station available nationally to a television station available nationally to now the largest media empire in the country. It has four television stations. It has, I think, maybe five national radio stations plus its regional outreach. It has a commanding presence in the newspaper of the 21st century, which is the online media portal, which is not paywalled or firewalled; it is cannibalising the commercial media operations.


The media landscape is undergoing radical change, and the ABC is at the centre of it. It is simply too big. It is simply too outrageous. It doesn't comply with its charter. Indeed, the latest managing director, Ms Guthrie, has basically levelled a threat against the government saying that the ABC will use its voice to showcase and highlight the damage that's been done to the ABC and that it wouldn't be able to comply with its charter. Well, here's news for you, Ms Guthrie: you're not complying with the charter now. It is appalling. And I say this not in a partisan sense, but it is appalling that the ABC will defend the use of the c-word on its own shows directed at political candidates in the name of humour yet won't allow that great other c-word to be used—the Conservative!—to get a fair and reasonable platform on the ABC. And congratulations to you, Minister, for not accepting that ridiculous response from Ms Guthrie—a form of which I received as well, where they review themselves and say, 'No, we've done nothing wrong'—and pursuing it with ACMA.


We had a Senate inquiry into commercial broadcasting standards, because other networks were broadcasting similar language in inappropriate timeslots. I don't think it's appropriate at any time, quite frankly, but nonetheless they came to that same conclusion. Channel 9, I recall, wrote a letter or made a public statement that they would not allow that sort of language to be broadcast at any time on their network. And yet somehow the ABC, which is meant to be reporting news and current affairs for all Australians, thinks it's okay—that it's good sport—to just allow all that sort of language; it doesn't matter if it's a Labor candidate, a Conservatives candidate, a Liberal candidate or anyone. They defend it. They are out of control.


If you want to do something serious about the ABC, Minister—$80 million cut, good. Thank you. For the young people of Australia, thank you for applying those funds to debt recovery, to budget repair and to preserving the future of our young people. If you want to do something serious about it, think about allowing our national broadcaster to consolidate, to merge, with SBS, to encourage them to provide a single news and current affairs channel and a single national radio network, or maybe two, to provide news and current affairs for all Australians. I do believe it is important for all governments—we don't know what's going to come down the pipe in the future—to be able to communicate with all Australians, and that includes in areas where market failure means that there are no other, rival services available. I do think the ABC fulfils an important role, but get it to consolidate.


If you don't want to do that, let's make the ABC accountable. Why not provide every Australian with shares in the ABC and allow them all to chip in their 8c a day, if that's what they want to do, or maybe hand in their shares to someone else who wants to pay their 8c or 11c a day. Let all Australians have a stake in it, rather than fund it and simply be told one version of news or current affairs, according to the partisan, cheerleading nature of the zeitgeist within the ABC. It is out of control, Minister, and I continue to encourage you to pursue media reform in this sense.


Returning to the substance of the political ghost of former Senator Xenophon: this bill is ridiculous. It's ridiculous because, as some regional media operators suggest to me, it will allow them to maybe upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10, or something along those lines. I just think it's a complete shemozzle and a waste of taxpayers' money. I believe that this is how we get into the problems in our parliamentary system, when the price of enacting important media reform—which you have achieved, Minister—is reflected by additional spending that is not going to make any difference to anyone except the poor taxpayers, who will end up having to pay it back. Minister, I won't be supporting this bill, but I want to go on the record saying that I congratulate you for your media reforms, I congratulate you for making a small start on the ABC and I'm sad that you've attached your name in any way, shape or form to endorsing this bill. Anything I can do to scupper it, I probably will, which may entail supporting some radical amendments from the Greens to make it completely unpalatable. But let's see what we can come up with.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:09):  I'll just make the observation that the program that this bill will enable is modest, time limited and targeted. I think it will make a positive contribution. There are media organisations in the regions that do welcome what we would like to put in place, but I also acknowledge that this is a product of the discussions which occurred through media reform and we have always been upfront about that.


Just touching on the earlier part of your contribution, Senator Bernardi, for the sake of completeness, because I haven't mentioned it in my responses to Senator O'Neill, the government has initiated a competitive neutrality review into the public broadcasters to look at the questions that are raised about whether those organisations in any way use their status as government organisations to compete unfairly with commercial broadcasters. The commercial broadcasters have their view and public broadcasters have their view, and what a competitive neutrality review will do is flush out those issues so that they can be canvassed in an open way. The people we have doing that work are: Robert Kerr, the former head of office of the Productivity Commission, who is chairing that review; Sandra Levy, the former head of ABC TV; and Julie Flynn, the former head of Free TV Australia.

I say this as I have just sat here and heard the minister talk about the need for efficiency dividends across various different government agencies, and we know the minister likes to keep taking the axe to the ABC. Could the minister explain how much money from his department is being spent on administering this grant?

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:17):  Thank you. I'd just like to draw the committee's attention to the fact that I have circulated a new amendment on sheet 8432. This is a tweaked version of the amendments that were previously circulated on sheet 8373. The amendment goes to the fact that we are extremely concerned that the government has just made a blind and ideological attack on news agencies that don't fit their political agenda. We know that this government, particular members of its frontbench and particular members of its backbench don't like media organisations like The Guardian, BuzzFeed or, let's face it, all the ABC or SBS. This government has a problem within its ranks—thinking that just because it's in government it should be able to pick and choose which journalists and which media outlets it supports, based on whether these agencies give it a good run or not, based on whether they ask tough questions or not and based on whether they're just prepared to swallow the government spin day in, day out.


I concur with many of the things raised by Senator O'Neill in relation to how this bill was constructed and put together as part of a pretty shabby deal with former Senator Nick Xenophon and the Centre Alliance team. It's the whole reason we're even discussing this piece of legislation. The legislation itself is just one of these ridiculous, slap-it-together, 'She'll be right, mate' kinds of legislation that's come out of a deal negotiated by former Senator Nick Xenophon. Despite all of the hoo-ha, he's never been a really good negotiator, has he? 


He spends a lot of time putting himself in the kingmaker position. But, when it comes to the crunch, what does he actually ever get? It ends up being pieces of legislation, or amendments, with unintended consequences or, indeed, not much more than a handshake and a promised word. At the end of the day, that is a bit disappointing when he is not even here now to have responsibility for it and be accountable.


The whole point of this package was to support small and regional publishers and help them to continue to have a role and to do a good job in underpinning public interest journalism in Australia. We have one of the most highly concentrated media markets in the world. Here we have a bill that is meant to do something to help support those smaller players, but it is just so ideologically bound and blinded by this government. The amendments on sheet 8432 that I have had circulated—




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator O'Sullivan
):  Senator Hanson-Young, I'm loath to interrupt you, but I would like to seek clarification. There has been another set of amendments circulated on sheet 8434.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Yes, that's an additional amendment. Perhaps I should clarify it from the beginning. I shall withdraw the set of amendments on sheet 8373 revised. There are two other amendments that have been circulated and there'll be a third one coming. The first one that I'm talking to is on sheet 8432. Then there is a second amendment, on sheet 8434, which is the one you have just referred to, Temporary Chair. And at some stage I imagine—



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  We don't need to deal with the withdrawal as you had never moved those amendments. So we will set them aside. So the clarification is that 8432 will be the subject, I understand, of a motion from the senator but there are additional amendments on sheet 8434.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Yes.




Senator Fifield:
  Temporary Chair, I seek clarification as to whether 8432 won't be proceeded with and 8434 is replacing it. It looks as though there are common elements to 8434 and 8432.



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Minister, 8432 replaces a set of amendments that were never moved, which were described on sheet 8373. So, to assist the chamber, we ought to ignore 8373. Senator Hanson-Young has just mentioned amendments which I assume are described on sheet 8432. So that's the contemporary set before us. The senator has circulated in the chamber amendments that are described on sheet 8434, which it is her intention to move, and she has foreshadowed that there will be a further set of amendments circulated. So we'll be dealing with three sets. If we can just treat them in order—




Senator Fifield:
  On my quick examining of the two, 8432 looks to be a subset of 8434. So 8434 has some amendments which are the same as 8432, but 8343 has what 8432 has plus further amendments. So is 8434 ultimately going to replace 8432?




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  This is the way the Clerk's office has decided to circulate them. I'm happy to take some advice as to why they have done it in this particular way.



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Before I give you the call, Senator Bernardi: Senator Hanson-Young, they are your amendments; so, while Senator Bernardi makes a contribution, you might be encouraged to do a comparative on those two sheets and then guide us as to what you'd like to happen. Senator Bernardi.

I'm conscious that I'll be relieving you in a few minutes, and I suspect these amendments will be discussed when I won't be able to make a contribution. In the event that 8435 is proceeded with, I would like to telegraph a question to Senator Hanson-Young about amendment (3) on sheet 8435, dealing with the grant schedule in subsection H. It says:


(g) the person does not receive financial assistance from, and does not carry on its business with regard to the interests of, any of the following:


It then lists a range of entities, including political parties, trade unions and so forth.


My question is with respect to the definition of 'financial assistance'. Does 'financial assistance' mean entering into any commercial relationship with any of those entities—such as for paid advertisements if a trade union or a political party enters into a commercial relationship with one of these publishers? It's quite a genuine question about what the definition of that is. Should you be proceeding with those amendments, I'd be interested in a response.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (10:26):  In the interests of collegiality—we've all been in a situation where we're trying to figure out exactly what's going on. What I can say, for those who are here, is that one of the concerns I have as a senator in this place—and I have lived most of my life outside the political world—is what happens when you get all of these Independents in here. There's a sense in the media, the champion of the Independents, that this is going to provide fantastic scrutiny and it will be a wonderful thing. What we're actually doing today is cleaning up after the party. We've all been in that situation, where there's been this great big party and there's a big mess and you've got to come in the night after and do the cleaning up. The cleaning up is pretty hard sometimes. This is the cleaning up that's being done because the government wanted to get rid of the two-out-of-three rule—to make sure that, if you live in a particular media market, no one company can get in there and have a massive say about the kind of news and information that you get.


The government did a deal. They did a whole lot of deals, actually. It took quite a degree of contortion to make deals with multiple people. One was with Pauline Hanson's One Nation party. But the deal that we're discussing today is the deal that was done with former Senator Xenophon. The way that it's characterised all the time in the media is that the government are pushing for this deal and they're going to deliver this reform. What did they trade off? In the case of this particular piece of legislation that we're cleaning up here today, we're doing it in the absence of former Senator Xenophon, who actually did the deal. The deal went through very late in the evening. Sometimes when you're not here in the chamber you'll hear that we worked until one or two o'clock in the morning. The debate was continuing, but the deal was so uncertain and we had many questions that couldn't be answered. Senator Xenophon left the chamber, the vote was taken and the government got their multiple deals sorted—there were enough votes for their legislation. And now we get this clean-up job to sort out what they actually agreed to. We understand that it was very dynamic that night, and the deals weren't clear and the questions weren't able to be answered. But, when we get to this point and we're about to make legislation, we would hope that everything would be in order.


This morning I asked Senator Fifield a number of questions about what's been going on, particularly with regard to the cuts to the ABC—$83.7 million. I'm very concerned about that, but I have to say I'm very concerned about what this piece of legislation is seeking to do. Increasingly, I'm also a little uncertain about what it is that we're supposed to be debating right now. There are a number of pieces of legislation that get amended and, at the moment, with many amendments coming from the Greens, we're not quite sure where we are. That's as I see it at the moment, and I think that's a fair characterisation.


Senator Fifield, how many publishers do you understand will be eligible for the fund? I note that, in response to a question from Senator Hanson-Young, you read quite a long list of supporters of this short-term injection of funding into the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund, but, from the advice that you've received from your department, how many people exactly do you think will actually be eligible for this fund?




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  For the benefit of the chamber, we are having a general discussion about the bill. There have been no amendments formally moved. The reason for that confusion may be because I addressed an amendment, given I was going to be in the chair shortly.

 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:31):  The list of organisations that I referenced before were those which were consulted in relation to the package, which has three elements: the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund, the Regional and Small Publishers Cadetship Program and the Regional Journalism Scholarships. That range of organisations would have had interest in each of those, not necessarily all of them. Some of the organisations may have only had an interest or potential eligibility for some of them. Some of them are organisations which make contributions to public policy and so were interested from that point of view. So that was the list that I referred to before.

That's something that is beyond my knowledge, and it is up to each individual media organisation to assess whether they're eligible to make application and whether they wish to make application. But we are confident that the $2.1 million that is part of the $50 million for the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund will be appropriate to administer the applications that are received, and ACMA is also of that view.

Senator Bernardi

I'll look for an indication as to whether those amendments are ready to proceed with. One option may be that the committee reports progress. I'm in the hands of the Senate. Minister?




Senator FIFIELD:
  I'll endeavour to be of assistance to colleagues, because we operate in real time in this place and we could all find ourselves, when presenting amendments, in a situation where the machinery is racing to catch up. I wonder if this may be of assistance: just looking at these two amendments sheets here, it looks to me as though it may have been the intention of the Australian Greens that the third amendment on sheet 8434 be circulated as a separate amendment, so that sheet 8432 stood as it was. If that's the case, then it might be possible for 8432 to be moved while amendment (3) on sheet 8434 comes as a separate amendment. I just offer that as a suggestion, as it may have been the intention of the instruction that the Greens gave.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:38):  Thank you, Minister, for that. Yes, I think what has happened is that these have been put up as separate sheets when really they should have been on one sheet and then we could move the three blocks of amendments separately. I understand that the Clerk is just circulating a revised sheet that puts it all together, and then we can discuss each amendment as we go. So we now have a sheet in front of us, sheet 8435, which includes amendments in relation to making sure that we can get the maximum amount of effectiveness out of this fund. I would like to suggest that we move amendments (1), (2) and (3) on sheet 8435. And if we can have a bit of a conversation about those things, that would be good. 



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Senator Hanson-Young, are you seeking leave to move amendments (1), (2) and (3) on sheet 8435 together?

unless:


(a) the ACMA is satisfied that the person satisfies the criteria specified in section 205ZHA; and


(b) the person is party to an agreement under subsection 205ZJ(2).


(3) Schedule 1, item 1, page 4 (after line 10), after section 205ZH, insert:




205ZHA Grant criteria



The following criteria are specified in relation to a person for the purposes of paragraph 205ZH(2)(a):


(a) the person carries on a business that in the financial year commencing on 1 July 2016 had a turnover of between $300,000 and $30 million;


(b) the primary activity of the business is journalism that investigates and explains, from an Australian perspective, public policy and issues of public interest or significance;


(c) the primary activity of the business is carried on by individuals resident in Australia;


(d) each senior manager of the person is resident in Australia;


(e) either or both of the following apply:


(i) the person is a member of the Australian Press Council;


(ii) the person has in place a process for the making and handling of complaints made to the person in relation to the person’s business;


(f) the person has in place a code of conduct, editorial guidelines or other framework directed at the provision of quality journalism;


(g) the person does not receive financial assistance from, and does not carry on its business with regard to the interests of, any of the following:


(i) a political party;


(ii) a trade union;


(iii) a superannuation fund;


(iv) a financial institution;


(v) a non-government organisation;


(vi) a policy lobby group.


Basically, what these amendments do is correct the problem that we have had with this piece of legislation from the beginning: that there is an ideological blindness that's been drawn into this bill. We want to make sure that if you're an Australian publisher, if you're an Australian news outlet, if you employ Australian journalists, if you're reporting Australian news and you're doing it for an Australian audience and you're within that small sphere as outlined by the criteria, you have access to this fund. It shouldn't matter whether you are friends with the government ideologically or not. The issue in relation to this would mean that we can ensure that the applicants, to be able to access this fund, must have a body corporate controlled by Australian residents. That is of course important. In this way it ensures that eligible applicants must have Australian management and Australian control with independent Australian editorial direction. But it is not based on whether it is from the right-wing media or the left-wing media—that shouldn't matter. It should be about whether the editorial control and the management are within Australia. It is Australian taxpayer funds, so let's ensure that we are supporting and that this fund can support agencies and news outlets that report Australian stories and employ Australian journalists. 


One of the key elements of this whole debate that came out of the media reform package was: how do we protect Australian journalists' jobs? We know that it is becoming a tougher and tougher gig to be a journalist in Australia. The margins to be able to keep funding organisations are getting harder and harder to work within. We know that the 24-hour media cycle has an impact on that. These are all of the different elements that we have covered over the months and years that we've been debating this issue in a broad sense. The whole objective is to protect Australian journalism, because it's in the public interest to have good journalists writing about Australian stories and what's going on, informing the Australian public, reporting on what we do here in this parliament, at a time when trust in politics is so low. It is a matter of having good support for the journalists who scrutinise us, question what we're doing and make sure that, as a government and as parliamentarians, we're upholding our obligations to the public properly. These are all important roles in relation to why we want a strong journalism sector in Australia. If that's the case, let's make sure this fund actually does that: supports Australian stories and Australian journalists and gets away from just saying, 'Well, it's only available to these people because they fit certain criteria.' The criteria should be that it is Australian managed, that it has Australian editorial control and that they're employing Australian journalists for an Australian audience. I don't see why this chamber should have any issues in relation to that.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:43):  The bill that we have before us is intended to be a simple amendment to give legislative authority to ACMA to independently administer the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund. We have set down a number of eligibility criteria. They are outlined in the explanatory memorandum to the bill but aren't proposed to be legislated. It is normal practice for guidelines and eligibility criteria to sit outside legislation. 


The other point I would make is that if the grant criteria were to be legislated it would mean that the government wouldn't be able to make minor tweaks to the criteria in a straightforward fashion—based on feedback from industry—in light of the administration of the fund, which is something that I think would be helpful.


The final point I'll make is that the Greens amendment does clear the way for outposts of large foreign media outlets to be eligible for funding, and that would mean less funding available for Australian publishers.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:45):  Could the minister explain why the government would be opposed to ensuring that this bill clearly outlines that this fund should be available to publishers who are writing Australian stories and employing Australian journalists for Australian audiences—organisations that are Australian managed and have Australian independent editorial control? Surely that's the objective of this entire bill?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:46):  It's the view of the government that outposts of large foreign media outlets should not be eligible for funding.

It is often the lifeblood of the community—the heartbeat of the community—to know what's going on and who's saying and doing what. Surely, the government must believe that those entities, if they put their hand out for public money, should have independent Australian editorial control?

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:47):  Temporary Chair, I'd just like to answer one of the questions that was asked by you during the committee stage, before you entered into the chair, in relation to clause 3 of the amendments on sheet 8435. From memory, you were asking about the types of things that this money could be spent on and the grant criteria. This is probably a question that needs to go to the minister in some respects, because we need to make very clear that this money is being spent on public interest journalism. This is what this is for; it's not to offset the budgets that bigger organisations perhaps have from their parent bodies in the city. This is about supporting journalists here in the regions, to ensure that those regional communities get the news and the analysis that they deserve. Just to be clear: we need to make sure—and it is in here—that the following criteria are specified in relation to a person for the purposes of this grant:




(g) the person does not receive financial assistance from, and does not carry on its business with regard to the interests of, any of the following:





(i) a political party;





(ii) a trade union;





(iii) a superannuation fund;





(iv) a financial institution;





(v) a non-government organisation;





(vi) a policy lobby group.



This money needs to be spent on journalism. This money should be being spent on what it takes to make sure Australian communities know what's going on in their communities and what their government is doing, and to underpin their ability to do that. Most newspapers or radio stations have advertising and sell ads to keep the newspapers in print or the radio stations on air. Their advertising revenue is up to them, but how do we ensure the money from this bill is being spent on journalists and journalism?

Examples might include commissioning feasibility studies or planning work; commissioning IT builds or installations; acquiring intellectual property or installing new technology, plans and equipment; acquiring assets that are directly and solely employed to achieve the project outcomes, which might take the form of acquisition or lease costs; training staff that directly support the achievement of project outcomes; and defraying the costs of financial auditing of project expenditure.

I understand that a lot of it will be left up to ACMA, but is this part of the consultations the minister has had? Has the minister spoken with the various agencies about how best to ensure this money is spent in the right place? Have these organisations asked to be able to spend this money on other things, and have you had to reject those requests?

 (South Australia) (10:55):  I hate to say it, but that's not very illuminative in terms of why it is $50 million. Is that all the Treasurer let you have, a measly $50 million for your negotiations? Is that what happened or is that just loose change at the back of the couch that you had left over from something else? If we are serious about the demise of public interest journalism in this country, why is it only $50 million? If you're genuinely interested in making sure you protect Australian journalists' jobs, why is it only $50 million?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:56):  It's not the practice that ministers will go to the internal deliberations of government and its internal decision-making processes. But, clearly, when you are in discussions over legislation such as the media reform package, colleagues from across a range of parties come forward with different propositions, and different colleagues will suggest what they think to be appropriate quantums for particular projects that they think might be important and that might be of assistance in helping them to crystallise their thinking about a piece of legislation. I know, Senator Hanson-Young, that you're not unfamiliar with those processes and propositions which might from time to time come from your party to the government in relation to different pieces of legislation.

It's ultimately up to individual organisations to assess themselves against the criteria to see if they meet those criteria in order to be eligible to make an application. I should point out that just because an organisation is eligible to make an application doesn't mean that an application that they submit will necessarily be successful.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:59):  I find this interesting. You think that there could be dozens and dozens of these organisations who could be eligible. Have you done any work in your consultation as to how many organisations might apply? You said you've done some consultation. You must have an idea of how many applications you're going to get. The reason I'm interested in this is that it helps us to understand how effective this is going to be as an innovation fund. If there are dozens and dozens of organisations that would be eligible under the criteria, how on earth will you determine which organisations in which locations will get access to this support? Would we be in a situation where Queensland, for example, gets nothing but your home state of Victoria and the regional newspapers in Victoria get a lot? Or, indeed, would it be that the media agencies in Queensland would get a lot and, say, those in my home state of South Australia will not?


You said to me you didn't want to explore, in this place, why $50 million was put on the table. You're now telling me that dozens and dozens of agencies would be eligible. How on earth are we going to decide which ones get them? How do we make sure this isn't just a pork-barrelling exercise for the government?

What protections are there? How will you manage to ensure that it's not lopsided? How do we make sure that it is not just communities on the east coast of Australia that are benefiting from this and no-one from Western Australia, South Australia or, indeed, Tasmania? How are you going to make sure that doesn't happen? It sounds as though, perhaps, you haven't really thought about (a) whether $50 million is appropriate or (b) how many are eligible in the criteria in relation to ensuring that you've got a fund that will effectively meet the needs of small publishers and media agencies whether they are in the suburbs or the bush.

I know she tried to address one that I foreshadowed earlier, but I don't believe it was adequately clarified for me. I'm specifically referring to amendment (3) on sheet 8435, in which there are very specific grant eligibility criteria. One of them is subsection (g): 'the person does not receive financial assistance from'—and then it lists political parties, trade unions and so forth. My question specifically is: what is the definition of 'financial assistance' in this case? If a political party undertakes a commercial contract with a person, as defined by this schedule, for advertising services or other engagement of a commercial nature, does that rule the person as described ineligible to apply for the grant?

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (11:05):  I understand how difficult it can be managing so many complex issues in your portfolio, Minister. For the benefit of you and your advisers, amendment (3) on sheet 8435 lists a range of grant criteria which Senator Hanson-Young has advised are directly out of your explanatory memorandum. I'm interested in the definitions of several clauses and several words in there. The one I particularly raised was financial assistance. What denotes financial assistance from one of those political entities? Is a regular commercial contract engaged, say, between a publisher and a political party or a financial institution deemed to be financial assistance because they are, in effect, giving money to the publisher? I want to know what criteria, specifically, apply to financial assistance.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:06):  Senator Bernardi, I can't help you because the wording in Senator Hanson-Young's amendment is not the wording that is in our explanatory memorandum and is not the wording that is in our criteria. Our criteria, in relation to that, are much broader. In our explanatory memorandum, where we talk about an independence test, we say that it not be:


… affiliated with a political party, union, superannuation fund, financial institution, non-government organisation or policy lobby group);


So we talk about affiliation, which is a much broader concept than that which is in Senator Hanson-Young's amendment. What Senator Hanson-Young is referring to by way of financial assistance I can't tell you because it's not our criteria and it's not in our EM.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (11:08):  Thank you, Minister. You'll understand why the Senate may be a bit confused when one senator says one thing, and I'm sure it's not due to malfeasance or anything else, and the minister says another. I will redirect the same question to Senator Hanson-Young. Do you have a response, Senator Hanson-Young?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2018-05-10,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (11:08):  The wording 'financial assistance' is used throughout the explanatory memorandum. That is why those are the words.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2018-05-10,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:08):  'Financial assistance' is used in the explanatory memorandum in terms of the Commonwealth's grant to an entity. It's not in relation to the relationship between the entity and a third party.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",AC,2018-05-10,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (11:08):  Thank you for that. As these amendments are moved and circulated by the Greens, I'm going to address the question to the Greens. In order not to delay the Senate in considering this bill in a timely manner, there are other questions about definitions as well which the minister may like to take under advisement should they be redirected towards him. There are questions around the phrase in the Greens amendment: 'each senior manager of the person is resident in Australia'. A 'person' being, let's presume, a corporate entity, does that mean each and every director? Does it mean the editors? Does it mean any senior personnel within the organisation? These are very specific questions because they go to the ability to implement the amendments that Senator Hanson-Young and the Greens have put forward. I'm just seeking some sort of assurance that Senator Hanson-Young has received the appropriate advice and is ready to respond, which I believe she is.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2018-05-10,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (11:10):  These would be matters for ACMA to interpret, as per the rest of the criteria in the current bill as before us. As the minister has said, this fund is meant to be administered by ACMA. We set down the criteria as they are, and they oversee them. I'd be interested to know, from the minister's perspective, how on earth ACMA are meant to interpret, for example, to ensure which of these 'dozens and dozens' of organisations that he believes would be eligible won't all just be concentrated in the same state.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2018-05-10,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:11):  I've already answered that.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",AC,2018-05-10,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (11:11):  I regret that I can't just accept the buck-passing to ACMA. I do note that the other amendments deal with ACMA dealing with it, but these are very specific issues because the description of each senior manager of the person is one that could lead to ongoing legal dispute, if I may say so. What is deemed a 'senior manager'? Is it a director? Does having one foreign director on your board in a corporate entity contradict the grant criteria, if you've got some international expertise? These are quite genuine questions because they go to the workability of it. Similarly with 'financial assistance': I could mount an argument that financial assistance is a regular commercial contract. If you're preventing small publishers from entering into a commercial contract with a financial institution, a political party. a trade union, a superannuation fund, a policy lobby group or a non-government organisation you're probably killing their business. I'm sure that's not the intention, but I've learned in my time in this place that you're better off being quite specific and resolving these issues now rather than leaving it to an outside entity to interpret them, because they're prone to problems later on. I'm trying to avoid the problems.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2018-05-10,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (11:12):  In relation to paragraph (g), I would point out to Senator Bernardi:


(g) the person does not receive financial assistance from—


and—


does not carry on its business with regard to the interests of …


The argument about a regular commercial contract and advertising—I don't believe that is caught by this at all. The point is that this is about the interests of these political organisations or trade unions or superannuation funds or whatever and the rest of that group. It's not just about the financial assistance. It's about ensuring that the interests of that group are not going to be supported by any of the activities that this fund would underpin.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",AC,2018-05-10,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (11:13):  Thank you, Senator Hanson-Young, that's very helpful. Just to clarify: something that is like The New Daily, which is funded by industry super funds, I understand, would be ineligible to receive a grant under this criterion. Is that correct?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2018-05-10,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",AC,2018-05-10,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (11:14):  In respect of the definition of what a senior manager is, amendment (3), paragraph (d), reads:


(d) each senior manager of the person is resident in Australia;


What is a senior manager?


Is it a director in a corporate entity—as most of these small publishers would be for liability reasons? And if they had a foreign director, even if there were only one of them, would that deem them ineligible? What if they had an editor in an offshore post somewhere, maybe in the Pacific or in an Asian country, and the editor were effectively deemed to be a senior manager? Where do the criteria begin and end?

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2018-05-10,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (11:15):  I do believe that this would be something that, in terms of those details, ACMA would need to oversee. But let me just be very clear: the intent of this is to ensure that eligible applicants have Australian management of the media outlet and agency—that they are Australian controlled—with independent Australian editorial direction.

The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(

Senator O'NEILL:
  Are there going to be votes on any of the other pieces of paper before us, or is their proposal simply that there will be a vote on the amendments as indicated on sheet 8435, which is before us currently?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2018-05-10,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (11:17):  No. It's fine with us if they're moved as a block. I just want to put some comments on the record, as it looks like we're about to go to a vote—I think we are. Labor will support this amendment, which seeks to ameliorate one of the flaws with the fund—that the grant criteria is ideologically motivated.


Public interest journalism, the fourth estate, is a key pillar in our democracy. Support for public interest journalism in our democracy should not be ideologically motivated. We had several things to say about that on the night the bill came before us for the first time. It was sadly ironic that the two-out-of-three cross-media control rule, which acted as a democratic safeguard in promoting media diversity in Australia, was done away with through a deal that was conducted behind closed doors and away from democratic scrutiny.


Labor understands and shares the sentiment behind this amendment. On the night the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund was announced in this place, Labor decried the government's ideologically motivated exclusion of certain innovative publishers from the fund. That included The Guardian Australia, BuzzFeed and The New Daily. The concerns we have about those very important parts of the media, which we have access to every day as citizens of this country, are the key motivation for our support of this amendment. Labor will continue to hold the government to account for the deal, and we'll monitor the uptake of this fund. We will be watching who applies for it, we will be watching who accesses it and we will certainly be watching to see what, if anything, it achieves.


Labor are aware that the government has valid concerns with the drafting of this amendment, such as concerns that there are technical defects. I have to say that we do share some of those concerns, but we do not think that these concerns are insurmountable, and we believe that the government will have the opportunity and resources to remedy them as the bill progresses through the parliament.


Labor is also conscious that legislating the eligibility criteria will mean that any changes to the criteria in future would require legislative amendment. For example, if the minimum revenue threshold of $300,000 were too high, it would be necessary to return to parliament to amend the criteria. To the extent that flexibility to tweak the criteria is desirable should the government discover along the way that the criteria are not fit for purpose, Labor notes that the government took the decision to forge these criteria behind closed doors, away from parliamentary scrutiny. That the government is making this fund up as it goes along is a matter of concern for the government and it is certainly of concern to us. While, as the minister outlined, it is standard practice to include criteria in guidelines and not legislation, the government has, unfortunately, acted to create a fund that is ideologically motivated, and has thus motivated the amendment that is now before us. Labor notes that, without legislating the criteria, it would be open to future governments to revisit the eligibility criteria. But the issue before the Senate with this amendment is whether the overarching criteria are actually suitable. As the criteria are ideologically motivated, we believe they should not be supported because they are not suitable.


I want to close by putting on the record that Labor has sought consultative engagement with both the Greens and the government with regard to this particular amendment. There are many unanswered questions on this bill and on the amendment. The amendments circulated by the Greens today are many and, in our view, they are not drafted perfectly. Yet, on balance, Labor believes that this does address an ideological attack on a vital part of the media landscape of this country and the amendment goes a significant way to redressing that balance. So, on balance, Labor will support this amendment on 8435.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:22):  I would make two quick observations. Firstly, it's very interesting if the Labor Party are saying that, henceforth, they believe program criteria and guidelines for grants should always be legislated. That's very interesting. That seems to be the Labor Party's new position across programs and portfolios. We'll be watching that with interest. Secondly, Labor themselves have conceded that there are errors and difficulties in the Greens amendments. It's very odd that the Labor Party, recognising that, are proposing to support the amendments and are saying that it's somehow the government's job to clean up inadequate amendments to give effect to something that is not government policy.



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Senator O'Neill, do you want to respond?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2018-05-10,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (11:23):  Just for the record, I don't intend to allow the minister to verbal me and declare that this is a position for Labor going forward. This is a bill that you constructed in the dark, in a dirty deal with Senator Xenophon, who's no longer here. This is a bill with guidelines that you constructed that excluded key participants in the media landscape of this country. This amendment is important in that it seeks to redress that ideological attack. This is an extraordinary situation, not business as usual, Minister. So I don't want you to misunderstand in any way our action on this very particular matter.

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2018-05-10,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:24):  I can only take the implication from that comment that the Labor Party are against any cross-party agreements and that they will not, from this point on, be entering into any agreements with any crossbench groupings in this place and will never have discussions outside of this chamber with any crossbench grouping. So, again, that's a curious development.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2018-05-10,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (11:24):  For the record, I think the senator is deliberately misinterpreting the nature of my comments this morning. I would not like his interpretation to stand as an accurate record. Of course the Labor Party will continue to constructively converse with all participants here in the chamber.



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  The question is that amendments (1), (2) and (3) on sheet 8435 be agreed to.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator McGRATH:
  Australia has a proud history of contributing to UN peacekeeping missions, which aim to provide security and stability in conflict affected countries. In addition to traditional peacekeeping activities, modern missions also aim to ensure a sustainable peace, including through efforts such as protecting civilians, assisting in disarming combatants, work to prevent the recruitment of child soldiers and assisting with free and fair elections. Australia is a significant and reliable contributor to UN peacekeeping. We've been engaged in UN peacekeeping for 70 years and have served in 21 UN peacekeeping operations.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:07):  I move:


That the Senate—


(a) recognises that single rates of unemployment payments are completely inadequate to cover basic living costs;


(b) acknowledges that our social safety net currently fails to protect jobseekers from falling into poverty;


(c) notes that:


(i) the Australian Council of Social Service has called for an increase of $75 a week to allowance payments for single people from 1 January 2019, and


(ii) the 2018-19 Budget did not increase any allowance payments, including Newstart or Youth Allowance; and


(d) urges the Federal Government to increase the single rate of Newstart and Youth Allowance by $75 a week.

Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (12:07):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator CHISHOLM:
  Newstart is too low. Labor knows this, but, unlike the Greens, we want to bring about change, not pull stunts. That's why Bill Shorten has committed to a root-and-branch review of Newstart. The truth is that if you want to see an increase to Newstart you've got to change the government.


How do you think the last major increase to social security came about? The Labor government commissioned the Harmer review into the adequacy of the pension. This was a proper policy process that was undertaken. Consultations with key stakeholders were held and it was paid for in the budget. As a result, pensions were increased by $30 a week, the biggest increase in history. One million Australians were lifted out of poverty. It didn't happen because of a stunt in the Senate from a minor party like the Greens; it happened because there was a Labor government in office.


We fully understand that Newstart hasn't seen an increase in real terms for more than 20 years. That's why we've worked so hard in the last two years to protect the energy supplement for vulnerable Australians on Newstart.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion as moved by Senator Siewert be agreed to. Those of that opinion, say aye—

Senator DI NATALE:
  Thank you, Madam Deputy President. Look, I just couldn't resist when I heard Senator Chisholm mention the word 'stunt'. The last time I heard a Labor senator use the word stunt when referring to a Greens' proposal was in relation to the royal commission. It was Senator Sam Dastyari who, in justifying a vote against a royal commission, said he wouldn't support it because it was a Greens' stunt. Well, if Senator Chisholm's been paying attention, he'd see right now that we do have a royal commission, and it was in large part thanks to the hard work of the Greens—in fact, my colleague, Senator Whish-Wilson—and some sensible National Party members who recognised that it was time that we had a review into the banking sector. Now, it won't be long before the Labor Party do come on board with the campaign to raise Newstart—something that Senator Siewert has been campaigning on for many, many years. I know many of you are a bit slow on the uptake, but it won't be long before you get there and, when you do, you'll thank the Greens and many other members of the community for leading the charge.

  President, in lieu of suspending standing orders, I seek leave to make a one-minute statement.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted.




Senator DI NATALE:
  I have to say, it's very disappointing, given that yesterday's motion on the same issue was not denied leave—a motion put forward by Senator Leyonhjelm. I will say: this is an important motion. On 15 May, many people in Israel are celebrating the creation of Israel but, at the same time, Palestinians commemorate the Nakba, where in 1948, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were displaced and lost their homes—and indeed, many were killed. This year marks the 70th anniversary of the state of Israel, but it also marks the 70th anniversary of the Nakba, and millions of Palestinians continue to suffer, living under occupation or as refugees. 


The Greens express deep concern that at least 43 mostly unarmed and peaceful Palestinian protesters have reportedly been killed by Israeli forces since the end of March on the border of Gaza, including four minors and two journalists. We welcome the fact that six Israeli human rights groups are challenging the Israeli military's actions in court, and we express further deep concern at Palestinian President Abbas's recent anti-Semitic comments.

  In line with the longstanding view of successive governments, given that formal motions cannot be debated or amended, they should not deal with complex and contested foreign policy matters. Australian policy is to support direct negotiation between Israel and the Palestinians to achieve a two-state solution. This policy has continued across governments. Unilateral recognition of a state of Palestine would not contribute to returning the parties to negotiations.

  Labor has long supported and continues to support an enduring and just two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict based on the right of Israel to live in peace within secure borders internationally recognised and agreed by the parties, and reflecting the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people to also live in peace and security within their own state. 


Labor supports all genuine efforts toward a negotiated settlement between the parties to the conflict based on international frameworks, laws and norms. We also condemn all violence related to the conflict, and Labor will continue to call on both sides to refrain from any actions that hamper peaceful outcomes for both the Israeli and Palestinian people. 


Labor is concerned about recent violence on the Gaza border. Labor also condemns anti-Semitic speech and behaviour in all its forms. Labor, whether in government or opposition, will continue to work with the parties to the conflict, our allies and the wider international community to achieve a peaceful resolution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict.

PRIMARY INDUSTRIES RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL 2017


SECOND READING SPEECH


Proactive industries are the future of Australian agriculture, fisheries and forestry – industries that see an opportunity to promote their product, grow their business and become more profitable. This bill will help a range of rural industry sectors to make it happen. 


In the late 1980s, industry and government established the rural research and development (R&D) corporations under the Primary Industries Research and Development Act 1989. Since then, the R&D corporations have helped to keep rural industries productive and profitable by conducting research, development and extension which is practical and relevant to each industry sector. Industry and government both invest in the R&D corporations. Industry invests through levies on production and the Australian Government invests by matching industry's R&D levy expenditure. According to ABARES kestimates, for every dollar invested in broadacre agricultural R&D farmers generate a $12 return within 10 years. 


Strong agriculture, fisheries and forestry industries are good for all Australians. ABARES forecasts our farm exports to be around $47.7 billion in 2016-17 and $48.7 billion the next year. 


There are 15 rural R&D Corporations, of which 14 can carry out marketing activities. Only ten do, however, and they provide a valuable service to their industry sectors. Marketing has helped to build our pork, wool and red meat industries, to name just a few, and expanded Australian access to international markets. 


Four statutory R&D corporations are still governed by the 1989 legislation – the Fisheries, Cotton, Grains and Rural Industries R&D Corporations. Unlike most R&D Corporations, they must have a statutory levy attached to the corporation in order to undertake marketing. This change was made in 2013 following wide consultation which lead to the passage of the Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Act 2013. 


The process to impose a statutory levy is often time consuming and its collection can be expensive. The Fisheries R&D Corporation and its industry bodies say that smaller industries cannot afford the costs of establishing and collecting a statutory levy. 


This bill provides that the Fisheries, Cotton, Grains and Rural Industries R&D Corporations will be able to carry out marketing activities using voluntary contributions – for example a gift, grant or bequest. This will add to their existing ability to conduct marketing with statutory levy funds. 


The R&D Corporation will have to report on the marketing activities it carries out each financial year in its annual report.


The bill will expand the definition of 'marketing activities' to include matters incidental to marketing. This will allow R&D Corporations to scope, plan and coordinate marketing activities without having to use funds provided to them for R&D purposes. The expanded definition mirrors the definition of R&D activities to make it easier to apply and understand. 


The affected R&D Corporations support the provisions in this bill.


TREASURY LAWS AMENDMENT (WORKING HOLIDAY MAKER EMPLOYER REGISTER) BILL 2017


SECOND READING SPEECH


This Bill introduces changes to ensure that details of the working holiday maker employer register are not made public. It also ensures information sharing between the Australian Taxation Office and the Fair Work Ombudsman, is undertaken in situations in which an entity is actually or is reasonably suspected of non-compliance with a tax law.


Through minor amendments to the taxation laws, this Bill removes the ability for details of the employer register to be made public on the ABN Lookup.


This change will not affect the operation of the employer register or the rules applying to employers of working holiday makers. All employers of working holiday makers will still be required to register with the ATO in order to withhold at the 15 per cent tax rate.


The register addresses concerns about the exploitation of working holiday makers and will provide valuable data on working holiday makers. This amendment being introduced today does not affect the requirement for the ATO to report this information annually to the Treasurer, for presentation to the Parliament. This reporting process involves aggregate employer information and will not identify any working holiday maker employers.


This Bill also ensures information sharing between the ATO and the Fair Work Ombudsman will be limited to situations in which an entity is actually or is reasonably suspected of noncompliance with a tax law.


Full details of this Bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum.


Debate adjourned.

Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales—Minister for Defence) (15:08):  I rise to make a statement to the Senate in relation to an order for production of documents. It frankly remains a mystery to all Australians who are interested in ensuring that Australia has a continuous naval shipbuilding program and the industry to support that why alone amongst the vast majority of Australians Senator Patrick seems unable to support that himself. It's a mystery to me and it's a mystery to his South Australian constituents. Nevertheless, we will provide some response this afternoon to his most recent motions.


It is typical histrionics from Senator Patrick to claim that the government has shown a profound lack of respect in its response to the Senate, to the President, by the letter of Minister Cormann of 12 February. In fact, if you know anything about tendering, if you know anything about significant contracts and if you know anything about national security then you would be of the view that it is perfectly reasonable, it is appropriate and it is proper that the government properly consider the circumstances under which information is publicly released where the release may have an impact on international relations and where it may unfairly prejudice the commercial interests of an entity or, indeed, of the Commonwealth. This government, perhaps unlike Senator Patrick, takes those responsibilities seriously. Further, unlike Senator Patrick's approach, this government will always act responsibly on such matters, especially when it relates to a program of such importance to our national security and to international relations.


In accordance with Senator Cormann's letter to the President when he was representing me in this place on 12 February, I will be writing to the President further on this matter.

",Senate,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Defence Procurement</title>,DOCUMENTS,21,1
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-05-10,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (15:10):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the statement.


At the outset I want to recap the sequence of events that managed to get us to this point. A year ago almost to the day, on 9 May 2017, then Senator Xenophon made an FOI application to the Department of Defence relating to Australian industry involvement in the $50 billion Future Submarine program, a nationally significant, highly important program. Senator Xenophon noted that an ANAO report into the Future Submarine CEP process had stated:


As part of its response to the competitive evaluation, the participants were required to provide an Australian Industry Plan identifying opportunities for Australian industry, and how Australian industry involvement could be maximised during the lifecycle of the program.


Senator Xenophon was interested in just what Australian industry involvement would be in this tremendously important national project and accordingly made an FOI application to the defence department for the final submarine Australian industry plan submitted to Defence by the submarine builder DCNS, now Naval Group. He simply wanted to know what they had promised to do in respect of Australian industry.


Defence was really quick to respond. Just two weeks later on 23 May 2017, a decision was made denying access to the document because, the department said, it did not exist. At that time I was an adviser to Senator Xenophon and on his behalf sought an internal review of that decision. After all, the Auditor-General had referenced it, so I was pretty sure that it did exist. On 26 June, a senior officer in the defence department made an internal review decision. Having found the document did actually exist, the department refused access to it in its entirety, claiming the documents to be exempt under sections 47C and 47G of the FOI Act. They claimed that the document contained information that was deliberative in nature and also contained confidential business information and commercial or financial information that, had it been released, would have disadvantaged or prejudiced business operation and may even have caused Defence difficulty in seeking such information in the future.


At the time, Defence made no claim—no claim at all—under section 33 of the FOI Act that the document was exempt from disclosure because it contained information that, if released, would damage the defence security or international relationships with the Commonwealth. No such claim was made. Former Senator Xenophon referred Defence's internal review decision to the Information Commissioner for independent review. That review is ongoing and is now being handled by me and my office on behalf of Mr Xenophon.


To move to this year: in the Senate on 12 February, I moved a motion for an order for the production of documents—specifically for the Minister representing the Minister for Defence Industry to present to the Senate the Australian industry capability plan submitted by DCNS to the defence department in its response to the Future Submarine competitive evaluation process. You might recall that at that time the defence industry minister had gone from 90 per cent to 60 per cent Australian industry content, and now we have just received a Future Frigate document that went to 50 per cent Australian industry content. In speaking to that motion, I made the following comments, which are worth repeating today:


This document is an important document which outlines the promise of DCNS, now Naval Group, to Australian industry as to what involvement it will have in the Future Submarine project. It is an important document that former Senator Xenophon requested under FOI in April 2017. What this means is that the Information Commissioner is about to make a decision about it. So I respectfully suggest to the minister that she needs to respond to the OPD in a very considered manner. I don't want to see the minister ordered to make another explanation as to why she got her OPD response wrong, because I can assure you I will not hesitate to protect the integrity of the Senate oversight processes in circumstances where the minister makes another bogus claim.


Senators will recall the Minister for Defence had previously claimed documents relating to the Future Frigate Program could not be released to the Senate, not only on grounds of national security and defence but also for international relations reasons, only to have those documents released through an FOI review undertaken by the Information Commissioner. So we can't have them, but Mr Xenophon, in those circumstances, could.


On 12 February, Senator McGrath affirmed to the Senate that the government would not release the DCNS Australian industry capability plan; indeed, it would continue to withhold the document in its entirety. Senator McGrath claimed the entire document contained intellectual property regarding the design and build of submarines and the methods for technology transfer. The subject matter of the document itself—Australian industry participation—made Senator McGrath's claims about intellectual property and technology transfer as the basis for withholding the entire document rather implausible. Most significantly, Senator McGrath added—almost as an afterthought but clearly as a justification for a complete refusal to disclose—that 'disclosure could be expected to damage Australia's international relations with France.'


This was the first time, on 12 February this year, that the government claimed that the release of the document would damage Australia's international relations. That claim had not been made by Defence in Defence's original internal review decision seven months earlier. It's not been made by Defence in the review process taking place with the Information Commissioner. One might have reasonably thought that, if the claim had merit, Defence would have already argued it, but they'd not raised it at all. 


On 12 February 2018, the Senate agreed to the OPD motion. On 15 February this year, the duty minister tabled in the Senate a letter claiming public interest immunity and stating that the release of the documents would affect the commercial interests of Naval Group and adversely affect Australia's international relations. That letter further advised the Senate that the government was awaiting the outcome of the Information Commissioner's review into FOI exemption claimed over the documents. On 27 March this year, I moved a further motion that noted a previous Senate resolution and declared:


… declining to provide documents or answer questions on the basis that an FOI request has been made for the same information is an unacceptable response, is not supported by the FOI Act and shows a profound lack of respect for the Senate and its committees. 


They're not my words; they come from Odgers. 


The motion further observed:


(f) … claim of commercial confidentiality must be carefully advanced and claimed narrowly so as to recognise the public interest that lies in openness and transparency on this very important project. 


The motion further made the point:


(g) the claim that the release of the documents will affect international relations is not properly made out and is flawed (and has not even been advanced by the Department of Defence as a concern in the Information Commissioner Review) because the document which is the subject of the order is a document of a French-law Public Limited Company, not a document of the French state;


The motion further called on the Minister for Defence to make a statement to the Senate—which she's done today—addressing why she:


(a) has advanced a claim showing a profound lack of respect for the Senate; 


(b) offered a broad confidentiality claim that does not correctly balance the public interest in knowing what DCNS promised, in respect of Australian industry involvement in our largest ever Defence project; and 


(c) has advanced a claim that releasing the document to the Senate would affect Australia's international relations knowing that this claim is inconsistent with the position of her own Department.


The motion was agreed to on 27 March.


Eight days after that motion there was a further interesting development in this story. On 4 April 2018, Defence made a new submission to the Information Commissioner's review and belatedly introduced a claim for the documents to be wholly exempt under section 33 of the FOI Act—namely, that the release of the documents would damage Australia's international relations. As I've said, in the course of nearly a year, Defence had not previously made that claim. That fact begs the question as to what, if anything, has happened to change the department's position.


Defence now claims that the release of the documents could reasonably be expected to cause damage to Australia's relationship with foreign governments; that it would damage international confidence in Australia and Australia's relationship with other countries; that it would adversely affect the ability of the Australian government to maintain good working relationships with other governments and international organisations; that it would cause a loss of trust and confidence in the Australian government; and that foreign officials may be less willing to engage with Australian businesses in future. None of those claims had been made previously; they were all freshly minted. Yet the department failed to detail any evidence to support its claim in relation to the release of the documents, which is, it should be recalled, information provided to the Commonwealth by a commercial entity engaged in a commercial tender process.


Defence's section 33 claim had been made late in the day. It is heavy on assertion and very light on evidence or argument. It looks much like something that's been cobbled together to bring the department's position in line with the assertion made by the minister in this place. Given the context of deliberations in the Senate on this matter since 12 February, it's not unreasonable to conclude that Defence's claim of a section 33 exemption may not be based on a careful evaluation of the relevant facts; rather, it may well be made in response to a direction or other interference from a minister's office or else was made by the department simply in order to bring the department's position in line with the claim made by the government in the Senate.


However, efforts to avoid political embarrassment for ministers are not appropriate drivers for departmental FOI decision-making. Defence's decision-making in this matter may well have been politically compromised. Accordingly, I have made a formal complaint to the Information Commissioner under section 70 of the FOI Act in relation to the defence department's decision-making in this matter. I have specifically requested the Information Commissioner to make inquiries and investigate Defence's decision-making in respect of its new section 33 exemption claim. It would be appropriate—indeed, I believe it is essential—for the information in pursuing such an inquiry to require under section 79 of the FOI Act the production of relevant documents and records, including communications between the department and ministers' offices and between the ministers' offices themselves in order to determine when, how and on what basis the purported new international relations exemption claims were made. Such an inquiry is essential to determine whether the integrity of Defence's decision-making has been compromised and whether Defence's claims are based on careful and objective reasoning and not on the desire to accommodate the political interests of the minister.


But that's not the end of the story. Curiously, on 30 April, I was advised by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner that Defence had advised that 'they intend to release at least part of the document and will do so tomorrow'—11 May. So perhaps some of those claims of exemption were not very robust at all and could not have been applied to the document in its entirety. But how convenient the timing is! Defence is waiting until tomorrow, after the Senate has risen this week, before it provides me with the new documents.


This is not the first occasion that the defence minister has, on dubious grounds, invoked 'damage to national security or international relations' to justify withholding information from the Senate. However, national security is not a political light bulb that can be switched on and off at the whim of ministers to resist releasing what they may consider to be embarrassing information.


Today the minister stated that there were very serious reasons for not providing this information to the Senate. Yet I have a document from the Information Commissioner today saying that Defence is quite prepared to release some of that information to Mr Xenophon. They won't release it to the Senate—the Senate won't get anything, it appears—but Mr Xenophon can get his information. In response, I can only return to the remarks I made on 12 February, when I respectfully suggested the minister needed to respond to the OPD in a very considered manner and that it would be regrettable if the minister had to make another explanation as to why she got her OPD response wrong. Regrettably, she did not do so. Instead the government have adopted an obstructive and negative approach to the release of information. They have done so in complete disregard of public interest.


The extent of Australian industry participation in the new submarine project, a project of tremendous national security and economic importance, is clearly something that should be subject to well-informed debate not only in the Senate but also in the public domain more broadly. A year has passed since former Senator Xenophon made his original application. Yet here we are today, with the government still fighting tooth and nail to keep these things locked away. They must do better than this, and the Senate must hold them to account.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2018-05-10,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (15:25):  The information that is being sought through this return to order unfortunately follows a record of deception and dissimilation, which Senator Patrick has outlined this afternoon, as a result of this government seeking to withhold legitimate information from the Senate. I have participated in the various committees of the Senate for quite some time. I have participated in the Senate inquiry into naval shipbuilding in this parliament, and I have seen the wide and reckless claims that the government have made in regard to executive privilege, the future frigate programs and the submarine programs. The claims they have made in regard to the withholding of information based on spurious protections of international relations or national security are confounded by the fact that these documents have so often been released subsequently. This is the really serious flaw in the government's argument. If the Information Commissioner is able to release the documents having had ministers of this government stand in this chamber and deny the legitimacy of the requests that are being made by senators in this chamber, it strikes me that it really does highlight the level of deception that this government has engaged in.


In my opinion, these are not questions that go to national security. As the alternative government, it is not the opposition's view that we would be engaged in questions that would fundamentally challenge the national security of the Commonwealth of Australia. As the alternative government, we have a responsibility to ensure that we don't use the powers of the Senate in a reckless manner. What we do have, though, is the responsibility to hold the government to account and to ensure that the actions of the government are scrutinised properly.


The fundamental premise on which the government's actions have been based has not been matters of national security but matters that go to the political interests of the government. The record of the government's Naval Shipbuilding Plan is much touted: a $90 billion investment and the development of a sovereign capability in our country, particularly the $50 billion Future Frigate Program, is essentially about a fundamental issue of the future direction of this country. It is only appropriate that we as senators take this matter at the most serious level. If we ignore the rhetoric and focus on what the government actually does in regards to the shipbuilding plan, I think we're entitled to go to the heart of what this issue really does come down to.


What has concerned me and my examination of these issues over the life of this government is that the Naval Shipbuilding Plan is increasingly resembling not a national industry plan for the development of a national capability in shipbuilding but a national marginal seats plan for this government. This is a government that makes assurances about shipbuilding jobs, for instance, which are simply not being fulfilled. Recently we have had the situation with Osborne, a shipyard in South Australia, where the ASC is still shedding jobs. Just last month, it announced 223 jobs would go. This is despite the fact that last December, last November—on numerous occasions in that period—and last October as well, the Minister for Defence Industry told the media:


The valley of death is over and we are now seeing a upturn of employment in naval shipbuilding in our state that will only continue to increase as these new projects gain momentum.


Yet he had previously told representatives of the metalworkers union and the Secretary of the ACTU that the ASC was transitioning and that he was doing all that was necessary to ensure that that was coming about. On 6 December Mr Glenn Thompson, the National Assistant Secretary of the AMWU, saw Mr Pyne in his office and was told that there would be no further job losses at the ASC.


On 11 December, Mr Pyne issued a media release where he said:


We are stabilising the shipbuilding workforce … things are truly on the up at Osborne.


However, on 22 April this year, the shipbuilding workers at Osborne found out what 'stabilising' actually meant under this government. It meant a further 223 of them were to go. We've got a long litany of broken promises. The minister's evasions and deceptions on this issue, I think, are totally without peer when it comes to what is a pretty sorry record of naval procurement.


The minister, in April 2016, announced that the company known as Naval Group was selected to design the Future Submarines. The Prime Minister talked to journalists at that time, with regard to the issue of sustainment of the submarines. This is the point of the documents that Senator Patrick has been able to secure through this process of discovery. The Prime Minister has been quoted many times in the media now about the delivery of the work. He said:


It will be shared between the two but the heavier work, if you like, was obviously always going to be done here at Osborne, as it is now.


Of course, what the Prime Minister was doing on that occasion was playing to a South Australian audience. What we know from the documents that Senator Patrick has brought before us is that a very different message was being given to the Department of Defence. Less than two months after that statement by the Prime Minister, on 3 June, the department asked the ASC, which carried out the work on the Collins class submarine at Osborne, to estimate the cost and time required to consolidate all the shipbuilding work in Western Australia—that was to actually shift the sustainment work to Western Australia. So the Prime Minister is telling the people of South Australia the work will be done in South Australia, while the department's asking the ASC what it costs and what it involves to move the work to Western Australia. Of course, that's being done in secret. The statement from the department issued to the ASC notes that the Collins class boats would still be in service at a time when the substantial construction work on the submarines and surface ships was underway at Osborne. He said:


This combination of activities may exceed the available industry capacity in SA, which may motivate consideration of a consolidation of Collins maintenance activities in WA, in order that SA industry might concentrate on ship and submarine construction.


Advice regarding scope, cost, schedule and risk of consolidating submarine maintenance in WA will help inform future considerations—


of the project. And the ASC, of course, was given until February 2017 to come up with an answer. The level of sheer dishonesty that's been perpetrated in this matter is clear for all to see.


What we know now, of course, is that there was something very pressing in the Prime Minister's mind when these matters were being developed. In the last week of May 2016 he announced that a federal election would be held on 2 July. That was an election in which the government was very worried about the job losses in South Australia. That was an election in which the government was very anxious about the consequences of its decision to destroy the motor vehicle manufacturing industry in this country. It wouldn't have been a good time to admit the truth about the government's intention to undermine the ASC and switch the sustainment work out of Adelaide and send it across to Western Australia. It wouldn't have been a good time to be honest with the workers at the ASC, who were employed in the sustainment of the Collins class boats, including the full-cycle docking at Osborne. So the Prime Minister used evasive words. He talked about sharing of the work between Osborne and Henderson. He said:


… the heavier work … was … always going to be done … at Osborne … 


We now know that the government was acting in a thoroughly dishonest and deceptive manner. If the government were serious about investing in the industry, if it were serious about developing the national capabilities in terms of naval shipbuilding, if it were serious about these questions of national interest, it would have actually argued its case publicly. It certainly wouldn't have engaged in this rhetorical sleight of hand. If it believed that it was actually in the national interest to develop the capacity at Henderson, you would have thought it would have said so. If it were serious about arguing the case for a long-term strategic industry, you would have thought it would have said so as well, rather than taking the slippery, evasive approach which has been highlighted throughout this whole process and which these documents reveal time and time again. What does the government do? It wraps itself in the flag and tries to pretend that it is engaged in something other than sheer political hypocrisy, when it is developing a national capacity to defend its own marginal seats rather than defend the national interests of this country.


The government talks a lot about short-term thinking. Well, it is a past master of short-term thinking—thinking about the next election, desperately trying to maintain its political survival. When you put on top of that a South Australian election, which is what we have had, and a minister in South Australia who really shouldn't be known as the Minister for Defence Industry but should be known as the Minister for Marginal Seats, we've got a situation where this government simply can't help itself. It just cannot help itself. A government that was directly responsible for the destruction of the automotive manufacturing industry in South Australia then had to turn around and try to dress that up by some arrangements with regard to naval shipbuilding, but it couldn't then quite work out how to balance out the interests in South Australia against its marginal seats interests in Perth.


What we've got is a government that tries to hide its political intentions, and these documents reveal the inner secrets of what's actually been going on inside the government. We now know that the government has made no attempt to explain how it will reconcile its conduct of the business between the department and the ASC with regard to submarine sustainment. Now, of course, we are past the 2016 election, past the South Australian election, and we discover in these documents that the department is then instructed to go ahead with the project, having had to suspend it when it gets caught out.


We now know that the Department of Defence is instructed in such a way as to suggest that it is entirely responsive to the political demands of the ministry, not the national interests of the country. That's why I'm so concerned about the process by which we are going through these discussions at the moment. If the government wants to claim national interest immunity in terms of the provision of documents, it's got to be consistent in its approach. It simply can't rely on these weasel words, suggesting it can't provide information on the basis of a range of priorities or suggesting it is commercial-in-confidence or involves national security, when the real issue here is nothing more than the political priorities of the government, as dictated by the electoral cycle.


The evasiveness about the dates on which the government operated has now been exposed. The release of the documents has shown clearly the events that have unfolded with regard to the department's request for the ASC on the consolidation of the submarine sustainment program. The department's Capability and Acquisition Sustainment Group emailed the ASC and made very clear the way in which it was to operate. The consequences of this in terms of the precedent that's been set for the Future Frigate Program are deeply disturbing, particularly when that decision is due within a month. If this is the way we are to conduct the procurement for $50 billion, one has to question what the approach will be for the frigates program. What I'd like to know is whether or not this is going to in fact be the practice. That's why the shipbuilding inquiry, which will be examining this issue and will have a future hearing within another month, will have an opportunity to examine these questions.


The approach that's been taken with regard to some of our major contractors—the very partisan approach that's been taken in regard to the tendering arrangements—should be subject to very close examination. The approach that's been taken by Austal in Western Australia suggests to me that a distinct bias has been taken against Australian shipbuilding. I trust that my suspicions are incorrect. But the operations of the Offshore Patrol Vessel contract and the manner in which the discussions have taken place with the preferred tenderer from Germany—and at this point, as I understand it, the ASC has actually been obliged to go to Germany to discuss those tendering arrangements; they're in Germany right now—demonstrates just how, in the government's mind, it should operate. If the frigates contract is to be treated in the same way, then I suggest that we have a serious problem.


A genuine national industry plan should be concentrating on the capacity of this country to build its capabilities from the basis of a design through to building and to maintenance. We're not seeing that. We're not seeing a genuine plan B developed to marshal and harmonise all our nation's resources, and we're not seeing that in so many areas of government policy. Just recently in the budget a similar pattern was announced with regard to the space industry, for instance. I can say this in so many areas of science, where the government is simply aiming at wining short-term political advantage rather than thinking about the long-term interests of the country.


The shipyard workers at Osborne and at Henderson are entitled to be treated so much better than they are being treated, and they deserve to be treated better. They're entitled not to be treated as pawns in a rather tawdry political game. I think that the people of this country, who are paying the bills for this procurement, are entitled to be taken into the government's confidence about the way these plans have been developed. That would require a change in direction—a fundamental change in attitude by a government who would actually be committed to developing a genuinely long-term, strategic shipbuilding plan. It would require an entirely different course. From what I've seen from these documents and from questioning so many of the witnesses through the various committee processes of this Senate, this is a government that's failed those tests—and, frankly, it's failed the people of this country: $90 billion is a lot of money in anyone's language, and if we are to truly develop a national shipbuilding capacity in this country we really do have to work a lot harder at this than we have through this experience.


For the minister to come in here and say, 'Look, I'm not going to talk to you about this, because it's a matter of national security,' is simply not going to cut it. Senator Patrick, I think securing these documents has done a real service to this parliament and to this country. We have supported the securing of these documents because it's the proper role of the Senate in its scrutiny of government programs. We won't act recklessly and we won't be in the business of undermining the capability of this country to procure these vessels properly, but we will be in the business of proper public accountability.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-05-10,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:44):  I thank Senator Payne for her statement today and for the documents she may have tabled. The nation is particularly fortunate to have a Minister for Defence with the style, capability and energy of Senator Payne. We are doubly fortunate in that we have Mr Pyne as Minister for Defence Industry. I can understand the concern of the Labor Party in nit-picking any little hole all the way, because during the six-year term of the Labor government they did absolutely nothing with defence procurement. There wasn't a ship build in sight under Labor. I can understand why Senator Carr wants to divert attention away from this government's great success in building, designing and launching military hardware within our country.


Senator Patrick indicates that he was an adviser to Senator Xenophon. He was also an adviser to a Liberal minister for defence, and I sometimes wonder about the source of some of Senator Patrick's knowledge. Senator Patrick made a long speech full of accusations and assumptions, not of fact. There was not one fact in them, just accusations and assumptions, mainly against public servants who aren't here and aren't capable of answering for themselves. It's typical that, when these facts are pointed out, both Senator Patrick and Senator Carr, who each had 20 minutes of accusations and assumptions—no facts—about a government that does something in the military construction area, they walk out of the debate.


Those who might be listening to this on radio should understand that what you've just heard in the last 40 minutes from Senator Patrick and Senator Carr is purely crass politics and has nothing to do with integrity or our military support. I won't go into the actual details; I hope and think that my colleague, Senator Fawcett, who is an expert in this area and a South Australian, will deal with some of the fallacies he may have heard in the previous two speeches. I just want to say how very fortunate Australia is to have defence ministers—two of them—and a government prepared to do something about construction of defence hardware. Labor continues to argue about and criticise the construction of ships. I again mention that Labor, in the six years it was in power in this country, did absolutely nothing about getting some ships built in Australia.


Ninety billion dollars has been allocated by this government for military hardware, most of which will be constructed within Australia. It will be done principally for our defence forces to ensure we can properly defend Australia, but it's important that most of that work will be done within Australia by Australian workers. You know where Senator Carr is coming from when, shortly into his speech, he starts telling you what the unions had told him to say about this. It's the old Labor approach, because they are entirely controlled by the union movement. When the unions ask Senator Carr to jump, he always says, 'How high?' He wasn't speaking in the interests of Australia or the integrity of the Senate, as he pretended he was; he was talking about the interests of the union movement in Australia, to which Senator Carr and most of his colleagues over there are entirely beholden.


I again thank Senator Payne and Mr Pyne for what they have done. I cannot understand why people like Senator Carr and Senator Patrick spend all of their time here criticising work that every other Australian says is just wonderful. We have this work in Australia. It's the first time for a long time. More than that—digressing slightly from shipbuilding—I'm from Queensland, and Senator Payne, in answering a question in the Senate yesterday, pointed out that 80 per cent of the work being done in the Central Queensland area, at Shoalwater Bay, for Australia's military training field is being done by local Central Queensland contractors.


That has been the whole direction of this government. Yes, we need these things done for the defence of our country and to make sure our military is properly equipped but, at the same time, we are doing it in a way that creates wealth and jobs for Australians. I can only congratulate the government, and I simply cannot understand the Senator Patricks and the Senator Carrs of this world who continually try to take down the wonderful work that is being done by this government—work which the Labor Party was never prepared to do.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2018-05-10,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (15:50):  I would like to rise on behalf of the Greens to also comment on this debate today and I'd also like to recognise, Senator Patrick, the importance of getting scrutiny. We just heard from Senator Macdonald about a $90 billion outlay on defence hardware. That is an incredible amount of money—$90 billion. Two years ago in budget week we heard that this government was ramping up defence spending to two per cent of GDP—the biggest increase since the Second World War—on the back of a white paper that said that there were no evident threats in our region. We've also heard in the last 12 months that this government is embarking on an arms export plan to put Australia in the top 10 exporters of defence military hardware in the world, including selling weapons to countries like Saudi Arabia.


Why is this occurring? I have my own theory. In fact, what I was going to say to Senator Patrick a little bit earlier was that I was in the same situation that he was in today—twice—three to four years ago, when the government refused, when ordered by the Senate under an order for the production of documents, to release information on the negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. Twice the Senate voted for the government to release those documents and twice the minister came in here and refused to release information. I sat down and I chatted with the Clerk of the Senate at the time, Rosemary Laing, and I said, 'What do you do?' She took out Odgersand she showed me. Hopefully I'm not oversimplifying it, but she basically said: 'The Senate needs to vote against all legislation in this area. You need to put up a fight. That's the only thing you can do. You can't demand a government release these documents, but the Senate, as a body, can continually make their life difficult until they come and play ball.' That's what I chose to do over the next four years over free trade deals that were done behind closed doors and taken outside of the scope of parliament.


The reason I raise these free trade deals is not just around the order for the production of documents; my theory is that the reason that we have this $90 billion industry policy—and that's just the start of it; our estimate is that this is going to be hundreds of billions of dollars—is largely to do with all these free trade deals we've signed in the last five or six years, which preclude us and governments directly subsidising industries like the car industry, which was ultimately killed by free trade deals, or other industries, because it is not allowed under state-to-state or investor state in all these deals we have been signing. The only thing that is excluded and carved out, funnily enough, is defence and national security industries. That's why this government, in the last four years, has gone down the road of making this an industry policy, not just a defence policy. I have no doubt about that.


I had a discussion with Senator Payne at last estimates about the jobs that the new arms export industry plan was going to create, because the Liberal Party said in its media release that this was a 'jobs plan'. They were their own words. I asked: 'How many jobs is this plan going to create?' And they couldn't name a single bit of work that had been done to try to forecast that or estimate that. Do you know what Senator Payne did?


Senator Payne came very close to doing this to Senator Patrick today, but she fell short. She played the patriot card—How dare you ask questions! Aren't you patriotic? Don't you support our armed forces? Don't you support our Defence personnel?—because I dared scrutinise a plan with $3.8 billion being given to companies to create weapons to sell overseas.


What we're seeing here today is on an even bigger and more disturbing scale, and I think it's just the beginning of it. So transparency is absolutely critical. It is the job of the Senate. The reason we're here is to scrutinise. If the government come in here with the attitude that Senator Payne shows—that somehow this is below contempt for them—then this is going to continue. I'm actually glad that it's taken something like this for this chamber to scrutinise an aspect of defence spending.


I will say, just to finish, that it's good to see scrutiny on how much content is going to be Australian made. That's a very noble and important cause and something the Greens no doubt will support. But I'd also like to see a lot more scrutiny on the decisions about whether we even need this kind of hardware in the first place—for example, 12 submarines or Joint Strike Fighters. I'd like to see a lot more scrutiny in this place around the actual decisions that lead to the procurement of these kinds of hardware programs.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2018-05-10,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (15:56):  I rise to make a contribution on this matter. It's always a pleasure to follow Senator Macdonald. It usually means that you don't need any speaking notes because he raises so many points that are so easy to rebut. I'm sure the Hon. Marise Payne is basking in the warm glow of his adulation and appreciation. I am absolutely certain of that. But, just to take one point of issue, we are this day going to table in this parliament a report on the economic effect that defence training exercises have around the country. The fact that Shoalwater Bay is now able to demonstrate 80 per cent local content is a really good thing, but at the start of that inquiry—and we produced four interim reports—Defence wasn't able to demonstrate that. Trust me: you can see that from the evidence. Victory always has 1,000 fathers, and no doubt Senator Macdonald is claiming that as a victory for himself personally and the minister.


I accept the minister has moved very quickly in that area to put in place around those exercises really good practice that is beneficial to regional economies. But Senator Macdonald's statements alleging that Senator Carr is simply jumping at the request of unions could not be further from the truth. I don't really get where he's coming from. If representing the best interests of skilled, hardworking, willing workers in an immensely important Defence sector is a sin then I'm sure everybody on this side of the chamber, and probably a few on the other side of the chamber, are going to plead guilty—but it's not a sin. When I go to Senate estimates and carry out my duty, which is to go to the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee hearing, look at the Hon. Mathias Cormann and read a script which says, 'We have so many people employed, so many apprentices employed and so many contractors employed; can you please update the register?' he immediately says: 'It is all your fault. When you were in government, you did nothing.' I have to remind the other side that that's two parliaments ago. A couple of parliaments have been created since that day. Blaming it all on the Labor Party five or six years later really doesn't cut it.


We have the Hon. Christopher Pyne declaring that the 'valley of death' is over and that the decision that he has made will avert people being turned off through lack of work and having to seek employment in other states or overseas. We know through the estimates process and the briefings we get that these workers are immensely valuable and skilful and they probably won't have a great deal of difficulty translating those skills into other sectors—but at what cost to this project? What is the cost to this project if that workforce—currently 223 jobs—is being shed, despite the protestations that the valley of death has been averted? That claim, extraordinarily enough, came during the preamble to the South Australian election: 'The valley of death is over. We've fixed it all. It's all good. We're getting on with the job.' Shortly thereafter, ASC announced it had to shed 223 jobs.


We know that the Minister for Finance is a shareholder of ASC, and we know that the Minister for Finance is very keen to sheet all the blame home to other people and to governments twice removed. But really the responsibility does go to this government, to these ministers, to properly and appropriately plan the spend of $87 billion and to properly and prudently put in place the right parameters, the right disclosure and the right decisions for the country. And it shouldn't be based on a marginal seat campaign. The South Australian redistribution is over, and plenty of people in South Australia recommended that the Honourable Christopher Pyne's seat of Sturt be abolished. But the Electoral Commission didn't take that advice. They abolished the seat of Port Adelaide, much to the amusement of some. So the member for Sturt's seat is now safe. The seat of Sturt is safe, but it should never have been in the consideration.


It's very shallow of Senator Macdonald to cast aspersions that representing working class skilled South Australians and others in this sector is a bad thing to do. What is shallow and what is not worthy of proper ministerial diligence is making decisions designed to protect someone's seat—federal, state or other. Defence and Defence's capability is too important to be put at risk for those shallow political considerations. So, Senator Macdonald, you're completely wrong. But we'll willingly wear the tag every day, forever, of standing up for hardworking skilled workers in whatever sector. If this is a stop-gap, or a sop to skilled workers in South Australia for the damage caused by the closing of the automotive industry, then get on with it. Let's program it properly. Let's avoid the loss of jobs. These workers will probably get jobs elsewhere because they're skilled and hardworking. If we can avoid the loss of skills to the sector, that's a direct benefit to defence capability, a direct benefit to the nation and a prudent and efficient way of doing business. In my view, that is where we should be going.


Question agreed to.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2018-05-10,"



Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales—Minister for Defence) (15:08):  I rise to make a statement to the Senate in relation to an order for production of documents. It frankly remains a mystery to all Australians who are interested in ensuring that Australia has a continuous naval shipbuilding program and the industry to support that why alone amongst the vast majority of Australians Senator Patrick seems unable to support that himself. It's a mystery to me and it's a mystery to his South Australian constituents. Nevertheless, we will provide some response this afternoon to his most recent motions.


It is typical histrionics from Senator Patrick to claim that the government has shown a profound lack of respect in its response to the Senate, to the President, by the letter of Minister Cormann of 12 February. In fact, if you know anything about tendering, if you know anything about significant contracts and if you know anything about national security then you would be of the view that it is perfectly reasonable, it is appropriate and it is proper that the government properly consider the circumstances under which information is publicly released where the release may have an impact on international relations and where it may unfairly prejudice the commercial interests of an entity or, indeed, of the Commonwealth. This government, perhaps unlike Senator Patrick, takes those responsibilities seriously. Further, unlike Senator Patrick's approach, this government will always act responsibly on such matters, especially when it relates to a program of such importance to our national security and to international relations.


In accordance with Senator Cormann's letter to the President when he was representing me in this place on 12 February, I will be writing to the President further on this matter.

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (15:10):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the statement.


At the outset I want to recap the sequence of events that managed to get us to this point. A year ago almost to the day, on 9 May 2017, then Senator Xenophon made an FOI application to the Department of Defence relating to Australian industry involvement in the $50 billion Future Submarine program, a nationally significant, highly important program. Senator Xenophon noted that an ANAO report into the Future Submarine CEP process had stated:


As part of its response to the competitive evaluation, the participants were required to provide an Australian Industry Plan identifying opportunities for Australian industry, and how Australian industry involvement could be maximised during the lifecycle of the program.


Senator Xenophon was interested in just what Australian industry involvement would be in this tremendously important national project and accordingly made an FOI application to the defence department for the final submarine Australian industry plan submitted to Defence by the submarine builder DCNS, now Naval Group. He simply wanted to know what they had promised to do in respect of Australian industry.


Defence was really quick to respond. Just two weeks later on 23 May 2017, a decision was made denying access to the document because, the department said, it did not exist. At that time I was an adviser to Senator Xenophon and on his behalf sought an internal review of that decision. After all, the Auditor-General had referenced it, so I was pretty sure that it did exist. On 26 June, a senior officer in the defence department made an internal review decision. Having found the document did actually exist, the department refused access to it in its entirety, claiming the documents to be exempt under sections 47C and 47G of the FOI Act. They claimed that the document contained information that was deliberative in nature and also contained confidential business information and commercial or financial information that, had it been released, would have disadvantaged or prejudiced business operation and may even have caused Defence difficulty in seeking such information in the future.


At the time, Defence made no claim—no claim at all—under section 33 of the FOI Act that the document was exempt from disclosure because it contained information that, if released, would damage the defence security or international relationships with the Commonwealth. No such claim was made. Former Senator Xenophon referred Defence's internal review decision to the Information Commissioner for independent review. That review is ongoing and is now being handled by me and my office on behalf of Mr Xenophon.


To move to this year: in the Senate on 12 February, I moved a motion for an order for the production of documents—specifically for the Minister representing the Minister for Defence Industry to present to the Senate the Australian industry capability plan submitted by DCNS to the defence department in its response to the Future Submarine competitive evaluation process. You might recall that at that time the defence industry minister had gone from 90 per cent to 60 per cent Australian industry content, and now we have just received a Future Frigate document that went to 50 per cent Australian industry content. In speaking to that motion, I made the following comments, which are worth repeating today:


This document is an important document which outlines the promise of DCNS, now Naval Group, to Australian industry as to what involvement it will have in the Future Submarine project. It is an important document that former Senator Xenophon requested under FOI in April 2017. What this means is that the Information Commissioner is about to make a decision about it. So I respectfully suggest to the minister that she needs to respond to the OPD in a very considered manner. I don't want to see the minister ordered to make another explanation as to why she got her OPD response wrong, because I can assure you I will not hesitate to protect the integrity of the Senate oversight processes in circumstances where the minister makes another bogus claim.


Senators will recall the Minister for Defence had previously claimed documents relating to the Future Frigate Program could not be released to the Senate, not only on grounds of national security and defence but also for international relations reasons, only to have those documents released through an FOI review undertaken by the Information Commissioner. So we can't have them, but Mr Xenophon, in those circumstances, could.


On 12 February, Senator McGrath affirmed to the Senate that the government would not release the DCNS Australian industry capability plan; indeed, it would continue to withhold the document in its entirety. Senator McGrath claimed the entire document contained intellectual property regarding the design and build of submarines and the methods for technology transfer. The subject matter of the document itself—Australian industry participation—made Senator McGrath's claims about intellectual property and technology transfer as the basis for withholding the entire document rather implausible. Most significantly, Senator McGrath added—almost as an afterthought but clearly as a justification for a complete refusal to disclose—that 'disclosure could be expected to damage Australia's international relations with France.'


This was the first time, on 12 February this year, that the government claimed that the release of the document would damage Australia's international relations. That claim had not been made by Defence in Defence's original internal review decision seven months earlier. It's not been made by Defence in the review process taking place with the Information Commissioner. One might have reasonably thought that, if the claim had merit, Defence would have already argued it, but they'd not raised it at all. 


On 12 February 2018, the Senate agreed to the OPD motion. On 15 February this year, the duty minister tabled in the Senate a letter claiming public interest immunity and stating that the release of the documents would affect the commercial interests of Naval Group and adversely affect Australia's international relations. That letter further advised the Senate that the government was awaiting the outcome of the Information Commissioner's review into FOI exemption claimed over the documents. On 27 March this year, I moved a further motion that noted a previous Senate resolution and declared:


… declining to provide documents or answer questions on the basis that an FOI request has been made for the same information is an unacceptable response, is not supported by the FOI Act and shows a profound lack of respect for the Senate and its committees. 


They're not my words; they come from Odgers. 


The motion further observed:


(f) … claim of commercial confidentiality must be carefully advanced and claimed narrowly so as to recognise the public interest that lies in openness and transparency on this very important project. 


The motion further made the point:


(g) the claim that the release of the documents will affect international relations is not properly made out and is flawed (and has not even been advanced by the Department of Defence as a concern in the Information Commissioner Review) because the document which is the subject of the order is a document of a French-law Public Limited Company, not a document of the French state;


The motion further called on the Minister for Defence to make a statement to the Senate—which she's done today—addressing why she:


(a) has advanced a claim showing a profound lack of respect for the Senate; 


(b) offered a broad confidentiality claim that does not correctly balance the public interest in knowing what DCNS promised, in respect of Australian industry involvement in our largest ever Defence project; and 


(c) has advanced a claim that releasing the document to the Senate would affect Australia's international relations knowing that this claim is inconsistent with the position of her own Department.


The motion was agreed to on 27 March.


Eight days after that motion there was a further interesting development in this story. On 4 April 2018, Defence made a new submission to the Information Commissioner's review and belatedly introduced a claim for the documents to be wholly exempt under section 33 of the FOI Act—namely, that the release of the documents would damage Australia's international relations. As I've said, in the course of nearly a year, Defence had not previously made that claim. That fact begs the question as to what, if anything, has happened to change the department's position.


Defence now claims that the release of the documents could reasonably be expected to cause damage to Australia's relationship with foreign governments; that it would damage international confidence in Australia and Australia's relationship with other countries; that it would adversely affect the ability of the Australian government to maintain good working relationships with other governments and international organisations; that it would cause a loss of trust and confidence in the Australian government; and that foreign officials may be less willing to engage with Australian businesses in future. None of those claims had been made previously; they were all freshly minted. Yet the department failed to detail any evidence to support its claim in relation to the release of the documents, which is, it should be recalled, information provided to the Commonwealth by a commercial entity engaged in a commercial tender process.


Defence's section 33 claim had been made late in the day. It is heavy on assertion and very light on evidence or argument. It looks much like something that's been cobbled together to bring the department's position in line with the assertion made by the minister in this place. Given the context of deliberations in the Senate on this matter since 12 February, it's not unreasonable to conclude that Defence's claim of a section 33 exemption may not be based on a careful evaluation of the relevant facts; rather, it may well be made in response to a direction or other interference from a minister's office or else was made by the department simply in order to bring the department's position in line with the claim made by the government in the Senate.


However, efforts to avoid political embarrassment for ministers are not appropriate drivers for departmental FOI decision-making. Defence's decision-making in this matter may well have been politically compromised. Accordingly, I have made a formal complaint to the Information Commissioner under section 70 of the FOI Act in relation to the defence department's decision-making in this matter. I have specifically requested the Information Commissioner to make inquiries and investigate Defence's decision-making in respect of its new section 33 exemption claim. It would be appropriate—indeed, I believe it is essential—for the information in pursuing such an inquiry to require under section 79 of the FOI Act the production of relevant documents and records, including communications between the department and ministers' offices and between the ministers' offices themselves in order to determine when, how and on what basis the purported new international relations exemption claims were made. Such an inquiry is essential to determine whether the integrity of Defence's decision-making has been compromised and whether Defence's claims are based on careful and objective reasoning and not on the desire to accommodate the political interests of the minister.


But that's not the end of the story. Curiously, on 30 April, I was advised by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner that Defence had advised that 'they intend to release at least part of the document and will do so tomorrow'—11 May. So perhaps some of those claims of exemption were not very robust at all and could not have been applied to the document in its entirety. But how convenient the timing is! Defence is waiting until tomorrow, after the Senate has risen this week, before it provides me with the new documents.


This is not the first occasion that the defence minister has, on dubious grounds, invoked 'damage to national security or international relations' to justify withholding information from the Senate. However, national security is not a political light bulb that can be switched on and off at the whim of ministers to resist releasing what they may consider to be embarrassing information.


Today the minister stated that there were very serious reasons for not providing this information to the Senate. Yet I have a document from the Information Commissioner today saying that Defence is quite prepared to release some of that information to Mr Xenophon. They won't release it to the Senate—the Senate won't get anything, it appears—but Mr Xenophon can get his information. In response, I can only return to the remarks I made on 12 February, when I respectfully suggested the minister needed to respond to the OPD in a very considered manner and that it would be regrettable if the minister had to make another explanation as to why she got her OPD response wrong. Regrettably, she did not do so. Instead the government have adopted an obstructive and negative approach to the release of information. They have done so in complete disregard of public interest.


The extent of Australian industry participation in the new submarine project, a project of tremendous national security and economic importance, is clearly something that should be subject to well-informed debate not only in the Senate but also in the public domain more broadly. A year has passed since former Senator Xenophon made his original application. Yet here we are today, with the government still fighting tooth and nail to keep these things locked away. They must do better than this, and the Senate must hold them to account.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2018-05-10,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (15:25):  The information that is being sought through this return to order unfortunately follows a record of deception and dissimilation, which Senator Patrick has outlined this afternoon, as a result of this government seeking to withhold legitimate information from the Senate. I have participated in the various committees of the Senate for quite some time. I have participated in the Senate inquiry into naval shipbuilding in this parliament, and I have seen the wide and reckless claims that the government have made in regard to executive privilege, the future frigate programs and the submarine programs. The claims they have made in regard to the withholding of information based on spurious protections of international relations or national security are confounded by the fact that these documents have so often been released subsequently. This is the really serious flaw in the government's argument. If the Information Commissioner is able to release the documents having had ministers of this government stand in this chamber and deny the legitimacy of the requests that are being made by senators in this chamber, it strikes me that it really does highlight the level of deception that this government has engaged in.


In my opinion, these are not questions that go to national security. As the alternative government, it is not the opposition's view that we would be engaged in questions that would fundamentally challenge the national security of the Commonwealth of Australia. As the alternative government, we have a responsibility to ensure that we don't use the powers of the Senate in a reckless manner. What we do have, though, is the responsibility to hold the government to account and to ensure that the actions of the government are scrutinised properly.


The fundamental premise on which the government's actions have been based has not been matters of national security but matters that go to the political interests of the government. The record of the government's Naval Shipbuilding Plan is much touted: a $90 billion investment and the development of a sovereign capability in our country, particularly the $50 billion Future Frigate Program, is essentially about a fundamental issue of the future direction of this country. It is only appropriate that we as senators take this matter at the most serious level. If we ignore the rhetoric and focus on what the government actually does in regards to the shipbuilding plan, I think we're entitled to go to the heart of what this issue really does come down to.


What has concerned me and my examination of these issues over the life of this government is that the Naval Shipbuilding Plan is increasingly resembling not a national industry plan for the development of a national capability in shipbuilding but a national marginal seats plan for this government. This is a government that makes assurances about shipbuilding jobs, for instance, which are simply not being fulfilled. Recently we have had the situation with Osborne, a shipyard in South Australia, where the ASC is still shedding jobs. Just last month, it announced 223 jobs would go. This is despite the fact that last December, last November—on numerous occasions in that period—and last October as well, the Minister for Defence Industry told the media:


The valley of death is over and we are now seeing a upturn of employment in naval shipbuilding in our state that will only continue to increase as these new projects gain momentum.


Yet he had previously told representatives of the metalworkers union and the Secretary of the ACTU that the ASC was transitioning and that he was doing all that was necessary to ensure that that was coming about. On 6 December Mr Glenn Thompson, the National Assistant Secretary of the AMWU, saw Mr Pyne in his office and was told that there would be no further job losses at the ASC.


On 11 December, Mr Pyne issued a media release where he said:


We are stabilising the shipbuilding workforce … things are truly on the up at Osborne.


However, on 22 April this year, the shipbuilding workers at Osborne found out what 'stabilising' actually meant under this government. It meant a further 223 of them were to go. We've got a long litany of broken promises. The minister's evasions and deceptions on this issue, I think, are totally without peer when it comes to what is a pretty sorry record of naval procurement.


The minister, in April 2016, announced that the company known as Naval Group was selected to design the Future Submarines. The Prime Minister talked to journalists at that time, with regard to the issue of sustainment of the submarines. This is the point of the documents that Senator Patrick has been able to secure through this process of discovery. The Prime Minister has been quoted many times in the media now about the delivery of the work. He said:


It will be shared between the two but the heavier work, if you like, was obviously always going to be done here at Osborne, as it is now.


Of course, what the Prime Minister was doing on that occasion was playing to a South Australian audience. What we know from the documents that Senator Patrick has brought before us is that a very different message was being given to the Department of Defence. Less than two months after that statement by the Prime Minister, on 3 June, the department asked the ASC, which carried out the work on the Collins class submarine at Osborne, to estimate the cost and time required to consolidate all the shipbuilding work in Western Australia—that was to actually shift the sustainment work to Western Australia. So the Prime Minister is telling the people of South Australia the work will be done in South Australia, while the department's asking the ASC what it costs and what it involves to move the work to Western Australia. Of course, that's being done in secret. The statement from the department issued to the ASC notes that the Collins class boats would still be in service at a time when the substantial construction work on the submarines and surface ships was underway at Osborne. He said:


This combination of activities may exceed the available industry capacity in SA, which may motivate consideration of a consolidation of Collins maintenance activities in WA, in order that SA industry might concentrate on ship and submarine construction.


Advice regarding scope, cost, schedule and risk of consolidating submarine maintenance in WA will help inform future considerations—


of the project. And the ASC, of course, was given until February 2017 to come up with an answer. The level of sheer dishonesty that's been perpetrated in this matter is clear for all to see.


What we know now, of course, is that there was something very pressing in the Prime Minister's mind when these matters were being developed. In the last week of May 2016 he announced that a federal election would be held on 2 July. That was an election in which the government was very worried about the job losses in South Australia. That was an election in which the government was very anxious about the consequences of its decision to destroy the motor vehicle manufacturing industry in this country. It wouldn't have been a good time to admit the truth about the government's intention to undermine the ASC and switch the sustainment work out of Adelaide and send it across to Western Australia. It wouldn't have been a good time to be honest with the workers at the ASC, who were employed in the sustainment of the Collins class boats, including the full-cycle docking at Osborne. So the Prime Minister used evasive words. He talked about sharing of the work between Osborne and Henderson. He said:


… the heavier work … was … always going to be done … at Osborne … 


We now know that the government was acting in a thoroughly dishonest and deceptive manner. If the government were serious about investing in the industry, if it were serious about developing the national capabilities in terms of naval shipbuilding, if it were serious about these questions of national interest, it would have actually argued its case publicly. It certainly wouldn't have engaged in this rhetorical sleight of hand. If it believed that it was actually in the national interest to develop the capacity at Henderson, you would have thought it would have said so. If it were serious about arguing the case for a long-term strategic industry, you would have thought it would have said so as well, rather than taking the slippery, evasive approach which has been highlighted throughout this whole process and which these documents reveal time and time again. What does the government do? It wraps itself in the flag and tries to pretend that it is engaged in something other than sheer political hypocrisy, when it is developing a national capacity to defend its own marginal seats rather than defend the national interests of this country.


The government talks a lot about short-term thinking. Well, it is a past master of short-term thinking—thinking about the next election, desperately trying to maintain its political survival. When you put on top of that a South Australian election, which is what we have had, and a minister in South Australia who really shouldn't be known as the Minister for Defence Industry but should be known as the Minister for Marginal Seats, we've got a situation where this government simply can't help itself. It just cannot help itself. A government that was directly responsible for the destruction of the automotive manufacturing industry in South Australia then had to turn around and try to dress that up by some arrangements with regard to naval shipbuilding, but it couldn't then quite work out how to balance out the interests in South Australia against its marginal seats interests in Perth.


What we've got is a government that tries to hide its political intentions, and these documents reveal the inner secrets of what's actually been going on inside the government. We now know that the government has made no attempt to explain how it will reconcile its conduct of the business between the department and the ASC with regard to submarine sustainment. Now, of course, we are past the 2016 election, past the South Australian election, and we discover in these documents that the department is then instructed to go ahead with the project, having had to suspend it when it gets caught out.


We now know that the Department of Defence is instructed in such a way as to suggest that it is entirely responsive to the political demands of the ministry, not the national interests of the country. That's why I'm so concerned about the process by which we are going through these discussions at the moment. If the government wants to claim national interest immunity in terms of the provision of documents, it's got to be consistent in its approach. It simply can't rely on these weasel words, suggesting it can't provide information on the basis of a range of priorities or suggesting it is commercial-in-confidence or involves national security, when the real issue here is nothing more than the political priorities of the government, as dictated by the electoral cycle.


The evasiveness about the dates on which the government operated has now been exposed. The release of the documents has shown clearly the events that have unfolded with regard to the department's request for the ASC on the consolidation of the submarine sustainment program. The department's Capability and Acquisition Sustainment Group emailed the ASC and made very clear the way in which it was to operate. The consequences of this in terms of the precedent that's been set for the Future Frigate Program are deeply disturbing, particularly when that decision is due within a month. If this is the way we are to conduct the procurement for $50 billion, one has to question what the approach will be for the frigates program. What I'd like to know is whether or not this is going to in fact be the practice. That's why the shipbuilding inquiry, which will be examining this issue and will have a future hearing within another month, will have an opportunity to examine these questions.


The approach that's been taken with regard to some of our major contractors—the very partisan approach that's been taken in regard to the tendering arrangements—should be subject to very close examination. The approach that's been taken by Austal in Western Australia suggests to me that a distinct bias has been taken against Australian shipbuilding. I trust that my suspicions are incorrect. But the operations of the Offshore Patrol Vessel contract and the manner in which the discussions have taken place with the preferred tenderer from Germany—and at this point, as I understand it, the ASC has actually been obliged to go to Germany to discuss those tendering arrangements; they're in Germany right now—demonstrates just how, in the government's mind, it should operate. If the frigates contract is to be treated in the same way, then I suggest that we have a serious problem.


A genuine national industry plan should be concentrating on the capacity of this country to build its capabilities from the basis of a design through to building and to maintenance. We're not seeing that. We're not seeing a genuine plan B developed to marshal and harmonise all our nation's resources, and we're not seeing that in so many areas of government policy. Just recently in the budget a similar pattern was announced with regard to the space industry, for instance. I can say this in so many areas of science, where the government is simply aiming at wining short-term political advantage rather than thinking about the long-term interests of the country.


The shipyard workers at Osborne and at Henderson are entitled to be treated so much better than they are being treated, and they deserve to be treated better. They're entitled not to be treated as pawns in a rather tawdry political game. I think that the people of this country, who are paying the bills for this procurement, are entitled to be taken into the government's confidence about the way these plans have been developed. That would require a change in direction—a fundamental change in attitude by a government who would actually be committed to developing a genuinely long-term, strategic shipbuilding plan. It would require an entirely different course. From what I've seen from these documents and from questioning so many of the witnesses through the various committee processes of this Senate, this is a government that's failed those tests—and, frankly, it's failed the people of this country: $90 billion is a lot of money in anyone's language, and if we are to truly develop a national shipbuilding capacity in this country we really do have to work a lot harder at this than we have through this experience.


For the minister to come in here and say, 'Look, I'm not going to talk to you about this, because it's a matter of national security,' is simply not going to cut it. Senator Patrick, I think securing these documents has done a real service to this parliament and to this country. We have supported the securing of these documents because it's the proper role of the Senate in its scrutiny of government programs. We won't act recklessly and we won't be in the business of undermining the capability of this country to procure these vessels properly, but we will be in the business of proper public accountability.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-05-10,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:44):  I thank Senator Payne for her statement today and for the documents she may have tabled. The nation is particularly fortunate to have a Minister for Defence with the style, capability and energy of Senator Payne. We are doubly fortunate in that we have Mr Pyne as Minister for Defence Industry. I can understand the concern of the Labor Party in nit-picking any little hole all the way, because during the six-year term of the Labor government they did absolutely nothing with defence procurement. There wasn't a ship build in sight under Labor. I can understand why Senator Carr wants to divert attention away from this government's great success in building, designing and launching military hardware within our country.


Senator Patrick indicates that he was an adviser to Senator Xenophon. He was also an adviser to a Liberal minister for defence, and I sometimes wonder about the source of some of Senator Patrick's knowledge. Senator Patrick made a long speech full of accusations and assumptions, not of fact. There was not one fact in them, just accusations and assumptions, mainly against public servants who aren't here and aren't capable of answering for themselves. It's typical that, when these facts are pointed out, both Senator Patrick and Senator Carr, who each had 20 minutes of accusations and assumptions—no facts—about a government that does something in the military construction area, they walk out of the debate.


Those who might be listening to this on radio should understand that what you've just heard in the last 40 minutes from Senator Patrick and Senator Carr is purely crass politics and has nothing to do with integrity or our military support. I won't go into the actual details; I hope and think that my colleague, Senator Fawcett, who is an expert in this area and a South Australian, will deal with some of the fallacies he may have heard in the previous two speeches. I just want to say how very fortunate Australia is to have defence ministers—two of them—and a government prepared to do something about construction of defence hardware. Labor continues to argue about and criticise the construction of ships. I again mention that Labor, in the six years it was in power in this country, did absolutely nothing about getting some ships built in Australia.


Ninety billion dollars has been allocated by this government for military hardware, most of which will be constructed within Australia. It will be done principally for our defence forces to ensure we can properly defend Australia, but it's important that most of that work will be done within Australia by Australian workers. You know where Senator Carr is coming from when, shortly into his speech, he starts telling you what the unions had told him to say about this. It's the old Labor approach, because they are entirely controlled by the union movement. When the unions ask Senator Carr to jump, he always says, 'How high?' He wasn't speaking in the interests of Australia or the integrity of the Senate, as he pretended he was; he was talking about the interests of the union movement in Australia, to which Senator Carr and most of his colleagues over there are entirely beholden.


I again thank Senator Payne and Mr Pyne for what they have done. I cannot understand why people like Senator Carr and Senator Patrick spend all of their time here criticising work that every other Australian says is just wonderful. We have this work in Australia. It's the first time for a long time. More than that—digressing slightly from shipbuilding—I'm from Queensland, and Senator Payne, in answering a question in the Senate yesterday, pointed out that 80 per cent of the work being done in the Central Queensland area, at Shoalwater Bay, for Australia's military training field is being done by local Central Queensland contractors.


That has been the whole direction of this government. Yes, we need these things done for the defence of our country and to make sure our military is properly equipped but, at the same time, we are doing it in a way that creates wealth and jobs for Australians. I can only congratulate the government, and I simply cannot understand the Senator Patricks and the Senator Carrs of this world who continually try to take down the wonderful work that is being done by this government—work which the Labor Party was never prepared to do.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2018-05-10,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (15:50):  I would like to rise on behalf of the Greens to also comment on this debate today and I'd also like to recognise, Senator Patrick, the importance of getting scrutiny. We just heard from Senator Macdonald about a $90 billion outlay on defence hardware. That is an incredible amount of money—$90 billion. Two years ago in budget week we heard that this government was ramping up defence spending to two per cent of GDP—the biggest increase since the Second World War—on the back of a white paper that said that there were no evident threats in our region. We've also heard in the last 12 months that this government is embarking on an arms export plan to put Australia in the top 10 exporters of defence military hardware in the world, including selling weapons to countries like Saudi Arabia.


Why is this occurring? I have my own theory. In fact, what I was going to say to Senator Patrick a little bit earlier was that I was in the same situation that he was in today—twice—three to four years ago, when the government refused, when ordered by the Senate under an order for the production of documents, to release information on the negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. Twice the Senate voted for the government to release those documents and twice the minister came in here and refused to release information. I sat down and I chatted with the Clerk of the Senate at the time, Rosemary Laing, and I said, 'What do you do?' She took out Odgersand she showed me. Hopefully I'm not oversimplifying it, but she basically said: 'The Senate needs to vote against all legislation in this area. You need to put up a fight. That's the only thing you can do. You can't demand a government release these documents, but the Senate, as a body, can continually make their life difficult until they come and play ball.' That's what I chose to do over the next four years over free trade deals that were done behind closed doors and taken outside of the scope of parliament.


The reason I raise these free trade deals is not just around the order for the production of documents; my theory is that the reason that we have this $90 billion industry policy—and that's just the start of it; our estimate is that this is going to be hundreds of billions of dollars—is largely to do with all these free trade deals we've signed in the last five or six years, which preclude us and governments directly subsidising industries like the car industry, which was ultimately killed by free trade deals, or other industries, because it is not allowed under state-to-state or investor state in all these deals we have been signing. The only thing that is excluded and carved out, funnily enough, is defence and national security industries. That's why this government, in the last four years, has gone down the road of making this an industry policy, not just a defence policy. I have no doubt about that.


I had a discussion with Senator Payne at last estimates about the jobs that the new arms export industry plan was going to create, because the Liberal Party said in its media release that this was a 'jobs plan'. They were their own words. I asked: 'How many jobs is this plan going to create?' And they couldn't name a single bit of work that had been done to try to forecast that or estimate that. Do you know what Senator Payne did?


Senator Payne came very close to doing this to Senator Patrick today, but she fell short. She played the patriot card—How dare you ask questions! Aren't you patriotic? Don't you support our armed forces? Don't you support our Defence personnel?—because I dared scrutinise a plan with $3.8 billion being given to companies to create weapons to sell overseas.


What we're seeing here today is on an even bigger and more disturbing scale, and I think it's just the beginning of it. So transparency is absolutely critical. It is the job of the Senate. The reason we're here is to scrutinise. If the government come in here with the attitude that Senator Payne shows—that somehow this is below contempt for them—then this is going to continue. I'm actually glad that it's taken something like this for this chamber to scrutinise an aspect of defence spending.


I will say, just to finish, that it's good to see scrutiny on how much content is going to be Australian made. That's a very noble and important cause and something the Greens no doubt will support. But I'd also like to see a lot more scrutiny on the decisions about whether we even need this kind of hardware in the first place—for example, 12 submarines or Joint Strike Fighters. I'd like to see a lot more scrutiny in this place around the actual decisions that lead to the procurement of these kinds of hardware programs.

Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (15:56):  I rise to make a contribution on this matter. It's always a pleasure to follow Senator Macdonald. It usually means that you don't need any speaking notes because he raises so many points that are so easy to rebut. I'm sure the Hon. Marise Payne is basking in the warm glow of his adulation and appreciation. I am absolutely certain of that. But, just to take one point of issue, we are this day going to table in this parliament a report on the economic effect that defence training exercises have around the country. The fact that Shoalwater Bay is now able to demonstrate 80 per cent local content is a really good thing, but at the start of that inquiry—and we produced four interim reports—Defence wasn't able to demonstrate that. Trust me: you can see that from the evidence. Victory always has 1,000 fathers, and no doubt Senator Macdonald is claiming that as a victory for himself personally and the minister.


I accept the minister has moved very quickly in that area to put in place around those exercises really good practice that is beneficial to regional economies. But Senator Macdonald's statements alleging that Senator Carr is simply jumping at the request of unions could not be further from the truth. I don't really get where he's coming from. If representing the best interests of skilled, hardworking, willing workers in an immensely important Defence sector is a sin then I'm sure everybody on this side of the chamber, and probably a few on the other side of the chamber, are going to plead guilty—but it's not a sin. When I go to Senate estimates and carry out my duty, which is to go to the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee hearing, look at the Hon. Mathias Cormann and read a script which says, 'We have so many people employed, so many apprentices employed and so many contractors employed; can you please update the register?' he immediately says: 'It is all your fault. When you were in government, you did nothing.' I have to remind the other side that that's two parliaments ago. A couple of parliaments have been created since that day. Blaming it all on the Labor Party five or six years later really doesn't cut it.


We have the Hon. Christopher Pyne declaring that the 'valley of death' is over and that the decision that he has made will avert people being turned off through lack of work and having to seek employment in other states or overseas. We know through the estimates process and the briefings we get that these workers are immensely valuable and skilful and they probably won't have a great deal of difficulty translating those skills into other sectors—but at what cost to this project? What is the cost to this project if that workforce—currently 223 jobs—is being shed, despite the protestations that the valley of death has been averted? That claim, extraordinarily enough, came during the preamble to the South Australian election: 'The valley of death is over. We've fixed it all. It's all good. We're getting on with the job.' Shortly thereafter, ASC announced it had to shed 223 jobs.


We know that the Minister for Finance is a shareholder of ASC, and we know that the Minister for Finance is very keen to sheet all the blame home to other people and to governments twice removed. But really the responsibility does go to this government, to these ministers, to properly and appropriately plan the spend of $87 billion and to properly and prudently put in place the right parameters, the right disclosure and the right decisions for the country. And it shouldn't be based on a marginal seat campaign. The South Australian redistribution is over, and plenty of people in South Australia recommended that the Honourable Christopher Pyne's seat of Sturt be abolished. But the Electoral Commission didn't take that advice. They abolished the seat of Port Adelaide, much to the amusement of some. So the member for Sturt's seat is now safe. The seat of Sturt is safe, but it should never have been in the consideration.


It's very shallow of Senator Macdonald to cast aspersions that representing working class skilled South Australians and others in this sector is a bad thing to do. What is shallow and what is not worthy of proper ministerial diligence is making decisions designed to protect someone's seat—federal, state or other. Defence and Defence's capability is too important to be put at risk for those shallow political considerations. So, Senator Macdonald, you're completely wrong. But we'll willingly wear the tag every day, forever, of standing up for hardworking skilled workers in whatever sector. If this is a stop-gap, or a sop to skilled workers in South Australia for the damage caused by the closing of the automotive industry, then get on with it. Let's program it properly. Let's avoid the loss of jobs. These workers will probably get jobs elsewhere because they're skilled and hardworking. If we can avoid the loss of skills to the sector, that's a direct benefit to defence capability, a direct benefit to the nation and a prudent and efficient way of doing business. In my view, that is where we should be going.

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2018-05-10,"



Senator MARSHALL
 (Victoria) (16:04):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) to questions without notice asked by Senators Wong and Marshall today relating to the 2018-19 budget.


One of the greatest cons ever perpetrated on the Australian public is the myth that the coalition government has some sort of economic credibility. I think if anyone was watching question time today or yesterday in the Senate or the House of Representatives, they would have seen evidence of that myth being completely demolished. Here we have a budget perpetrated on the Australian people which is a budget that is good for the Liberal Party. It is not a budget that has the interests of Australians or this country at its heart. It is a budget that is purely about re-electing the Turnbull government. And what is the best demonstration of that? It is the government's absolute lack of knowledge of the details of the tax cuts that are the centrepiece of their policy, that move into the never-never, that move into budgets not just this year but next year and the year after. They move not only into future budgets but into future parliaments. 


The cornerstone of this budget is Malcolm Turnbull saying to the Australian people, 'If you re-elect me not only at this forthcoming election but at the next election, here is all this money that's going to come like Christmas to everybody in the Australian community.' Again, it is one of these great cons. It demolishes the myth. It's one of the cons and myths that's carefully constructed and supported by the apparatchiks in the Liberal Party and those that support them, like the Business Council of Australia, which we heard today in question time is not only enthusiastically supporting this government but could do more and were actually asked to do more by Senator Cormann. It is those people who, in this budget, are going to receive $80 billion in tax cuts. It is the banks that are going to receive billions of dollars in tax cuts. If this were a budget that had anything to do with being properly constructed for the benefit of Australia and the Australian people, it wouldn't give $80 billion of tax cuts to companies that don't need it and to companies that have ripped off Australians every day of the week and at the same time cut $270 million from the TAFE system, leaving working people in this country vulnerable. But the $270 million cut in this budget is on top of previous budget cuts to this sector. 


We just heard a debate in this place, which went for an hour, about our submarine corporation and the ability of Australia to maintain a skilled workforce to give us the capacity to build high-level submarines and frigates in this country. And at the same time we are cutting the TAFE sector. This is an absolute disgrace. It is a construction for the benefit of the Liberal Party and the re-election of Malcolm Turnbull. As meagre as these tax cuts are for the lower income people, we support them, because those people need relief from this government. At the same time, we're seeing electricity prices skyrocket. In this budget we see pensioners losing the energy supplement, which will cost them $14 a fortnight. This is at the same time that the government is giving $80 billion worth of tax cuts to companies that don't need it and to companies that rip off those very same pensioners day after day. It is a budget that is purely constructed in the interests of the Liberal Party, and I say that that is not good enough. We can't put up with $17 billion of accumulated cuts to schools and $2.2 billion of cuts to universities. We cannot accept a budget that cuts $80 million to the ABC, one of the few places where we can get an unbiased news service. We really do have a situation now in this country where this government has simply discarded the interests of Australians and the interests of this nation for its own self-interest.


But tonight we will see an alternative. Tonight we will see what we will do in government if we are elected. What we're interested in doing is putting up a budget, a plan, that benefits our kids, that supports our older people, that helps our sick people, that doesn't discard people to permanent unemployment, with no benefits, to live on the poverty line.

"Molan, Sen Jim",LP,2018-05-10,"



Senator MOLAN
 (New South Wales) (16:09):  I rise very slowly today to speak to Senator Marshall's motion to take note of answers by Senator Cormann during question time. He mentioned economic management in relation to the budget, and he said that the budget that we have brought down is 'only good for the Liberal Party'. I had the pleasure this morning of hosting the Treasurer and the Prime Minister in the electorate of Eden-Monaro, where I live. They met with Australians with a real interest in this budget. They met 12 seniors from Queanbeyan in that federal electorate, the electorate of Eden-Monaro.


The reason why we went there was that this budget does work for a vast range of Australians. Let me give you some examples that relate particularly to the electorate of Eden-Monaro. There are more than 63,000 low- to middle-income earners across Eden-Monaro who will get tax relief as a result of this budget. There are 5,000 local families who are eligible for childcare provisions as a result of this budget. There are 16,000 local businesses throughout Eden-Monaro who have benefitted already from the legislated enterprise tax cuts; 1,000 of them have already accessed the $20,000 instant asset write-off facility. There is $23.7 billion being spent on infrastructure that will go to New South Wales, an increase of $9 billion over five years.


Let me talk for a minute about infrastructure, for the simple reason that the people of Eden-Monaro who met the Treasurer and the Prime Minister this morning were very, very interested in infrastructure. Over the next 10 years, because of this budget, we will invest over $75 billion in new and upgraded transport infrastructure projects across Australia through a 10-year infrastructure investment pipeline. We are building on our current investments to improve our road, freight, rail and urban public transport networks. In New South Wales, we're investing $17.2 billion through the Infrastructure Investment Program up to 2021-22, with $1.7 billion to be funded in 2018-19.


The coalition's vision to deliver infrastructure of critical importance can be seen right across New South Wales, which is of basic interest to those people in Eden-Monaro, with investment in projects from the Western Sydney Airport and infrastructure plan to Inland Rail and the duplication of the Pacific Highway. In my home electorate of Eden-Monaro the benefits of the Turnbull government's infrastructure investment for the community include an additional $100 million for the Barton Highway upgrade package and a $100 million investment in the Monaro Highway upgrade package. These investments will bust congestion for people travelling to Canberra from Queanbeyan, Murrumbateman, Yass and beyond. It will help to move freight more efficiently, better connect our regions, grow our economy and create new local jobs. Importantly, it will improve safety so that our neighbours and friends can get home sooner and safer.


This money, this $200 million, is real money and it's having a real effect, unlike the pie-in-the-sky promises of those in the Labor Party. The local member for Eden-Monaro, Mr Mike Kelly, described that $200 million for the Barton and Monaro highways as 'a con job'. That's sad and I think, unfortunately, it's a bit shifty. Ongoing activities are also occurring in Eden-Monaro: for example, the port of Eden, the Bega sewage treatment plant, regional development grants for Men's Sheds and RFS facilities, the Shoalhaven bridge and an ACT overpass, which is also of value to Eden-Monaro residents. The local member, Mr Mike Kelly, describes this budget as 'a great disappointment'. It would be a great disappointment to him because it's the truth. There are no cuts to education or health; each year both education and health budgets in Eden-Monaro increase, not decrease, and it's duplicitous to say otherwise. That is why the people who the Prime Minister and the Treasurer met this morning, who were locals, believe that this budget is a manifestation of the superior economic management of the coalition government.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2018-05-10,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (16:14):  Today in question time Senator Wong asked Senator Cormann, as she also did yesterday, to provide this parliament with the revised total cost of corporate tax cuts over the 10 years from 1 July. She asked the question today. She asked it yesterday. It was also asked in the other place of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. But the Prime Minister and the Treasurer and, again today, the Minister for Finance, have refused to answer this question. They have refused on some four occasions now. They have refused to answer whether or not the total cost of Prime Minister Turnbull's big corporate tax cuts over the next 10 years, from 1 July this year, is more or less than $100 billion.


Why won't they answer this question? Why are they so scared to tell the Australian people exactly how much of their tax is going to corporate Australia? Corporate Australia does not need this money. Australians know that very clearly, because by just turning on the TV they can see the profits of Westpac or the Commonwealth Bank. They see exactly how much profit corporate Australia is making. They know very well that it does not need a tax handout from this government. But this government refuses to tell the Australian people exactly how many billions of dollars it's going to cost.


The reason the government don't want anyone to know is that this budget takes money away from Australian taxpayers. It takes it away from schools—some $17 billion—and gives it to big corporations who make record profits and who do not need government handouts. This is a budget that takes taxpayer dollars out of our health system and out of our Medicare system and gives them to big banks—banks who report record profits and don't need a tax cut. How is that fair? It is not fair, and that is why they are hiding the largesse of these corporate tax cuts.


What we have in this budget is Australians who are going to miss out. They will miss out on great schools, on world-class hospitals and on a chance for a better education and TAFE system because of the fixated, antiquated, backward and trickle-down-economics view that this government has and its desire to use Australian taxpayers' money to look after the wealthy end of town—the corporate end of town. As we know, this is the corporate end of town that has shareholders, board members and investors that aren't even in Australia. So how on earth is this money going to provide any benefit to Australians? It is not.


Australians are being robbed by this government, robbed of their hard-earned money and the taxes that they pay. And they deserve better. They deserve the services that they expect the government to deliver. They deserve decent public hospitals. They deserve, in this country, a decent public education system where, no matter what your postcode, you end up getting a really good education. That is the country of the fair go that Australia stands by and that we all want to live by—but not those on the other side of this place; not the Turnbull government. The Turnbull government want to look after the banks, the corporate sector and the wealthy end of town, because they don't care about everyday average Australians; they don't care about Australians that are doing it hard to make ends meet. And they certainly don't care about older Australians. They don't care about pensioners. They don't care about those in our aged-care sector, who are crying out to this government, saying: 'Come on! What are you doing? Why are you robbing us of all those years of hard-earned money and the taxes that we paid, to give it now to the corporate end of town?'


This budget is an absolute disgrace when it comes to fairness. There is nothing that this government can say that is going to make Australians believe it is somehow sensible, decent or honourable, or that it has any integrity, if it gives $80 billion of taxpayers' money to corporate Australia—corporate Australia, who continue to record profits. Good on them for getting record profits, but they should stand up and say, 'We don't need Australian taxpayers' money to get there.'

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:19):  Well, it's a little bit off topic, but can I just start this afternoon by congratulating Dr Mahathir on his magnificent victory in Malaysia. Dr Mahathir will become the world's oldest leader, at the age of 92. I think he'll bring great wisdom and great experience to the role in Malaysia. Anyone who's interested in the politics of Malaysia—and perhaps the recent politics of Malaysia, without dwelling on it too much—can't but be impressed by the victory. I had the pleasure of being in Dr Mahathir's company in January 2017 at his home with his wife, and I was greatly honoured to hear his vision for Malaysia but importantly also his vision for the Asian region.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Senator Smith, the indulgence is probably now getting to an end.




Senator SMITH:
  And I know you're a generous man, so I will just make one last point, and that is that Dr Mahathir has given a pledge to uphold the rule of law and, importantly, to prosecute those that have breached it. I think that's an ominous sign for some who have engaged in less than decent practices across Malaysia, and indeed internationally, in recent times.


But that brings me to the topic du jour, and that is, of course, the federal budget. And I'm spoilt with choice—I don't know where to start! I don't know whether I should start with sharing with Liberals across Australia why this is a budget that they can be proud of—indeed, why it's a budget that fiscal conservatives can be proud of. I don't know whether or not I should start by talking about why the budget is a significant win for Western Australia. You're right, Senator Molan: while it's not a fix for the GST problem in Western Australia, it's a very, very good budget, a strong budget, that Western Australians can be very, very proud of. Perhaps I should just start by quoting back to Labor what it has said itself about the importance of company tax cuts.


You're right, Senator Molan; I think I'll start at the end. I think I will start by sharing with Senator Keneally, Senator Moore and Senator Urquhart what it is exactly that Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, himself has had to say about the importance of company tax cuts.



Senator Bartlett interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  I'm disappointed, Senator Bartlett, that I have only 2½ minutes to go, because I have three pages. So let me start from the top.


What did Bill Shorten say to the House of Representatives on 23 August 2011? Let me remind you:


Cutting the company income tax rate increases domestic productivity and domestic investment. More capital means higher productivity and economic growth and leads to more jobs and higher wages.


That's convincing for me. So what did Mr Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, say in a speech to the Australian Council of Social Services National Conference on 30 March in that same year, 2011? He said:


Reducing the corporate tax rate … sees more capital flowing into our domestic economy, which will then flow on to workers in the form of higher wages—thereby improving standards of living.


I know; I know. There is more. What did Bill Shorten say in an interview on Sky with Kieran Gilbert on 12 March 2012? He said: 'Friends, corporate tax reform helps Australia's private sector grow and it creates jobs right up and down the income ladder.' What did Bill Shorten say when he addressed the Institute of Chartered Accountants on 6 April 2011? He said:


The Government's tax reform agenda has a strong focus on ensuring that Australia remains an attractive place to invest.


…   …   …


Cutting the company tax rate is an important step along this road.


This recognises the benefits to investment and growth from lower company tax rates and a trend to lower rates across the OECD over the past 30 years.


Let's go to Julia Gillard. What did Julia Gillard say? We will cast our minds back a little bit further to show that cutting corporate tax rates is as much in the DNA of the Australian Labor Party as it is in the coalition's. Julia Gillard said in March 2012 to the House of Representatives:


If you are against cutting company tax, you are against economic growth. If you are against economic growth, then you are against jobs.


It is worth repeating: 'If you are against economic growth, then you are against jobs.' It's convincing, I know. (Time expired)

"Keneally, Sen Kristina",ALP,2018-05-10,"



Senator KENEALLY
 (New South Wales) (16:24):  I rise to participate in this debate, noting the questions asked by Senators Wong and Marshall during question time today. They are very relevant questions. As represented in the budget, how much will certain government policy initiatives cost the budget? We're talking about the corporate tax cut and we're talking about the personal income tax cuts that are cast off into the never-never, seven years and two elections from now. It's valid that the opposition ask these questions. It's valid that the Senate, through the crossbench and the other minor parties, ask these questions. We are being asked by the Minister for Finance and the Prime Minister to vote for these personal income tax cuts and to vote for this corporate tax cut, yet we cannot get an answer out of this government as to what providing these tax concessions to big business, the big end of town and some of the wealthiest people in our community will cost the budget.


Budgets are all about choices. They are about what you choose to invest in, how you choose to stimulate the economy and how you choose to provide wage growth to people who have not seen a wage increase in many years. It is valid that the Senate ask these questions. Today we got no answers. We received no answers from Minister Cormann on the cost of the corporate tax cut or the cost of those personal income tax cuts—phase 3, as the Treasurer called them in his budget speech.


I make note that Labor has already made clear it will support the government's income tax cuts that are slated to come in on 1 July. That is because we know working people have not participated in the profits and in the productivity gains that we've seen in this country. Their wages have flatlined. We believe it is appropriate that the government, through the tax system, provide them with some relief. When it comes to an $80 billion big business tax giveaway, we see the government giving $17 billion to the banks there. That figure of $17 billion is important because it also happens to be the amount of money that the government is taking away from schools. That is the choice the Turnbull government is making in this budget: $17 billion given to the banks in the form of a corporate tax cut and $17 billion taken away from our nation's children and our nation's schools.


We also heard in question time today that Minister Cormann does believe the Business Council of Australia is helpful to his cause and that they could do more. I'm sure he's delighted with the news that the Business Council of Australia is creating a $26 million fighting fund to campaign for the Turnbull government. No doubt they're grateful for the largesse that will flow to big business as a result of this corporate tax cut. No doubt the Liberal Party and the Prime Minister are happy about this fighting fund. It may well prevent Malcolm Turnbull from having to put his hand in his deep pocket for the $1.75 million to fund the next Liberal Party campaign.


I want to look briefly at this third tranche of the personal income tax cuts that will take two elections and seven years before we see them. What we do know from the Treasurer is that he's planning to flatten the tax rate. If you are earning between $40,000 and $200,000, he proposes that you pay the same rate of tax. Ask yourself: how is it fair that somebody who is on $40,000 will get a couple of hundred dollars back in a tax cut but someone on $200,000 will get $7,000 back on a tax cut? These are the numbers we know. The number we don't know is the cost of this tranche of the personal income tax cuts to the budget, yet we are being asked by this government to vote this in without that information.


Senator Smith had a great time when he finally got to the substance of the debate, reading out a number of quotes from the past. What the good senator may well bear in mind is that there is a different context today. Today we have a budget where the deficit is 6½ times what the Liberal Party promised it would be in 2014. The deficit has increased by 6½ times on their watch. We have net debt that has doubled. We have debt that has crashed through half a trillion dollars, and we've seen no prospect of that coming under half a trillion dollars in the next decade. That is the budgetary context in which we operate. It is very different to the past context. Senator Smith may want to ask himself this: if the coalition was so gung-ho on corporate tax cuts, why didn't they support them in 2011? Of course, they didn't. Here we have a Senate being asked to pass a corporate tax cut and to cut income tax cuts off in the never-never with no sense of what they will cost. It's valid that we get those answers.

Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (16:31):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate—


(a) acknowledges that the Turnbull Government's budget:


(i) cuts the energy supplement for pensioners – costing pensioners $14 a fortnight, 


(ii) forces Australians to work until they are 70 before they are eligible for the pension,


(iii) locks in $17 billion in cuts to schools, $2.2 billion in cuts to universities and cuts to hospitals,


(iv) cuts Medicare by keeping the rebate freeze on specialists for one more year,


(v) introduces $270 million in new cuts to TAFE and apprentices,


(vi) breaks a promise to not cut funding to the ABC by slashing more than $80 million,


(vii) announces a $1.5 billion cut to remote housing by ending the national partnership agreement and $40 million cut to dental care for veterans, and

Tasmanians have a right to feel extremely disappointed by this federal budget. While the government would like you to think that it's a budget with something for everybody, in reality the tax rates after the first couple of years are overwhelmingly skewed towards those on the highest incomes. It's clear that in this budget Mr Turnbull has failed. He has failed to address the fundamental structural problems in our economy and the challenges that ordinary Australians face. It's a budget with a short-term focus on winning the next federal election, rather than one mapping out a future economic agenda for our nation. Hidden in it are cuts to essential public services to our schools, hospitals, families and pensioners. It's clear that Mr Turnbull and his party colleagues are completely out of touch. He does not and cannot understand the concerns of those who live outside Point Piper, and he certainly does not understand the concerns of people in my home state of Tasmania, particularly those on the north-west and west coasts. They're doing it tough up that way, and the federal Liberal government has been completely missing in action when it comes to fixing issues in those communities. The government may make promises in the lead up to the election, but people need to remember that Mr Turnbull has failed the people of Tasmania, not just on Tuesday in the budget but over the whole of the five years in government. Short-term, pre-election pork-barrelling is not enough to overcome this government's years of neglect.


I know my good friend Justine Keay has been working very hard in the communities on the north-west and west coasts of Tasmania, and I sincerely hope that the people of Braddon will give her the opportunity to keep on working and fighting for them, because only Labor can reverse the neglect of this government. Let me give an example. While the government wanted to talk a lot about senior Australians in the lead up to the budget, their past actions are the ones that they need to be judged on. The task of fixing Australia's aged-care system is critically important, but, sadly, the Turnbull government are not doing enough. In the north-west of Tasmania alone there are 243 older Tasmanians waiting for care—that number is based on the latest data from the Department of Health. These include 160 older Tasmanians waiting with high-care needs, many of them with dementia. The aged-care portfolio is in crisis, and that is absolutely unacceptable. This situation will worsen with the ageing population on the north-west and west coasts, too. We have to remember that in my home state of Tasmania we have the oldest population, and it is ageing faster than the national average. How is it fair that these older Tasmanians have to wait for care while the Turnbull government continues to pursue an $80 billion tax handout to big corporations and to the banks?


Senior Tasmanians are also set to lose the pensioner energy supplement of around $7 a week. We've got to remember that 1,570 local pensioners in Braddon alone are worse off due to previous cuts: 1,170 lost part of their pension, while 400 lost their pension entirely. More and more Tasmanians will have to work for longer, with the government hiking the retirement age to 70. I'm sure that these Tasmanians won't trust a government that previously promised no changes to pensions. We don't forget. We've got long memories in Tasmania, and we do not forget.


Young Tasmanians also feel that the government has completely failed them. The government in the budget has done absolutely nothing to address the biggest concern that young people in Tasmania face, and that's affordable housing. According to Anglicare's Rental Affordability Snapshot Tasmania 2018 there were no private affordable rentals in Tasmania for people on youth allowance—none. And, for a single adult with a Newstart allowance, there was only one affordable rental property in the whole of Tasmania—just one in the whole of Tasmania. That is a disaster. Yet this government doesn't see there's an issue. This government's so utterly blind that it can't see the wave of homelessness that's approaching. We've had recent protests in Tasmania, with people camping on the lawns of Parliament House and crown land because there's nowhere else for them to go. As a result of the actions, or nonactions, of the Liberal federal government and the Tasmanian Liberal government, that's what it has come to. We're coming into winter, we've got a really bad weekend coming on weather-wise, and we've got people living in tents. It's atrocious. In the north-west in the seat of Braddon there was a 45 per cent drop in advertised properties since 2017. That means that many Tasmanians in the north-west and across the state with a job, good references and a solid credit history are now unable to find a rental property. And yet this government's done nothing, and it has done nothing in the federal budget to make any improvements to the dire housing situation facing Tasmanians.


They've also failed utterly on the issue of youth unemployment. The youth unemployment rate in Braddon has just dropped below the national average. It's around 11 per cent still, and that's not good enough. The overall level of unemployment in Braddon on the north-west and west coast of Tassie is at six per cent, which is above both the state and the national averages. One in five workers in the electorate of Braddon could have been affected by the government's penalty rate cuts—one in five. While the government's focusing on giving $17 billion to their mates in the banks and $80 billion to their mates in big business, including multinationals that will funnel those funds offshore—we know that—Labor has a plan to create jobs. In Braddon alone, 6,611 local businesses will benefit from Labor's Australian Investment Guarantee, and that's including 6,147 small businesses. While the Liberals just want to give away money to line the pockets of foreign shareholders, we want to generate real investment and create real jobs.


This budget also locks in the government's cruel cut of $715 million to hospitals over the next two years. Once again, if we look at the seat of Braddon, that includes $730,000 from the Tasmanian North West Regional Hospital. The budget also contains further cuts to hospitals for the five years from 2020. Mr Turnbull's cuts will see $11 million less to public hospitals in Tasmania from 2017 to 2020. There's a crisis in Tasmanian hospitals at the moment, an absolute crisis, and these cuts will only make things worse. Surgeries will be delayed; nurse and doctor numbers will decline. We've got people resigning left, right and centre in our public hospitals. Emergency department wait times—and we have ramping in Tasmania constantly—will increase as a result of Mr Turnbull's cuts.


I've mentioned previously in this place that the government has locked in $17 billion worth of cuts to schools. This includes cuts of up to $14.7 million from local schools on the north-west and west coasts of Tassie. I think we're all pretty aware of the importance of education in creating better employment outcomes for people, but this government would rather give money to Mr Turnbull's mates in the big banks than spend it on good, local community schools in Tasmania. I would be embarrassed and I would be ashamed if I were part of the government. They're handing out $17 billion to their mates in the banks but they're cutting resources from our classrooms and from our children's education. Tasmanians, particularly those on the north-west and west coasts, should remember, every time their school can't afford something, that the money was ripped from their schools to inflate bank profits.


And then we face the issues around higher education. Higher education is on the chopping block as well, with $58 million cut from the University of Tasmania. The University of Tasmania has three campuses, and one of them is in Burnie on the north-west coast of Tassie. This is vital to ensuring that the young people on the north-west coast are able to gain skills and qualifications to participate in growing the economy of the region. So I hope those cuts won't directly impact on the courses provided by the Cradle Coast campus, but I'll be watching because I've got my doubts.


Tasmanians on the west coast—over there in Queenstown, Rosebery and Zeehan—should also be furious about the second-rate NBN they're being left with under this out-of-touch government. I know my colleagues Senator Anne Urquhart and Justine Keay pushed very strongly for upgraded NBN services on the west coast, but the government have failed them. Households and businesses on the west coast are screaming out for improved broadband. The region has some of the highest rainfall in the country, and much of the copper is heavily degraded. While some premises on the west coast will now get fibre to the curb, Mr Turnbull needs to direct NBN Co to immediately change the designs for Queenstown, Rosebery and Zeehan to deliver fibre to the curb to all premises in these towns. While he's there, the government should make sure the people in the towns on the west coast of Tassie have an opportunity for employment when the rollout gets to them, if ever it does. Mr Turnbull's ego should not leave the west coast of Tasmania with a dud NBN service.


Mr Turnbull wants to distract people with pre-election promises while the rest of his budget has locked in cuts to schools, cuts to hospitals and cuts to pensions. It's absolutely clear that this budget has failed Tasmanians. It's particularly failed people on the north-west coast of Tasmania in the seat of Braddon. That's why Tasmania needs a Shorten Labor government, which will govern for all Australians. The north-west and the west coasts of Tasmania need Justine Keay, who will continue to be a great representative for the electorate of Braddon, and I'll be very happy to go and support Justine in her campaign.

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2018-05-10,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (16:42):  I rise to support this government's budget measures this year. I think it is an outstanding budget. It is an outstanding budget for our nation and it is also an outstanding budget for the future and for our children. It is a particularly good budget for my home state of Western Australia in a number of its measures. One of the reasons I'm most proud of being a senator from Western Australia in this place is that my great friend and colleague Dean Smith and I, coming from Western Australia, know what it takes to generate national wealth and know what it takes to grow the economy. Unlike what we've just heard from those opposite, we know that it takes a lot of hard work to generate national money and general income.


Before I go into the benefits of the budget for Western Australia, I would just like to remind those opposite of several facts about the Labor Party and also, in particular, the Greens. What happened to the budget under Labor? When you're having a look at framing and assessing what those opposite are saying somewhat shrilly today, just remember this: Bill Shorten and the Labor Party want to increase taxes on every Australian so that they get a tax take of more than $200 billion. That is $200 billion, but they have not said a word about how our economy is going to generate that beyond taking money from the economy and from taxpayers. Labor have said how they're going to do that: they will impose new and increased taxes on electricity, small and family business, incomes, housing, investment and also retirees. This means, from what we already know from Labor—and we know it will have the support of the Greens—that everybody will pay more and be at greater risk. We hear the rhetoric now, but in government Labor racked up six deficits in a row. They inherited government with zero debt and in fact money in the bank, but after six short years of Labor and six deficits we had $240 billion worth of debt. Unemployment was decreasing and the economy was not doing well. They plunged Australia into debt and deficit, despite, as I said, inheriting zero debt and a $20 billion surplus. They squandered the benefits that came from the once-in-a-century mining boom.


I well remember, as would many in this place, that Wayne Swan promised four years of surpluses, but they have not ever delivered a surplus since—how long since they haven't delivered a surplus, would you say?



A government senator:  The never-never?




Senator REYNOLDS:
  It was 1989. The last time the Labor Party delivered a budget surplus was 1989. The bottom line is Labor are addicted to taxing and spending and, at the last election, they actually promised to increase the deficit by $16.5 billion. 


Again, we've just heard the previous speaker going on ad nauseam about problems we have in Australian society. Those on this side of the chamber, of course, do not deny that. We see the same figures, but what I'm so proud of—being a Liberal member and sitting on this side of the Senate chamber—is that we know that to deliver anything, anything at all, you need to raise the money. We do not, like those opposite, believe you raise money simply by taking it and recycling it amongst taxpayers. 


So what are some of the benefits for Western Australia? Western Australia does very well out of this budget because it is a budget tobuild a stronger economy which will create more jobs and pay for more of those services those opposite go on ad nauseam about but never say they're going to pay for. The government's plan for a stronger economy will support more jobs for WA families and their children, and it will assist Western Australia to set itself up for the future. Already in Western Australia over 20,000 more people are in work since the coalition was elected, but those of us from Western Australia know we need to do more to develop new industries to create new and more sustainable jobs in Western Australia's economy. 


So what has the Commonwealth government done for Western Australia in this budget? It's providing $9.8 billion for vital infrastructure projects, including $2.8 billion for new major projects—such as the $1.1 million METRONET rail project, which takes the government's commitment to more than $3.2 billion for the project and will support $17,000 direct and indirect jobs in Western Australia. I'm particularly delighted that it will include the Thornlie to Cockburn rail link, which is something I've been advocating for for a long time because residents of Perth who live in the eastern suburbs need far greater access to jobs in the south metropolitan area. 


We've heard about the $944 million Perth congestion package, including $581 million for the Tonkin Highway extension. As someone who drives regularly on the Tonkin Highway, I know just how important this is and what a difference it will make to not only industries in the area but also the families who live along that route. There is $560 billion for the Bunbury Outer Ring Road, which is something all of my Liberal colleagues in Western Australia have fought for—and no-one more so than the great Nola Marino. She has fought tirelessly to deliver this essential piece of infrastructure for the South West.


We've also provided $220 million for the Great Northern Highway Bindoon bypass as part of the Roads of Strategic Importance initiative. Like my colleague Dean Smith, I regularly travel in that part of northern Perth, and it will make an enormous difference for industries—existing and new industries—to find a new home in the northern parts of Perth. 


This budget also guarantees the essential services that Western Australia relies on, with record funding for hospitals and schools, and a comprehensive approach to aged care for older Australians to live healthier, more independent and safer lives. It will also guarantee funding for disability services, which is something that I could not be happier about. 


Despite what those opposite say—somewhat untruthfully—under the fully-funded hospitals agreement, public hospitals in Western Australia will receive more than $14.3 billion over the next five years out to 2024-25. The agreement will deliver an additional $3.42 billion in funding compared to the previous five years. That is a funding increase of 32 per cent from the federal government to Western Australian health. Despite, again, the suggestions of those opposite that we are not doing everything we can for primary health care in Western Australia, last financial year there were 3.4 million more bulk-billed GP attendances in WA compared to when Labor were in government. I believe bulk-billing rates in Western Australia are now well over 90 per cent. That has been under a coalition government. Why have we been able to do that? Because we are growing the economy, creating new jobs and creating new national wealth to pay for those resources. At the end of the day, we on this side know that everything in our nation—our lives, what we do and how we do it—rises and falls on a stronger economy. We on this side know that, and that's what we've been working tirelessly for over the last six years.


The security of all Australian jobs, all Australian businesses, all salary earners and all Australian incomes relies on a strong economy. We hear endlessly about essential services from those opposite, as if they're telling us we somehow don't realise these are services that are required. Of course we do. Of course we are compassionate. Of course we want our children to get the best education. We want all young people and all Australians who can work to work and to have the opportunity to work. We want to fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We want to do all of these things. But we know we have to pay for it. The essential services that I've gone through for Western Australia—hospitals, schools, Medicare, disability services, affordable medicines, aged care—have all been funded and delivered because we have a growing economy and we have more people in jobs. One of the many things in this budget I am particularly impressed about is that we are not only funding more of these services that we all want funded and getting nearly one million people into new jobs in this country but also bringing the budget back into balance, and a year earlier than we were expecting.


I listened with some interest, and a great deal of dismay, to those opposite during question time mocking the government and the finance minister for taking a long-term view to economic planning. I almost don't have the words to describe how ridiculous that is and how much of a difference that shows between the two sides of the Senate. Those opposite mocked the Minister for Finance for not taking a one-year or a four-year planning process for our nation's economic future. The fact that those opposite thought it was outrageous and funny that this government was committing and planning for the long term filled me with despair. The long term is the world in 10 years that my nieces and my godchildren will be coming out to. I think it is brilliant that this government is being conservative with its figures, and planning for the longer term.


What will the economy be as a result of this budget and the 10-year plan that the government is putting forward? What will it be for students who are currently going into high school or studying at university in their early 20s? What I don't want is for these children—again, my relatives, my godchildren and others—to come out to the same economy that I came out to in the mid-eighties, when I graduated high school. Times then were very tough, but I was one of the lucky ones who graduated high school and managed to get a job. I started off waiting tables and I sold office supplies. But times were tough; there were few jobs, high interest rates and low wages.


The only way for this generation of students is to graduate, get a great education and know that if they study hard and work hard—and study the right subjects—they will get a job in a growing economy and will not have to do what so many of us had to do when I graduated from university, or high school to start with. It was so difficult to get by and difficult to find a job. Not only do I want to have that future certainty for the next generation of school students but, like all of my coalition colleagues, I also want our small-business owners, young couples planning to have families and older Australians who are preparing for retirement to know that they can have a plan for the next 10 years and beyond with confidence.


Plenty of those opposite think that this tax relief is meaningless. I think they are clearly of touch. As the Treasurer said so aptly yesterday, they're caught in an almond latte fog. Our tax relief will provide help for those bills to be paid. As we heard from Nicole yesterday in that great video clip, it will allow her family a bit more freedom in budgeting and also allow her to give the kids something extra for what they would like to do. At the end of the day, what we are doing is giving people's money back for them to spend at their own discretion, with what their priorities are and how they want to spend it. We're giving them more freedom.


Our seven-year tax plan also runs a sword through bracket creep. What we've seen today in the media and in a lot of commentary, uniformly, is that it's a great thing for Australian families. If those hardworking Australians, whatever age they are, work more hours, do more overtime or get a pay rise, they get to keep more of their own money. It gives them more freedom to spend the money how they see fit with their own families, instead of paying it to the government.


When the second-highest tax bracket is eventually abolished, most Australians earning over $41,000 will never, ever face a higher marginal tax rate in their entire working lives. The fact that those opposite could not think that that was a universally great thing for the majority of Australian working families, again, has me beat. I'll just say this again, because of the implications for Australian families: when the second-highest tax bracket is abolished, most Australians earning above $41,000 will never, ever in their working lives face a higher marginal tax rate. So they can work more, do more overtime or get pay increases and they will get to keep more of their money for themselves and for their families.


But how has this government managed to do this when it inherited such an enormous debt and a very obstructive Senate in terms of budget reform? We've done this because we have single-mindedly worked very hard to grow the economy and to grow new industries and new trade opportunities. And guess what? When businesses, small and large, do well they employ more—they've now employed over a million new Australian workers. Again, that is what we aspire to on this side of the chamber. When business does well, employees do well and they earn more. And now, with the government getting rid of bracket creep, hardworking families can actually keep more of their well-earned money.


In summary, this budget is clearly a plan for a stronger economy. Again, it sounds almost self-evident to those on this side of the chamber, but it is the biggest differentiator between us and those opposite. We know, as the great Maggie Thatcher said over 30 years ago, that there is no such thing as government money. There is only the money that comes from taxpayers. If people want increased government expenditure, they pay for it. They either pay for it in taxes or they pay for it as loans to the government, which they pay back in tax. There is no free money; there is no government money.


Under this government we are creating a bigger economy. We're bringing more money into our economy. We have more money to spend on services. But, most importantly, we are creating jobs and a much stronger future, not only for older Australians in retirement but also for the next generation of students who are looking forward to whatever job, whatever career and whatever future they want. They'll be able to have it if we have the money for it.


As I said at the beginning, everything in our lives here in Australia relies on our economy. Our lives get better or they get worse according to the strength of our economy. Our economy only ever has strength when we create national wealth and we distribute it fairly, but we do it in a way that does not de-incentivise people to work and does not disempower them in all aspects of their lives.

",Senate,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>Budget</title>,MOTIONS,26,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AG,2018-05-10,"



Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (17:00):  I do agree with the previous speaker, just a little bit, that our economy is very important. It is pivotal. It affects people's lives. The economy affects people's material concerns and it affects their day-to-day lives. It affects whether people can afford to keep a roof over their heads, to feed their children and to get health care—which are, of course, fundamental—and that is why this budget is such an abomination.


I'm somewhat moved to support this motion but I would like to say that I'm disappointed because it lists some of the things that are wrong with the budget. It's a bit short. I think it could be a good 10 times as long and it still wouldn't get through all of the things that are problematic about this budget.


Let me firstly go to the core issue of inequality. Inequality is something that, finally, most people—clearly not those in the government, unfortunately—in the wider community recognise is a serious social problem. It is a serious problem in terms of justice and fairness—that old Australian ethos of egalitarianism that sometimes still gets quoted. It's sounding very musty and dated these days because it certainly hasn't been followed. In fact, it's been deliberately destroyed by this government.


Also, equality is a crucial thing with regard to making our economy work properly. There's ample evidence around from economists demonstrating that once you get to the sort of stage of widespread and increasing inequality—income inequality and, most particularly, wealth inequality—it starts to become extremely harmful to the fundamentals of your economy and it also then starts to become extremely harmful to the foundations of your society.


Alongside the need to emphasise the significance of having an economy that delivers the basics for everybody, for all of us, is the need to ensure that we have a healthy environment because there is not much point having people with some jobs if they can't breathe the air and if their water is poisoned. Their jobs will disappear—as they will in my state of Queensland, and in northern Queensland, in particular—if something is not done to stop the rapid global warming that is happening and that is cooking the Reef.


I saw quite an interesting thing in these budget papers, in amongst everything. The government tried to make a big deal of it with $535.8 million over five years for the delivery of a Reef 2050 action plan. Out of that, $443 million is delivered this financial year, as in the next couple of months. That's front loading in a big way. If it were actually going to be delivered to help ensure the survival of the Reef then that would be great, because it is urgent. But if you look at the government's own wording in the budget papers, they're talking about using this money for a range of things, including to progress a research and development program for science innovation, for coral reef restoration and for adaptation to rising ocean temperatures.


Half the time we have people from the government saying that it's a myth that we've got rising temperatures. But they're now saying they need to spend very significant amounts of money to deal with adaptation for rising ocean temperatures. That on the surface would be a good thing, but a much, much better thing would be to stop doing the things that are creating the rising ocean temperatures and putting at threat tens of thousands of jobs and the long-term sustainability and cultural viability of communities along the Queensland coast.


Instead, what they're also using this money for is a reef communications plan. I had the pleasure—perhaps I shouldn't call it a 'pleasure'—of being in a committee hearing with Senator Macdonald the other day in Yeppoon. It was educational. It was just down the road from Senator Canavan's office. It was an inquiry into tourism. It was very useful. It was looking into the job opportunities for Central and Northern Queensland that come through tourism and that absolutely all of them—150 per cent—rely on the health of not just the reef but the marine park, the rivers, the wetlands and the coastal strip in general. All of those are being put at risk by the continual environmental vandalism of this government. It is reiterated in this budget, as there's pretty much nothing to address it. In fact, there are cuts to environment funding, cuts to the jobs of people who are trying to ensure our threatened species don't go extinct and cuts to the jobs of people who are trying to monitor water quality and the health of the water around Queensland and the country. I heard Senator Macdonald in that hearing openly saying, 'This money for the reef action plan is coming forth to have advertising overseas to combat the lies.' These are the so-called lies of people wanting to let people overseas know that the health of the Great Barrier Reef is at risk.


I hope I am proven wrong on this, but I think we're going to have this massive front-loaded spending of money to run a propaganda campaign overseas to say, 'The reef is all healthy and it's all good,' whilst at the same time this government is putting more money into digging up more thermal coal around Queensland and around the country and trying to get more people to put more money into building coal-fired power stations that will further destroy the reef, the marine park and the jobs that are all attached. That's the absurdity at the heart of this budget. That's just one example amongst many that shows just how much of a myth it is that these government members can call themselves good economic managers.


Poll after poll shows that Australians these days, if they're given that basic choice between tax cuts or investment in social infrastructure and social services, will say, 'We want the money invested in health care, education, housing, public transport, our environment and our communities.' That is what the Australian community want. We don't want greater inequality. But we actually had the previous speaker from the government—and I think I got this right—saying: 'It's a universally great thing that someone will never have to pay a higher tax rate again once they hit $41,000. Even if they get to $200,000, they still won't have to pay at a higher tax rate.'


I can remember the Joh Bjelke-Petersen days. I am old enough to remember when Joh Bjelke-Petersen—one of Senator Canavan's heroes, I think—made his great run for Canberra. He ran on his flat tax program. There were probably a couple of things that blew that whole campaign up, but that was probably the key thing—that he ran on something that was so clearly unjust and so clearly economically insane and stupid. Yet this government is really trying to push us down to not quite total, absolute ground-zero flat tax but pretty close. It is really trying to push us right down to as close to flat as it can get. It thinks it's a universally good thing for somebody earning $200,000 a year to be in exactly the same income tax bracket as somebody earning under the median wage. I accept the government is being honest about that. At least it does create a clear indication of the stark choice here. But it shows there is an ongoing, clear-cut commitment to not just maintaining but increasing the inequality that is threatening our society and our economy in the long term.


I draw attention to the analysis. There is an interesting case study after every budget, and probably this one in particular, of how people can use numbers and statistics in all sorts of ways to create very different pictures. But the simple fact is, when you're looking at the basic issue of equality and whether you're increasing it or decreasing it, you're looking at who's getting more money out of it. We already know the big corporations, the big banks, and the Liberal, National and One Nation alliance are still committed to giving big tax cuts to the banks. We've seen the analysis—and there's been plenty of it; I'll pick the one from the Australia Institute—somebody earning $40,000 a year will get a tax cut of $455 a year; and someone earning $200,000 will get $7,225 a year. That is five times more—they earn five times more, but their tax cut is 16 times bigger. The inequality from the tax cut grows by a factor of three, if these tax cuts ever do come into law. I urge, as part of this debate, all of those in the Senate on the crossbench to do what they can to make sure that this rampant inequality does not get locked into law. 


I want to draw attention to the comments from organisations working in the area of housing. St Vincent de Paul, for example, have stated that this budget locks in future spending cuts and leaves people on the lowest incomes worse off. People are already struggling, and it leaves them worse off. There is still no increase to Newstart. Even John Howard is finally agreeing with the Greens. We heard people from the Liberal side of the chamber saying, 'If you want to see what Labor's position will be in five years, look at what the Greens are saying now.' On some issues, there's truth in that. I wish they'd speed things up a bit sometimes. But we're even seeing John Howard getting to where the Greens are, and there are others. 


The Business Council of Australia says that we need an increase in Newstart. We needed it many years ago, and this budget has not delivered it. Inevitably, the inequality will get worse as will the social harm that comes from not being able to afford to survive or to keep paying the rent and being forced into homelessness. Where is there anything in the budget to try and address homelessness? Last year there were quite inadequate measures, but at least there was the pretence of acting on the issue of housing affordability, the crisis of housing affordability. This year there's nothing, nothing at all—nothing to reverse the massive tax breaks that go to the richest when it comes to housing deductibility, negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts. Instead, there is a cut to remote housing—a $1.5 billion cut—and I'm pleased this cut is mentioned in this motion. 


We should be investing in public housing across the board, not trying to tweak the broken housing system the free market fundamentalists have delivered. We've gone past that. We should be saving the revenue and, instead of giving massive multibillion-dollar tax cuts to the banks who make their profits by gouging people through the housing market, building the housing directly. We can afford to build significant amounts of public housing, and the government's own report showed the funding program for remote housing for Aboriginal communities has delivered great results, particularly in my state of Queensland, where on every measure it went off the charts. And this government stops the funding. What on earth? 


You've got a program that works, that's reducing overcrowding with all of the positive flow-on social benefits—improved school attendance, reduced child safety problems and reduced health problems from overcrowding—and they stopped funding it. There are the jobs that go with it. To pull the funding away from jobs in remote Aboriginal communities—real ongoing, skill-developing jobs; what on earth is going on? 


I was on Palm Island a couple of weeks ago just after their wonderful 100-year commemorations—a community that is trying to build their own viable future from a very, very dark history. Not surprisingly, there is significant unemployment on that island and in that community. Forty jobs—40 skilled jobs, 40 jobs in building and housing construction—will go in July, in a month or so, because of the refusal to keep funding this. It's the same in Western Australia and in the Torres Strait and elsewhere.


We've seen money taken away from genuine action on climate change, something which is also an economic issue, a social justice issue and an issue for the future of young people today. We're seeing the cuts to universities, we're seeing the cuts to TAFE, we're seeing the ideological cuts to the ABC and we're seeing the cuts to schools. And we have a government that somehow thinks that giving tax cuts and giving a flat tax rate to people who are earning six figures is a great achievement. That's the great achievement, while everything else is being laid waste to? It's quite extraordinary. Just today, we have seen cuts to ASIC—right in the middle of a banking royal commission that has shown just how rampantly this government's mates have been able to flout the law at horrible human and economic cost—and we're seeing the continuing weakening there.


The core message that I'd like to put forward on behalf of the Greens with regard to this motion is that this is a budget which is economically irresponsible. It does not address the significant issue of inequality. It does not address the issues of wage stagnation, job insecurity and housing affordability. It does not address the massive problem faced by the significant, and growing, number of people who have to rent their homes, often in insecure circumstances. It does not address the issue of total inaction on homelessness and housing security. Instead, we've got massive handouts that predominantly go to the wealthiest. That seems to be the ground that this government wants to pick a fight on leading into the general election next year, or in these by-elections coming up in the near future. Certainly from the Green's point of view, we think this is important ground to battle over because the future of young people in particular in Australia is at stake. Alongside that, of course, the future of the environment is also at stake.


I cannot repeat often enough what a disgrace the complete inaction with regard to climate change in this budget is. It particularly threatens the future of young people, their future job opportunities and their basic right to a healthy environment and planet to live in. We need to fight back against that as strongly as possible, because otherwise that is what this institution will continue to try and inflict on the Australian community.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-05-10,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (17:18):  I thought over the last five years that I'd seen some bad budgets—inequitable, horrible budgets that punished the Australian people—and I didn't really think it could get much more unfair or much worse. But the priorities and choices that this government displays in this budget are appalling. It entrenches the inequality of this government's previous decisions and it goes much, much further. It's the fifth budget we've seen from this government, and it's very clear that Australians are not better off. You on the other side seek to entrench greater inequality in our nation. This is at the same time as we're having to battle cuts to health, education and training and Australians have to battle cuts to penalty rates. You don't have within this budget a plan for wage growth or job creation. What you do have is a plan to put more money into the pockets of big business. That's your grand plan for wage growth and that's your grand plan for job creation, but the economics of your corporate tax cut simply do not stack up. Last month there was a survey released which showed what we've been saying for a long time, which is that the majority of firms given a tax cut would not give employees a wage rise, but rather that the majority of these tax cuts would reward overseas shareholders and pump up executive bonuses. This is not about boosting wages or creating jobs for Australians; this is about serving your vested political interests on your side of the chamber.


This budget fails the fairness test. It fails the test on education, it fails the test on hospitals, it fails the test on job creation and it certainly fails the tests on families, pensioners and workers. It is an unfair budget, and let me tell you why. It isn't a budget that looks after everyday Australian families. This is a budget for big business and, somewhere down the track, very high income earners.


It's not a budget for women. After five years and five budgets you've never put forward a plan that brings Australian women with you. On the one hand, you've tried to cut parental leave, calling working mums rorters and double dippers; on the other hand, you've introduced a childcare policy that leaves a massive 279,000 families worse off as childcare costs continue to rise. A great many of those families are low-income households. You've also frozen the funding for the six National Women's Alliances, you've cut millions of dollars from community legal centres and you've cut capital funding used for safe housing options for women. That was all done before you were forced to restore some of that funding. You've cut almost $2 billion worth of pay rises and support for workers in feminised industries in this nation such as early childhood education and disability care. 


What else have you done in the last few years? Well, you've cheered on cuts to penalty rates that disproportionately impact women. I can certainly see why you abolished the annual women's budget statement, because surely you must know just how bad your budgets are for Australian women. Today I was proud to be at Labor's own women's budget statement release, which we have done from opposition, which shows all of these things. It has a critical analysis of exactly what this government's budget does to Australian women. It highlights all of those issues and many more, and it demonstrates very clearly that gender equity is at the bottom of the pile for this government. You've not taken any serious action on gender equality on superannuation for women, for example.


We can also see very clearly today and this week that this is not a budget for pensioners or, for that matter, a budget for future Australian pensioners. Instead, pensioners are one of the biggest losers in this big-business budget. What we've seen—and I was frankly surprised to see this—is that you've locked in those unfair zombie cuts to pensioners that you previously couldn't get through. You're still relying on them. You still make it part of your agenda to balance your bottom line, so you can hand out those big tax cuts to big business at the expense of pensioners. We will fight you every inch of the way on those measures, but they're still there in the budget so you can serve your big business interests. You're there axing the energy supplement, costing single aged pensioners a massive $14 a fortnight. Now that might not sound like a lot of money to you but if you're an age pensioner, like my parents are, then it means a lot. It means the difference between getting a prescription that you need or not being able to afford it. It might mean the difference between going to the doctor or not being able to afford to do so. It might mean the difference between keeping your electricity on or putting food on the table. We know we have a nation that has growing energy costs, so why would you strip away this most vital support? The energy supplement provides assistance to households that are on low incomes and are very obviously going to be struggling to meet growing energy costs. These households are not likely to have solar panels on their roof to offset their energy costs. If you're in social housing or the rental market because you are on a low income you very rarely have the luxury of solar panels on your roof to cut back on energy costs. Instead, you can often be relying on really inefficient heating. Two million people on low incomes will be worse off under this measure.


I'm also incredibly appalled to see in this budget, in your attacks on pensioners and future pensioners, Australians being forced to work until they're 70 before they're eligible for a pension. My father is in hospital this week. He's in his late 60s. He's having treatment for bowel cancer. Fortunately, he has the security of a pension—currently—so he's not worried about his income while he undergoes his cancer treatment. But I am absolutely gobsmacked to think that people in his situation would need to be juggling access to a disability pension. Despite the fact that many older Australians have better health than they've ever had before, it is a continuing worry for them. You are more likely to have a crook back as a result of being a labourer. You are more likely to have prostate cancer or breast cancer in your older age. So it is completely unreasonable to have this kind of approach coming from the government—that people should be required to work until they're 70 before they can access an age pension. By all means, let's encourage people to work if they can, but it becomes more and more difficult for many people to continue to work. When you talk to tradies, nurses, farmers, manufacturing workers and teachers, who have very demanding physical roles, you find being required to work until you're 70 is simply too much to ask for many of those people. This is a pathetic insult to older Australians.


Also a pathetic insult is your failure, despite all the big talk, to address the aged-care crisis you've created under your watch. You created the aged-care crisis, you've ignored the aged-care crisis, and this budget fails to fix Australia's aged-care crisis. There are more than 100,000 vulnerable Australians waiting for home-care packages but there is funding for just 14,000 new home-care packages in this budget. Appallingly, this will be paid for from the existing aged-care budget.


I heard the weasel words from Minister McKenzie today about how there were no real cuts to places in aged care. That's rubbish. Residential aged care is equally in crisis, equally overburdened. But do you know why aged-care places are underutilised? Because there simply are not the institutions to take up these places that our nation needs. Why? Because they're struggling with making their internal costs add up to invest in new infrastructure. There's growing demand on all the urban fringes of Perth and in rural Western Australia for more residential aged-care beds. But it is no surprise to me that those aged-care beds may be under utilised, because there has been a failure of investment to get those beds happening—because of the squeeze of this government on those costs.


So 3½ thousand places a year is not enough to keep up with demand. We know that the waiting list for home and community care places grew by some 20,000 places in the last six months of 2017 alone. There are 105,000 older Australians currently on the waiting list for a home-care package, including almost 80,000 older Australians needing the most support to stay in their homes and out of aged care. And I hope that when my dad comes out of hospital after this week he is not one of them, because I don't want him waiting on one of those lists. It's the kind of worry that every aged person, as they start to fall into greater frailty and ill health, worries about—how they will stay at home and how they could possibly afford a place in residential care should they ever need it.


There are 105,000 older Australians on the waiting list for a home-care package and you on that side of the chamber are not doing enough to fix it. I hope you go back to your constituencies, back to your states, and listen to the stories of older Australians who are struggling to stay in their own homes. They should be supported to stay in their own homes. Otherwise, they increase the demand on residential aged care. As I said before, this is an unfair budget on women. We know that it is women, in the main, who care for elderly parents in our community. This government's not doing enough to fix those issues. You're underfunding aged care, selling out older Australians, and you're not even honest about it.


Sadly, older Australians are not the only people losing out under this budget. I'm worried about the future of our education system. At a time when we should be growing the investment in our schools at a much higher rate than we are, what you've done is put in place $17 billion worth of cuts to our schools. Our children are losing out under this budget. I know those on the other side will argue that the education budget is growing and that you can prove it's growing. But the simple fact is that we laid out very clear plans and very clear priorities that our schools deserve more growth in funding than what you've given them. That difference adds up to some $17 billion being ripped out of our schools and that you want to hand over in tax cuts to big banks, to big business. The big banks are getting that $17 billion. I find it extraordinary that, at a time when we are seeing the real and devastating and worrying impacts of the conduct of Australia's banks coming out of the banking royal commission, you on that side want to hand them a big tax cut. It's incredibly galling to me that I can see that that money should be going straight to Australia's schools.


It should also be going into our higher education system. I'm appalled to see that this budget locks in previous $2.2 billion in cuts to our universities. Part of this plan is a proposal to lower the repayment threshold for the HELP scheme, with repayments to start when individuals earn just $45,000. I was talking to my own staff and to other young people today about the fact that they're completely galled by the idea that they should be on the same tax rate as someone earning $180,000 or $200,000 a year at the same time as they're having to pay back HELP, HECS and all those kinds of student payments.


It is incredibly difficult to get by as a young person today. These cuts to universities will have a big impact on students, and, indeed, on prospective students, across the country. I also worry about what they will do to the quality of our participation in international education markets. I want to give a shout-out to the National Union of Students Build a Better Budget campaign, because, importantly, they've put many of these issues on the agenda consistently and, rightly, are communicating with students right around the country about what a bad budget this is.


Today we see a budget that persists with $715 million worth of cuts to hospitals over the next two years alone, and we can see more cuts to follow in the next five years. We see that the Medicare rebate is frozen and we see increasing out-of-pocket costs to see specialists. Those opposite failed to fix the health insurance affordability crisis, and I'm very disappointed to see that they failed to adopt Labor's great plan to scrap the discriminatory tampon tax. Rightly, we don't see items like condoms taxed in Australia, and nor should we see items like tampons taxed.


We see that we have a government here that can't be trusted on health or apprenticeships. We've seen a loss of more than 139,000 apprenticeship places under this government. We've seen more than $3 billion worth of cuts in previous budgets to education and training. We absolutely cannot afford to see any more of these cuts. We've seen cuts in remote housing, we've seen cuts in dental care and we've seen women's homeless shelters and domestic violence shelters put at risk.


So today we stand with a clear choice in the lead-up to the by-elections that are before us. A future Labor government is a government that will invest in education, job creation and health care. Or there are the Liberals, who rip money from families, schools and hospitals. (Time expired)

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2018-05-10,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (17:38):  I begin my contribution tonight by wishing Senator Pratt's father a very speedy recovery and a safe return home from hospital. I have to say, though, that I found Senator Pratt's new-found concern for older Australians a little surprising, given that Senator Pratt is a member of a political party, the Labor Party, which only a few weeks ago unveiled a new policy to smash the household budgets of many older Australians, many self-funded retirees and, indeed, many pensioners. That was until they were forced into an embarrassing backflip a few weeks later, announcing that their changes to dividend imputation would in fact exempt pensioners—rather than their original plan, which was to smash the budgets of pensioners by preventing them from receiving the dividend imputation credits that they had been expecting in their retirement.


It's particularly galling for older Australians to hear this new-found concern for their welfare from the Labor Party when Labor were prepared to push through a change that would have decimated their household budgets and given them no way to respond. Older Australians—people who have retired—are not like the rest of us. They don't have as much time on their side, and if they have been out of the workforce for a long time they don't have many options to restructure their financial affairs to respond to changing government policy. So if someone is in their 70s, 80s or 90s and they planned for their retirement under the policy settings that were in place at the time that they retired—for example, knowing that they would be able to receive a credit in exchange for the tax that was pre-paid on shares that they own in Australian companies—and then someone pulls the rug out from underneath them, as the Labor Party proposes to do, there's very little that 70-year-old, 80-year-old or 90-year-old can do about that. They're not going to find it very easy to go back to work to earn replacement income for the income that they've lost. They're not going to be able to do anything all that creative with their finances, which they're reliant on for their income. They're just going to have to cop it. We heard horrific stories of reductions in household income of as much as 20 per cent to 30 per cent. Senator Pratt was talking about a possible $14 per week reduction in income for some pensioners. People affected by Labor's dividend policy would be affected by losses far, far greater than that.


The truth is that this budget, like all budgets delivered by coalition governments, is extremely generous to older Australians. It's extremely mindful of the contribution that they've made to their nation over their lifetime and extremely mindful of the fact that they, as older Australians, are less able to respond to changing policy settings that could affect them. That's why one of the features in this budget that I think is really worthy of support and I hope will receive support from this chamber is the change that allows pensioners to earn an extra $1,300 a year in private income before their ability to receive a pension or a part-pension is affected. That's a really good change, because a lot of older Australians might have quite good health but don't necessarily want to work full time and, of course, wouldn't want to jeopardise the pension they plan to rely on for their retirement. They might like to do a bit of part-time work here and there in their local community. They might like to do a part-time job to keep them engaged in the community, as much as anything, as well as providing themselves with a bit of extra income. Thanks to changes in this budget, they're now able to do so for more hours if they wish. It's a choice that we're giving them.


Another change in the budget which is going to make it easier for pensioners to live a more financially secure retirement is the pension loan scheme changes. They will allow pensioners, if they choose, to borrow against the value of their home and enjoy the proceeds of living against the value of their home, of living from an income from the value of their home—again, without affecting their eligibility for the pension. That would in many cases allow them to enhance their retirement income and standard of living, just by being able to access the value of the equity in their home. That's another change we've made to help older Australians better plan for their retirement and better structure their financial affairs in retirement.


Senator Pratt mentioned the aged-care system. As it happens, my wife, as some senators know, is a cofounder and director of a business in the aged-care industry that helps people who need places in residential aged-care homes to find places in such homes, so it's something I hear about often over the dinner table at home most nights. I'm acutely aware of the particularly strong demand there is in the community for home care. Like many Australians, older Australians become very attached to their home and to the community in which they live. They've chosen to live there, often because it's in close proximity to their family, children, grandchildren, friends and neighbours that they've grown to become very fond of. Many older Australians would like to remain in their home for as long as possible. They would prefer not to go into a residential aged-care facility if possible. There is great demand for the government's home-care services, and that's why in this budget they're being significantly expanded to cater for that unmet demand in the community. So for Senator Pratt or the Labor Party to characterise this budget as anything other than a very favourable budget for older Australians is very unfair and not consistent with the facts of the budget.


I'm very proud to be part of a government that's handing down a budget like this and I want to talk tonight about some of the really key features of this budget that I think are worthy of support. In particular I want to talk about two, and, depending how much time I have, I may get to some others. The two that I want to focus on tonight are the tax relief for working Australians, which is provided for in this budget, and the way in which the government has managed to get our finances better under control to live within our means by returning the budget to surplus earlier and delivering a larger surplus within the forward estimates.


I'll begin on tax relief because there's a very important principle at stake here. Every single dollar that the government raises, every single dollar that the government spends, has first been earned by someone else. It has been earned by someone because of their hard work, their entrepreneurship, their ingenuity and their effort, and government should only take as many dollars as it needs from the Australian people who have earned it in the first place, as many as it absolutely requires to run the services that only governments can run and provide the services that no other organisation in society can. We should, as a principle, allow people to keep as much of the money they earn for themselves, because it's right that they keep what they earn as the fruits of their own labour and because, frankly, they know how to spend it better than could any politician or bureaucrat, however well motivated, plan to spend someone else's money on their behalf. So, in the first stage of the tax relief plan over seven years that the Turnbull government has revealed in the budget this week, we'll focus particularly on lower- and middle-income earners.


One of the key features of this package is a new, non-refundable low- and middle-income tax offset. This will provide up to $530 a year to low- and middle-income earners every single year, starting in 2018-19. This reform will assist 10 million Australians, with around 4.4 million Australians receiving the full $530 benefit as soon as the 2018-19 financial year.


The second phase of the budget is to raise the threshold for the 32½ per cent tax bracket from $87,000 to $90,000 from 1 July 2018. This will deliver a tax cut of $135 a year to around three million Australians. Really importantly, it will prevent more middle-income earners being pushed from the 32½ per cent tax bracket into the second-highest bracket of 37 per cent, countering potential disincentives to earning higher incomes, which they face through jumping into a higher tax bracket, and, of course, countering the dreaded effects of bracket creep.


In 2022-23, the government will increase the top threshold of the 19 per cent tax bracket from $37,000 to $41,000 and increase the low-income tax offset, which I mentioned earlier, from $445 to $645. From 1 July 2022, tax relief of up to $1,350 per year will be provided by further increasing the top threshold of the 32½ per cent bracket, which I mentioned earlier, from $90,000 to $120,000. This is the bracket that was increased in the last budget from $80,000 to $87,000, so in just a few short years under the Turnbull government this middle-income tax bracket will increase from $80,000 to $120,000, helping millions of Australians avoid going into a higher tax bracket. In fact, 1.8 million will be prevented from facing the 37 per cent tax rate in 2022-23, keeping them in that lower 32½ per cent tax bracket.


The third and final phase of the government's income tax plan is to ensure that our tax system becomes much simpler and flatter, because we all know that a simpler and flatter tax system is a more efficient tax system and is a tax system which better rewards people's efforts. From 1 July 2024, the government will increase the top threshold of the 32½ per cent tax bracket from $120,000 to $200,000. Effectively, that abolishes the 37 per cent tax bracket completely. That means the second-highest tax bracket, which a number of Australians pay now and will pay in the future, will be abolished entirely. A result of this plan is that 94 per cent of taxpayers are projected to face a tax rate of just 32½ per cent, or even less, by 2024-25.


I think one of the great features of this plan is the flat nature of the tax system that will be introduced. People earning from $41,000 upwards, up to $200,000, will face no disincentives to working longer hours or going for a higher-paying job because they will remain in the same tax bracket. No matter how much extra they earn, up to $200,000, they'll still pay 32½ per cent tax. If we don't make these changes, only 63 per cent of taxpayers will have that protection. The coalition want to allow people to keep more of their own money because, unlike the Labor Party and the Greens, we believe in reward for effort.


I think this is a good tax plan. I think it's an ambitious tax plan. I think it delivers welcome tax relief for millions of working Australians. But, to be truthful, it is not the most ambitious tax plan I've read about recently. In fact, I have here in front of me a much more ambitious tax plan that proposes much more significant cuts to not just the thresholds of tax but the rate of tax. I admit it is from August 2005. I'm reading from an article by Jason Koutsoukis and Josh Gordon, since retired from the Fairfax bureau, in The Sunday Age entitled 'Union chief joins call for big tax cuts':


One of Australia's most influential union leaders has called for the top income tax rate to be slashed to 30 cents in the dollar as the push for widespread tax reform gathers pace.


Australian Workers' Union national secretary Bill Shorten, who is widely tipped to enter Parliament at the next election, said all rates needed to be simplified as part of a radical overhaul of the tax system.


Mr Koutsoukis and Mr Gordon were spot on. They could see the future. Mr Shorten did indeed enter the parliament. The article continued:


He urged Labor to embrace genuine reform to try to wrong-foot the Howard Government.


Mr Shorten's call came as Labor's finance spokesman Lindsay Tanner also backed calls to slash the top marginal tax rate, now 47 cents in the dollar.


Mr Shorten said tax reform was the best way to boost sagging productivity levels …


""There is no question that we have to offer fair dinkum tax reform,"" Mr Shorten told The Age. ""All this tinkering about, offering people $6-a-week tax cuts, is just putting lipstick on the tax system.""


Mr Shorten has proposed a radical simplification of the tax scales with a top rate of 30 cents in the dollar, a medium rate of 20 cents and a lower rate of 10 cents.


He said the top rate would cut in above $100,000, with income between $50,000 and $100,000 taxed at 20 cents in the dollar, and income below $50,000 taxed at 10 cents—all to be funded by ""cutting out all the business tax rorts and business welfare"".


I have to confess, it doesn't sound like too bad a plan to me. In fact, it's in many ways much more ambitious than the plan that the government's proposed. It would involve massive tax cuts for many Australians, including those on higher incomes. It compares to the government's tax plan in the same way, I guess, as the Liberal Democrats' tax plan compares to our current tax plan. It's a very radical tax plan proposing very significant tax cuts.


I aspire to one day ensure that Bill Shorten's vision for Australia's personal income tax system is achieved. Sadly, we now know that it won't be achieved under Bill Shorten, because Bill Shorten has said that the government's much more modest proposals to reduce taxes go far too far and are unfair. If the government's proposals are unfair, I wonder what 2018 Bill Shorten thinks of 2005 Bill Shorten. I wonder what 2018 Bill Shorten thinks of the ambitious, young Australian Workers' Union leader aspiring to enter the parliament and his ambitious plan for cutting taxes.


This is a little bit of a pattern, colleagues. This is not the first time that Bill Shorten has proposed quite pro-market, pro-reform, low-tax policies. In fact, as we all know, and have heard umpteen times in this chamber, he's proposed quite significant cuts to the company tax system as well. But we know that Bill Shorten's position has changed. I wonder why that is. I wonder why, as opposition leader, he's now walking away from principles that he's held throughout his career. He's walking away from his commitment to lower personal income taxes and to lower company taxes. It might just be that Mr Shorten is an ambitious person who wants to be Prime Minister and is willing to say or do anything in order to achieve that and is willing to walk away from principles he has espoused well within living memory.


Some of the criticism of the government's tax plan has been that the benefits in the tax reduction will in some way be distributed unfairly. Even the Grattan Institute today has acknowledged that the progressivity of the income tax system in Australia will be altered in no significant way by our tax plan, and the Grattan Institute is not a exactly a renowned friend of coalition governments. It was famously founded by the Rudd and Brumby governments with an injection of $15 million each of taxpayers' money. It sits upon a $30-plus million taxpayer funded endowment, courtesy of the Rudd government and the Brumby government. It is not renowned for being a close ally or friend of coalition governments or free markets, but nonetheless it has acknowledged that there would be no significant change to the progressive nature of the Australian tax system as a result of the changes in this budget.


I think it's worth putting some real facts, figures and numbers on the table here in this debate, because the truth is that, as a result of this tax plan, Australians on an income of $30,000 a year will receive an 8.3 per cent reduction in their tax bill over the course of the seven-year plan. That is a good and significant reduction. Australians on $50,000 a year will receive a little bit less. They will receive a 6.3 per cent reduction. Australians on $120,000 a year will receive a little bit less still. They will receive a 2.9 per cent reduction. Those on $160,000 a year will receive a 2.4 per cent reduction. Those on $200,000 a year will receive a reduction of 2.5 per cent. So the greatest proportional reduction in tax bills will go to those on the lowest incomes—8.3 per cent for those on $30,000 compared to 2.5 per cent for those on $200,000.


There are of course tax cuts in this budget for Australians with higher incomes, and I think that is a very necessary and worthwhile change in this budget. The truth is that, when you cut taxes, in dollar terms many of those benefits accrue to people on higher incomes because they pay more taxes. The top one per cent of income earners in Australia pay 17 per cent of all income tax. The top 10 per cent of income earners in Australia pay 45 per cent of all income tax. To put that in stark dollar terms, someone on $200,000 who, as we heard earlier, is getting a 2.5 per cent reduction in their tax bill pays $67,000 in tax. Someone on $100,000 pays $26,000 in tax. Someone earning $50,000 pays $8,000 in tax. Someone earning $30,000 pays only $2,700 in tax. Our tax system is highly progressive. People on higher incomes pay a much greater amount of tax both in real dollar terms and as a proportion of their income and, under this tax cut plan, although they will get tax reductions proportional to the tax they pay, it will be very modest compared to the very significant reductions at the lower end of the scale.


I realise that, in my enthusiasm for talking about Bill Shorten's exciting, ambitious 2005 personal income tax reform plan, I've run out of time to talk about some of the other great features of the budget. I was going to talk about how excited I am about bringing forward the return to surplus by a year. I was going to talk about how excited I am about the increase in the size of the surplus and the wonderful infrastructure package of which my home state of Victoria is the recipient. But, sadly, there is so much good news that I've run out of time, even in 20 minutes, to address it all. I'm sure there will be an opportunity to return to the Senate to share more good news with my colleagues.

Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (21:11):  By popular demand, I will provide a further speech this evening. It is not on the budget, although I will preface my remarks by highlighting that it is an ongoing disappointment and of great concern to me that a prolonged period of major underfunding in our foreign aid budget is continuing following this government's tabling of its economic details this week. I make that point as a prelude to the comments I wish to make tonight.


The speeches we've had this evening around the federal budget and its impact on Australians are very important. The budget is crucial to the lives of everybody who lives in this country. But I want to speak tonight about people outside this country who are in a dire and desperate situation. I speak of the Rohingya people in our own region, nearby. Tonight, rather than just tabling or incorporating a document, I'd like to read into the record words put together by Rohingya groups, coordinated by the Burmese Rohingya Association in Queensland, based in my home city of Brisbane, on behalf of the Central Queensland Rohingya community; the Darwin Burmese Rohingya community association; the Burmese Rohingya Community in Australia, based in Sydney; the Arkan Rohingya Community of Australia, based in Melbourne; and the Australian Burmese Rohingya Organisation, based in Melbourne.


On their behalf I'll read these words that they want to have read into the record for the attention of all senators, all parliamentarians and the wider community. They are words that I support. They start by reminding us of the words of the United Nations Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide, Mr Adama Dieng, who reported the following:


… international crimes were committed in Myanmar. Rohingya Muslims have been killed, tortured, raped, burnt alive and humiliated, solely because of who they are. All the information I have received indicates that the intent of the perpetrators was to cleanse northern Rakhine state of their existence, possibly even to destroy the Rohingya as such, which, if proven, would constitute the crime of genocide. However, whether or not we consider that the crimes committed amount to crimes against humanity or genocide, this should not delay our resolve to act and to act immediately. We owe this to the Rohingya population.


The letter from these organisations reads:


Dear honourable senators,


On behalf of more than a million forgotten people whose voices are often unheard, and uncared, we, the undersigned Rohingyan organisations, speak to you with our grave concerns as to what is currently happening to the Rohingya people, both in and outside Myanmar. Renowned humanitarian organisations such as the Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have already published detailed accounts of tortures, rapes and mutilations of innocent Rohingya civilians. We hope that the government of Australia would do something to protect this persecuted minority, as their very existence and identity are threatened.


Since 25 August 2017—


only in the last nine months—


as per Medecins Sans Frontieres, more than 9,000 Rohingyas have died which include at least 730 children below the age of 5. Death tolls are on the rise and to date, there are at least 888,000 refugees registered in Bangladesh. Therefore, it is no surprise that the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, states:


""In my experience, the Rohingya are one of the most discriminated-against populations in the world - and that was even before the crisis of the past year. Deprived of nationality, they have been subjected to extreme brutality by military forces and others, and cast out of their homes and country in a clear example of ethnic cleansing… The Rohingya community desperately needs immediate, life-saving assistance, long-term solutions and justice.""


The letter goes on:


The trust that our people and the international community had in the country's de facto leader, to speak up for minority rights, has been marred. This recent episode of the ongoing military clearance operation by Myanmar which forced out more of the Rohingyan population than any of the previous exoduses, comes at a time when the Rohingyas had placed their undivided faith in Ms Suu Kyi to speak up and intervene in this humanitarian disaster, which the UN describes as a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"" and ""the hallmarks of a genocide."" Suu Kyi's one-sided and dispassionate approach towards this ethnic cleansing, and she failed to live up to the 'democratic values and causes' she once advocated for as an admired icon.


On the other hand, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina showed great leadership and compassion towards the Rohingya that have fled the genocide. However, with their limited resources, Bangladesh has gone beyond its capacity to help and such support cannot be practically sustained in the long term.


We believe this house is aware of the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of Rohingyas who have been trapped in the refugee camps for decades in countries like Bangladesh, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. They have never been given any legal status nor have they been offered resettlement to a third country, such as Australia. Furthermore, Australia too has locked up many refugees including Rohingyas in countries like Papua New Guinea and Nauru.


The remainder of the Rohingyas are either on the run or hiding in bordering countries for the sake of survival. Amidst this, no sustainable and durable solution to date has been achieved to ensure that this race has the basic human rights that everyone deserves. We fear that a generation of people who have already suffered loss will lose all faith in the world leaders due to their inaction and inability to stop the ongoing atrocities. Such a situation poses a tangible risk for liberal, democratic nations like Australia, with the potential to fuel more chaos in the region, as pointed out by experts and rights groups. Many world leaders have expressed concerns that the continued negligence and silence by powerful countries towards this genocide will leave these disempowered Rohingyas vulnerable to manipulation, radicalisation, human trafficking and slavery.


…   …   …


We do not want to see more bloodshed or violence that compounds our loss of rights and loss of lives at the hands of the Myanmar government and its military. Our people want to live simple and dignified lives, return home and villages safe and protected, and be reunited with their families.


We are aware that many of you have personal experiences and family backgrounds of forceful relocation. It was not so long ago that many of your ancestors went through similar situations when displaced from their homes during wars in Europe and elsewhere. Historically, Australia has played an active role in creating a haven for people fleeing violence, offering a fair go to migrants who have been encouraged to thrive and express their full potential as human beings.


We humbly request that Australia show this same consideration to the persecuted and defenceless Rohingya people. We believe Australia has the capacity and the heart to step forward and offer a more enduring assistance and resolution, and give the Rohingyan people a realistic hope of living a dignified life.


As a country which has close ties with Myanmar, Australia has supported the Myanmar military, providing them with training and financial aid, and is indirectly making a significant contribution to the atrocities committed by Myanmar military against our people. This is the very same military that has waged a genocide against the innocent Rohingya people and as a result many Rohingya have lost their dignity and their lives. The military have deliberately imposed media blockades in these regions and the few of those who have dared to speak against their government's atrocities have been detained. At a least 10 Burmese journalists have been arrested for reporting on the brutal reality that Myanmar and its military are associated with. Australia has a responsibility to speak out against these crimes to protect a minority who are being massacred in broad daylight—and this is happening today, a genocide in our region in the 21st century.


We Rohingyas have made Australia our home—


those who have written this letter—


we recognise that Australia has done a great deal to support Rohingyas, and Australia has yet more to do. We believe Australia can and should play a leadership role, and so we ask our government—


as people who are resident in Australia—


to take some immediate steps to:


Facilitate a special humanitarian intake of 20,000 Rohingya people so the most vulnerable amongst Rohingyas can be brought to safety in Australia.


Condemn Myanmar and its military for the atrocities committed against Rohingya. Impose targeted sanctions on its trade agreements, aid agreements and more importantly its military relations, until they provide Rohingyas with rights and recognition.


Ask the Myanmar government to reinstate the citizenship rights of this oppressed group.


Australia to monitor the worsening situation of Rohingyas along with other international partners. Ask the Burmese people to grant access to Rakhine state for international aid agencies, medical staff, international media and observers, UN fact finding missions and investigators—so they can account for the atrocities that have ensued and justice be brought for the victims.


Expedite family reunion applications so families that have been separated by conflict can be reunited in safety here.


Issue permanent visas to all Rohingya people who have sought asylum in a country of Australia.
