Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (09:32):  The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Support for Commonwealth Entities) Bill 2016 contains two main changes to the act. The first change is an administrative one. It allows the government's agency to use Efic expertise on the basis of a fee-for-service arrangement. This is not controversial and the opposition supports it. The second makes it easier for Efic to lend money to companies wanting to expand their offshore operations. Ideally, this would allow Australian companies to take advantage of trading opportunities, therefore benefiting the Australian economy. However, an earlier version of this bill would have also made it easier for Efic to lend money to a company wanting to relocate its manufacturing operations offshore or to set up a call centre overseas. I can assure you, given my recent experience with Telstra's call centres in the Philippines and in India, no-one could possibly want to have that happen. It was truly an appalling experience to see how those facilities, which were moved from Australia to the Philippines and India, have left an appalling level of service for Australian customers of Telstra. I'm glad to see the government moved amendments in the other place that reduced that risk. I see the government has indicated it will accept further amendments, which the Labor Party will be proposing, to further reduce that risk.


Efic's internal policy stipulates that any loan that a corporation provides must not result in a net loss of jobs in Australia. Labor does not believe this in itself is a sufficient safeguard. We believe that taxes paid by Australians should be used for the benefit of Australians. It's a fundamental Labor value that Australian jobs should be put first, and that's why we moved to refer this bill to a committee of inquiry. It was necessary to check whether the changes in Efic's role would have had unintended damaging consequences.


The committee heard evidence from a range of community groups that share Labor's concerns about this bill. In its submission, for instance, the Australian Fair Trade and Investment Network said:


It is a reasonable and in fact modest requirement that firms receiving support from Efic actually produce goods and/or services in Australia and employ Australians … In the absence of such a requirement, there would be no incentive for firms receiving Efic loans to have any Australian content. This would lead to the perverse situation of an Australian government institution being able to provide support for firms providing no employment in Australia.


It said:


The removal of local content requirements from the legislation would enable firms based in Australia but providing no local employment to have access to Efic support. It would provide no incentive for firms to continue to conduct operations in Australia and provide local employment.


The Australia Institute commented:


While the change to specifically recognise service exports may be desirable, the current proposed amendment seems to remove any focus on products that are produced in Australia. The effect of this could be the further offshoring of Australian manufacturing. For example, a garment company based in Australia could move all production offshore, but still be eligible for Efic's services.


This has the potential to not only deprive finance to companies that produce in Australia, but also to give advantage to their competition in other countries.


The Australian Council of Trade Unions submission declared:


It is in the national interest that companies which receive government loans are required to use that money in a way which benefits Australian employment. The removal of these provisions will be yet another blow to the Australian manufacturing and services sectors. It could potentially lead to jobs being offshored.


So we see those various submissions producing comments on the same theme. They gave a warning which I think was justified and should have been heeded, and that's why Labor did not accept the recommendations of the government majority on the committee that the bill should be passed without amendment. We acknowledged that when the bill was considered in the House of Representatives, and we are moving amendments that go some way towards allaying the concerns. The most important of these amendments stipulates that an applicant for a loan or guarantee:


… must certify, by writing given to EFIC, that the person reasonably believes that the loan will result in a net increase in the number of people employed in Australia by the business or a related business during the term of the loan.


Nonetheless Labor believes that this is insufficient, so we are moving two further amendments, and we're pleased that the government has indicated that it's prepared to accept those amendments. I understand, Minister, that that remains the case. These amendments provide that, at the completion of any loan or guarantee that it is to be used for the dominant purpose of direct investment outside Australia, the applicant must provide Efic with a certification stating whether a net job increase occurred as a result of Efic's financing and that this information must be publicly released by Efic. Further, for businesses with a turnover of more than $150 million in a financial year, the company must certify that any loan or guarantee to be used for the dominant purpose of direct investment outside Australia will not be used to offshore substantial parts of the business. These amendments will allow closer scrutiny of the use of taxpayers' money for direct foreign investment. This will help ensure that Efic's finance will result in net job growth in Australia.


These are outcomes that I think are positive. They reflect Labor's resolve to put Australian firms and their workers first. Far too often the Abbott-Turnbull government has done nothing while Australian jobs have been sent offshore. On this occasion we thank the government for its willingness to negotiate around these amendments, and it's a much better bill as a result than it was when it was first introduced. We hope that this government will continue to be willing to agree to measures that actually reduce the risks of jobs being lost in this country.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2017-09-06,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (09:39):  I rise to speak on the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Support for Commonwealth Entities) Bill 2017 before us today. The Greens have significant concerns with this bill and believe the government missed an important opportunity to reform and progress meaningful reform to Efic, reform that we know is very much needed, before we expand the powers of this particular body. Chief among our concerns is the fact that Efic already has a very poor record in assessing the impacts of its investments and has a very poor record of being transparent with the parliament and with the Australian people—the taxpayers that fund these operations. Yet, despite this history, the first amendment of this bill expands Efic's powers. According to the explanatory memorandum:


The policy objective of the first amendment is to allow Efic to offer its specialist financial capabilities in the operation and administration of Commonwealth financing programs, where there is no connection to exports.


Expertise, I guess, is in the eye of the beholder. When you see the very dark, opaque way that Efic has been operating, you have to wonder what expertise indeed we are talking about.


Instead, we need to strengthen the accountability practices of Efic before we consider and contemplate expanding its powers. Efic must get its own house in order before it starts telling other government agencies what to do and how to do it. Efic has repeatedly demonstrated a failure to conduct proper due diligence, evidenced by human rights and environmental violations at Efic sponsored projects overseas. One of those violations is in Efic's work in PNG, one of the most illustrative examples of Efic's poor decision making and lack of transparency—namely, in support of the ExxonMobil led PNG LNG project in 2009. It was at the time the largest single loan that Efic had given. Much of this transaction was done on the National Interest Account and was thus undertaken with the cooperation of DFAT. Nonetheless, it never could have happened without passing Efic's due diligence standards, which have clearly been found wanting.


In 2009, and again in 2012, Jubilee Australia found two major shortcomings of the project. Firstly, from a macroeconomic point of view, the expected financial impacts on the PNG economy were likely to be mixed, and poor governance in PNG meant that it was likely that this project would undermine any predicted widespread benefits for the ordinary people of PNG. Secondly, Jubilee warned that the unrealistic promises, combined with inadequate landowner mapping and political pressures on the landowners to sign on to the project agreement, would eventually lead to landowner discontent. We know that that indeed is what has happened. Jubilee Australia further warned that if this discontent caused low level conflict, the PNG government might send in the military, which would lead to an escalation and bloody civil conflict in the area. This is precisely what has happened. Efic was grossly incompetent in assessing this project's social, economic and political risks.


I question the expertise of Efic in relation to other government agencies and projects and the ability to expand Efic's powers under this piece of legislation. This is just one example, and there are others. One is that Efic has been unable to assess the risks associated with other large resource projects. In the early 1980s, Efic financed and assisted in the expansion of the Rio Tinto controlled Panguna mine. The exploitation associated with this mine led to the Bougainville Civil War. Efic has never really taken responsibility for the role that it played in this, the largest and most destructive conflict in the South Pacific region since World War II.


I don't just highlight these as one-off examples. This is an ongoing systemic problem we have with this agency and its ability to conduct proper risk assessment on social, economic and political risks and take responsibility for the role that this agency has had in escalating problems throughout our region.


The list, of course, goes on. We get to the role that Efic has had in relation to the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, the NAIF. In addition to the overseas projects, we now know that Efic is tightly entwined in the operation of funding of projects through the NAIF. Efic's role in the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility does nothing to inspire confidence in its ability to provide advice to other Commonwealth entities and agencies and to assist them in conducting due diligence. With Efic's support, the NAIF is a secretive organisation that is considering blatantly unethical and illegitimate investments like Adani's billion-dollar rail line from its proposed Carmichael coalmine to the Galilee Basin. NAIF and Efic have advanced the project to the due diligence stage, despite the fact that Adani made clear on 5 December that the loan was 'not critical' and that they applied for it 'because it's available' and 'it doesn't mean it's a make or break for the project'. In light of that statement, the Adani project clearly fails NAIF's own investment mandate. You have to wonder why Efic has allowed it to progress to the due diligence stage.


Illustrative of the Efic-NAIF problems is the recent resignation of Efic's independent non-executive director and audit committee chair, Annabelle Chaplain. As a board member, Ms Chaplain oversaw Efic's work for NAIF from the beginning until her recent resignation. She gave notice to the minister, Mr Ciobo, on 19 July, just weeks after Environmental Justice Australia publicly pointed out a potential conflict of interest; and, despite being referred to as a board member with a term to 31 July 2019 in Efic answers to questions on notice, Ms Chaplain has now resigned. Ms Chaplain's potential conflicts of interest were obvious. She was a board member of Efic, the body assessing the suitability of the Adani taxpayer loan, at the same time as she was a shareholder and chair of Downer EDI, which has an arrangement for $2 billion worth of work with Adani—of course, if it is to go ahead. She is also the chair of Queensland Airports Ltd, which owns the Townsville Airport, which is working to 'secure the opportunity for Townsville to be the FIFO hub for the Adani mine'. No public explanation has yet been made as to Ms Chaplain's resignation beyond 'unexpected commitments'; nor do we know what measures she took previously to avoid the conflicts of interest prior to resigning. In the committee stage, I will be asking the minister specific questions in relation to this opaqueness around Efic and potential conflicts of interest of board members, and I'm warning the minister that it'd be helpful if we could get some answers when we get to that point.


Perhaps the Productivity Commission said it best when it recently summarised its criticisms of Efic. It said:


There is much to be learned from the long experience of EFIC providing concessional export finance. Some of these lessons cover what not to do.


The assisted expansion of the Rio Tinto controlled mine is one example. The exploitation associated with the Panguna mine led to the Bougainville conflict war. These, of course, are things that have to be taken into consideration. The Productivity Commission's review of Efic found that it was failing to support small and medium enterprises where market gaps in access to export financing were likely. The commission also found governance problems such as insufficient internal and independent oversight of compliance with its mandate. The commission was not satisfied that the Efic board was provided with sufficient information in board papers to evaluate whether finance facilities submitted for approval met the requirements set out in the minister's statement of expectations. That, of course, has come directly from the Productivity Commission's review.


Given our concerns about Efic's actions overseas as well as at home, through the NAIF and through overseas exploitation, we will be moving amendments to strike out these provisions in the bill. We cannot support an expansion of Efic's remit when it is so clearly failing to fulfil its current requirements.


We are extremely worried about the lack of transparency to the parliament and to the Australian people in relation to the activities and funding of projects through Efic. We will be moving amendments to remove Efic's exemption from the freedom of information laws. Concerns about Efic's lack of transparency and accountability were identified during the Productivity Commission's inquiry in 2012. The inquiry found that Efic's exemption from the FOI Act should be removed and that Efic should be required to release more information about social and environmental impact assessments. Efic has failed to meaningfully improve its transparency and accountability mechanisms since the Productivity Commission's report, having only adopted a grievance mechanism and introduced a weak and secretive human rights policy. It is high time that we follow the Productivity Commission's recommendations and remove Efic's exemptions from FOI laws.


We will move this amendment, and I call on all members in this place, including the opposition and fellow crossbenchers, to support this amendment. There is no excuse for an exemption from FOI, particularly for an organisation that has proven itself to be untrustworthy when it comes to these issues, looking at the impact of the projects that it funds and taking responsibility for the consequences. This is, of course, taxpayers' money, and FOI exemptions such as what currently exists undermine the ability for the public and the taxpayer to know that their money is being spent appropriately and in line with common standards.


This bill also misses the opportunity to remove one of the many subsidies provided to the fossil fuel industry, which continues to be a bugbear with this government. These fossil fuel subsidies were estimated to amount to $7.7 billion of taxpayer funds in the 2016-17 financial year alone. It is well established that export credit agency funding for fossil fuel development should be considered a fossil fuel subsidy, as that funding is provided by the government. But of course we never hear an acknowledgement by the government of just how much Australian taxpayers' money is going to subsidise the fossil fuel industry, allowed by the federal government. Efic currently lacks policy guidance in these areas, and it is therefore not required to consider the carbon emissions associated with investments it supports. We believe that Efic should not be able to use taxpayer funds to subsidise the fossil fuel industry anymore. Of course, we're not happy with Australian taxpayer money being used to subsidise a mates-rates-type loan for Adani, and the last thing we want to see is the ability for Efic to fund more projects like this into the future.


As the world moves to address the crisis posed by climate change, and especially in the light of the Paris Agreement coming into force in 2016, the role of fossil fuel subsidies is increasingly under international scrutiny. We must end these polluting subsidies, and this is an opportunity to do that here today. That's why we'll be moving an amendment to ensure that Efic does not fund transactions that directly or indirectly support the extraction of fossil fuels in relation to the NAIF or any other agencies that Efic lends its expertise to.


One of the other issues in relation to this bill—and this was covered by Senator Carr extensively in his speech on the second reading—is of course the concerns in relation to offshoring of Australian workers' jobs overseas. We are concerned that this bill will result in further offshoring of Australian manufacturing positions and deprive companies that produce in Australia and in some cases give advantage to their competition in other countries.


I will be keen to see further clarification around the opposition's amendments when we get to committee stage, and we look forward to seeing if we can in some ways improve that aspect of the bill. We do know that the ACTU wrote that it could not agree with this part of the bill, because they feared it would make another blow to Australian manufacturing and the services sector. The Greens welcome the government's recognition of these concerns, but we are yet to see what true action will come from fixing it up in relation to that part of the bill.


Despite the possibility of some of these safeguards in relation to offshoring of jobs, the Greens will not and cannot support this bill as it stands. We have major concerns that the government has missed the opportunity to reform the accountability mechanisms and issues related to Efic. They've missed the ball. This was the bill to do that. We cannot continue to see and we will not support the continuation of such a secret organisation operating with huge amounts of taxpayer funds in the dark without the information being available to the parliament or, indeed, the taxpayer. We don't want to see further taxpayer funds spent on subsidising the fossil fuel industry.


For all of these reasons the Greens will not be supporting this bill.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2017-09-06,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (09:56):  I rise to make a contribution in respect of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Support for Commonwealth Entities) Bill 2017. I want to start off by saying that Labor does support the good work of Efic, but it's important to note that that's not without some concerns as to some aspects of its operation and with regard to proper scrutiny of the work of Efic. It's right and proper that the government plays a role to support our exporters by providing financial services where the private sector cannot, and Efic has played its part in supporting Australian jobs and growing our economy. It is to be commended for that.


It would appear that the government's been on a bit of a journey in respect of this issue. I note that in 2014 or thereabouts the government released a report of the National Commission of Audit that made a number of recommendations. At that point of time it was the view of the National Commission of Audit that Efic should cease to exist. That's a quite extraordinary recommendation from the National Commission of Audit, which generally is seen as reflecting fairly extreme right-wing views, but it's good to see that we still have Efic performing a function. But, as I say, it's not without the need for scrutiny.


And EFIC isn't without its flaws, as I indicated. I'm mindful that its processes in the past have let Australians down. So it's important that, when we look at legislation that amends Efic, we ensure that Efic does really deliver for everyday Australians. The Labor Party is committed to the objectives of growing our economy and creating more well-paying jobs here at home.


The bill seeks to amend the Efic Act in two ways. Labor support one of those amendments and will seek our own amendments to address concerns with the other ground of the Efic bill. The first part of the bill—the support for Commonwealth entities—expands Efic's function to include the provision of services to Commonwealth entities and companies, subject to the approval of the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment. This would allow Efic to offer its specialist financial capabilities in the operation and administration of Commonwealth financing programs where there is no connection to exports.


As it currently stands, there is only one other body that Efic can currently provide services to, and that is the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. I am the chair of the Senate Economics References Committee, and we are inquiring into the governance of the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. Some submissions have noted concerns in relation to the arrangements between Efic and NAIF, particularly that there is little public information provided about how Efic serves NAIF and that the processes governing this arrangement are robust. In the course of the proceedings of that inquiry we heard evidence from Professor Thomas Clarke, professor of corporate governance at the University of Technology Sydney. Professor Clarke talked about the fact that there was no effective transparency in the NAIF's governance framework, including in its project assessment and approval processes. He commented that it is unheard of for a publicly funded body to work in these conditions of absolute secrecy. He said all meetings, information and decisions are kept secret until they are approved, and the public is denied any knowledge of specific projects and who is proposing the projects. He said that this is not compatible with accountability and probity in public office, and neglects all established principles and protocols in public service in Australia and internationally.


We generally support the work of Efic. Of course, the issue of NAIF governance and operations is a question for the board of NAIF. One doesn't know the full extent of the advice given by Efic to NAIF in some of these issues, particularly in relation to due diligence arrangements. But there is a question mark as to what is happening with NAIF and the processes that are there to deal with applications that are coming before the NAIF. I must say that NAIF is certainly not a model of transparency that we would like to hold up for others to follow. This all goes to say that, while Efic does do good work, we know it is not perfect. We can't necessarily blame Efic for the decisions of the NAIF board, but there are some concerns that NAIF is not operating in a manner that Australians would like to see.


Generally, the first part of the bill is quite sensible and the Labor Party supports that. Enabling the government to deliver services in a more productive way makes a lot of sense. However, the second part of the bill has raised quite a few concerns. The Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee looked into this bill. It heard the concerns of the Australian Fair Trade and Investment Network and the ACTU that the bill might lead to Efic providing financing to companies that might offshore Australian jobs and remove incentives to produce or manufacture in Australia. So Labor has taken a constructive approach to improving the legislation so that not only are no Australian jobs lost in this process but there are assurances that Efic's finance is leading to net job increases here at home. I would like to thank the shadow minister for his work in tightening the amendments to ensure this happens. I also appreciate the minister working with Labor to improve this legislation. This is something that does not happen often enough in this place.


I note that the minister already has moved amendments to the original bill in the House of Representatives, which stipulated that, when applying for a loan or guarantee for the purpose of direct investment overseas, the person who carries on the business must certify in writing given to Efic that the person reasonably believes that the loan will result in a net increase in the number of people employed in Australia by the business or a related party of the business during the term of the loan. Labor supports this amendment, but it doesn't go far enough. There should be higher standards to make sure that a company has used an Efic loan or guarantee for its intended purpose and met all the requirements. We also know that what is promised and what is delivered do not always line up. When taxpayer funds are being used to assist companies, there is a responsibility for government and the parliament to make sure that Australian jobs are being created.


I now turn to the first amendment that Labor has proposed in respect of the Australian jobs test. Labor will move amendments to ensure that an Australian based business, if they are successful in receiving a loan or guarantee to be used for the dominant purpose of direct investment outside Australia, must provide Efic with certification as to whether a net job increase did occur in Australia as a result of Efic's financing at the completion of the loan or guarantee. This certification must also be publicly released by Efic. It makes a lot of sense for good governance that these results are made public. We do know that Efic has fallen short in the past, and measures like this help to tighten the governance framework. I also understand that the government will support this amendment and I want to thank the government for working with Labor to make this legislation stronger.


In relation to the second amendment that we propose, Labor is also concerned that an Efic loan or guarantee to an Australian based business for the purpose of direct investment overseas may be used to offshore existing parts of the Australian business. This may leave large numbers of Australians unemployed. Companies do this, but they shouldn't use taxpayer funds to do this. This is why Labor believes that an Efic loan or guarantee that is to be used by an Australian based company for the dominant purpose of direct investment outside Australia should not be used to offshore substantial parts of the business.


This was the position the shadow minister took to the minister: that an Efic loan or guarantee that is used for the dominant purpose of direct investment outside Australia should not be used to offshore substantial parts of the business. I understand the shadow minister met with Efic over the break and discussed the exact wording of the amendment, and it has been agreed that, for smaller businesses, there was a legitimate reason as to why some facilities may need to be sent overseas to help grow the business back here in Australia. Efic already defines a large business as one with a turnover of more than $150 million per annum. To ensure proper operation of Efic, Labor agreed that the proposed amendment should apply to businesses with more than $150 million turnover per annum. This is a sensible amendment, which will help to ensure taxpayers' funds are not used to offshore Australian jobs, while allowing for the growth of small and medium businesses.


So, in summary, these Labor amendments are completely consistent with the policy positions we have taken in a number of areas recently. It is important that creating good, secure, well-paying Australian jobs is foremost in the minds of elected officials here in Canberra. Whether it is a policy on apprentices, steel production, Labor's proposed Australian skills authority, the skill-up training fund, saying no to labour loopholes in trade deals or protecting penalty rates, Labor is leading the way on putting well-paid Australian jobs first.


However, when you look at the current government, it seems to be more based on a free market, de-regulated, 'You're on your own' ideology, rather than on sound policy. Whether it's on shipbuilding, 457s, Work for the Dole, the Youth Jobs PaTH intern program, slashing funding to TAFEs and universities, the slow rollout of the regional jobs packages or cutting penalty rates, you see a picture: the government isn't taking these issues seriously and the government isn't taking Australians seriously. And that is unacceptable. However, as long as the government adopts Labor's sensible amendments, which will put Australian jobs first, I will support this bill.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2017-09-06,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:09):  I support the second reading stages of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Support for Commonwealth Entities) Bill 2017, but I have real reservations about it. I believe it will be improved by the amendments that will be moved by the crossbench—by Senator Hanson-Young, particularly, in relation to FOI—and by the opposition in relation to the issue of Australian jobs. But it is important to make this point: at a point in time when manufacturing in Australia as a percentage of GDP has plunged by half in the last decade, and more than 200,000 local manufacturing jobs have been lost, this bill in its current form would introduce provisions that would see Efic being able to support Australian companies to set up manufacturing facilities offshore in preference to here at home. That is something that seriously concerns me. My understanding is that the government will agree to the opposition's amendments, and that is obviously welcome.


Whilst the committee report on this fairly drew out both the pros and cons of the impact this legislation would have, I believe it grossly underestimated the risks of this legislation in the context of an economic sector in a perilous condition. We know energy prices in this country are putting manufacturing at enormous risk. I will have more to say outside this chamber about AEMO later. I think AEMO have been abysmal in terms of their forecasting and in terms of their leadership in the energy sector because that impacts on manufacturing. In a sense, it does draw us back to this particular bill.


There are two key amendments. The first amendment seeks, in the words contained in the explanatory memorandum:


… to allow Efic to offer its specialist financial capabilities in the operation and administration of Commonwealth financing programs, where there is no connection to exports. Following Efic's provision of services to the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (""the NAIF""), Commonwealth departments have expressed interest in leveraging Efic's expertise.


On the face of it, this seems sensible. These are matters I've raised in estimates with Efic. It is taking a lot of resources in terms of the NAIF. There have been points raised by Jubilee Australia and the Australia Institute, particularly in relation to the dilution of focus. I think if we could get some assurances from the industry minister in relation to this, that would be very useful. Efic's annual report states:


Efic's primary purpose is to facilitate and encourage Australian export trade on a commercial basis. We provide financial support to Australian-based companies that are exporting, integral to a global supply chain or seeking to grow internationally.


The report also points out that the organisation compromises about 100 people. Any diversion of resource and function in such a small and focused organisation could only reasonably be expected to distract and prevent the organisation in respect of encouraging export trade. Exports are our lifeblood. The more we export, the better it is for the economy. I am a bit nervous that the Australian dollar is hovering just below 80 cents. I would prefer it to be way below that; around 70 or 75 cents seems to be a sweet spot for our exporters. So I want to be assured that Efic should and needs to remain tightly focused in facilitating export trade, and that is why I have been concerned about the first amendment. There are some transparency measures there. The FOI amendments by the Greens, I think, are good amendments and they ought to be supported to improve the legislation.


Now to the second amendment which I am concerned about. Under the current legislation, for a company to receive financial support from Efic, it needs to demonstrate there is some element of labour, goods and materials of Australian content. The level of Australian content in an export contract is an important factor in determining the amount of financial support that Efic provides. In essence, the higher the level of Australian content, the more financial support Efic can provide. The proposed unamended changes to the legislation seek to remove the local content requirement that invokes Efic's support and replace it with the need 'only for the benefit flowing back to Australia' to be present. That is incredibly imprecise, incredibly vague, and open to abuse. This creates a situation where Efic funding could be used to offshore a new manufacturing capability at the cost of Australian jobs.


The opposition's amendments are welcome, but I would put this question on notice—short notice—to the shadow industry minister, Senator Carr: what analysis has been done of these amendments in terms of preventing a bleeding of Australian jobs overseas in relation to that? I note the amendment. It is welcome, but I am still nervous about the fact that it could be rorted and that we could see money that Efic is providing—Australian taxpayers' money—go towards seeing jobs offshored, albeit with the stricter requirements in the amendments moved by the opposition.


Let's put this in context. This is not some esoteric argument I am raising. Australia's manufacturing sector has been in broad decline since 2008, with real output having contracted at every quarter since September 2011. Over 200,000 manufacturing jobs have disappeared since 2008, and the rate of job losses is accelerating. Employment in manufacturing fell six per cent in 2015 alone, and it's going to get much, much worse unless we deal with the energy crisis in this country. The fact that gas prices are double the price of Australian gas being sold in Japan, notwithstanding the liquefaction, the regasification and the transport of gas to Japan, means there is something seriously awry with our gas market in this country.


The impact it has had on manufacturers that rely on gas has been devastating. When new contracts come up, a lot of manufacturers will put their hands up and say, 'Do we want to do business in Australia?' That concerns me. I know there have been some measures, which I welcome, from the government, but this is an existential crisis for manufacturing in this country, so I don't want to make it worse with what this bill is proposing. These amendments from the opposition, which I understand the government is supporting, will at least help to ameliorate that concern. That is my concern, and that is something that should be explored in the committee stages of this bill.


Some of the submitters made the point that the loosening of the Efic reins may assist companies to set up marketing promotions offshore. While these sort of initiatives must be encouraged and supported by government, there are other programs better suited to marketing such as the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. To pull the Efic lever to facilitate promotion is to pull the wrong lever, and that is why I still have serious concerns about this bill. The amendments moved and the concessions by the government are welcome. But I will still reserve my position in the third reading stages of this bill, because I would not want to see Efic, an arm of government funded by taxpayers that is meant to encourage Australian exports and, by extension, Australian jobs and the growth of our economy, to be used as a Trojan Horse to fund the expansion of manufacturing overseas. That, to me, is a bridge too far and should not be supported. With those words, I support the second reading stage of this bill. I believe the bill can be improved in the committee stage, but I still have serious reservations about it.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (10:17):  I rise to speak on the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Support for Commonwealth Entities) Bill 2017. Have you got a good business idea? Have the banks refused your requests for a loan? Then get a loan from the government; it's getting back into the banking business. It has got the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which will provide you with a loan if you tell the public servants that your business idea will save the climate. The Abbott government had wanted to abolish this green bank, but after the Senate rejected the idea and we got a new Prime Minister, the government is now an enthusiastic supporter.


The government wants to establish the Regional Investment Corporation, which will provide you with a loan if you tell the public servants that if you don't get a concessional loan your farm will be taken over by a larger, more-efficient farmer—we just couldn't have that. Now, the government is expanding the role of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, so it doesn't just provide loans. If you've got a business idea relating to the exporting of manufactured goods that no bank will touch, now the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, through this bill, will offer loans. If you've got a business idea relating to tourism but can't get a loan from a bank because they assess your idea as bonkers, all you need to do is point out to the public servants that some of the tourists you hope for will be foreigners.


The same applies if you've got an idea for an online business. If you point out to the public servants that some of the online customers you hope for will be foreigners, you're in. If your idea relates to intellectual property, and no bank thinks it's worth a pinch of salt, then you're in luck too, provided you point out to the public servants that some foreigners might use your intellectual property. You'll even be able to get a loan from the government's Export Finance and Insurance Corporation if you want to invest overseas, provided you mention to the public servants that some indirect benefit will flow back to Australia. So what are you waiting for? If you want a loan and the banks have knocked you back, there's a government bank that's ready to hand you some taxpayers' cash. Commercial viability is no longer a prerequisite. All you need is to have an idea that suits the political breeze.


I hear the cynics out there pooh-poohing this development. They say that government banking makes us poorer by diverting cash to ideas that aren't as profitable as the ideas supported by commercial banks. They say that, when loans turn bad, government banking makes unwilling taxpayers instead of willing bank shareholders take the hit. They also make annoying references to the history of government banks—but it will be different this time, somehow! I don't think it will come as a surprise that the Liberal Democrats oppose the establishment of government banks, which make us all poorer. I will be opposing this bill. Unfortunately, I'll probably be alone in doing so.

"Sinodinos, Sen Arthur",LP,2017-09-06,"



Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales—Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science) (10:20):  Let me begin by thanking the senators for their contributions to the debate on the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Support for Commonwealth Entities) Bill 2017. The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, Efic, plays an important role in supporting the growth of Australian exporters, with a focus on small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs. Efic delivers simple and creative finance solutions for Australian exporters. Efic provided 130 Australian SME exporters with over $150 million in support in 2016-17. This government wants to make it easier for Australian exporters to access Efic's support for jobs and growth, which hopefully will lead to higher wages as well. We need to foster an environment where Australia's exporters can grow. As it stands, the bill will look to do this by improving Efic's support for businesses who cannot obtain private sector finance to expand their reach overseas.


To address a point made by Senator Leyonhjelm: Efic are addressing a gap in the market, particularly when it comes to smaller enterprises wanting to expand overseas who may not have a great track record in the private sector here. Private banks may not be willing to finance their exports overseas, so Efic do fill a gap. Yes, they do take a risk. It's possible that some of these firms may not work out, but it is a gap in the marketplace that facilities like Efic are seeking to fill.


This bill will enable Efic to lend directly to an expanded range of Australian exporters and will ensure Efic's support for overseas direct investment results in more jobs in Australia. The evidence is very clear that Australian companies that export abroad are more productive, pay higher wages and, in that sense, make a premium contribution to the Australian economy. This bill prioritises the needs of a wider range of small and medium-sized enterprises across Australia to grow exports and jobs and expand their presence overseas, including tourism operators, online businesses and exporters of intellectual property and other related rights. In particular, we want to be able to keep the intellectual property here, but also to use it as a platform for exports.


This government responded to issues raised during the Senate committee review process by passing amendments in the House which have been noted and which legislate a net-positive jobs test for overseas direct investments and maintain local content requirements. The net-positive employment stipulation for Efic support for overseas direct investment means businesses will have to certify in writing their reasonable belief that Efic's support for overseas direct investment will result in a net increase to the number of people employed in Australia. I understand the opposition will shortly move two amendments to build upon this. One amendment will ensure Efic publicly discloses the business certification. This requirement is an extension of Efic's existing policy to publish the details of its high-level commercial transactions. We have no objection to this. The second opposition amendment will ensure large businesses with annual revenue of $150 million or more certify to Efic that they will not move all or a substantial part of their business overseas as a result of Efic's support for an overseas direct investment transaction. The idea that Australian taxpayers would be subsidising the offshoring of Australian jobs is clearly something that would not go down well with the Australian public. This requirement codifies Efic's existing policy to ensure its support for overseas direct investment will not result in plant closure or net job losses in Australia, and again we have no objections to this.


With around 100 employees today, Efic operates in the financial services sector with experience and specialist expertise regarding finance arrangements. This bill enables Efic's expertise to be made available to a wide range of commonwealth entities and companies on a fee-for-service basis beyond its current work for the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, subject to ministerial approval. This government responded to issues raised during the senate committee review process by passing amendments in the House to require Efic to charge fees for any services provided to Commonwealth entities and companies. In this way, additional resources will be provided to Efic so that Efic's support for SMEs remains undiminished. Australia's exporters are among the best businesses in this country. This bill will enable us to help even more of them receive the financial support they need to win business, employ more Australians, grow internationally and achieve export success. I commend the bill to the Senate.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:34):  I have some questions for the minister. Minister, I referred in my second reading contribution to the appointment of Annabelle Chaplain to the Efic board. I want to go to the specifics in relation to her appointment. She's now resigned, of course. Was the minister aware of Ms Chaplain's roles with Downer EDI and Queensland Airports Limited when considering her term on the Efic board, prior to her shock resignation?

Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales—Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science) (10:34):  I'd have to seek further information. But I would make the point that, in relation to the person concerned, if you're talking about a possible conflict between Efic and NAIF in this regard, please understand that Efic is a service provider to the NAIF and provides no sort of decision-making role and does not in any way dictate what the NAIF should or should not do.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:35):  Efic was advising NAIF from its inception in July 2017, despite one of its board members, Annabelle Chaplain, having clear conflicts of interest. She was, Minister, just for your information, responsible for overseeing NAIF's project assessment under Efic, as well as on the board of companies that would benefit from NAIF projects, such as the Adani rail line. Is the minister aware of the roles that Ms Chaplain held besides being on the board of Efic?

Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales—Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science) (10:35):  My understanding is based on what information was publicly available at the time—that there were some reports about various roles this particular person occupied. But I believe in all circumstances the matter's been well handled, and the person involved is no longer there.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:36):  When did Efic executives become aware that there might be a personal conflict of interest between Ms Chaplain in the assessment of projects applying for NAIF funds, such as Adani?

Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales—Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science) (10:36):  You're now asking me a more detailed series of questions on a matter which is not directly relevant to the bill here. I'm happy to take a series of questions on notice and have them answered for you, but I believe it would be in the interests of all of us to focus on the substance of what is in this bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Support for Commonwealth Entities) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2017-09-06,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:36):  One of the reasons this is important is the lack of transparency within Efic—the fact that it is exempt from FOI and it operates in a very secretive manner. There have been conflicts of interest for Efic board members. Ms Chaplain's appointment was ended abruptly. I believe it is relevant to this bill, because you are asking the parliament to accept an expansion of powers and roles for Efic, despite the fact that currently there is a cloud over the way the organisation runs and how it handles potential conflicts of interest for board members. That's why.


I'm happy to put each of these questions to you, and, if you can answer, that would be great; if you need to take them on notice, that is your right, of course. But, just to be clear, I think these questions are directly related to this issue, because you are asking the parliament to accept an expanded role for this organisation, but what we have here is one example of a woman who has been on the board of Efic who had conflicts of interest, and I'd like to know how Efic managed this conflict of interest from the word go.


If you could take on notice, Minister, when Efic executives first become aware of a potential conflict of interest for Ms Chaplain in the assessment of projects applying for NAIF funds, that would be helpful. I'd also like to know, Minister, what actions were taken by Efic to avoid this conflict, or the perception of it. And I hope that is something that you could provide to us today because, going forward, we need to know that Efic has proper processes in place to deal with potential or perceived conflicts of interest.

"Sinodinos, Sen Arthur",LP,2017-09-06,"



Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales—Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science) (10:38):  The first point is this: Efic has a policy to manage conflicts, and that policy would have been applied in this particular case. The other point to make is that this organisation is subject, I believe, to a higher degree of public scrutiny than any so-called private bank, because of budget estimates, for example, and other processes of government. So I am satisfied that, subject to things like commercial-in-confidence requirements and the rest, this is an organisation that meets appropriate levels of transparency and openness. I'll have more to say about particular amendments that the senator wants to run in relation to FOI exemption in a second, when that matter is raised, but I'll leave it there for now.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:39):  Could the minister please give an explanation as to why Ms Chaplain resigned from the board and why her tenure on the board expired much earlier than originally planned? She was meant to be on the board until 2019. Why was her tenure short-lived?

Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales—Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science) (10:40):  In the interests of natural justice for the person you've named, I will find out the exact circumstances in which she resigned and provide that to you. Again, I make the point that we're here today to deal with a forward-looking set of propositions to help Efic do its job even better in the future. The reality is that Efic has policies in place to manage these conflicts. Efic needs to exist because overseas bodies exist in this space—export credit agencies. We often hear complaints from Australian companies that they want assistance from the Australian government to be able to compete against overseas suppliers, who get the support of their governments on major contracts. The main benefit would come back to Australia in terms of contracts and orders.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:41):  Following the same line of questioning as Senator Hanson-Young, we know that Efic has a very flawed track record when it comes to supporting large resource projects. We know that it supported the Wiggins Island Coal Export Terminal, which has performed really poorly. I understand that Senator Hanson-Young has mentioned other projects. The Productivity Commission review in 2012 found a wide range of concerns. Can you just outline to me why we shouldn't address those concerns first, before we grant additional powers to Efic to assist more agencies?

Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales—Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science) (10:42):  The point I would make is this: Efic is a learning organisation. When it has done things in the past, it's gone back to review them to work out what has worked and what hasn't worked, and we go from there. This particular bill, and what it does here, in part reflects those sorts of lessons from previous experience. Some of the examples you throw up are examples where the evidence may well be contested and the conclusions may be contested. It's important for us to understand that you or I may have a particular view about the role of Efic in a particular resource project, because we may have a view about that particular resource, but that should not cloud whether we therefore have a positive view about whether Efic is operating in an appropriate way in dealing with the matter.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:43):  I suppose I'm not talking specifically about the investments. I'm now talking specifically about the Productivity Commission's review, which did express a wide range of concerns. So it's not a question of whether we support the areas that Efic is investing in. On that, has the Productivity Commission looked at Efic's governance since it responded to the 2012 review? Has there been another look by the Productivity Commission at what Efic is doing? Or, if they haven't, has the Auditor-General, for example?

Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales—Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science) (10:43):  In relation to the Productivity Commission, I don't believe they have. In relation to the Auditor-General, they have an ongoing brief. The Auditor-General can, at any time, decide to examine an organisation or a particular set of projects or proposals. That's a matter for the Auditor-General.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2017-09-06,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:44):  Is the government contemplating opening up Efic to FOI requests, so that we can get a better understanding? It's a black box at the moment. There are claims and counter claims, as you say, but that is in large part because of the secrecy under which Efic operates. Is any consideration being given to opening up FOI requests, so that we get a better understanding of how Efic is governed and how decisions are made?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Support for Commonwealth Entities) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Sinodinos, Sen Arthur",LP,2017-09-06,"



Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales—Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science) (10:44):  Efic does have an exemption from FOI. It is limited. It relates essentially to transactional matters under parts 4 and 5 of the Efic Act. The reason for the exemption is to protect commercial-in-confidence information provided by the client. Clearly exporters will not want to provide commercially sensitive information to a financial institution that could be made public through FOI. Efic's long-held view is that the current Efic-specific exemption provides administrative certainty to Efic regarding its obligations and greater certainty to clients about its ability to maintain confidential information without which the quality of information provided to Efic may be prejudiced and Efic's ability to make informed decisions on the risks of transactions it considered supporting impaired. In turn, that would increase the risks and potentially the costs to taxpayers.


Efic's current FOI exemption is consistent with the banker's common law duty of confidentiality to clients and has been established for nearly 100 years. I would add, though, that on top of that Efic is subject to estimates and other processes of government. So there are a number of ways in which we can examine the structure and governance of the organisation. But in relation to information about particular transactions, as I indicated here, the FOI exemption is an extension of the common law doctrine of protecting financial privacy, and it is consistent with and is followed in every common law jurisdiction, including Australia.

Are there going to be more staff employed? Is there a move to decentralise where necessary? The example I give is that Efic is providing significant support to the NAIF and yet it hasn't located one staff member to northern Australia.

(c) if the business is a large business—the person who carries on the business must certify, by writing given to EFIC, that the loan will not be used to move the whole or asubstantial part of the business, or of a related party of the business, overseas; and


(d) EFIC must ensure that it publicly discloses copies of the certification it receives under subsection (4)(b).


I will make some preliminary remarks in regard to some matters that were raised in the second reading debate. Efic, of course, has provided an extremely valuable service to this country since 1957. It's a very substantive role. I am unashamedly a supporter of public intervention when it comes to access to finance. I'm surprised the Greens are not. When it comes to manufacturers in the country today, when you talk to manufacturers, they will talk to you about two major problems they face, which are the price of energy and access to finance. We know that for exporters there is a particular difficulty when it comes to our financial institutions. Of course, by and large they have been privatised, have been deregulated, and as a consequence they're probably the most profitable in the world. But, when it comes to their social responsibilities, I think we have ample cause to see why we need a royal commission into our banks. We do have clear and unequivocal examples where, time after time, our banking system has failed to meet its social and economic obligations to the development of this country, whereas Efic, since 1957, has provided support to manufacturers and a range of enterprises—small, large and medium-sized enterprises—in accessing finance that quite often is simply not available through commercial means.


Senator Leyonhjelm says, 'If it's not available from the commercial sector, well, it's not good enough.' That's not the case. That's not the reality. That's not the economic reality of how businesses is actually done. I can talk directly of experiences I had with General Motors Holden, as an example. I don't normally discuss matters relating to Efic but the matter is now public. General Motors Holden, during the global economic crisis, had been banking with the Commonwealth Bank for 60 years in this country. But the banking system in this country said, 'Oh well, we're not interested in this area because the risks are too great,' and withdrew their financial support for one of the leading companies in this country at the time. There was no access to finance through commercial means, and it was Efic that filled that gap, met that market failure. It became public because of the extraordinarily unethical arrangements that had been entered into between the then Leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Turnbull, and Mr Godwin Grech. As a consequence of those arrangements, these matters became a matter of public record. In those circumstances General Motors Holden were obliged to enter into arrangements with Efic. The risk was taken on under the national account, which meant it was actually a cabinet decision. But it was properly evaluated by Efic, and the consequences were that, at a very high rate of interest, a premium rate of interest, General Motors were able to secure a line of credit that they couldn't get anywhere else. It turned out that they didn't need to use it. They had to have it; otherwise they could well have gone belly up. They didn't actually need to call upon it. That is an example of what an extraordinarily important service this agency has provided.


Of course, we see them in so many other areas. Whether it be in regard to companies that have operated in the area of engineering or companies that have developed new technologies for export, whether it be in manufacturing, whether it be in the resources sector, whether it be in construction—right across the economy—Efic have played an extraordinarily important role. Traditionally it was a role that was played by what used to be the publicly owned banks through the development agencies they had available. Private banks aren't much interested in this. Think about what's happened throughout regional Australia: you can't get access to finance under the present financial system for so many aspects of the economy.


When it comes to exports, I think the minister is quite correct to point to the fact that, by international standards, other competing economies provide these services to their enterprises. It is only fitting that we're able to do so. The circumstances that we now face are: what are the conditions under which these arrangements are made? That's why these bills are so important. What we have here in these amendments provides a means by which we are actually strengthening accountability. That's why we're moving these amendments. Efic has provided assistance to—I think one minister said there was $150 million in last year's accounts, 194 transactions valued at $390 million in total. It supported 149 export contracts worth $1.4 billion—a very substantial contribution.


So the question that concerns us is: how do we make sure that this resource is not made available to actually facilitate the offshoring of jobs and capabilities? My colleague Mr Jason Clare has been able to negotiate very strong improvements in this bill with Mr Ciobo. I congratulate both of them for undertaking that work. I acknowledge the government's work in this regard in acknowledging that the bill could in fact be strengthened as a consequence of these amendments that I am moving, which require Efic to provide additional measures of accountability from the companies that are seeking assistance.


Regarding questions raised by Senator Xenophon, perhaps I can deal with that now—I trust he's paying attention, because I don't intend to pursue this at any great length other than through this contribution now. I point out to Senator Xenophon that the principles underlying these amendments—and we don't have the resources of government to be able to say yes; we've got an empirical study to back these up., but the philosophical principles underpinning these amendments—are that applicants must provide a certification at the beginning and at the end of any particular project as to the net job increases as a result of the particular project that was the basis of the loan. This is information that must be made public. The essential proposition is that to grow jobs in Australia, and where there is a need to move some facilities offshore—and we acknowledge that this happens; there are those who suggest that if we say 'made in Australia' then every single component has to be made in Australia, but that's a nonsense—in a globalised world, you will have some elements and some capacities that will need to be undertaken in other parts of the world. But the net impact will be in firms with over $150 million per annum. The net impact will be positive and that will have to be demonstrated in terms of the intention of the project, both before and after.


Finally, in regard to the criticisms of Efic in regard to any particular project, fancy calling on the Productivity Commission as an example—exemplar!—of any assessment of manufacturing in this country. In my opinion, they should have been privatised a long time ago. That would've been the first thing that could've been done to assist manufacturing in this country. We could've cut out the middle man, taken the position straight out from the IPA, and, I think, saved the public a lot of money. But to suggest that the Productivity Commission would be the paragon of virtue when it comes to assessing public enterprise in this country—I find that highly amusing coming from those great left-wing advocates, the Greens. To suggest that somehow or other Efic is responsible for what has been undertaken by the project managers in another jurisdiction is really stretching credulity. They are the providers of finance. That does not make them responsible for the management of a particular project any more than the Commonwealth Bank became responsible for the management of my household when I took out a mortgage with them. It's a nonsense to suggest that there's a direct link between the management of a project and the provision of finance.

(

Question agreed to.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Support for Commonwealth Entities) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2017-09-06,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (11:00):  by leave—I move Australian Greens amendments (1) to (3) on sheet 8206 together:


(1) Schedule 1, page 4 (after line 3), after item 4, insert:




4A


At the end of subsection


8(2)



Add:


(c) ensure it is not funding transactions that, directly or indirectly, support the extraction of fossil fuels (including in relation to EFIC's Northern Australia economic infrastructure functions).


   (2) Schedule 1, item 6A, page 4 (after line 27), at the end of section 16, add:


(5) In addition, EFIC must not make a guarantee or enter into a contract under this section in relation to a loan or a proposed loan if the loan or the proposed loan is to be used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of extracting fossil fuels.


   (3) Schedule 1, item 6B, page 5 (after line 7), at the end of section 23, add:


(5) In addition, EFIC must not lend money under this section for the purpose of financing a transaction if the purpose of the transaction is to extract fossil fuels.


The Australian Greens have circulated two sets of amendments. The first set, which I have just moved, is in relation to putting a restriction on Efic's ability to use its expertise and to fund further subsidies for the fossil fuel industry. We are, of course, very concerned that, despite a number of issues that Efic could and should be spending its time on in relation to other types of export projects, and advancing ability for Australian industry, the last thing we should have is more Australian taxpayer money being spent on propping up the fossil fuel industry in this country. We hear over and over again from the Turnbull government—from many on the backbench, but particularly from those on the frontbench—that the fossil fuel industry doesn't get any subsidies and, indeed, that it's only the renewable energy sector that does. Well, what a load of bollocks. It's not true. We know that billions and billions of dollars, Australian taxpayer dollars, go every year into subsidising the fossil fuel industry in this country.


These amendments are in relation to stopping more Australian taxpayer money being spent to prop up the fossil fuel industry. At a time when we need to be reducing carbon emissions, at a time when we need to be finding better ways to reach our Paris agreement targets and at a time when we need to be transitioning to cleaner forms of energy, spending billions and billions of dollars and Commonwealth government resources on propping up and subsidising the fossil fuel industry is just madness—absolutely crazy stuff. We hear all the time from members of the Turnbull government that the renewable energy sector is propped up and subsidised. Well, it is subsidised nowhere near to the extent that the fossil fuel industry gets subsidised by the taxpayer day in and day out. Through this bill we have the opportunity for it to be expanded and propped up and subsidised even more, and the Australian Greens don't want to see that happen. We don't want to see more Australian taxpayer money wasted, propping up an industry when the time has come for transition.


Only yesterday Senator McGrath stood up in this place and said, 'Coal is good' and sat down. That is the level of maturity from this government in relation to tackling carbon emissions and, indeed, tackling a failing fossil fuel industry. We know that we must transition in order to save the planet, that we must put renewable energy on a firm footing, because that is what is going to be needed to power the nation in the future. In fact, it's working right now. The craziness of the push within the Turnbull government to say now that they are prepared to pay to keep coal-fired power stations burning even longer, polluting even longer, for more and more years, just because the Turnbull government doesn't have the gumption to take on this industry and the gumption to take on the right-wing rump in the backbench and, of course, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott. This is the level of madness and the lack of maturity that is coming from this government. If we can try and save some Australian taxpayer money through this process to stop Efic funding being used to prop up the fossil fuel industry, then we should.


It doesn't make financial sense; it doesn't make environmental sense and it is ridiculous to see, at a time when we need to be decarbonising the economy, more backdoor ways of giving subsidies to the fossil fuel industry. That's what this amendment is about. Anyone who cares about reducing carbon emissions and ensuring that taxpayer money is spent in the places where we will get the best bang for our buck in terms of energy and resource production should be supporting this amendment. Wasting Efic's resources and Efic funding to prop up the coal industry, to prop up the corrupt project that is Adani, is simply not good enough.


We know that the Adani coalmine will only be able to go ahead if the Australian taxpayer funds a billion dollars and even then it's questionable. The banks won't bankroll it because it doesn't make economic sense. The planet would cook if we allowed the Adani mine to dig as much coal out of the ground as it wants to ship off and have burnt. We will not be able to fulfil the Paris Agreement; we will not be able to fulfil the very necessary requirements to decarbonise the economy, and all at the cost of the Australian taxpayer. The billon dollars that the dodgy, corrupt Adani company wants, the billion dollar mates-rates loan, should not go ahead. It's being facilitated via Efic and the NAIF, and it is a waste of Australian taxpayers' money.


Most people out there are thinking, 'Hang on, we're doing it pretty tough. We've got low wages growth; we've got high unemployment; the cost of living continues to soar; the government says it has to cut funding to schools and hospitals. Meanwhile, we have this government agency handing over a billion dollars to Indian coal company Adani. Where are the government's priorities?' Well, the priorities are propping up and subsidising fossil fuels, propping up and subsidising Adani. Meanwhile, schools don't get the funding they need; hospitals don't get the funding they need. We have an NBN across this country that is not being rolled out as fast and as well as it should be because the government hasn't got the funding to do it. Meanwhile, Adani continues to laugh and know that it's pulled the wool over the eyes of the federal government.


We're waiting for a decision on whether this loan will go ahead, because we now have the peculiar situation where the minister who is in charge of this sits in the other place—this is, of course, Minister Joyce—with a big cloud over his head. We don't even know if he's eligible to be in the parliament, let alone eligible to be a minister, yet this is the person who is responsible for signing off and handing over a billion dollars of Australian taxpayer money to Indian coal miner Adani. It's a waste of money and a decision of a minister who's not even legitimate.


I can bet your bottom dollar, Chair, that, if Minister Joyce does sign off on this project and does give the taxpayer handout—the corporate welfare cheque to Adani—it will be challenged in the courts because not only is it economically irresponsible but also the minister in charge should not even be there. So this whole issue becomes even murkier and murkier. One of the things we can do today is stop Efic and, therefore, the NAIF from being able to continue to prop up, with public funds, the fossil-fuel industry. In particular, we can stop the NAIF from being able to fund the billion-dollar cheque to Adani.


When you hear cries for the need for economic responsibility, mutual obligation and the crackdown and the kicking of people on welfare payments from this government, you've got to wonder what on earth is going on when we can't help unemployed people in this country to get enough income support so that they can get a job, but we're happy to hand out corporate welfare to one of the biggest, greediest and dodgiest mining companies in the world. That, of course, is the Adani Carmichael coalmine. I commend this amendment to the Senate and will be watching very closely to see who supports it.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Support for Commonwealth Entities) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Sinodinos, Sen Arthur",LP,2017-09-06,"



Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales—Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science) (11:11):  I've already addressed the issue of the Greens amendment on the removal of the FOI exemption. I will say, in relation to removing Efic's ability to support fossil fuels, that we will also be opposing this amendment. Efic provides support to Australian exporters where private financial institutions are unable or unwilling to support—in other words, where there is a gap. It is not for the purposes of subsidising. It would be an unprecedented step for a government to legislate to ban the financing of a product that, the last time I looked, is beneficial, legal and a major export earner for the country. Furthermore, the broad sweep of the language in the amendment, directly or indirectly, would even stop Efic financing SME-equipment suppliers to coal-export projects and potentially go much broader than that, so we will not be supporting this amendment.


Let me make the point that issues to do with emissions and the control of greenhouse-gas emissions and the like, pursuant to our strong commitments under the Paris Agreement, are a separable issue to whether support is provided to a coal project within Australia. The other point I will make is that, when Efic finances overseas projects relating to coal or support of SME suppliers of coal, it adheres to OECD arrangements on export credit disciplines and on coal-fired power plants which came into effect in January this year and is bound by the OECD recommendation of the Council on Common Approaches for Officially Supported Export Credits and Environmental and Social Due Diligence. Efic also adheres to the Equator Principles, which is a globally recognised benchmark to manage environmental and social risk in projects. For these reasons, we will not be supporting this amendment or the other amendment.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Support for Commonwealth Entities) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2017-09-06,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (11:13):  Can I address both sets of amendments, although I understand that Senator Sarah Hanson-Young has yet to move the amendments on sheet 8207. The opposition will not be supporting either set of amendments. On sheet 8206, there are questions that go to the banning of the resources project's support. The definitions, frankly, as outlined in these amendments, that specifically refer directly or indirectly are far too broad. With regard to the impact, it would lead to a significant loss of jobs for Australian workers, and it would undermine supply-chain companies that are currently operating within the industry. They're operating in terms of the suppliers to the mining industry. It will also undermine professional services companies operating within the resources sector as well. So for either those engineering companies that supply the resources sector or the professional services companies that are currently within the remit of the ethics charter, it is inappropriate that they should be excluded from that.


The current arrangements that Efic operates on were, in fact, outlined in a letter that former minister Andrew Robb distributed back in 2014, which I understand remains in force. It points out that Efic does not provide support for onshore resources projects and related infrastructure, given the private sector is active in that part of the market. In essence, the way Efic operates is that it provides finance where there is a gap—I think that's the word they use—in the market and so Efic is able to provide support for projects that involve suppliers to domestic resource projects that have an export component. However, that arrangement remains in force. We, the opposition, believe that strikes the right balance, where there is a market gap and where it helps to create Australian jobs.


In regard to the second proposition by Senator Hanson-Young on FOI matters, we are more sympathetic. We understand the intention of the amendments, and there is always an amendment in regard to transparency when it comes to public funds. However, there is also a need to ensure that Efic is able to do its job properly, and there is a legitimate issue here about genuine commercial-in-confidence matters. Efic is not there to provide commercial advantage to others that are competing with its operations or those that are applying to it for support. It would be a ludicrous proposition if, under FOI, competitors for a particular project could secure commercially sensitive materials and then use them against a competitor.


While we are sympathetic to the intention of providing more public information about the operations of public enterprise, we do not want to support the unintended consequences of crippling public enterprise—which would be the consequence of these amendments as they are put forward. We are more than happy to work with other parties in this chamber about ensuring greater transparency, but we will not be supporting these amendments. 



The CHAIR:  The question is that items (1) to (3) on sheet 8206 be agreed to.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Support for Commonwealth Entities) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2017-09-06,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (11:25):  The remaining amendment is on sheet 8207. This is in relation to removing the exemption that Efic currently has in relation to freedom of information requests. I did speak about this at length during the second reading speech and in the questions to the minister previously at the committee stage. I just want to reiterate that this bill is asking the parliament to endorse expanding the powers, responsibilities and role of Efic; meanwhile, we know that there are big questions over Efic's ability to be straight and up-front with the parliament and the Australian people about the projects that it has already been funding and supporting. You'd think that, if the government honestly wanted to expand the role of Efic, they would get Efic's house in order first. They've missed the opportunity to do that.


This amendment injects necessary transparency into this process. If we're going to have an expanded role then the public, the parliament and the taxpayers need to know what Efic is doing, what types of projects it is funding and how it is operating. I've heard the minister already today say that Efic has more transparency than a private bank. Okay: it's a Commonwealth agency, it is Australian taxpayers' money, so it should. But what we see in reality is that every time there are questions to Efic from this place, in Senate estimates and through other avenues available to us as senators, about what Efic has done—issues in relation to projects that it has supported, how it gets to the due diligence stage for projects such as the Adani coalmine and the associated rail line—Efic pulls the non-disclosure card. It continues to duck and weave on genuine questions that should be answered. If there's nothing to hide, what is the problem?


While we've heard that there are genuine commercial-in-confidence issues in relation to companies, that is the excuse that always gets dragged out when government agencies don't want to be straight with the Australian people. That's what is constantly used as the catch-all excuse for not being transparent and for allowing secrecy to rule. It just doesn't cut it. These are billions of dollars that are not just there willy-nilly; this is the Australian people's money. They deserve to know. There needs to be an increased level of scrutiny and accountability, because these are public funds. Not only is Efic caught up in backing projects that have created instability in parts of the region, such as PNG or the South Pacific, in relation to Bougainville, and other areas but we also know that every time you ask Efic about why they made these decisions, what risk analysis they used, whether they considered the social, economic and political impacts, and how they missed that some of these terrible consequences would roll out in places like PNG, for example, in relation to the ExxonMobil project, you get nothing back.


Efic don't want to talk about these things. They pull the 'we don't know and we can't tell you' card. We need to break open what is a secretive and what has become an incredibly opaque organisation. This is a public institution. They are using public funds and the voters have a right to know. What we now see, as Efic moves into funding domestic based projects, such as in relation to the Adani Carmichael mine, is that the public have an increased desire to know why those decisions are being made. Who is making those decisions? What due diligence is being done? And yet, over and over again, we get nothing out of the bureaucrats who sit within the Efic framework, because of the ridiculously strict exemption in relation to freedom of information. We need to reform this. I'm not, as a matter of principle, opposed at all to the original intentions for what Efic was meant to do, but I fear that Efic has moved substantially away from its intended mandate. It has done that under a cloud of secrecy and it now has an opaque framework. Australian taxpayers have every right to be concerned. 


Of course, it suits other government agencies, such as the NAIF, to be able to rely on the secret nature of Efic so that they don't have to maintain reasonable levels of transparency and respond to reasonable questions, whether they are questions from senators in this place, members from the other place, or, indeed, the public. We know that the NAIF has used the cover of Efic secrecy to not be straight about what is going on and why decisions are being made. No-one has been able to articulate why on earth Adani is even being considered for a billion-dollar public subsidy, when the Adani company themselves have said they don't need it; it's just that it's available. That means they should not meet the criteria. Why are they still sitting there like a puppy dog on the lap, begging for loose change—loose change that is costing the Australian taxpayer a billion dollars? 


I saw the Prime Minister in his press conference just now refer to the fact that burning coal has never been so profitable. That's what the Prime Minister has just said today: burning coal has never been so profitable. I guess if you're funding and subsidising the coal industry with billions of dollars of Australian taxpayer money, anything could become profitable. What a load of gobbledygook. This government is so desperate to prop up the fossil fuel industry and the coal industry in this country that they not only allow Australian taxpayer money to roll out the door; they know that the public won't be happy, so they do it through this secretive, opaque mechanism. We need to blow this open. I think it's ridiculous that the government comes here asking this place to give Efic more powers yet less accountability, and makes no effort to clean up the lack of transparency that we all know is rank within the current Efic set-up. I commend the amendment to the House.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:35):  I indicate that my colleagues and I strongly support this amendment moved by Senator Hanson-Young in relation to FOI. I know the minister expressed a concern that the ability to FOI Efic will compromise confidentiality inherent in banking. Whilst I appreciate the need for confidentiality in business where appropriate, I point out that such information is protected by exemptions in the FOI Act, namely section 47G, and other exemptions in the FOI Act will also apply. So, noting the protection that the FOI Act affords businesses, I and my colleagues will vote in favour of the Greens amendment, which promotes greater transparency.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2017-09-06,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (09:32):  The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Support for Commonwealth Entities) Bill 2016 contains two main changes to the act. The first change is an administrative one. It allows the government's agency to use Efic expertise on the basis of a fee-for-service arrangement. This is not controversial and the opposition supports it. The second makes it easier for Efic to lend money to companies wanting to expand their offshore operations. Ideally, this would allow Australian companies to take advantage of trading opportunities, therefore benefiting the Australian economy. However, an earlier version of this bill would have also made it easier for Efic to lend money to a company wanting to relocate its manufacturing operations offshore or to set up a call centre overseas. I can assure you, given my recent experience with Telstra's call centres in the Philippines and in India, no-one could possibly want to have that happen. It was truly an appalling experience to see how those facilities, which were moved from Australia to the Philippines and India, have left an appalling level of service for Australian customers of Telstra. I'm glad to see the government moved amendments in the other place that reduced that risk. I see the government has indicated it will accept further amendments, which the Labor Party will be proposing, to further reduce that risk.


Efic's internal policy stipulates that any loan that a corporation provides must not result in a net loss of jobs in Australia. Labor does not believe this in itself is a sufficient safeguard. We believe that taxes paid by Australians should be used for the benefit of Australians. It's a fundamental Labor value that Australian jobs should be put first, and that's why we moved to refer this bill to a committee of inquiry. It was necessary to check whether the changes in Efic's role would have had unintended damaging consequences.


The committee heard evidence from a range of community groups that share Labor's concerns about this bill. In its submission, for instance, the Australian Fair Trade and Investment Network said:


It is a reasonable and in fact modest requirement that firms receiving support from Efic actually produce goods and/or services in Australia and employ Australians … In the absence of such a requirement, there would be no incentive for firms receiving Efic loans to have any Australian content. This would lead to the perverse situation of an Australian government institution being able to provide support for firms providing no employment in Australia.


It said:


The removal of local content requirements from the legislation would enable firms based in Australia but providing no local employment to have access to Efic support. It would provide no incentive for firms to continue to conduct operations in Australia and provide local employment.


The Australia Institute commented:


While the change to specifically recognise service exports may be desirable, the current proposed amendment seems to remove any focus on products that are produced in Australia. The effect of this could be the further offshoring of Australian manufacturing. For example, a garment company based in Australia could move all production offshore, but still be eligible for Efic's services.


This has the potential to not only deprive finance to companies that produce in Australia, but also to give advantage to their competition in other countries.


The Australian Council of Trade Unions submission declared:


It is in the national interest that companies which receive government loans are required to use that money in a way which benefits Australian employment. The removal of these provisions will be yet another blow to the Australian manufacturing and services sectors. It could potentially lead to jobs being offshored.


So we see those various submissions producing comments on the same theme. They gave a warning which I think was justified and should have been heeded, and that's why Labor did not accept the recommendations of the government majority on the committee that the bill should be passed without amendment. We acknowledged that when the bill was considered in the House of Representatives, and we are moving amendments that go some way towards allaying the concerns. The most important of these amendments stipulates that an applicant for a loan or guarantee:


… must certify, by writing given to EFIC, that the person reasonably believes that the loan will result in a net increase in the number of people employed in Australia by the business or a related business during the term of the loan.


Nonetheless Labor believes that this is insufficient, so we are moving two further amendments, and we're pleased that the government has indicated that it's prepared to accept those amendments. I understand, Minister, that that remains the case. These amendments provide that, at the completion of any loan or guarantee that it is to be used for the dominant purpose of direct investment outside Australia, the applicant must provide Efic with a certification stating whether a net job increase occurred as a result of Efic's financing and that this information must be publicly released by Efic. Further, for businesses with a turnover of more than $150 million in a financial year, the company must certify that any loan or guarantee to be used for the dominant purpose of direct investment outside Australia will not be used to offshore substantial parts of the business. These amendments will allow closer scrutiny of the use of taxpayers' money for direct foreign investment. This will help ensure that Efic's finance will result in net job growth in Australia.


These are outcomes that I think are positive. They reflect Labor's resolve to put Australian firms and their workers first. Far too often the Abbott-Turnbull government has done nothing while Australian jobs have been sent offshore. On this occasion we thank the government for its willingness to negotiate around these amendments, and it's a much better bill as a result than it was when it was first introduced. We hope that this government will continue to be willing to agree to measures that actually reduce the risks of jobs being lost in this country.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (09:39):  I rise to speak on the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Support for Commonwealth Entities) Bill 2017 before us today. The Greens have significant concerns with this bill and believe the government missed an important opportunity to reform and progress meaningful reform to Efic, reform that we know is very much needed, before we expand the powers of this particular body. Chief among our concerns is the fact that Efic already has a very poor record in assessing the impacts of its investments and has a very poor record of being transparent with the parliament and with the Australian people—the taxpayers that fund these operations. Yet, despite this history, the first amendment of this bill expands Efic's powers. According to the explanatory memorandum:


The policy objective of the first amendment is to allow Efic to offer its specialist financial capabilities in the operation and administration of Commonwealth financing programs, where there is no connection to exports.


Expertise, I guess, is in the eye of the beholder. When you see the very dark, opaque way that Efic has been operating, you have to wonder what expertise indeed we are talking about.


Instead, we need to strengthen the accountability practices of Efic before we consider and contemplate expanding its powers. Efic must get its own house in order before it starts telling other government agencies what to do and how to do it. Efic has repeatedly demonstrated a failure to conduct proper due diligence, evidenced by human rights and environmental violations at Efic sponsored projects overseas. One of those violations is in Efic's work in PNG, one of the most illustrative examples of Efic's poor decision making and lack of transparency—namely, in support of the ExxonMobil led PNG LNG project in 2009. It was at the time the largest single loan that Efic had given. Much of this transaction was done on the National Interest Account and was thus undertaken with the cooperation of DFAT. Nonetheless, it never could have happened without passing Efic's due diligence standards, which have clearly been found wanting.


In 2009, and again in 2012, Jubilee Australia found two major shortcomings of the project. Firstly, from a macroeconomic point of view, the expected financial impacts on the PNG economy were likely to be mixed, and poor governance in PNG meant that it was likely that this project would undermine any predicted widespread benefits for the ordinary people of PNG. Secondly, Jubilee warned that the unrealistic promises, combined with inadequate landowner mapping and political pressures on the landowners to sign on to the project agreement, would eventually lead to landowner discontent. We know that that indeed is what has happened. Jubilee Australia further warned that if this discontent caused low level conflict, the PNG government might send in the military, which would lead to an escalation and bloody civil conflict in the area. This is precisely what has happened. Efic was grossly incompetent in assessing this project's social, economic and political risks.


I question the expertise of Efic in relation to other government agencies and projects and the ability to expand Efic's powers under this piece of legislation. This is just one example, and there are others. One is that Efic has been unable to assess the risks associated with other large resource projects. In the early 1980s, Efic financed and assisted in the expansion of the Rio Tinto controlled Panguna mine. The exploitation associated with this mine led to the Bougainville Civil War. Efic has never really taken responsibility for the role that it played in this, the largest and most destructive conflict in the South Pacific region since World War II.


I don't just highlight these as one-off examples. This is an ongoing systemic problem we have with this agency and its ability to conduct proper risk assessment on social, economic and political risks and take responsibility for the role that this agency has had in escalating problems throughout our region.


The list, of course, goes on. We get to the role that Efic has had in relation to the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, the NAIF. In addition to the overseas projects, we now know that Efic is tightly entwined in the operation of funding of projects through the NAIF. Efic's role in the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility does nothing to inspire confidence in its ability to provide advice to other Commonwealth entities and agencies and to assist them in conducting due diligence. With Efic's support, the NAIF is a secretive organisation that is considering blatantly unethical and illegitimate investments like Adani's billion-dollar rail line from its proposed Carmichael coalmine to the Galilee Basin. NAIF and Efic have advanced the project to the due diligence stage, despite the fact that Adani made clear on 5 December that the loan was 'not critical' and that they applied for it 'because it's available' and 'it doesn't mean it's a make or break for the project'. In light of that statement, the Adani project clearly fails NAIF's own investment mandate. You have to wonder why Efic has allowed it to progress to the due diligence stage.


Illustrative of the Efic-NAIF problems is the recent resignation of Efic's independent non-executive director and audit committee chair, Annabelle Chaplain. As a board member, Ms Chaplain oversaw Efic's work for NAIF from the beginning until her recent resignation. She gave notice to the minister, Mr Ciobo, on 19 July, just weeks after Environmental Justice Australia publicly pointed out a potential conflict of interest; and, despite being referred to as a board member with a term to 31 July 2019 in Efic answers to questions on notice, Ms Chaplain has now resigned. Ms Chaplain's potential conflicts of interest were obvious. She was a board member of Efic, the body assessing the suitability of the Adani taxpayer loan, at the same time as she was a shareholder and chair of Downer EDI, which has an arrangement for $2 billion worth of work with Adani—of course, if it is to go ahead. She is also the chair of Queensland Airports Ltd, which owns the Townsville Airport, which is working to 'secure the opportunity for Townsville to be the FIFO hub for the Adani mine'. No public explanation has yet been made as to Ms Chaplain's resignation beyond 'unexpected commitments'; nor do we know what measures she took previously to avoid the conflicts of interest prior to resigning. In the committee stage, I will be asking the minister specific questions in relation to this opaqueness around Efic and potential conflicts of interest of board members, and I'm warning the minister that it'd be helpful if we could get some answers when we get to that point.


Perhaps the Productivity Commission said it best when it recently summarised its criticisms of Efic. It said:


There is much to be learned from the long experience of EFIC providing concessional export finance. Some of these lessons cover what not to do.


The assisted expansion of the Rio Tinto controlled mine is one example. The exploitation associated with the Panguna mine led to the Bougainville conflict war. These, of course, are things that have to be taken into consideration. The Productivity Commission's review of Efic found that it was failing to support small and medium enterprises where market gaps in access to export financing were likely. The commission also found governance problems such as insufficient internal and independent oversight of compliance with its mandate. The commission was not satisfied that the Efic board was provided with sufficient information in board papers to evaluate whether finance facilities submitted for approval met the requirements set out in the minister's statement of expectations. That, of course, has come directly from the Productivity Commission's review.


Given our concerns about Efic's actions overseas as well as at home, through the NAIF and through overseas exploitation, we will be moving amendments to strike out these provisions in the bill. We cannot support an expansion of Efic's remit when it is so clearly failing to fulfil its current requirements.


We are extremely worried about the lack of transparency to the parliament and to the Australian people in relation to the activities and funding of projects through Efic. We will be moving amendments to remove Efic's exemption from the freedom of information laws. Concerns about Efic's lack of transparency and accountability were identified during the Productivity Commission's inquiry in 2012. The inquiry found that Efic's exemption from the FOI Act should be removed and that Efic should be required to release more information about social and environmental impact assessments. Efic has failed to meaningfully improve its transparency and accountability mechanisms since the Productivity Commission's report, having only adopted a grievance mechanism and introduced a weak and secretive human rights policy. It is high time that we follow the Productivity Commission's recommendations and remove Efic's exemptions from FOI laws.


We will move this amendment, and I call on all members in this place, including the opposition and fellow crossbenchers, to support this amendment. There is no excuse for an exemption from FOI, particularly for an organisation that has proven itself to be untrustworthy when it comes to these issues, looking at the impact of the projects that it funds and taking responsibility for the consequences. This is, of course, taxpayers' money, and FOI exemptions such as what currently exists undermine the ability for the public and the taxpayer to know that their money is being spent appropriately and in line with common standards.


This bill also misses the opportunity to remove one of the many subsidies provided to the fossil fuel industry, which continues to be a bugbear with this government. These fossil fuel subsidies were estimated to amount to $7.7 billion of taxpayer funds in the 2016-17 financial year alone. It is well established that export credit agency funding for fossil fuel development should be considered a fossil fuel subsidy, as that funding is provided by the government. But of course we never hear an acknowledgement by the government of just how much Australian taxpayers' money is going to subsidise the fossil fuel industry, allowed by the federal government. Efic currently lacks policy guidance in these areas, and it is therefore not required to consider the carbon emissions associated with investments it supports. We believe that Efic should not be able to use taxpayer funds to subsidise the fossil fuel industry anymore. Of course, we're not happy with Australian taxpayer money being used to subsidise a mates-rates-type loan for Adani, and the last thing we want to see is the ability for Efic to fund more projects like this into the future.


As the world moves to address the crisis posed by climate change, and especially in the light of the Paris Agreement coming into force in 2016, the role of fossil fuel subsidies is increasingly under international scrutiny. We must end these polluting subsidies, and this is an opportunity to do that here today. That's why we'll be moving an amendment to ensure that Efic does not fund transactions that directly or indirectly support the extraction of fossil fuels in relation to the NAIF or any other agencies that Efic lends its expertise to.


One of the other issues in relation to this bill—and this was covered by Senator Carr extensively in his speech on the second reading—is of course the concerns in relation to offshoring of Australian workers' jobs overseas. We are concerned that this bill will result in further offshoring of Australian manufacturing positions and deprive companies that produce in Australia and in some cases give advantage to their competition in other countries.


I will be keen to see further clarification around the opposition's amendments when we get to committee stage, and we look forward to seeing if we can in some ways improve that aspect of the bill. We do know that the ACTU wrote that it could not agree with this part of the bill, because they feared it would make another blow to Australian manufacturing and the services sector. The Greens welcome the government's recognition of these concerns, but we are yet to see what true action will come from fixing it up in relation to that part of the bill.


Despite the possibility of some of these safeguards in relation to offshoring of jobs, the Greens will not and cannot support this bill as it stands. We have major concerns that the government has missed the opportunity to reform the accountability mechanisms and issues related to Efic. They've missed the ball. This was the bill to do that. We cannot continue to see and we will not support the continuation of such a secret organisation operating with huge amounts of taxpayer funds in the dark without the information being available to the parliament or, indeed, the taxpayer. We don't want to see further taxpayer funds spent on subsidising the fossil fuel industry.


For all of these reasons the Greens will not be supporting this bill.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2017-09-06,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (09:56):  I rise to make a contribution in respect of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Support for Commonwealth Entities) Bill 2017. I want to start off by saying that Labor does support the good work of Efic, but it's important to note that that's not without some concerns as to some aspects of its operation and with regard to proper scrutiny of the work of Efic. It's right and proper that the government plays a role to support our exporters by providing financial services where the private sector cannot, and Efic has played its part in supporting Australian jobs and growing our economy. It is to be commended for that.


It would appear that the government's been on a bit of a journey in respect of this issue. I note that in 2014 or thereabouts the government released a report of the National Commission of Audit that made a number of recommendations. At that point of time it was the view of the National Commission of Audit that Efic should cease to exist. That's a quite extraordinary recommendation from the National Commission of Audit, which generally is seen as reflecting fairly extreme right-wing views, but it's good to see that we still have Efic performing a function. But, as I say, it's not without the need for scrutiny.


And EFIC isn't without its flaws, as I indicated. I'm mindful that its processes in the past have let Australians down. So it's important that, when we look at legislation that amends Efic, we ensure that Efic does really deliver for everyday Australians. The Labor Party is committed to the objectives of growing our economy and creating more well-paying jobs here at home.


The bill seeks to amend the Efic Act in two ways. Labor support one of those amendments and will seek our own amendments to address concerns with the other ground of the Efic bill. The first part of the bill—the support for Commonwealth entities—expands Efic's function to include the provision of services to Commonwealth entities and companies, subject to the approval of the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment. This would allow Efic to offer its specialist financial capabilities in the operation and administration of Commonwealth financing programs where there is no connection to exports.


As it currently stands, there is only one other body that Efic can currently provide services to, and that is the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. I am the chair of the Senate Economics References Committee, and we are inquiring into the governance of the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. Some submissions have noted concerns in relation to the arrangements between Efic and NAIF, particularly that there is little public information provided about how Efic serves NAIF and that the processes governing this arrangement are robust. In the course of the proceedings of that inquiry we heard evidence from Professor Thomas Clarke, professor of corporate governance at the University of Technology Sydney. Professor Clarke talked about the fact that there was no effective transparency in the NAIF's governance framework, including in its project assessment and approval processes. He commented that it is unheard of for a publicly funded body to work in these conditions of absolute secrecy. He said all meetings, information and decisions are kept secret until they are approved, and the public is denied any knowledge of specific projects and who is proposing the projects. He said that this is not compatible with accountability and probity in public office, and neglects all established principles and protocols in public service in Australia and internationally.


We generally support the work of Efic. Of course, the issue of NAIF governance and operations is a question for the board of NAIF. One doesn't know the full extent of the advice given by Efic to NAIF in some of these issues, particularly in relation to due diligence arrangements. But there is a question mark as to what is happening with NAIF and the processes that are there to deal with applications that are coming before the NAIF. I must say that NAIF is certainly not a model of transparency that we would like to hold up for others to follow. This all goes to say that, while Efic does do good work, we know it is not perfect. We can't necessarily blame Efic for the decisions of the NAIF board, but there are some concerns that NAIF is not operating in a manner that Australians would like to see.


Generally, the first part of the bill is quite sensible and the Labor Party supports that. Enabling the government to deliver services in a more productive way makes a lot of sense. However, the second part of the bill has raised quite a few concerns. The Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee looked into this bill. It heard the concerns of the Australian Fair Trade and Investment Network and the ACTU that the bill might lead to Efic providing financing to companies that might offshore Australian jobs and remove incentives to produce or manufacture in Australia. So Labor has taken a constructive approach to improving the legislation so that not only are no Australian jobs lost in this process but there are assurances that Efic's finance is leading to net job increases here at home. I would like to thank the shadow minister for his work in tightening the amendments to ensure this happens. I also appreciate the minister working with Labor to improve this legislation. This is something that does not happen often enough in this place.


I note that the minister already has moved amendments to the original bill in the House of Representatives, which stipulated that, when applying for a loan or guarantee for the purpose of direct investment overseas, the person who carries on the business must certify in writing given to Efic that the person reasonably believes that the loan will result in a net increase in the number of people employed in Australia by the business or a related party of the business during the term of the loan. Labor supports this amendment, but it doesn't go far enough. There should be higher standards to make sure that a company has used an Efic loan or guarantee for its intended purpose and met all the requirements. We also know that what is promised and what is delivered do not always line up. When taxpayer funds are being used to assist companies, there is a responsibility for government and the parliament to make sure that Australian jobs are being created.


I now turn to the first amendment that Labor has proposed in respect of the Australian jobs test. Labor will move amendments to ensure that an Australian based business, if they are successful in receiving a loan or guarantee to be used for the dominant purpose of direct investment outside Australia, must provide Efic with certification as to whether a net job increase did occur in Australia as a result of Efic's financing at the completion of the loan or guarantee. This certification must also be publicly released by Efic. It makes a lot of sense for good governance that these results are made public. We do know that Efic has fallen short in the past, and measures like this help to tighten the governance framework. I also understand that the government will support this amendment and I want to thank the government for working with Labor to make this legislation stronger.


In relation to the second amendment that we propose, Labor is also concerned that an Efic loan or guarantee to an Australian based business for the purpose of direct investment overseas may be used to offshore existing parts of the Australian business. This may leave large numbers of Australians unemployed. Companies do this, but they shouldn't use taxpayer funds to do this. This is why Labor believes that an Efic loan or guarantee that is to be used by an Australian based company for the dominant purpose of direct investment outside Australia should not be used to offshore substantial parts of the business.


This was the position the shadow minister took to the minister: that an Efic loan or guarantee that is used for the dominant purpose of direct investment outside Australia should not be used to offshore substantial parts of the business. I understand the shadow minister met with Efic over the break and discussed the exact wording of the amendment, and it has been agreed that, for smaller businesses, there was a legitimate reason as to why some facilities may need to be sent overseas to help grow the business back here in Australia. Efic already defines a large business as one with a turnover of more than $150 million per annum. To ensure proper operation of Efic, Labor agreed that the proposed amendment should apply to businesses with more than $150 million turnover per annum. This is a sensible amendment, which will help to ensure taxpayers' funds are not used to offshore Australian jobs, while allowing for the growth of small and medium businesses.


So, in summary, these Labor amendments are completely consistent with the policy positions we have taken in a number of areas recently. It is important that creating good, secure, well-paying Australian jobs is foremost in the minds of elected officials here in Canberra. Whether it is a policy on apprentices, steel production, Labor's proposed Australian skills authority, the skill-up training fund, saying no to labour loopholes in trade deals or protecting penalty rates, Labor is leading the way on putting well-paid Australian jobs first.


However, when you look at the current government, it seems to be more based on a free market, de-regulated, 'You're on your own' ideology, rather than on sound policy. Whether it's on shipbuilding, 457s, Work for the Dole, the Youth Jobs PaTH intern program, slashing funding to TAFEs and universities, the slow rollout of the regional jobs packages or cutting penalty rates, you see a picture: the government isn't taking these issues seriously and the government isn't taking Australians seriously. And that is unacceptable. However, as long as the government adopts Labor's sensible amendments, which will put Australian jobs first, I will support this bill.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2017-09-06,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:09):  I support the second reading stages of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Support for Commonwealth Entities) Bill 2017, but I have real reservations about it. I believe it will be improved by the amendments that will be moved by the crossbench—by Senator Hanson-Young, particularly, in relation to FOI—and by the opposition in relation to the issue of Australian jobs. But it is important to make this point: at a point in time when manufacturing in Australia as a percentage of GDP has plunged by half in the last decade, and more than 200,000 local manufacturing jobs have been lost, this bill in its current form would introduce provisions that would see Efic being able to support Australian companies to set up manufacturing facilities offshore in preference to here at home. That is something that seriously concerns me. My understanding is that the government will agree to the opposition's amendments, and that is obviously welcome.


Whilst the committee report on this fairly drew out both the pros and cons of the impact this legislation would have, I believe it grossly underestimated the risks of this legislation in the context of an economic sector in a perilous condition. We know energy prices in this country are putting manufacturing at enormous risk. I will have more to say outside this chamber about AEMO later. I think AEMO have been abysmal in terms of their forecasting and in terms of their leadership in the energy sector because that impacts on manufacturing. In a sense, it does draw us back to this particular bill.


There are two key amendments. The first amendment seeks, in the words contained in the explanatory memorandum:


… to allow Efic to offer its specialist financial capabilities in the operation and administration of Commonwealth financing programs, where there is no connection to exports. Following Efic's provision of services to the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (""the NAIF""), Commonwealth departments have expressed interest in leveraging Efic's expertise.


On the face of it, this seems sensible. These are matters I've raised in estimates with Efic. It is taking a lot of resources in terms of the NAIF. There have been points raised by Jubilee Australia and the Australia Institute, particularly in relation to the dilution of focus. I think if we could get some assurances from the industry minister in relation to this, that would be very useful. Efic's annual report states:


Efic's primary purpose is to facilitate and encourage Australian export trade on a commercial basis. We provide financial support to Australian-based companies that are exporting, integral to a global supply chain or seeking to grow internationally.


The report also points out that the organisation compromises about 100 people. Any diversion of resource and function in such a small and focused organisation could only reasonably be expected to distract and prevent the organisation in respect of encouraging export trade. Exports are our lifeblood. The more we export, the better it is for the economy. I am a bit nervous that the Australian dollar is hovering just below 80 cents. I would prefer it to be way below that; around 70 or 75 cents seems to be a sweet spot for our exporters. So I want to be assured that Efic should and needs to remain tightly focused in facilitating export trade, and that is why I have been concerned about the first amendment. There are some transparency measures there. The FOI amendments by the Greens, I think, are good amendments and they ought to be supported to improve the legislation.


Now to the second amendment which I am concerned about. Under the current legislation, for a company to receive financial support from Efic, it needs to demonstrate there is some element of labour, goods and materials of Australian content. The level of Australian content in an export contract is an important factor in determining the amount of financial support that Efic provides. In essence, the higher the level of Australian content, the more financial support Efic can provide. The proposed unamended changes to the legislation seek to remove the local content requirement that invokes Efic's support and replace it with the need 'only for the benefit flowing back to Australia' to be present. That is incredibly imprecise, incredibly vague, and open to abuse. This creates a situation where Efic funding could be used to offshore a new manufacturing capability at the cost of Australian jobs.


The opposition's amendments are welcome, but I would put this question on notice—short notice—to the shadow industry minister, Senator Carr: what analysis has been done of these amendments in terms of preventing a bleeding of Australian jobs overseas in relation to that? I note the amendment. It is welcome, but I am still nervous about the fact that it could be rorted and that we could see money that Efic is providing—Australian taxpayers' money—go towards seeing jobs offshored, albeit with the stricter requirements in the amendments moved by the opposition.


Let's put this in context. This is not some esoteric argument I am raising. Australia's manufacturing sector has been in broad decline since 2008, with real output having contracted at every quarter since September 2011. Over 200,000 manufacturing jobs have disappeared since 2008, and the rate of job losses is accelerating. Employment in manufacturing fell six per cent in 2015 alone, and it's going to get much, much worse unless we deal with the energy crisis in this country. The fact that gas prices are double the price of Australian gas being sold in Japan, notwithstanding the liquefaction, the regasification and the transport of gas to Japan, means there is something seriously awry with our gas market in this country.


The impact it has had on manufacturers that rely on gas has been devastating. When new contracts come up, a lot of manufacturers will put their hands up and say, 'Do we want to do business in Australia?' That concerns me. I know there have been some measures, which I welcome, from the government, but this is an existential crisis for manufacturing in this country, so I don't want to make it worse with what this bill is proposing. These amendments from the opposition, which I understand the government is supporting, will at least help to ameliorate that concern. That is my concern, and that is something that should be explored in the committee stages of this bill.


Some of the submitters made the point that the loosening of the Efic reins may assist companies to set up marketing promotions offshore. While these sort of initiatives must be encouraged and supported by government, there are other programs better suited to marketing such as the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. To pull the Efic lever to facilitate promotion is to pull the wrong lever, and that is why I still have serious concerns about this bill. The amendments moved and the concessions by the government are welcome. But I will still reserve my position in the third reading stages of this bill, because I would not want to see Efic, an arm of government funded by taxpayers that is meant to encourage Australian exports and, by extension, Australian jobs and the growth of our economy, to be used as a Trojan Horse to fund the expansion of manufacturing overseas. That, to me, is a bridge too far and should not be supported. With those words, I support the second reading stage of this bill. I believe the bill can be improved in the committee stage, but I still have serious reservations about it.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (10:17):  I rise to speak on the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Support for Commonwealth Entities) Bill 2017. Have you got a good business idea? Have the banks refused your requests for a loan? Then get a loan from the government; it's getting back into the banking business. It has got the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which will provide you with a loan if you tell the public servants that your business idea will save the climate. The Abbott government had wanted to abolish this green bank, but after the Senate rejected the idea and we got a new Prime Minister, the government is now an enthusiastic supporter.


The government wants to establish the Regional Investment Corporation, which will provide you with a loan if you tell the public servants that if you don't get a concessional loan your farm will be taken over by a larger, more-efficient farmer—we just couldn't have that. Now, the government is expanding the role of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, so it doesn't just provide loans. If you've got a business idea relating to the exporting of manufactured goods that no bank will touch, now the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, through this bill, will offer loans. If you've got a business idea relating to tourism but can't get a loan from a bank because they assess your idea as bonkers, all you need to do is point out to the public servants that some of the tourists you hope for will be foreigners.


The same applies if you've got an idea for an online business. If you point out to the public servants that some of the online customers you hope for will be foreigners, you're in. If your idea relates to intellectual property, and no bank thinks it's worth a pinch of salt, then you're in luck too, provided you point out to the public servants that some foreigners might use your intellectual property. You'll even be able to get a loan from the government's Export Finance and Insurance Corporation if you want to invest overseas, provided you mention to the public servants that some indirect benefit will flow back to Australia. So what are you waiting for? If you want a loan and the banks have knocked you back, there's a government bank that's ready to hand you some taxpayers' cash. Commercial viability is no longer a prerequisite. All you need is to have an idea that suits the political breeze.


I hear the cynics out there pooh-poohing this development. They say that government banking makes us poorer by diverting cash to ideas that aren't as profitable as the ideas supported by commercial banks. They say that, when loans turn bad, government banking makes unwilling taxpayers instead of willing bank shareholders take the hit. They also make annoying references to the history of government banks—but it will be different this time, somehow! I don't think it will come as a surprise that the Liberal Democrats oppose the establishment of government banks, which make us all poorer. I will be opposing this bill. Unfortunately, I'll probably be alone in doing so.

"Sinodinos, Sen Arthur",LP,2017-09-06,"



Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales—Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science) (10:20):  Let me begin by thanking the senators for their contributions to the debate on the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Support for Commonwealth Entities) Bill 2017. The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, Efic, plays an important role in supporting the growth of Australian exporters, with a focus on small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs. Efic delivers simple and creative finance solutions for Australian exporters. Efic provided 130 Australian SME exporters with over $150 million in support in 2016-17. This government wants to make it easier for Australian exporters to access Efic's support for jobs and growth, which hopefully will lead to higher wages as well. We need to foster an environment where Australia's exporters can grow. As it stands, the bill will look to do this by improving Efic's support for businesses who cannot obtain private sector finance to expand their reach overseas.


To address a point made by Senator Leyonhjelm: Efic are addressing a gap in the market, particularly when it comes to smaller enterprises wanting to expand overseas who may not have a great track record in the private sector here. Private banks may not be willing to finance their exports overseas, so Efic do fill a gap. Yes, they do take a risk. It's possible that some of these firms may not work out, but it is a gap in the marketplace that facilities like Efic are seeking to fill.


This bill will enable Efic to lend directly to an expanded range of Australian exporters and will ensure Efic's support for overseas direct investment results in more jobs in Australia. The evidence is very clear that Australian companies that export abroad are more productive, pay higher wages and, in that sense, make a premium contribution to the Australian economy. This bill prioritises the needs of a wider range of small and medium-sized enterprises across Australia to grow exports and jobs and expand their presence overseas, including tourism operators, online businesses and exporters of intellectual property and other related rights. In particular, we want to be able to keep the intellectual property here, but also to use it as a platform for exports.


This government responded to issues raised during the Senate committee review process by passing amendments in the House which have been noted and which legislate a net-positive jobs test for overseas direct investments and maintain local content requirements. The net-positive employment stipulation for Efic support for overseas direct investment means businesses will have to certify in writing their reasonable belief that Efic's support for overseas direct investment will result in a net increase to the number of people employed in Australia. I understand the opposition will shortly move two amendments to build upon this. One amendment will ensure Efic publicly discloses the business certification. This requirement is an extension of Efic's existing policy to publish the details of its high-level commercial transactions. We have no objection to this. The second opposition amendment will ensure large businesses with annual revenue of $150 million or more certify to Efic that they will not move all or a substantial part of their business overseas as a result of Efic's support for an overseas direct investment transaction. The idea that Australian taxpayers would be subsidising the offshoring of Australian jobs is clearly something that would not go down well with the Australian public. This requirement codifies Efic's existing policy to ensure its support for overseas direct investment will not result in plant closure or net job losses in Australia, and again we have no objections to this.


With around 100 employees today, Efic operates in the financial services sector with experience and specialist expertise regarding finance arrangements. This bill enables Efic's expertise to be made available to a wide range of commonwealth entities and companies on a fee-for-service basis beyond its current work for the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, subject to ministerial approval. This government responded to issues raised during the senate committee review process by passing amendments in the House to require Efic to charge fees for any services provided to Commonwealth entities and companies. In this way, additional resources will be provided to Efic so that Efic's support for SMEs remains undiminished. Australia's exporters are among the best businesses in this country. This bill will enable us to help even more of them receive the financial support they need to win business, employ more Australians, grow internationally and achieve export success. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"O'Sullivan, Sen Barry",Nats,2017-09-06,"



Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (12:45):  I rise to bring the attention of the chamber to a cruel disease called spinal muscular atrophy or SMA. It's a relatively unknown illness, despite it being the No. 1 genetic killer of infants under the age of two in Australia. It is largely unknown because babies born with it rarely live beyond their second birthday. I'd like to share with the chamber the story of one couple who have had their world shattered by this illness. Their names are Rachel and John, and all members of the parliament would have received a letter from them introducing you to their young daughter, Mackenzie, who suffers from SMA. Mackenzie was the couple's first child and they told me they couldn't have been any happier. But, shortly after, their world was turned upside down. At 10 weeks of age, their little baby daughter was diagnosed as having SMA type 1.


This disease is a neuromuscular disorder characterised by the loss of motor neurons and progressive muscle wasting, often leading to death. It manifests over a wide range of severity, affecting both infants and adults, and is broadly divided into five types in accordance with age or onset of symptoms or from the highest attained milestone of motor development. In the case of Mackenzie, she was diagnosed with having the most common form of SMA, which is type 1. Type 1 is terminal. The prognosis for Mackenzie is devastating, cruel and quite unforgiving. The average life expectancy for infants with the condition is nine months at best.


In December last year, a clinical trial was commenced in Australia of a drug that, in some cases, can delay the onset of symptoms. It has also shown itself to be a big step forward in medical advancement and is currently being assessed by the TGA. However, it is not a cure and the prognosis for little Mackenzie remains the same. Rachel described to me how she felt as the medical expert advised them that Mackenzie had a terminal illness for which there was no known cure and that her life expectancy was likely to be less than one year. Rachel described how, as their world fell away, everything went blurry for her. Sounds muffled and she felt like she was collapsing. She remembers looking at her husband, John, and saying, 'What just happened?'


For most of us, it is difficult, if not impossible, to imagine how such a devastating and shattering experience would feel—from being on such a positive high with the birth of their daughter to being told that their precious little baby will die, perhaps before her first birthday, and that there's nothing she or they can do to change the situation. As I've said, the disease is a cruel and unforgiving condition. From planning and dreaming for the future of their daughter, their time is now spent arranging and giving the best palliative care for Mackenzie. In Rachel's words: 'I cannot adequately express the love we feel for Mackenzie. Rather than dreaming of Mackenzie's future and imagining all the beautiful experiences of life that lay before her, we are now going to have to watch our baby slowly lose muscle movement, lose the ability to feed and swallow and, finally, lose the ability to breathe.'


Before Mackenzie's diagnosis, Rachel and John had never heard of SMA. Neither had anyone amongst their families or friends. They were soon to learn that it is the No. 1 genetic killer of children under the age of two years. It begs the question: how is it that no-one has heard of this disorder?


One in 35 people in Australia are carriers of SMA. If two carriers have a baby, there is a one-in-four chance of their baby having SMA. These statistics are simply astonishing. This rare neuromuscular disorder is clearly not so rare. Rachel and John undertook all the tests offered to them before and during pregnancy, including genetic testing for more common genetic illnesses, such as Down syndrome. But they were not offered genetic testing to check whether either was an SMA carrier prior to conception. In most cases, such genetic testing is offered only if you have a family history. But four out of five children born with a genetic disorder do not have a family history of the disorder.


Today SMA is not curable, but it is 100 per cent preventable. A couple planning for a family today can find out if they are carriers through having a blood test during the pregnancy screening. Not only can this testing be undertaken before conception, but tests can also be undertaken for more severe genetic disorders, such as cystic fibrosis and fragile X. I'm instructed that this simple test to protect our community obviously only works as a prevention if people know about it.


Rachel and John are both proud to be federal police officers. They are made of fairly stern stuff. When confronted with such a personal tragedy, in their grief they looked to ways to help others and to turn their suffering to something of a benefit for others. They know they cannot change the outcome for Mackenzie, but perhaps their campaign can prevent others from going through such pain and suffering. Accordingly, while caring for Mackenzie they also make the time to push for greater awareness of SMA and increased access to carrier testing. It is through this initiative that I got to know Rachel and John and to know about their story and their aims.


When I met Rachel and John, I asked them what they were hoping to achieve and how we could help them. As Rachel explained to me, they have three main aims—although there is much that can be done in this space. They want to help raise awareness of pre-pregnancy genetic testing amongst people planning a pregnancy and among healthcare professionals. This testing already exists; people just need to know about it so that they can make an informed choice. There is a general lack of awareness of these genetic tests, and SMA more specifically, even amongst healthcare professionals. Secondly, they would like to encourage the federal government to consider subsidising pre-implantation genetic diagnoses during the IVF process for those couples known to be carriers of genetic disorders. This is currently being looked at by government and should be approved without further delay. They hope that eventually genetic testing becomes routine and subsidised to make it more accessible to all Australians. It is so much more effective for us to spend our money on increasing access to carrier testing than to pay for the medical, palliative and social costs associated with these disorders, to say nothing about the emotional impacts on in this case a child and their parents.


I'm pleased to say that there appears to be broad support across parliament for what Rachel and John are trying to achieve. Both the Minister and Assistant Minister for Health have begun looking at ways to assist in achieving these outcomes. In addition, the New South Wales health minister, Brad Hazzard, has met with Rachel, John and Mackenzie and has made a commitment to create a change for Mackenzie. In fact, our own federal Minister for Health has indicated that he has taken a personal interest in their representations. Rachel and John are thankful for the support they have received from some members of parliament, and now they hope that this support turns into action. For my part, I also pledge to do all I can to assist Mackenzie and her family to realise these sensible ideals. Our hearts remain with John and Rachel as they confront what is a very personal and enormously difficult struggle. I promise you that your efforts won't be in vain.

Government senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order on my right! Senators have the right to ask the questions they wish to ask. 




Senator URQUHART:
  Yesterday, the Minister denied that her potential ineligibility as a senator had impacted her decision-making by claiming she was 'very recently with the member for Whitlam announcing $10 million for a road'. Given that the decision to fund this road was made almost 12 months ago, does the minister want to try again? Just name one funding decision made since questions about your eligibility as a senator were revealed.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals, Minister for Regional Development, Minister for Local Government and Territories and Minister for Regional Communications) (14:01):  If my recollection serves me correctly, I was talking in general at that point in time about the very good regional grants program that we have in this coalition government. I was simply pointing out the fact that I was with the member for Whitlam, Stephen Jones, talking about the $10 million road project in Fowlers Road, Dapto, which was very well received not only by the local member but by the people down there in the local community. It was relating to my broader conversation at the time around projects. As I have indicated to the chamber, I have made many decisions around projects. The advice that I have currently indicates that I will continue to do so and that those decisions will be very well considered and appropriate. 



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Wong, on a point of order?




Senator Wong:
  Mr President, on a point of order: the minister might have been about to get to it, but she was asked one question. She was asked to name one funding decision made since questions about her eligibility as a senator were revealed, not the 12-month-ago decision that she referred to yesterday. 



The PRESIDENT:  She was asked two questions. The first one was: 'Does the minister want to try again?' That was the first question, and I think the minister was clearly answering that portion of the question. Minister, have you concluded your answer?




Senator Nash:
  Yes.

I will continue to make decisions in my capacity as Minister for Regional Development and, indeed, my other portfolios. I believe those decisions will be very well considered and appropriate. But can I now point out that this is the ninth question I've had since Monday morning on an issue that is not a priority for the Australian people. Again, the Labor Party has refused to take the opportunity to ask me a question about any of my portfolios or any of the portfolios of ministers that I represent about things that matter to the Australian people. I know from the conversations I've had that there are people who are incredibly disappointed that Labor is again showing their complete disregard for regional Australia.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:05):  I thank Senator Bushby for that question. What it shows is that the Turnbull government's pro-growth, pro-opportunity, pro-jobs agenda is working. It shows that our economy continues to grow. In recent weeks we have seen evidence of more jobs, more investment, higher wages and more exports. Real growth of 0.8 per cent over the past quarter is more than twice the rate of the previous quarter. In year-average terms, at 1.9 per cent throughout the 2016-17 financial year, real growth is higher than the 1¾ per cent real growth forecast in the last budget.


Of course, Labor is not interested in the strength of our economy or in opportunity. They are only interested, for political reasons, in going back to their old failed socialist agenda of the past. At budget time, the Labor side was saying, 'These growth forecasts are way too ambitious', and, of course, we've come in above the growth forecast. But do you know what the shadow Treasurer says today: 'This is too low.' At budget time, he said we were being too optimistic, too ambitious and that we would never deliver on the economic growth forecasts in the budget. Well, we've exceeded them. They say today, 'It's too low.' They haven't got a clue. That is what socialism does to you. Socialism clearly leaves everyone worse off and it clearly is already having an impact on the Labor Party.


Export volumes rose 2.7 per cent in the June quarter and 4.3 per cent throughout the year. New private business investment grew by 1.1 per cent in the quarter to be 1.5 per cent higher than a year ago. New machinery and equipment investment expanded 3.2 per cent in the quarter. There is more business investment in Australia, with capital imports increasing by almost 25 per cent. There is so much more— (Time expired)

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:07):  One of the central planks of our national economic plan for jobs and growth is a tax cut that benefits 87 per cent of Australian workers working for private sector businesses—a tax cut which the Labor Party is opposing. They used to support it, but now that they've gone back to their socialist past—to a time when your Labor government of the past wanted less opportunity for people to get ahead and was quite happy for less growth, less investment, fewer jobs and lower wages—they are now against a business tax cut to benefit 87 per cent of Australian workers working for a private sector business, even though they would know these tax cuts help protect jobs, help to create more jobs and help to drive increases in real wages over time. We also, unlike those opposite, have a commitment to keep the tax burden on the economy below 23.9 per cent. (Time expired)

 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:08):  We are pursuing policies to provide equality of opportunity because we want every individual Australian to have the best possible opportunity to get ahead. That is why, among other things, we are pursuing policies to provide a safety net for those in need of support but also to encourage reward for effort and hard work and to encourage Australians to do the best they can so that Australians today and future generations of Australians can have the best possible opportunity to succeed, because pursuing equality of outcome leaves everyone worse off. The evidence is in. The case studies around the world have demonstrated that, if you pursue policies designed to achieve equality of outcome, you leave everyone worse off and the people that get hurt the most are low- and middle-income earners. Labor don't care about the opportunities for low- and middle-income earners. Labor just want to pursue an outdated socialist agenda— (Time expired)

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2017-09-06,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:02):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Regional Development (Senator Nash) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.


We have had a decade of obstructionism and stupidity from this rabble of a government when they were in opposition under former Prime Minister Tony Abbott—when they were run by Tony Abbott—and now under the current Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull. Such a disappointment to everyone in the country. This is the guy who stood up and said he wouldn't lead a government that wasn't serious about dealing with climate change. This is a man who just ran away from every value and every principle he ever had.


Senator Nash, who begged to be questioned on a policy issue and actually said, 'Ask me a question about what we're doing to improve energy affordability,' couldn't even answer the question after begging us to ask her a question on that very issue. She wasn't even prepared to come in here and deal with it. Yet this is a minister who is here under false pretences. She should do the same as her colleague in the National Party and stand down from the ministry until her capacity to sit here as a minister is determined by the High Court. This is a nonsense. This is a government in absolute crisis. This is a government just going from one crisis to another.


I can tell Senator Nash that the question I actually asked her was whether it was true that wholesale prices had doubled under this government, and the answer is yes. I also asked her about the Finkel review. There was one overarching position in the Finkel review, which was that the Finkel review proposed a clean energy target. Yet all the troglodytes on the other side of the parliament, all these people who just don't believe in climate change—all the climate change deniers—will not allow the current Prime Minister to actually put a clean energy target in to do something about electricity prices in this country. I couldn't believe it when Senator Fawcett actually got up and asked the question and spoke about filthy polluting diesel generators. Obviously Senator Fawcett's never been in a power station. Well, I worked at Liddell power station for seven years, as a maintenance fitter, and I can tell you that if you ever want to see a dirty, polluting place, go to Liddell power station. It's filthy. Coal-fired power stations are absolutely filthy. Maybe, Senator Fawcett, AGL will let you go in and have a look at the power stations up there and see how dirty they are. They are full of dirt. They are full of coal dust. They are full of pollutants.


And Liddell power station, a coal-fired power station—if you're talking about pollution coming out of a diesel generator, have a look at what 1,200 tonnes of coal an hour being burnt in an old-fashioned power station like Liddell power station looks like. I went to work at Liddell in 1974, when it was only two years old, and it was dirty, polluting and filthy then. You can imagine what it's like now. In 1972 the Holden Torana was the best-selling car in Australia, followed by the Datsun 180B. Well, that's what Liddell power station is: it's the equivalent of a Holden Torana or a Datsun 180B, with the technology that's in there. It is dirty, it is old, it is polluting, and we need to get jobs for people out of the power stations and into renewable energy and actually make a difference. This government does not have a clue about the real issues facing ordinary workers, ordinary Australians. You would have seen that if you were here during question time. They simply want to attack the union movement because they've got no policies, no way forward. (Time expired)

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2017-09-06,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania) (15:08):  The Senate has, regrettably, just been subjected to five minutes of personal denigration by a Labor senator—nothing positive to provide to the discussion of policy matters in this country. It was an unedifying display of ugly, destructive language. There was tearing down of everybody and everything that Senator Cameron could turn his mind to. Well, I want to say to the Australian people that we on this side of the chamber, the Liberal-Nationals coalition, in fact don't want to tear down, don't want to destroy, don't want to denigrate. We are actually about building the nation, building opportunities, and that is what Senator Nash has been doing in her portfolio area and in the regional areas of this country. I refer to my home state of Tasmania, where just three or four short years ago we had the highest unemployment rate in the country: 8.1 per cent. Today it is below six per cent, bearing testament to the wonderful economic and social transition that has occurred courtesy of the policies of the Liberal-National parties at both federal and state levels.


Getting people into jobs is not only an economic good. Sure, they become contributors to our economy; sure, they are no longer reliant on welfare. But there is also a great social good when you see thousands of your fellow Tasmanians going from welfare into employment, becoming self-reliant and being part of the economic mainstream. All the social data tells us that if people are given a job and have the opportunity of a job their mental health, their physical health, their self-esteem and their social interaction are all enhanced. This has been the task for this government over the past three plus years: to seek to grow the economy and to provide job opportunities for our fellow Australians so that they can become self-reliant and can become part of the economic and social mainstream of our nation. 


In stark contrast to the denigration, the personal vitriol, the nastiness that we had to endure from Senator Cameron's contribution, I want to talk about the positives, such as in my home state of Tasmania. We go to the very north of Australia—Senator Macdonald may well talk about this—the great northern development policies that we have for this country. These are the sorts of things that the Australian people want us as a government and as a parliament to get on with. But no, the Australian Labor Party cannot help itself. Devoid of any policy, having a cupboard that is completely barren of any policy ideas, it comes into this place and the other place simply to denigrate ministers who may have an issue in relation to a constitutional provision relating to dual citizenship, and then making mischief about that. Whilst the Labor Party concentrate on these political games, on this political gamesmanship, we as a government are getting on with the task of delivering to the people of Australia. That is what we're elected to do. That's what we're paid to do. That is what we are sworn to do. That is what we on this side are actually doing, actually achieving for the people of Australia. 


Back to my home state: not only has the unemployment rate gone down but the tourism numbers are burgeoning. Hobart Airport is being extended. The Midland Highway is being duplicated in many areas and upgraded. We are having new irrigation schemes put in. We are having a freight equalisation scheme for our exports, allowing us to hit the world market. The list goes on. I would invite those who especially bring the news to the Australian people to do a bit of a juxtaposition, a bit of a compare and contrast, and put the nastiness of Senator Cameron's contribution next to the actual achievements of the Liberal National Party government over the past three or four years. If they were to do that, the Australian people would see a government getting on with the task and not playing politics such as Senator Cameron and the Labor Party do.

"Watt, Sen Murray",ALP,2017-09-06,"



Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (15:13):  I also rise to discuss the real problems that regional Australia is suffering as a result of the paralysed government that we are seeing here, led by Malcolm Turnbull and distracted ministers, whose job it is to be sponsoring projects and economic activity in regional Queensland and across regional Australia but who are far too distracted by their own problems to do so. We know very well that Senator Nash, as the minister for regional Australia, is responsible, more than anyone in this entire parliament, for ensuring that projects are happening in regional Australia and that services are being delivered. But we know, unfortunately, that Senator Nash is so distracted by her own citizenship problems that she is incapable of turning attention to the real needs of regional Australia that are out there right now. Senator Nash, of course, is a member of a famous new party in Australian politics: the 'Dual Nationals'!


You look at them every single day over there, and they're disappearing one by one. We've had Senator Canavan actually do the right thing and stand down from his role as minister, but neither Senator Nash nor her leader, Mr Joyce, have the decency to stand down from cabinet to allow the business of government to go on without this permanent cloud that remains over their heads while their citizenship is in doubt.


This is more than just a political bunfight. The problem with Senator Nash and Mr Joyce not standing down from their ministries is that they are so distracted by their own personal citizenship queries that they can't get on with the business of their portfolios and deliver the services, infrastructure and jobs that regional Queensland and regional Australia so desperately need. We saw yet another embarrassing performance from Senator Nash here in question time today, where not only was she incapable of answering any question that was asked of her related to her portfolio but she was even incapable of answering questions that yesterday she wanted to be asked. Yesterday she came in here, attacked us for asking questions about her citizenship and listed a series of topics that we, in her view, should be asking her about. We did the right thing today. We turned up ready to ask those questions, and we asked those questions of her, but when we did so, she was completely unable to answer and said that she'd have to get back to us.


Every single day we listen to this government moan about energy prices, and they are a real issue in much of Australia. The government ignores the fact that wholesale electricity prices have doubled under their watch over the last few years. Senator Nash is not even aware of this basic fact, but she's happy to stand up every day and criticise the Labor Party about energy prices. For every single region of Australia that we asked about today—whether it be the Bowen Basin, Far North Queensland, particularly around Cairns, the Hunter Valley in New South Wales—we were asking, 'What is the government doing to get projects and services happening in those parts of Australia?' and, remarkably, Senator Nash was incapable of answering, didn't know the answers, doesn't know what's going on in her portfolio and clearly doesn't know what's going on in regional Australia. That's not to mention the woeful answers that she was giving in relation to the concerns about Senator O'Sullivan's mixing of his business and his official duties.


There is a reason that Senator Nash is incapable of answering these questions. She, like so many of her ministerial colleagues, is so distracted by the citizenship fiasco in which we're seeing this government engulfed that they are paralysed by inaction, when regional Australia has never needed a government more active in getting projects, services and infrastructure happening so that we get jobs moving again in regional Australia, which is the absolute top priority for so much of our country. As I get around regional Queensland, as I very often do, the things that people are constantly telling me they want this government focused on are getting jobs, particularly for young people, and getting new projects up and running. But no ideas are coming forward from this government, no money is being spent out of its programs, and the minister doesn't have the capacity to make decisions to get the projects and spending happening.


People in regional Queensland want better health care, particularly mental health care. I was in Rockhampton only last week, talking to young people about their need for better mental health care. It's not happening under this government. They're not getting training and apprenticeship opportunities. These are the things that regional Australia wants; these are the things which Labor is coming forward on a regular basis with policies for. We need a minister who is not distracted.

Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (15:18):  I will begin by supporting the words of my colleague from Tasmania. Senator Nash is an extraordinary senator and an extraordinary minister. She is a great representative of New South Wales, a fine role model and an honest minister, extraordinarily hardworking and extremely competent. She is genuinely making a difference to people's lives in regional Australia. The personal targeting of Senator Nash by those opposite in the last couple of days, the last couple of question times, is nothing short of scandalous. To discuss the issue of her citizenship over and over again is little more than opportunistic at best and certainly grubby at worst. The only time, Senator Watt, that Senator Nash's citizenship is a distraction is in question time.


In fact, for the last two days we have seen incredible tactics by those opposite. Coincidentally, before today, it seemed that almost all the questions from those opposite came from female senators, which I think was scandalous—a warped schoolyard mentality that those opposite should be ashamed of. At least today, although it was disingenuous in the extreme, you used the shroud of policy to cover up your criticisms of Senator Nash. It is quite amazing that those opposite continue to discuss issues of no interest to ordinary Australians. Senator Watt came in here talking about what's important to his state, yet he continues to talk about section 44. I can assure you section 44 is of no interest to anybody in Townsville or Bundaberg or Mackay. It's of no interest to anybody in Albany or Bunbury, for Senator Sterle. It is of absolutely no interest whatsoever to anybody in Albury or Gosford or Bathurst or Orange, for Senator Cameron. It is of no interest at all to anyone in Ceduna or Whyalla, for Senator Wong. Speaking as a senator for Victoria, it is of no interest whatsoever to anybody in Ballarat or Shepparton or Wangaratta or Geelong or Warrnambool or Hamilton. 


It is so frustrating for those of us on this side of the chamber to see Senator Nash, who does an extraordinary job in regional Australia, being attacked so unnecessarily. She was asked a question today on energy policy—how disingenuous was that? She was the wrong minister to ask that question of, and those opposite knew that. Senator Birmingham was the correct minister to ask, yet you pushed Senator Nash, asking her that question as a shroud to criticise her over her citizenship status. That is extraordinary. You know full well that, had you asked that question of Senator Birmingham, the most appropriate minister, you would have heard exactly how the Turnbull government is putting downward pressure on energy prices, with two million households getting better deals, transparency and clarity in comparing deals, intervention in the gas market that ensures domestic supply, abolition of limited merits reviews to stop the networks gaming the system, and of course the announcement of Snowy Hydro 2.0—a game-changing renewable energy policy. Mr Marles said the ALP knew that gas prices would rise when you opened the market to foreign exports. This has been a shameless deflection by Senator Cameron, shrouding Senator Nash's citizenship issue with energy policy questions. What extraordinary behaviour, rather than talking about what's important to Australians. 


What is important to Australians? This government is dealing with exactly what is important to Australians. First of all, there is a national security issue that overrides anything else. Quite frankly, we are at a point where North Korea is displaying a level of brinkmanship that we probably haven't seen since the Cuban missile crisis, yet that did not come up even once today from this opposition. No-one asked about the security threats, about the grave danger posed by North Korea and what the Turnbull government is doing about it by committing to a path of diplomatic and economic pressure. No-one asked about the economy—extraordinary. Rather than talking about promoting investment, encouraging entrepreneurship, reducing red tape and the burdensome bureaucracy, lowering taxes and supporting more jobs, you spoke again about Senator Nash. Shame on the opposition. Tomorrow, please talk about something that matters to ordinary Australians. (Time expired)

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2017-09-06,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (15:23):  Senator Nash demands that we ask her questions on issues that, as a National Party senator, we know would be dear to her heart in her own state, such as energy affordability—something that I know is on the minds of many a senator in this place. But when we ask her such questions, as we did here today, she doesn't even know that wholesale prices have doubled under her own government. That is a fairly basic thing that you would think Senator Nash would know. I actually think Senator Nash probably did know that, and in hindsight is thinking, 'That's right—wholesale prices have doubled under this government.' But the problem is that Senator Nash's mind is distracted. Her mind is currently distracted because of this citizenship fiasco that has been taking up a lot of her time, so much so that she had to put on the front page of her website a statement outlining her position in relation to this. 


Her position, unfortunately, is very different to that of her colleague Senator Canavan in that she has remained on the front bench. The big concern here is that there are a number of questions about the decisions she is making as minister while this citizenship fiasco hangs over her head. If I were in Senator Nash's position—just thinking about it for a moment—if I were a minister of the Crown and had this hanging over my head, I know what I would do. I would do exactly what Senator Canavan has done. I wouldn't remain on the front bench. I wouldn't remain holding onto ministerial decision-making. I would step down until the issues were resolved. That's my take on it as a matter of integrity and as a matter of what the right thing to do is.


But if you don't want to take my word for it, take Professor George Williams' word for it. He is, as everyone knows, the dean of a law faculty and a very much acknowledged constitutional expert. He gave an address at the National Press Club recently and explained, in great detail, the problem that hangs over Senator Nash and Senator Canavan. He advised that the wisest course of action for Minister Nash, and also Minister Joyce, was to not only refrain from decision-making but also step down, pending the outcome of the High Court hearing. That, I think, would be the most sensible thing for Senator Nash to do, after the expose that we had today from her and that we've had on subsequent days this week in relation to her efforts in answering some pretty basic questions about things that she should know.


Unfortunately, we have a glass-jaw attitude going on with Senator Nash. She's dug herself into a hole and probably feels that it's too late for her to step down. Well, it's not too late for her to step down. We're only talking about a month or so until the High Court hearing occurs. She needs to reflect that there is an inconsistency at the moment in the National Party with what has occurred in relation to Senator Canavan, who did resign, and Senator Nash and the Deputy Prime Minister, who have not done so. The number of questions that leaves unanswered really makes the government look like a shambles.


I will share the analogy that Senator Kitching used the other day for this whole dual citizenship fiasco. She said that it reminded her of Star Wars, when the emperor was dead, Darth Vader was dying and the Death Star was crashing—that is this government. I think that's quite a fitting analogy. Not that I'm a huge Star Wars goer, but I can see the characters and connection that one could make with such a situation because of what we've ended up with here. What we've had is a huge distraction today from Senator Nash. I'm sure she's embarrassed, and I think— (Time expired)

 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (15:38):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator GALLAGHER:
  Father's Day is a fantastic tradition that honours the role that father figures play in our lives and, particularly, in the lives of children. Free TV has clarified in a statement that it asked for an authorisation to be included at the end of a proposed advertisement by Dads4Kids, but Dads4Kids declined, so the advertisement did not run. During debate in the other place just last night on a government bill to expand authorisation requirements, authorisations were described by the government's own members as 'necessary to ensure our democracy'. Dads4Kids actively advocates against marriage equality and LGBTIQ rights. At a time when Australians are about to participate in a postal survey on marriage equality, it is understandable why Free TV believed it was appropriate for it to include an authorisation. If anyone is politicising Father's Day, it's the senators who have moved this motion.

Senator RICE:
  The Greens will also not be supporting this motion, but not because we don't support Father's Day. We think Father's Day is a terrific institution, but the motion, as worded, is factually incorrect. A father singing a lullaby to his child is not political, and any notion suggesting that honouring the role of the father on Father's Day as political is incorrect. However, Dads4Kids, the organisation behind the advertisement, has campaigned heavily against marriage equality and also advocates in support of gay conversion theory. So it is very clear in the context of the current debate about marriage equality, the campaigning about marriage equality and the postal plebiscite, that this advertisement needed an authorisation. We are in a different environment this year than at the same time as Father's Day last year. It is very clear that an authorisation is needed. It's standard practice for political broadcast advertising.

Senator SESELJA:

I rise in response to the objections to this motion of the Labor Party and the Greens, and in relation to what Senator Gallagher had to say. Those ads have been running for many years, uncontroversially it seems. Any objective observer looking at those ads would say that something simply promoting fatherhood and Father's Day and encouraging men to be good dads is not political. To suggest now that that is somehow political and therefore needs a political authorisation is ridiculous. That's what this motion is highlighting. I find it extraordinary that the Labor Party and the Greens wouldn't support this. I think the vast majority of Australians would look at the idea that Father's Day is now a political statement, and supporting Father's Day is now a political statement, as being absolutely absurd.

The speech read as follows—



AGED CARE AMENDMENT (RATIO OF SKILLED STAFF TO CARE RECIPIENTS) BILL 2017


Elderly Australians have contributed valiantly to society, and throughout their lives have helped make Australia the great country it is. They have worked, volunteered, paid taxes and raised families. Some have been to war, and many live with the scars. Unfortunately, many of these Australians who have given so much to society are highly vulnerable, and are not currently guaranteed the standard of care they deserve within our aged care facilities. 


The Aged Care Act 1997 fails to prescribe a minimum staffing standard for Australian Government funded aged care residential facilities, and does not specify what constitutes 'appropriately skilled and qualified staff' for the purpose of providing care. New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria prescribe staffing requirements for some residential aged care facilities, but all elderly Australians deserve the best level of care when they can no longer live independently, and instead rely on others for their health, protection and wellbeing.


It's hardly surprising that international research suggests that higher Registered Nurse staffing levels, higher total staffing levels and a high skills mix (ratio of Registered Nurses to other nursing staff) are associated with better quality care. And that is what this amendment is seeking to do; to enhance the level of care provided by aged care facilities nation-wide. The majority of aged care staff in Australia are personal care attendants (PCAs) or community care workers (CCWs), with a declining share of registered nurses (RNs) over the last decade or more. In 2016 the average total care hours worked per resident per day were 2.9 hours. 


This Bill introduces the concept of a mandated ratio of skilled staff to care recipients in Australia's aged care residential facilities. The task of calculating a safe and specific ratio (including providing for variables such as day and night shifts, higher and lower care residents, and for metropolitan, rural and regional areas) should be undertaken by the Department of Health in consultation with the aged care sector, and included in the Quality of Care Principles. 


The passage of this Bill would be an important step in moving towards an aged care system that is more focussed on the protection of the elderly than on profit margins of aged care facilities.

  I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

 (Queensland) (17:13):  I present an interim report of the Economics References Committee on non-conforming building products.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator KETTER:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


I rise to table the interim report as part of the non-conforming building product inquiry. It is a sobering report, brought about by the events of the Lacrosse apartment building fire in 2014 and the tragic circumstances of the Grenfell Tower fire earlier this year. It is not acceptable in 2017 that people are injured and killed in their own homes. Homes should be places of safety, laughter, joy and community. To have lives put at risk or even lost in modern times is completely unacceptable. We can do better and we must do better. 


Throughout this inquiry, we've heard from a number of different stakeholders, and the number of process failures when it comes to construction is utterly bewildering. As Senator Carr, whom I thank for his participation in this inquiry, succinctly put it: 'Over the last few decades, there has been a plethora of deregulation and privatisation. Proper controls, audits and enforcement were not carefully put in place when deregulation and privatisation was carried out. The issue of dangerous, flammable polyethylene cladding is really just a symptom of much bigger problems.' We will continue to tackle these bigger problems through the rest of the inquiry, but for now we have this interim report, which I think highlights the problems that are occurring, and some sensible recommendations that can protect the Australian people.


I'll turn to the problems that we have found with the use of this aluminium cladding. First, there is little accountability for non-conforming and non-compliant products in the supply chain. We heard evidence that importers and suppliers often have very little knowledge of where this cladding ends up—that it's used only in situations that conform to the National Construction Code. I am heartened by the fact that, in my home state, the Queensland government is moving to put accountability into the supply chain for importers, wholesalers and retailers when it comes to the sale of building products. This draft legislation from Queensland has been well received by most stakeholders, and I hope that it is implemented across the nation. Second, we heard evidence that certificates in many instances cannot be trusted. Fraudulent certificates seem to be rife, and the certificates do not contain significant information to explain where it is appropriate to use these products. 


The problems don't stop there. When it comes to product standards, the current cladding standard falls far short. Australian standard AS 1530.1 conducts only small-scale testing and doesn't actually provide a good guide as to how a product will perform under a full-scale fire. At this point, I do commend the Four Corners program this week, which highlighted this particular issue in some depth. The structure of the National Construction Code also has numerous ways in which unscrupulous builders might circumvent reasonable requirements when it comes to fire protections. In the words of one of the witnesses:


The Building Code is too complicated. It is contradictory, with no hierarchy of control for various clauses which compete with each other.


There were also concerns raised about a lack of standards for licensing, with many roles requiring little in terms of education and professional development, and some roles having no licensing requirements at all. In fact, in 2003, the Queensland Labor state government brought in licensing for wall cladding installers, which seems to be an important reason that more of this cladding isn't occurring in Queensland. It was actually one of the suppliers in our inquiry who made the point, I think, from recollection, that around 70 per cent of the cladding installed is done by one of four licensed installers of cladding. Substitution of non-compliant cladding is apparently rife throughout Australia, particularly since polyethylene cladding is slightly cheaper. It seems that cost dominates many of the decisions taken in the building industry, to the detriment of end consumers and the wider public. 


When it comes to building surveyors, those entrusted with keeping an eye on builders, we heard about problems there, too. We heard concerning evidence that surveyors are often in a situation where they do only visual inspections on sites and are often unable to verify the cladding type once the cladding is installed and sealed up, so they are not actually able to see if it is fire-resistant cladding or another form of cladding. Other stakeholders shared concerns about surveyors being not much more than certificate collectors, constrained to trusting electronic certificates sent by email.


We also heard concerns that many surveyors are paid for by the builders, which makes it all the more difficult for a surveyor to challenge a builder where they suspect nonconformance or noncompliance. In the end, this leaves much of the risk of nonconformance and noncompliance with the owners. In many cases body corporates are not formed until after the construction is complete and are left with hidden faults that emerge many years after any warranties have expired. The Owners Corporation Network lamented that there is a greater duty of care in the sale of a refrigerator than in the delivery of people's homes. No matter where you turn in this industry, you can find people trying to evade their responsibilities and place the blame somewhere else, and in the case of flammable cladding the process hasn't failed in just one place—it has failed at almost every point of the chain. That is why there needs to be a multifaceted approach to addressing this issue, which I will address now. 


Let's talk about the recommendations in the report. Polyethylene ACP cladding can currently be installed in low-rise buildings and signage. We have to trust that people are not using it in inappropriate circumstances, like high-rises. The committee has come to the conclusion that the public risks associated with this product outweigh the benefits that it can provide, so our first recommendation is that the government implement a total ban. For a small additional cost we can remove the risk entirely. 


The second major area is licensing. Some accountability needs to rest with the people responsible for installing building products as well as people such as building surveyors, building inspectors, builders and project managers. If there is a threat that people might lose their licence if they don't comply with the codes, then we stand a better chance. It would seem that the federal government has the capacity under the training regime in terms of Commonwealth funding powers. There is a need for national licensing, for a high bar to be set for qualifications and for it to be harmonised across the states to improve productivity. The federal government can and should act in this area. The committee has also recommended that accountability for others in the supply chain be strengthened, with the Queensland legislation—the Building and Construction Legislation (Non-conforming Building Products—Chain of Responsibility and Other Matters) Amendment Bill 2017—being a very good starting point. In fact, I don't think any witnesses in the course of the inquiry provided any negative feedback on the Queensland bill. 


When it comes to Australian standards, we heard evidence that the prohibitive costs of purchasing building product and meeting construction standards can also inhibit strong code compliance. I have urged the government to consider making Australian standards free for users. In response to the issue of strata properties, often high-density apartment blocks, I have recommended that a duty of care be extended to strata communities so that builders and developers have the responsibility to deliver compliant buildings to end-user apartment owners. Regarding Commonwealth-funded construction projects, the committee has recommended that the new Federal Safety Commissioner be given adequate resources to carry out audits against the National Construction Code performance requirements for building materials. In addition, there should be a penalties regime for noncompliance. Commonwealth-funded construction should be done according to the national code. 


In summary, the issue is a very sobering one. We can debate many issues in this chamber, some more trivial than others, but this report goes directly to the safety of the Australian people. In line with this, I would encourage Minister Laundy to do his job as minister. Along with this report I have tabled a letter in which the minister has bizarrely requested the committee to investigate the claims made throughout our public hearings. Memo to the minister: you are the minister, you are part of the government, you control the regulators and it is on you to fix this mess. It is not the responsibility of a parliamentary committee.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (17:24):  I concur with Senator Ketter, the chair of this inquiry by the Economics Reference Committee, and commend him for the work that he's done—and, of course, I commend the work of the secretariat and my colleagues. This very important inquiry on non-conforming building products was instigated several years ago, at the end of 2015, and that involved my then colleague Senator John Madigan and Senator Lambie. The trigger for this inquiry was the Lacrosse building fire in Melbourne in November 2014. It was due to luck alone that no lives were lost in that fire. The committee quite rightly revisited the issue of cladding following the awful tragedy of the Grenfell Tower fire in London in June this year. This inquiry is very timely and very urgent. I agree with everything Senator Ketter has said about the need for urgent action in relation to this.


It is up to the government, it is up to the minister and it is up to the states to take immediate action in relation to this. If the government won't act, the next step will be to have an amendment to the Customs Act in terms of safer building products so that, once and for all, we can ban polyethylene building products coming into this country. We don't need them. We can go without them. The cost differential between the two per square metre is minuscule. That is the evidence the inquiry has heard. It would ensure that these products are not used in high-rise buildings. At the moment, the flammable material can be used for shop fittings; it can be used on single-storey buildings. But why let them into the country in the first place? The cost involved would be negligible in terms of having a fire retardant, a material that is actually safe, so that you will not effectively have buildings wrapped in petrol.


On a recent episode of Four Corners, fire safety engineer Tony Enright stated:


A kilogram of polyethylene will release the same amount of energy as a kilogram of petrol, and it gets worse than that because polyethylene is denser than petrol too, so that's about, a kilogram of polyethylene is like about one and a bit, one and a half litres of petrol. … If you look at a one metre by one metre square section—


of PE core cladding—


that will have about three kilograms, the equivalent of about five litres of petrol.


People live in these buildings and sleep there overnight. So why would we have any of those buildings effectively wrapped in petrol? That is what we are talking about. There must be immediate action in relation to this.


That is why this inquiry has been so important. Everything that the chair has said is spot-on. We need to make sure that we have action by the states and the Commonwealth in relation to this as a matter of urgency. Unless the states act with alacrity, with a great sense of urgency, the way to stop this from occurring is to stop bringing this stuff into the country. But that still leaves thousands of buildings that have this cladding. There must be that audit. I am not satisfied that the audit has been as comprehensive as it could have been.


We asked questions of the South Australian government—I think they were questions by Senator Hume—about the new Royal Adelaide Hospital, the two magnificent buildings. We should have been told immediately what sort of cladding they had, because there is an audit that is occurring on that. I think the government has assured us there isn't a problem. But this is information a government should have at its fingertips with an audit. So ban the stuff from coming into the country from now on, and let's have a comprehensive audit so remediation can be carried out and people can live and work safely in these buildings.


This report is of utmost urgency. The committee has done its work—and I note that Senator Carr was a very active participant on this committee. We have done our work. We have issued the warnings. We have said there is no excuse not to act. Let us hope that governments federal, state and territory do not hesitate to act on the recommendations of this inquiry to do what is necessary to protect public safety. We cannot, under any circumstances, bear the tragedy that occurred in London just a few months ago. We must prevent any risk of that happening here. That is why this report is of utmost public importance and urgency and we must act on it.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (17:29):  This report of the Economics References Committee on non-conforming building products is one of those seminal reports that the Senate has an opportunity to deal with from time to time. I know a great deal of public debate occurs about the role of the Senate. I think there is often undue criticism paid to the way the Senate operates. One of the most important functions the Senate has, and I think the real secret of the Senate's power in this country, is the power of exposure. Senator Ketter, as the chair of this committee, has led it through a daunting series of public hearings and through the examination of submissions from over 160 submitters. 


I have been here a few years now and I can say to you that it is rare that you have an opportunity to see evidence presented to a Senate committee from such a diverse group of people in an area of the Australian economy that's often renowned for its division and diversity. But, in this case, what's remarkable is the uniformity of views. As a participant in this inquiry, I have been struck by how broadly based the concerns of the building practitioners have been. Whether it be employer organisations, unions or consumer groups, a very powerful concern has been expressed about the systematic failure of the regulatory regime in this country to deal with fundamental issues of public safety. 


The real anxiety that I have here is that there is an opportunity for this parliament to put an end to the buck-passing on what, for some time, has been a litany of abrogations of responsibilities by just about everybody concerned with the building industry. It is a common feature of this industry that someone always has somebody else to blame. The circumstances around the Lacrosse fire in Melbourne highlighted something in this country, whereby a fire started by a cigarette butt spread within 11 minutes across 23 storeys of a residential building. We were incredibly lucky that no-one was killed in that circumstance. The firefighters who witnessed that, men of extraordinary experience—31 years experience—said that was the most devastating fire they've ever witnessed in an urban area. That testimony was repeated many times over by senior firefighters across the country. This is in the circumstance where we saw the recent events in the United Kingdom, where a fire tragically killed 80 people, highlighting once again the use of this plastic-centred aluminium cladding, which essentially explodes. 


There have been 19 significant fires like this in multi-storey buildings around the world. In one case in Dubai, a building caught fire twice. There have been a number of fires in Australia, including a couple in Melbourne. According to the evidence, at least 10,000 buildings across the country contain this building material. According to the evidence, we have here a systematic failure as a result of the privatisation and the deregulation of the building industry, which has led to what is now clearly a major problem of public safety in this country. What we have is an abrogation of responsibilities where governments have been, essentially, seeking to refer this to one committee of procrastinators after another so that nothing actually gets dealt with. Senator Ketter has drawn our attention to what's happened in Queensland, and I commend the Queensland government for at least making that effort. They're the only government in the country that have actually made an effort. In the case of Victoria, litigations are continuing about the Lacrosse fire nearly four years after the event.


When you talk to officials about these things, they don't dispute the evidence. It's not as if people are saying, 'No, this is not happening.' They are not saying that there hasn't been widespread document fraud, widespread certification fraud or widespread substitution of products. When you ask officials, for instance, from the Victorian Building Authority, they say, 'Yes, it's true'. They acknowledge it. When you ask, 'How many prosecutions have there been for fraud?' they say, 'We know of one with some evidence.' There's no-one taking action here, so, in the circumstances in Melbourne, it's the residents of the Lacrosse building who are now left responsible for removing this cladding.


This is cladding which was, according to the evidence before the committee, saving $3 a square metre. It's going to cost billions to take this stuff down. That's an extraordinary proposition. Audits have been undertaken across the country and governments all over the country are trying to duck and weave when it comes to how many buildings are involved. There are 2½ thousand, according to a leaked submission, in New South Wales alone. So our recommendations go to some pretty simple propositions here. In the first instance, this is stuff that's so dangerous that it can't be used in low-rise buildings. It's just not justified to be used in low-rise buildings. Everyone acknowledges that it should not be used in high-rise buildings, which it has been. When you ask the simple question, 'How does that occur?' people say, 'It is compliant for low-rise buildings.' It shouldn't be. It should be banned, and that's the recommendation of the committee.


Just like asbestos, this stuff—the plastic cores—is too dangerous to be used for the external cladding of buildings. We are saying that we have to bring public accountability back into the system for public safety in the building industry. There has to be a national licensing authority to secure that. In the medical industry, if a doctor's caught doing malpractice, they lose their licence and are deregistered. This committee's recommending to the parliament that that's one way of bringing back public accountability into the building industry for all building practitioners. We're saying that, if you want to breach the code, there ought to be penalties for breaching the code with regard to Commonwealth buildings.


The Office of the Federal Safety Commissioner that's in place there is an absolute paper tiger. It has no real authority, no real powers and no real resources. It is a complete joke of an office. For Commonwealth-funded buildings, that should change. We should ensure that actions are put in place. The Commonwealth Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science is the responsible minister for the Building Ministers' Forum. He should not only take responsibility for this but also ensure that the supply chain is actually brought back into this. We should ensure that Australian standards and the products of their work—particularly the building codes themselves—are available to the industry, but not at such prohibitive prices as to make them unavailable.


This is an important inquiry that's making recommendations to the parliament which I trust the political parties will take up. It provides an opportunity to restore public confidence and public accountability for public safety and provides an opportunity for this parliament to show real leadership, because clearly this government has failed to do so. The assistant minister's letter to the committee suggesting that it was the parliamentary committee's responsibility to police breaches of the code is a complete joke, and it demonstrates why this government just doesn't understand its own responsibilities to prosecute people who have broken the law. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (17:13):  I present an interim report of the Economics References Committee on non-conforming building products.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator KETTER:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


I rise to table the interim report as part of the non-conforming building product inquiry. It is a sobering report, brought about by the events of the Lacrosse apartment building fire in 2014 and the tragic circumstances of the Grenfell Tower fire earlier this year. It is not acceptable in 2017 that people are injured and killed in their own homes. Homes should be places of safety, laughter, joy and community. To have lives put at risk or even lost in modern times is completely unacceptable. We can do better and we must do better.

There's no-one taking action here, so, in the circumstances in Melbourne, it's the residents of the Lacrosse building who are now left responsible for removing this cladding.


This is cladding which was, according to the evidence before the committee, saving $3 a square metre. It's going to cost billions to take this stuff down. That's an extraordinary proposition. Audits have been undertaken across the country and governments all over the country are trying to duck and weave when it comes to how many buildings are involved. There are 2½ thousand, according to a leaked submission, in New South Wales alone. So our recommendations go to some pretty simple propositions here. In the first instance, this is stuff that's so dangerous that it can't be used in low-rise buildings. It's just not justified to be used in low-rise buildings. Everyone acknowledges that it should not be used in high-rise buildings, which it has been. When you ask the simple question, 'How does that occur?' people say, 'It is compliant for low-rise buildings.' It shouldn't be. It should be banned, and that's the recommendation of the committee.


Just like asbestos, this stuff—the plastic cores—is too dangerous to be used for the external cladding of buildings. We are saying that we have to bring public accountability back into the system for public safety in the building industry. There has to be a national licensing authority to secure that. In the medical industry, if a doctor's caught doing malpractice, they lose their licence and are deregistered. This committee's recommending to the parliament that that's one way of bringing back public accountability into the building industry for all building practitioners. We're saying that, if you want to breach the code, there ought to be penalties for breaching the code with regard to Commonwealth buildings.


The Office of the Federal Safety Commissioner that's in place there is an absolute paper tiger. It has no real authority, no real powers and no real resources. It is a complete joke of an office. For Commonwealth-funded buildings, that should change. We should ensure that actions are put in place. The Commonwealth Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science is the responsible minister for the Building Ministers' Forum. He should not only take responsibility for this but also ensure that the supply chain is actually brought back into this. We should ensure that Australian standards and the products of their work—particularly the building codes themselves—are available to the industry, but not at such prohibitive prices as to make them unavailable.


This is an important inquiry that's making recommendations to the parliament which I trust the political parties will take up. It provides an opportunity to restore public confidence and public accountability for public safety and provides an opportunity for this parliament to show real leadership, because clearly this government has failed to do so. The assistant minister's letter to the committee suggesting that it was the parliamentary committee's responsibility to police breaches of the code is a complete joke, and it demonstrates why this government just doesn't understand its own responsibilities to prosecute people who have broken the law. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

The speeches read as follows—



COMPETITION AND CONSUMER AMENDMENT (COMPETITION POLICY REVIEW) BILL 2017


This Bill contains a significant package of reforms to the Competition and Consumer Act 2010. These reforms are designed to simplify the law and better deal with anti‑competitive conduct while supporting pro-competitive behaviour. They will strengthen Australia's competition law to improve the long term welfare of consumers, businesses and the economy.


In 2014, the Government commissioned an independent 'root and branch' review into Australia's competition framework: the Harper Competition Policy Review. Professor Ian Harper and the review Panel consulted extensively with businesses, consumers, regulators and legal experts and found that while our competition laws have served Australia well, they should be reformed to enhance their effectiveness. This Bill implements a significant number of the competition law reforms recommended by the Harper Review and agreed to by the Government in its response. It also implements the recommendations made by the Productivity Commission in its 2013 Inquiry into the National Access Regime, which the Government accepted in its response to the Harper Review.


Schedule 1 to this Bill amends the definition of 'competition' in section 4 of the Act to confirm that competition includes competition from goods and services that are capable of importation, as well as those actually imported. This change clarifies that a credible threat of import competition is relevant to competition analysis.


Schedule 2 to this Bill amends the Act to simplify and better target the provisions on cartel conduct. This includes changes to confine the application of the provisions to cartel conduct affecting competition in Australian markets, and to change the scope of the joint venture exceptions to ensure that they do not limit legitimate commercial transactions or increase business compliance costs. 


Schedule 3 to this Bill repeals the price signalling provisions. Since their introduction in 2012, no cases have been brought under these provisions. 


The price signalling provisions are replaced with a general prohibition on corporations engaging in a concerted practice that has the purpose, effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition. 


This prohibition will capture anti-competitive conduct that falls short of a contract, arrangement or understanding as the courts have interpreted each of those terms in section 45. An exception is provided where the only parties to a concerted practice are the Crown and one or more government authorities. 


Schedule 3 also repeals the separate prohibition on exclusionary provisions from the Act, which substantially overlaps with the cartel prohibitions in the Act.


Schedule 4 to this Bill repeals the definition of 'exclusionary provision' and a defence to the prohibition on exclusionary provisions, following the repeal of this prohibition by Schedule 3. 


Schedule 5 to this Bill simplifies the provisions of the Act by removing separate, complex prohibitions on covenants that substantially lessen competition and expanding the general prohibition on contracts that substantially lessen competition to include covenants.


Schedule 6 amends the Act to increase the maximum penalty for breaching the secondary boycott provisions, so that it aligns with penalties for other breaches of the competition law. As secondary boycotts are harmful to trading freedom and therefore harmful to competition, they warrant a significant penalty. 


Schedule 7 to this Bill amends the Act to prohibit third line forcing only where it has the purpose, effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition. This will bring the prohibition on third line forcing in line with the similar prohibition on second line forcing and with other comparable jurisdictions, including the United States, Canada, the European Union and New Zealand.


Schedule 8 to this Bill amends the Act to allow a corporation or person to notify the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission of resale price maintenance conduct, as an alternative to seeking authorisation from the Commission for such conduct. It is appropriate to make notification available for resale price maintenance conduct because this conduct may in some circumstances be pro-competitive, and notification is a quicker and less expensive means of obtaining an exemption than authorisation. 


Schedule 8 also provides an exemption from the resale price maintenance prohibition for conduct between related bodies corporate, reflecting that companies within a corporate group are not considered to be competitors.


Schedule 9 to this Bill makes a number of amendments to the Act. It simplifies the complex provisions governing the authorisation process. It makes the Commission the decision maker at first instance for merger authorisations, as it is best suited to make these decisions. It also grants the Commission the power to issue a 'class exemption' for business practices that are unlikely to raise competition concerns, or are likely to generate a net public benefit. This will remove the need for individual applications for authorisation by creating 'safe harbours' for business and thereby reduce compliance and administration costs and increase certainty.


Schedule 9 also allows the Commission to impose conditions on notifications for collective bargaining that involves collective boycott conduct, and grants the Commission a power to issue a 'stop notice' requiring notified collective boycott conduct to cease. 


These reforms will introduce greater flexibility into the collective bargaining notification process to ensure that it is more widely used. This is likely to be of particular benefit to small businesses, given their lack of bargaining power relative to larger suppliers. The Commission may also impose conditions on notifications for resale price maintenance.


Schedule 10 to this Bill extends section 83 of the Act so that a party bringing certain proceedings may rely on admissions of fact as well as findings of fact made in certain other proceedings. This will help to reduce the cost of private actions, as a person relying on a previous admission of fact as prima facie evidence will not need to establish that fact.


Schedule 11 to this Bill extends the Commission's power to obtain information, documents and evidence in section 155 to cover investigations of alleged contraventions of court enforceable undertakings and merger authorisation determinations. 


Schedule 11 also introduces a 'reasonable search' defence to the offence of refusing or failing to comply with section 155. This reflects the increasing cost of documentary searches as businesses retain many more documents, such as emails, than in the past. 


Schedule 11 also increases the fine for non‑compliance with section 155 to bring it into line with penalties for similar notice-based investigative powers. 


Schedule 12 amends Part IIIA of the Act, which contains the National Access Regime, to implement the recommendations made by the Productivity Commission in its Inquiry into the Regime. This will ensure that the Regime better target the economic problem of an enduring lack of effective competition in markets for nationally significant infrastructure services. Schedule 12 amends and clarifies the declaration criteria that must be used by the National Competition Council and the designated Minister in determining whether a service should be declared. Notably, the current 'private profitability' test is replaced by a 'natural monopoly' test. Schedule 12 also introduces a new power for the Minister to revoke certification of a state access regime.


Schedule 13 to this Bill deals with the transitional application of amendments made by the Bill.


Schedule 14 to this Bill makes various amendments to streamline the administration of the Act, to reduce compliance burdens for business, individuals and Government, while preserving the protections available under the Act. These amendments focus on the requirements of the Australian Consumer Law.


Together, these reforms contained in the Bill will strengthen, simplify and modernise our competition laws. The reforms will support the enforcement role of our national competition regulator and facilitate pro-competitive conduct to the long-term benefit of Australian businesses, consumers and the economy. 


Full details of the measure are contained in the explanatory memorandum.


INTERNATIONAL MONETARY AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT (NEW ARRANGEMENTS TO BORROW) BILL 2017


Today, I introduce a Bill to amend the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947 to renew the International Monetary Fund's New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB). 


These amendments will ensure that the standing appropriation and authority to borrow that allows the Government to make payments to the IMF under the current NAB will continue for the renewed arrangement.


The NAB is a multilateral borrowing agreement that under its renewal will provide a line of credit to the IMF of around A$329 billion from 37 participant countries or institutions, including Australia. 


Australia joined the NAB as a founding member in 1997. On 4 November 2016, the IMF Executive Board agreed to renew the NAB for a period of five years, from its current expiry date of 16 November 2017 to 16 November 2022. 


Australia's funding commitments of around A$4.05 billion will remain unchanged under the renewed NAB. The broader terms and conditions of the NAB will also remain largely unchanged. 


The NAB has already been used numerous times to help manage crises, including assistance to developing, transitioning and advanced member countries.


The renewal of the NAB forms part of a broader global effort to maintain the current level of IMF resourcing, to ensure that it has sufficient financial resources available to effectively fulfil its global role in economic crisis prevention and resolution. 


Ensuring that the IMF has sufficient financial resources in place provides confidence to markets and other economic actors that the IMF has the resources it needs to continue to play its role effectively. This is an important factor that underpins ongoing confidence to trade and invest. 


As a successful open trading economy, Australia's prosperity relies on strong and stable growth in the world economy. 


Full details of the measure are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum.


Debate adjourned.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Social Services and Multicultural Affairs) (19:20):  Dainere Anthoney was a very special young lady. Earlier today I was pleased to have the opportunity to launch Dainere's 'rainbow' bus outside Parliament House. I have spoken in this House before about Dainere's story and the amazing work her family have done to continue her legacy and to bring some hope and progress in the wake of her tragic passing four years ago. I am grateful that today's bus launch gives me the opportunity to once again share her story and highlight the need for more brain tumour research.


Dainere Anthoney was a bright young girl who lived her whole life in Canberra. In 2009, she was diagnosed with high-risk medulloblastoma. I was fortunate to meet Dainere not long after her diagnosis in 2010 at the launch of her book You Have to Go Through a Storm to Get to a Rainbow. While high-dose radiation and chemotherapy helped her for a brief time, in February 2012 she suffered an inoperable and incurable recurrence of the disease in her spine, with palliative care the only option. On 24 June 2013, Dainere passed away at the age of 15. Dainere's family decided to honour her by creating the Dainere's Rainbow Brain Tumour Research Fund, which assists the research team led by Dr David Ziegler, Dainere's oncologist, in their work to improve treatment and to find a cure for this shocking disease. Their research is vital because each year more than 950 children and adolescents are diagnosed with brain cancer. The sad truth is that no significant improvement has been made in survival rates in almost three decades.


Dainere's bus is a Qcity Transit bus that will have her foundation's design and branding for the next five years, a very generous donation from Qcity buses. The bus will do regular routes in Queanbeyan and Canberra, spreading awareness of Dainere's foundation. The bus has been launched in September, commemorating Go Gold month, which also helps to raise awareness of brain tumours in young people and the need for more research. I would encourage everyone to wear a gold ribbon or share Dainere's story on social media to encourage this great cause.


Before I finish, I would also like to take a moment to thank John Mikita for all the work he does for Dainere's foundation and Steve Bushby and Qcity buses for their generous support for the foundation, as well as the other businesses that have jumped on board to help out, specifically Screenmakers Pty Ltd and TransitGraphics. Finally I would like to acknowledge Dainere's family—her parents, Stephen and Yvonne, her brother, Jarrett, and her sister, Nalani, for their tireless work in continuing her legacy.


Last week I had the privilege of supporting another great cause—and that was R U OK? Day—by attending an afternoon tea as part of the R U OK? conversation convoy which has been traversing Australia in the lead-up to R U OK? Day next week. The afternoon tea was generously hosted by His Excellency Sir Peter Cosgrove and Lady Cosgrove, at Government House. To have it take place in such an illustrious setting shows the success R U OK? Day has had in quite literally changing the conversation around suicide. It also of course goes to the great work that our Governor-General and Lady Cosgrove do for so many organisations.


It is likely that every single one of us in this place has been affected in one way or another by suicide and mental illness in our lives and the lives of those close to us. In so many of those situations, how often were we not even aware that a family member or friend was doing it tough? It is that silence about mental health that R U OK? Day seeks to directly address. It is a day when we can look out for each other and ask that simple question: are you okay?


Sometimes when someone is struggling they just need a friend, a family member, a work colleague—anyone—to notice them and listen to them. I have been grateful to work with R U OK's CEO, Brendon Maher, over the years on events and initiatives that help get the message out even further than it already has. I want to acknowledge other members of the R U OK Day board, who have worked so hard on this worthy cause, including Michael Connaghan, Graeme Cowan, Barry Du Bois, Kathryn Howard, Jack Singleton, Mark Soulos, Helen Christensen, David Liddiard, Janina Nearn and, last but not least, Aya Larkin and the entire Larkin family, for their dedication to helping others and making sure that Gavin's legacy was strong and had a positive impact in our community. 


So next week, on 14 September, I would encourage everyone here, anyone listening and anyone reading Hansard to take part in R U OK Day, not only by helping raise awareness about the day and about breaking the silence on mental health but also by being a good friend, neighbour, member of the community and colleague, and ask those around you if they are okay. 


As part of my duties as Assistant Minister for Social Services and Multicultural Affairs, I have the great opportunity to visit and meet with a whole range of diverse communities around Australia and to take part in some of their important celebrations. One of those unique opportunities took place on 12 August, when I was invited to be a guest at the St Alexander Nevsky Russian School debutante ball in Sydney. The school, in Homebush in Sydney, is the largest Russian school in Australia, with 185 students and 25 teachers. The school was founded in 1971 and teaches students from pre-kindergarten through to year 10, who attend their ordinary school during the week and take classes in the St Alexander Nevsky Russian School on Saturdays. Since 1973, the New South Wales government have supported the school through their use of the premises of Homebush Public School. 


The school is focused on maintaining their Russian traditions and Orthodox faith through teaching the Russian language and history, studying the fundamentals of Orthodox scripture and teaching Russian singing, dancing and art classes. The debutante ball is the school's main fundraiser and community event, and it's a chance for the students who are soon to move on from the school to be presented to the Russian-Australian community and to celebrate their impending entry into adulthood. It is also a great chance for the students to honour their heritage, their families and their community and to celebrate their place in Australia as one of the great multicultural societies in the world. 


I would like to acknowledge the efforts of the debutantes. I won't name them all, but I would say that they were outstanding in the way they presented themselves and the way they represented their school and their community. The dancing was extraordinary. They were just amazing young people. Debutante balls are one of those older traditions, of course, but this is something that is very important to this community, something they have done over many years, and it was certainly wonderful to join with them in that. I was joined by Russian ambassador to Australia, and also my predecessor as multicultural affairs minister and local member, Craig Laundy, and a couple of our good local New South Wales representatives in Victor Dominello and John Sidoti. 


I would like to take the opportunity to thank head teacher Galina Harrison and president of the parents' committee, Nicholas Maksymow, for the work they do at the school. I was really taken by their commitment to the school and the great commitment that so many people put in. This Russian school is one of many of these language schools that we have right around the country. They are so often staffed by volunteers, people who want to keep that connection to the country of their parents, grandparents or great-grandparents. I think it's a wonderful thing. It is one of the things that make Australia the great multicultural nation that it is, that people can come to Australia and feel very much that they are part of Australia. They can integrate into Australia, but they can also hold onto the language and culture from where they have come and from where their ancestors have come. I congratulate all involved in the event and thank them very much for the great hospitality that was shown to me.
