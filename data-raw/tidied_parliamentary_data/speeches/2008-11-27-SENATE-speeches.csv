"Ludwig, Sen Joe (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",ALP,2008-11-27,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (8) of standing order 111 not apply to the Corporations Amendment (Short Selling) Bill 2008 and the Tax Laws Amendment (Luxury Car Tax—Minor Amendments) Bill 2008, allowing them to be considered during this period of sittings.
I also table statements of reasons justifying the need for these bills to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statements incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statements read as follows—

Corporations Amendment (Short Selling) Bill 2008


Purpose of the bill

The bill ensures that covered short sales (those short sales which are supported by securities lending agreements) are disclosed and to enhance the powers of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) to deal with short selling regulation and disclosure arrangements.

Reasons for Urgency

To ensure the reporting of covered short sales and enhance ASIC’s powers in relation to short selling, as soon as possible. The under reporting of covered short selling has caused significant concern and uncertainty in the marketplace and may have provided opportunities for market misconduct. Continued uncertainty would be detrimental to confidence in the market and could cause harm to investors. These problems have been amplified by the current volatility being experienced in global financial markets. This resulted in ASIC taking temporary action to limit short selling in Australia. These circumstances have increased the urgency to establish an effective legislative regime for the disclosure of covered short sales and to enhance ASIC’s powers in this area as a means of restoring transparency and market confidence.
The Prime Minister, in his speech to the Confederation of British Industry, noted the recent volatility in stock markets has been exacerbated by the lack of transparency surrounding the increasingly prevalent practice of short selling, and that it is in the interests of all investors to have greater transparency around these issues.

The potential benefits of transparency include disclosure providing a signal to the market that securities may be overvalued, noting that not all short sales are information trades and this information needs to be regarded in that context. Other possible benefits include that there is some awareness that those sales need to be reversed at some future time. Also greater transparency may tend to deter attempts at market abuse. This transparency, and the greater confidence it will engender, is particularly important in the context of the current market volatility.

Tax Laws Amendment (Luxury Car Tax—Minor Amendments) Bill 2008


Purpose of the bill

This bill will make minor and technical amendments to the tax law relating to the luxury car tax relating to the operation of the refund provisions and contracts entered into before 13 May 2008.

Reasons for Urgency

The measures in this bill are intended to ensure that the refund and pre-13 May 2008 provisions put in place by the Tax Laws Amendment (Luxury Car Tax) Act 2008 operate as intended. It is important that the measures be passed as soon as practicable to ensure that vehicle retailers, finance companies and consumers are certain as to their eligibility for refunds and the rate of luxury car tax that applies. A delayed introduction may impact vehicle purchasing decisions and create further uncertainty for these groups.
In the main, the measures start on 1 July 2008 which is the date that the provisions being amended commenced.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2008-11-27,—I will assist by saying that I believe we had concluded debate on this particular amendment yesterday. We are at the point where the amendment was going to be put.,SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-11-27,"—Senator Nash is correct. However, we had just ordered an additional piece of information from the minister on the question of, if I remember correctly, the ACCC inquiry. I think the minister was just about answering a question that I had asked about whether the inquiry was able to look at the issues around third parties and the extent to which they could look at the restructuring, or potential restructuring, of a particular district. I was interested in what people are now calling a ‘Swiss cheese approach’ of just buying out particular properties and, as a result, additional expense being put on the whole of the district when those properties are bought out. That would have been my subsequent question in response to her answer. We left the debate yesterday with her saying that she thought that the ACCC was looking at some of that information and that their report was being provided to the minister. She said that the minister would then make a decision. So I am, in fact, still interested in getting an answer to that question because it will help us to decide how we should be voting on this inquiry. If the work, as the minister is saying, has already been done then I do not see any need to repeat it. But if that work is not being done, this inquiry would help to gain that information.",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2008-11-27,"—Senator Siewert is indeed right. I think we had reached that point yesterday but, if the amendment had been put at that point, we would not have been able to take into account that information. As I indicated yesterday, I was also very interested in hearing the response from the minister on that particular issue. My understanding, as I said yesterday, is that particularly within the industry there is not a level of comfort—that what Senator Siewert is trying to ascertain is indeed the case. I certainly understand that there has been some interaction between the industry and the ACCC. That having been the case, and with them still coming to the coalition with concerns about the process, it really leads me to believe that perhaps it is not the case that that third-party effect is going to be undertaken by the ACCC. Hence the need, we thought, for moving our amendment.
Again, just to reiterate from yesterday, there is going to be, as Senator Siewert and others have pointed out, a lot of adjustment throughout the communities. We are looking at bulk water holders and the impact on them of changes in arrangements, of potentially taking water out for a public good. We believe that needs to be very closely looked at to ensure there are not consequences flowing on from the act of taking that water out for that public good. So we feel that this amendment is entirely appropriate in making sure at the very least that there is a safeguard for this process. I am sure the minister will very shortly give us some advice on the workings of the ACCC and I am sure she will very definitively point out how it is all in hand and all being undertaken through the ACCC process. But our view is very clearly that this amendment is appropriate. It will work, at the very least, as a safeguard to ensure that the effect on third parties around the bulk water arrangements is taken very much into consideration.",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-11-27,"—I thank Senator Nash for enabling me to arrive in the chamber. I apologise to the chamber; I was somewhat delayed. I think I went through yesterday the issue of where the government is currently proceeding in relation to the ACCC and other matters. I think it might be useful if I perhaps go through where those inquiries are at. First, in relation to termination fees, which I think Senator Nash talked about on the last occasion when this amendment was being debated, they are a legitimate mechanism to do with third-party impacts of irrigators terminating access to an operator’s irrigation network. Obviously, one of the discussions that have been raised with me on a number of occasions is the quantum. Unsurprisingly, depending on where people are in that commercial arrangement, they have different views about that. Currently the schedule E protocol to the Murray-Darling Basin agreement on access, exit and termination fees requires that the termination fees only be allowed when an irrigator terminates access to the operation network and that the termination fee be capped at 15 times the annual fixed access or shadow access fee. My advice is that the 15 times limit was a decision of the previous government.
I do not know whether I should wait until Senator Siewert is able to listen; I do not know whether she wants me to explain this or not. In terms of the termination fee, which obviously is a legitimate mechanism, as I said, to deal with third-party impacts, the current arrangements are that, under schedule E to the agreement, the termination fee is capped at 15 times the annual fixed access or shadow access fee. As I understand it, that was a decision of the previous government predicated on advice which had been provided, including by the ACCC.
The Water Act, which passed through this parliament under the previous government, requires the Commonwealth minister to obtain and have regard to advice from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in making the water market and water charge rules to apply in the basin. I am advised the ACCC is undertaking an exhaustive three-stage process of consultation to develop these rules. In July of this year, in response to stakeholder feedback—I emphasise also at the request of the ACCC—I extended the deadline for the ACCC to provide its advice in order to allow more time for stakeholder consultation. Currently the ACCC is due to provide its final advice on rules for termination fees and water market rules to me next month. The draft rules for termination fees provide for operators to levy termination fees but only when they choose to terminate access to the operator’s network and recommend that termination fees be capped at 10 times the annual fixed access fee. I am advised this provides 12 to 15 years of annual access fees. So that is the mechanism by which third-party impact is managed.
The draft rules also provide for the ACCC to approve the imposition of higher termination fees where contained in new or existing contracts. For those operators worried about security against irrigators transforming and trading out without paying termination fees or ongoing access fees, the draft water market rules provide for operators to obtain security. There is obviously no clear formula by which we can calculate the correct termination fee multiple. Setting the multiple is not a deterministic process but takes into account a range of competing objectives. In recommending in the draft rules the termination fee level be at 10 times the access fee, the ACCC has attempted to strike the right balance between providing, on the one hand, investment certainty for operators and irrigators and, on the other hand, incentives for rationalisation to promote the efficient delivery of required services and water trade.
I pause there to emphasise that point. I think Senator Siewert asked, if not yesterday, perhaps last night, about third-party impacts. As I said, a termination fee is one of the ways in which one manages that. It is important to recognise the countervailing policy considerations, and that is that an excessive termination fee—and I appreciate people may have different views as to what that will mean—clearly operates as a barrier to the sort of rationalisation or adjustment we know will be required in the industry. So there are balancing policy objectives here in terms of ensuring that you have a certain investment environment so as to provide an appropriate and sufficient level of investment certainty without, at the same time, creating barriers to the sort of adjustment that we know will need to occur and which irrigators may want.
The government believes it is prudent to monitor any new regulatory arrangements to ensure that they have the desired effect in terms of setting appropriate rules for the market and for market participants and do not have any unintended consequences. To this end, the draft rules recommend a review of the water charge rules, which would include termination fees, to commence by 2012 and conclude by 2013.
I trust that that assists the chamber in terms of some of the questions which arose yesterday in relation to this amendment. I suggest that a range of the issues that Senator Nash has raised concerns about are already being considered by government and I am certainly happy, if senators are seeking it, to provide further information after the ACCC has provided to me their final advice on termination fees and water market rules.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2008-11-27,"—I move opposition amendment (1) on sheet 5664 revised:
(1)    Schedule 2, page 318 (after line 32), after item 162, insert:
162G  At the end of Part 12
Add:

 Lower Lakes and Coorong emergency assistance

         (1)    As soon as practicable after the commencement of this section, the Government must determine an assistance package of a minimum $50 million for Lower Lakes and Coorong communities to help farmers, small businesses, tourism and community sectors to respond to the crisis caused by the lack of water.
         (2)    Payments of assistance in accordance with a scheme determined under subsection (1) are to be made from money appropriated by the Parliament for that purpose.

There has been a lot of discussion, particularly over the last few months, about the Lower Lakes and the Coorong. Indeed, I participated in one of the inquiries that went to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport looking particularly into the state of the Lower Lakes and the Coorong and into what arrangements might be necessary to assist. It looked at, initially, the state determining whether there was any water able to go south to the Lower Lakes and the Coorong and what steps governments should take to remedy the situation. One of the recommendations that came forward from coalition senators at that time was that there was a very distinct need for assistance for the Coorong and the Lower Lakes given the very dire situation that they were in.
With this amendment we are intending to require the government to determine an assistance package of a minimum of $50 million for the Lower Lakes and the Coorong. This is to assist communities, farmers, small businesses and the tourism and community sectors to respond to the crisis which has been caused by this lack of water. We think it is an entirely appropriate amendment. We believe that the financial assistance that would then be put forward from the government would go a significant way to alleviating the hardship being experienced by the people in that region at the moment.",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2008-11-27,"—I have a question for the minister that may be related. Minister, I want to ask about the definition of ‘conveyance water’ in the bill. I am sure you are very familiar with it. I am referring to schedule 1, item 2, page 12, lines 22 to 24 of the bill which defines conveyance water as:
… water in the River Murray System required to deliver water to meet critical human water needs as far downstream as Wellington in South Australia.
Minister, can you explain the intent of the inclusion of the words in that definition ‘as far downstream as Wellington in South Australia’?",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-11-27,"—I assume the senator is aware of what conveyance water is—I was actually asked by a senator in a division the other day what it is. It is additional water to the water that is used required to ensure delivery. So you need to release more water than you actually need at the other end, for obvious reasons, because of the losses on the way. These words were agreed through the IGA process, including with South Australia; this is a critical human need of communities around the Lower Lakes below Wellington. The Senate would be aware that we are already funding a pipeline network for those purposes to the tune of $120 million to enable towns and communities, as well as irrigators who are currently relying on the Lower Lakes, to connect to a higher point on the Murray.
Senators may be aware that earlier this month I visited that area with Premier Rann and Minister Maywald to inspect and announce the work that had already been commenced, and in fact was proceeding quite rapidly, on 130 kilometres of pipeline to supply potable water to households and properties around Langhorne Creek and Raukkan and also to the Narrung and Poltalloch peninsulas. The definition is agreed with South Australia and, in relation to the Lower Lakes and the Coorong, the critical human needs are being secured by the mechanisms, including a very substantial amount of funding, that I described.",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2008-11-27,"—What is the effect of the inclusion of the words in that definition ‘as far downstream as Wellington in South Australia’ in both legal and practical terms, Minister?",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-11-27,"—I am advised that Wellington is the end of the regulated system, and that portion of the river—as the senator would know—includes the off-takes for Adelaide’s water supply. My advice is that it is the end of the easily regulated system. I am not sure if that is, in fact, a term. The point is, the off-takes to Adelaide are upstream of Wellington, as the senator would know.",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2008-11-27,"—Yes, I do know the off-takes for Adelaide are upstream. My question, in both legal and practical terms, relates to what is not upstream of Wellington, to what is downstream of Wellington. If I understand the definition of ‘conveyance water’ correctly, it means that conveyance water would not be provided beyond Wellington—in other words, conveyance water would not be provided under the bill for anything downstream of Wellington. Is that right?",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-11-27,"—I anticipated that proposition, which is why I made the point about the $120 million the government is already putting in place to ensure potable water. I hope the Liberal Party in South Australia are considering very seriously their position on this bill. There are a range of significant advantages in the bill for South Australia. One of them is, for the first time, the formalisation of arrangements which have worked informally until now through the process that the former Prime Minister and other former ministers established, I think on Melbourne Cup day 2006, to deal with the extraordinarily low levels of inflow and to ensure that critical human needs were met. What we have achieved through this legislation—and South Australian senators from all sides of the chamber should be aware of this—is to obtain agreement from the states, including the upstream states, to formalise those arrangements, thereby giving a far greater level of water security to South Australians.
I know the political point that Senator Fisher is trying to make. We are addressing the issue of the supply of potable water to the Lower Lakes communities, as I have described, through the pipeline mechanism. But this is not a problem where there is a quick and easy fix. It is certainly not a problem that her government was able to find any solution to in 12 years. We are facing an extremely difficult situation, as senators are aware, in the Lower Lakes and Coorong—as we are, frankly, at many wetlands upstream. Senator Fisher can try and make some points about a definition here, but the fact is that this is a more beneficial set of provisions for your state, Senator, than your government ever achieved in the Turnbull bill and, frankly, it should be supported.",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2008-11-27,"—My point is not political. My question is trying to ascertain the basis of the critical human water needs being met for communities below Wellington in South Australia. I am endeavouring to understand the basis upon which—the reasons why—the definition in the bill does not contemplate conveyance water for critical human water needs going any further than Wellington in South Australia. I am trying to establish the reasons why it is seen fit to have those communities rely on external mechanisms rather than conveyance water and critical human needs water, which the bill sees as appropriate for the rest of the basin. I am trying to ascertain and understand the reasons why it is not seen as appropriate for communities downstream of Wellington in South Australia.",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-11-27,"—The off-takes for Adelaide and the communities which I have outlined around the Lower Lakes—Langhorne Creek, Raukkan and the Narrung and Poltalloch peninsulas—will be upstream of Wellington. Second, in terms of delivery of water to those communities, given the situation in the Lower Lakes, the most reliable way of delivering water to those communities in the current circumstances is through the pipelines network that the federal government is funding.",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2008-11-27,"—I would like to put on record the Greens’ support for the coalition amendment here. I think it is really important that we do something to support the communities who rely on the Lower Lakes and the Coorong. We know that the lack of water has been devastating for people in those communities. We know that, even though we hate to talk about these things, the level of suicide in those communities is increasing. That is how desperate the situation is for people whose businesses are folding, whose schools are closing, whose lifestyles and livelihoods are on the brink of collapse because they just do not know what the future holds for them. We need to be doing whatever we can to support those communities, whether it is transitioning to other types of industries or whether it is giving them a bit of a stopgap measure until we get some increased flows. I am quite concerned—and I spoke about this in my speech in the second reading debate—that this bill as it stands does very little for the Lower Lakes and the Coorong area to respond to the desperate and urgent need for increased flows and support for the community. The opposition should be commended for this amendment.",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2008-11-27,"—I would just like to echo the words of Senator Nash and Senator Hanson-Young in particular in support of this amendment. The opposition has, particularly throughout the course of the second reading and committee stage debates of this legislation, sought to recognise that many communities are stressed throughout the system. We have sought to do this by calling for structural adjustment funding throughout the basin system. We have sought to do this by calling for support for exit grants and packages that are necessary throughout the system. In doing so, we have recognised that, right throughout the Murray-Darling Basin system, many, many communities are under stress, particularly irrigation communities in my home state—and the home state of Senator Hanson-Young, Senator Fisher and the minister—of South Australia. We recognise that those Riverland irrigation communities are under particular stress and pressure.
But coming down through the system, with this, one of the last amendments that we propose, we recognise that the Lower Lakes communities are also under pressure. We have recognised, throughout the second reading debate and the committee stage debate, the strains that communities throughout the basin system have been facing. We now recognise that the Lower Lakes communities equally are feeling particular pressure. We have seen thousands upon thousands of South Australians protest in support of those Lower Lakes communities, protest in support of delivering additional water and additional support for the communities there, particularly the people of Goolwa, who are very passionate and are urging the state government and others to consider alternative proposals. This amendment tries to help them through the tough times. Just as we have sought to find ways to help irrigators through the tough times, we see this as a way to try to help those businesses, those tourism operators, those many people suffering throughout the Lower Lakes through the tough times. I commend the amendment to the house.",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2008-11-27,"—I support the comments of my colleagues Senators Nash and Birmingham and also many of the sentiments put by Senator Hanson-Young. The state of the Lower Lakes and Coorong in South Australia has now been well documented and I think is recognised, as it needs to be. I recognise that there are measures in progress to provide some assistance for the Coorong and the Lower Lakes. The trouble is that it is becoming too little and we fear that it will be too late. These initiatives need to be progressed more quickly and, pending progress of those initiatives, the opposition sees the need for the sorts of measures outlined in this amendment.
It is very good that the South Australian government, particularly Minister Maywald, in the last couple of days has been able to announce the pumping into Lake Bonney in the Riverland in South Australia of 10 gigalitres of water over the next two months, designed to stop Lake Bonney from becoming acidic and in particular to save, for example, the Murray cod, which are attempting to continue to inhabit Lake Bonney. It is very good that the state government and the federal government through national initiatives have found a way to find 10 gigalitres of water to pump into Lake Bonney in the Riverland in South Australia in the next two months. However, I do note that through the recent Senate committee process coalition senators and others, including the Greens and Independents, were cognisant of evidence given to that inquiry that 30 to 60 gigalitres would be very prudent at the very least in respect of Coorong and the Lower Lakes. So it is very pleasing that state and federal governments through a national system have found a way to secure 10 gigalitres to be pumped into Lake Bonney in the next two months. It does raise a question as to when the same mechanism will be able to deliver 30 to 50 gigalitres required to help Coorong and the Lower Lakes.",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2008-11-27,"—I indicate my support for this amendment and I support the sentiments expressed by Senators Fisher, Hanson-Young and Birmingham in relation to this. The people of the Lower Lakes are bearing the brunt of years and years of policy inaction and mismanagement of the river upstream, and I think it is entirely appropriate that there be this additional package. I think it would be churlish not to acknowledge the assistance that the Commonwealth has given in terms of the pipeline project and a number of other measures. That needs to be acknowledged and it is welcome. But I believe this additional assistance is warranted in the context of the additional pressures the people of the Lower Lakes have been facing, through no fault of their own, as a result of not only the double whammy of drought and climate change but also the fundamental issues of overallocation and of mismanagement of the river system upstream.",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-11-27,"—I want to respond first to Senator Hanson-Young’s contribution. Senator Hanson-Young says the opposition should be commended. I want to place on record here that I think with respect to the Greens, or certainly from that comment from Senator Hanson-Young, they are becoming dangerously close to becoming apologists for the Liberal Party in terms of their approach to the Murray. I do not mind the crossbenchers holding governments accountable; you should do that. But what I do mind—
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I raise a point of order. The minister can say what she likes, but I think if we are going to have this debate get to a personal slur match it is not going to enhance the outcome for the people in the basin. I think we should get back to debating the matters at hand.

(Senator Marshall)—There is no point of order.
—I want to make these points and perhaps remind the chamber, including the crossbenchers, of the Liberal Party’s position and the National Party’s position on water. I hope that the Greens when they hold us to account also hold to account those opposite for failing to do anything for 12 years. I hope when they hold us to account they also hold the opposition to account for their criticism of water purchase, which I understood the Greens to support and which this government has had the courage, in the face of very significant opposition upstream, to continue. I hope that, just as the opposition is commended for moving an amendment, the Greens would also commend the government for, in the face of significant political opposition, continuing water purchases because we believe it is the right thing to do.
I hope when people criticise the government for its perceived failures that there is also a recognition of statements being made by opposition frontbenchers such as, ‘Minister Wong’s decision to buy $3.1 billion of water entitlements guarantees that communities currently in the worst drought in living memory will go from a natural drought to a Rudd-made drought.’ I hope those sorts of comments are the subject of criticism from the Greens and from Liberal senators like Senator Birmingham who say we should buy more. I hope when we talk about the Lower Lakes that Liberal senators who stood up in here and said that we should save the Lower Lakes will come out and condemn frontbenchers of their own party who say that we should open the barrages to the Lower Lakes. But I have not heard Senators Birmingham and Fisher do that.
People criticise this government for seeking to move to free up water trading and to negotiate to remove the caps that limit that trading. I hope that those who think we should do that also criticise Liberal frontbenchers who criticise those efforts, such as Dr Stone, and say those caps should not be removed. So let us inject into this debate a little bit of fairness, a little bit of policy rigour, because I for one am tired of this debate not recognising the extraordinary inconsistencies of those opposite. Senators Birmingham and Fisher can come in here and talk about the Lower Lakes but refuse to roll people in their own party who are critical of water purchases.
We had the extraordinary situation in Senate estimates where we talked about a 1,500-gigalitre target. I think the Greens have been on record wanting double that. My recollection, Senator Brown, is that in one of the elections you indicated 3,000 gigalitres. That is reasonable for an environmental party to push; I accept that. We had Senator Joyce saying, in front of everybody, to Senator Birmingham, ‘We don’t support that.’ This is the alternative government. What is their policy? What is their position? So all I say to those from an environmental perspective who commend the opposition is this: I trust you will be reasonable enough and fair enough and recognise your own constituency enough to also condemn them for the great many things that they either failed to do or still are not supportive of.
In terms of this Lower Lakes issue, the same sorts of inconsistencies by those opposite that I have already outlined are really most patent. Senators, you cannot come in here professing that you do everything for the people of the Lower Lakes and professing that you want to see water returned to that area unless you are prepared to do the hard yards and roll those in your party who are opposed to water purchases and who have described this purchasing as a ‘Rudd-made drought’. You cannot have it both ways, because ultimately people will judge you by what you do, not by what you say. You speak but you do not act. You do not come out and say, ‘They’re wrong.’ You do not come out and say, ‘This is our position.’ You do not come out and say: ‘Yes, we will do this. We will purchase. We will ensure that those upstream know that the Victorian Liberals and the National Party members who are opposed to purchases, those who are critical of purchases, do not represent the views of Mr Turnbull and the party.’ I actually think Mr Turnbull does think we should do something, but clearly he and those around him are unable to control the members of the National Party who are running this debate in the Senate and the members of their own front bench who are more interested in speaking to their local constituency and not dealing with the big problem.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—The reality is the honourable thing to do is not to play local politics and build on people’s fears but to be upfront with them about what reality we confront in the basin. This government is actually prepared to do that. We are prepared to say upfront to these communities: ‘Yes, we think you have to adjust. We think all in the Murray-Darling Basin have to adjust. That is why we are doing what we are doing. That is why we are prepared to purchase.’
In relation to the assistance that is proposed here, my recollection is that, although those opposite never made a formal funding decision to allocate structural adjustment, they are now requiring that of this government. I assume, given their position, that they would want that taken out of the water purchase entitlement. I do not know, in terms of this agreement or this position between the Greens and the Liberal Party, whether that has been agreed. I want to make the point that this government has done more in one year to assist this community than was ever done by those opposite. I would hope, just as Senator Hanson-Young commends the Liberal Party for an amendment requiring $50 million to be paid—

Senator Hanson-Young interjecting—

—Senator Hanson-Young, I hope you will also commend this government for having the courage to purchase water for the first time—I hear silence. I hope you will also commend this government—
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. I do not know what the minister had for breakfast but the point of order here is that she must not encourage the flouting of standing orders by talking across the floor. She should be addressing her remarks through you, Mr Temporary Chairman.
—Yes, a point well made, Senator Brown.
—Through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, I note Senator Hanson-Young is prepared to interject to criticise the government but not when I say that perhaps it is reasonable for the Greens, consistent with their policy position, to commend the government for having the courage to be the first government in the nation’s history to purchase water. I hope also that when people talk about the Lower Lakes they might recognise that, while those opposite can move an amendment, we are actually the ones putting money on the ground. We have committed some $320 million in total to the Lower Lakes and Coorong: $120 million for piping to secure the water needs of the communities which were discussed in the previous amendment, plus $200 million for a lasting solution as to the Lower Lakes for the South Australian government. We are working with them to develop that. These are important reforms.
We know that much more needs to be done. Yes, I do have a personal understanding of this area, Senator Hanson-Young, but the problems in the Lower Lakes are problems which are endemic to the system as a whole, particularly the southern basin. And, as many environmentalists have said, this is the most obvious example of the legacy that we—all of us—have inherited, particularly this government in having to address it, and is most obvious at the Lower Lakes. There are a great many wetlands, a great many environmental assets upstream which are also under pressure. I have spoken before in this place about a visit which made a great impression on me: I went to Bottle Bend near Mildura and an irrigator talked to me about the fact that the acidity levels in that billabong were equivalent to sulfuric acid.
There are environmental pressures throughout this system. That is why we are committed to purchasing: because that is the fastest way to return water to the system. Again, it is opposed by many of those opposite. Senator Nash can get up and say, ‘We support water purchases but in the right environment, in the right circumstances.’ There are many on your frontbench who do not, and they are on the record as saying it. That is why we are investing in infrastructure return efficiencies to the river, and I notice again that the shadow minister and others have been critical of the government for not rolling this out. Firstly, we have rolled out more than was ever the case under the previous government. Secondly, we know that investing in irrigation infrastructure is the right thing to do to ensure that the economic base for those communities continues to be viable and productive. But we also know that savings yielded through that process take far longer to be returned to the river simply by virtue of the nature of getting those projects out.
I simply want to place on record here that this is a government that takes this issue seriously and that is undertaking practical measures to address these issues. We are making progress. A solution will not be achieved overnight and I do not think anybody—if they are honest—in this chamber believes that. We do not support this amendment. We point to what we are already doing and that is providing $200 million for a lasting solution to the Lower Lakes, $120 million for pipelines and a continued program of returning water to this system in order to improve its health, because that is what is demanded in the basin.",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2008-11-27,"—The minister said that we need to inject a little bit of fairness into the debate. I would also like to inject a little bit of history into the debate. The Greens for years and years have been calling on calling for action for the Murray, for the entire basin. We have continuously criticised whatever side of this chamber was in government and called for better action, for better foresight in seeing what we needed to do to tackle the overallocation issue and its implications for communities further downstream. I would like to remind the minister that when this bill first came into play it was the Greens that were moving amendments to strengthen the arrangements, to strengthen the impact on saving the river Murray, saving the basin and giving communities hope and security. There was very little support from either side—either the then opposition, the Labor Party, or the then government, the coalition. So as well as injecting a little bit of fairness, I think we also need to inject a little bit of history.
Even as recently as yesterday, the Greens stood up and acknowledged the good things the government has done on this issue over the last 12 months. But we are talking here about an amendment to give some immediate relief to those communities in the Lower Lakes and the Coorong. We acknowledge that things are happening slowly and further down the track in terms of trying to offer security to these communities, but this package is about trying to relieve the pressure that the communities feel now—and it is important to do that. It is a shame that the minister cannot see that that is an important thing that these communities need right now. They need this support right now. They need action right now.",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2008-11-27,"—We have probably been debating this bill for close to 10 hours, through the second reading stage and the committee stage. Throughout those debates, at numerous intersections, Minister Wong has accused us and others in the chamber—but particularly those of us on this side—of playing politics with the debate. She has accused us of being overtly political throughout the debate. Perhaps the pot should look in the mirror at the kettle, because we just had 15 minutes of overt politics, of totally playing politics. However, it is not for the first time in this debate by any means—for the umpteenth time, the minister has felt the need, particularly during this committee stage, to hector and lecture on political point-scoring matters.
I would like to think that we will have robust debates here and yes, Minister, we will actually have robust political debates too—you know that and I know that; we are all grown-ups and we all recognise that politics will be engaged in just as the issues will be engaged in—but do not lecture us on the one hand about playing politics and then give us 15-minute political lectures on the other hand.
The minister knows full well that the process of funding buybacks was started by Mr Turnbull. The minister knows equally well that it was also not long before the election that the Water Act was passed; it was passed only a couple months prior to the election. It was one of the last pieces of legislation dealt with in this chamber. Minister, you know that. You know very well that that is the case. If it had not been for the fact that Minister Turnbull had allocated $10 billion of funding in last year’s budget, you would not have managed to get the funding through the razor gang this year. You would not have managed to get the extra funding that was required to have that $10 billion to be able to do these things. So you owe Mr Turnbull a lot for the fact that he put the process in place. He started things going. He started the ball rolling. Indeed, if your Victorian Labor Party counterparts had not been playing politics with this issue throughout the course of last year, throughout the lead-up to the last election, more may well have been able to be done. The minister obviously feels like she needs a little bit more loving today. She wants some commendation. Minister, I am happy to commend you.
—Not from you!
—No, Minister, please.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. In case anybody is under any illusions, I require no loving from Senator Birmingham.
 (Senator Humphries)—There is no point of order.
—I thank the minister for that interlude. I am sure my fiance, who is looking—I hope—to meet me on the aisle in a week or two will not be getting too concerned about any arrangements that we may have. Nonetheless, I will not give the minister the loving but I will give her the commendation. I commend the minister for the fact that building has started on the pipelines to the Lower Lakes and the Narrung Peninsula for the communities there.
It is noteworthy that two years ago, when this proposal was first made, the South Australian government were not calling for those pipelines to be built. Of course they were not calling for them to be built, because at that stage the water levels in the lakes were higher than they have been this year. At that stage, the process was in crisis but not so much in crisis. At that stage, they did not see piping water to the lakes as the solution; this year they did. And I recognise that the government acted and acted quickly to support them.
The question I pose, though, is: if the government can build infrastructure for the Lower Lakes communities so quickly, if it can fund that infrastructure so very quickly and get works happening on the ground so quickly, why can’t it do it elsewhere? That infrastructure is important. It provides water security for the Lower Lakes communities, but it does not actually save any water. It is not the type of infrastructure that is about increasing efficiencies in irrigation elsewhere throughout the system. It is purely infrastructure that provides security to the communities. That is critical, but it is not the water-saving infrastructure that is so desperately needed throughout the rest of the basin. If non-water saving infrastructure can be put on the ground and started within a matter of months then why can’t other projects where hundreds of gigalitres of water could potentially be saved—the Menindee Lakes and elsewhere—be done in months, not years? That is what we should expect from the government when it comes to delivery across the basin, not just in that one community.
What was noteworthy throughout the minister’s 15-minute contribution was that she barely mentioned the communities. Senator Hanson-Young was right to draw the debate back to the Lower Lakes communities and to the point of this very amendment, which is to ensure that some tangible support is provided to those communities. The tangible support that we have called for is to assist irrigators and communities throughout the basin to help them survive the tough times they are in. The minister was right when she said that progress would not be achieved overnight. That is why these communities need support. They need support because progress will not be achieved overnight, and they need support to be able to sustain themselves into the future. They need support so that all the businesses do not close their doors, so that all the farmers do not leave their properties, so that the marinas are not put out of business by all the boats having to be taken to other marinas, so that the tourism industry and other industries in the area are not decimated, so that the schools stay open and so that the facilities of those communities are sustained through the difficult times until progress is made. That is why this amendment is critically important. That is why it should be supported by this house. I commend it to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-11-27,"—Just very briefly, I will not counter all the issues that Senator Birmingham put on the record. Robust political debate—I am up for that. I do not think you would accuse me otherwise, Senator Birmingham. But I think there is a political game playing that people should be called on when what they say and what they do are so different. I note that Senator Birmingham, despite his professed support for purchases et cetera, has always failed to condemn or clarify that his government’s position is not that articulated by Dr Stone—
—I wish I had a government.
—Sorry, opposition. Thank you, Senator Birmingham—that his party’s position is not that of Dr Stone, Mr Cobb or Senator Joyce. The relevant shadow minister, who clearly does not have the internal party political power to deliver this, has never come out and said that Senator Joyce, Dr Stone and Mr Cobb et al are wrong. So my point about playing politics is that people will judge this government and the opposition, as the alternative government, not simply by what they say but by what they do.
I think a number of times in this debate I have been in the rather odd position of being the defender of the Turnbull act. I do acknowledge that Mr Turnbull commenced this process. He did not achieve very much but he did commence this process, and he did get an act through that Senator Nash, on behalf of your party or your opposition, has moved amendments to. We have defended the Turnbull legislation on certain—
—Are you an apologist for the coalition?
—No. I leave that to you, Senator Hanson-Young. It is not a perfect act. That is why we have brought forward a very substantial bill to amend it. But there are a couple of key areas where the opposition has moved amendments to its own act. When this comes back from the lower house it will be a test of Mr Turnbull’s leadership. It will be a test of whether those in the opposition who have professed concern on these issues are actually able to stand up to those also on that side who do not want water purchases and who want to continue to oppose it. It will be a test of Mr Turnbull’s leadership as to whether or not those extreme elements inside the coalition will scuttle a piece of legislation that is so important.
I accept that there are differences of views about whether this bill goes as far as people want. There are differences of views from Senator Xenophon and from the Greens, and a different set of differences of views at times from the Nationals and the Liberal Party. But, ultimately, when this comes back from the lower house the test will be whether you are prepared to back genuine reform or whether you are prepared to scuttle it in the interests of playing politics. I would suggest that that latter path will really demonstrate that what you say and what you do are poles apart.",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-11-27,"—Senator Hanson-Young has really covered the field, but I just want to comment on the minister’s approach to this. As the minister said, the Greens have been campaigning to get action on the Murray-Darling Basin for many years, and that included a 3,000-gigalitre guaranteed flow. We campaigned for that because the scientific evidence was that one quarter of the flow should be guaranteed for environmental purposes. If only the Howard government had acted on that we would not now be looking at a river system in such a parlous state. Indeed, it may have helped if the Labor opposition at the time had been apologists for the Greens and supported the position that we were putting.
We are now debating a very serious piece of legislation; it is a major piece of legislation for the minister. But the whole role of this Senate and its committee system is to, through the community, improve legislation where we can. If the government or the opposition have amendments that the Greens consider meritorious then we will be supporting them. I can make the opposition relaxed by telling them that we are not going to be defrayed from that by Minister Wong’s talk about apologists. The only thing that we do not want to do is have to apologise to the community for denying good amendments on the basis of a political stand. This amendment has merit for the reasons that Senator Hanson-Young and Senator Birmingham have outlined. It is our intention to support it.",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2008-11-27,"—I understand that there are other things happening and that there are other things further down the track that you will do to try and support the sustainability of those local communities. But, if you are not prepared to support this rescue package for the immediate relief that these communities need, what is it that you will do?",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-11-27,"—We can open up this debate again. We are opposing this because we are already doing things for this region—very substantially more than is proposed. This was a Mayo by-election Liberal Party policy stunt, and I think that people know that. We are already putting substantial amounts of assistance into that region. We have taken a consistent position that the best way of ensuring viability for communities throughout the basin—because we as a government have to look at the basin as a whole—and the best way governments can use taxpayers’ funds to assist communities in the basin is to investment in irrigation infrastructure so that we can ensure the economic base of the communities that are reliant in part or substantially on irrigation and so we can assist them to adjust to a future where there is less water. I am not sure that I can add anything further. I understand the position that your party is taking and I have outlined the government’s position.

These amendments are related to the recognition of Indigenous water rights. This is a very important issue. Members of this chamber will be aware that the Greens have been pursuing the issue of cultural water flows for quite some time. I moved some similar amendments previously, when we were debating the Water Act 2007. This very importantly deals with not only Indigenous water rights but also establishing cultural flows in the Murray-Darling Basin.
Indigenous nations are, and have been since time immemorial, connected to and responsible for their lands and waters. The peoples of every Indigenous nation obtain and maintain their spiritual and cultural identity, life and livelihood from their lands and waters. In addition, Indigenous nations each have responsibilities and obligations under their Indigenous law and custom to protect, conserve and maintain the environment and ecosystems in their natural state to ensure the sustainability of the whole environment.
In November 2007, Indigenous peoples for the nations represented within MLDRIN, which is the Murray Lower Darling Rivers Indigenous Nations, met in Echuca to come to an agreement on the definition of cultural flows and to discuss the impacts and benefits. The Indigenous nations of the Murray-Darling Basin have been working on this for quite some time and are very keen to ensure that their water rights are recognised and that cultural flows are provided for in the Murray-Darling Basin plan.
I would just like to remind the chamber that it is often cited that within Australia the percentage of land in the Indigenous estate is around 20 per cent. However, in the Murray-Darling Basin, Indigenous peoples currently hold less than 0.2 per cent of the land, despite comprising around four per cent of the basin’s population and despite land reforms such as the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 and the Native Title Act 1993. In other words, Aboriginal people’s connection to and involvement in the management of the Murray-Darling Basin has been extensively broken over a considerable period of time. We believe it is about time that we start recognising this and making provisions for Indigenous water rights and cultural flows.
The right to access water is supposed to be provided by the National Water Initiative and other Commonwealth and state mechanisms, but many of these are contingent upon positive native title determinations. Given the current disparity of Aboriginal land tenure within the Murray-Darling Basin, we believe access to water for Indigenous peoples has been severely limited and restricted. Unfortunately, until relatively recently, cultural flows have not been on the political agenda in Australia. They have not been part of the discussions on natural resource management. So, while Australia has moved on and is finally starting to recognise environmental water flows and the importance of natural resource management, we still have not adequately incorporated Indigenous knowledge, expertise and experience into natural resource management. As I said, making provision for cultural flows, in particular, still has not been fully and properly incorporated into our decision making.
MLDRIN defines cultural flows as water entitlements that are legally and beneficially owned by the Indigenous nations and that are of a sufficient and adequate quality and quantity to improve the spiritual, cultural, environmental, social and economic conditions of those Indigenous nations. Cultural water flows have many benefits and impacts. These include empowerment and social justice, where water is delivered to country by the peoples. They further include growing native plants, protecting and hunting animals, song and dance, art and ceremony, spiritual sites and improved cultural, economic and health outcomes through the provision of food, medicines and materials for art.
The difference between environmental and cultural water is that cultural water is the Indigenous peoples themselves deciding where and when water should be delivered, based on traditional knowledge and aspirations. This ensures that Indigenous peoples are empowered to fulfil their responsibility to care for country. The question of volumes needed under cultural flows needs to be acknowledged and scoped. More work needs to be done. MLDRIN acknowledges that that work does need to be done. But of course we need to make provision for cultural flows in the first place in order to ensure that there will be water available once the decisions have been made and the calculations have been done on the issue of volumes.
I would like to point out that there are a number of international conventions and processes through which there has been recognition of Indigenous rights to water. They include the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 1965. A number of the provisions of this convention relate to the rights of Indigenous peoples to access and use their traditional water resources. For example, paragraph 5 of recommendation 23 of the convention says:
The Committee especially calls upon State parties to recognise and protect the rights of indigenous peoples to own, develop, control and use their common lands, territories and resources and, where they have been derived of their lands and territories traditionally owned or otherwise inhabited or used without their free and informed consent, to take steps to return those lands and territories otherwise inhabited or used without their free and informed consent, to take steps to return these lands and territories.
The World Heritage Convention also recognises cultural landscapes and their links to conservation and diversity. Included within that is a new category of cultural landscapes. Despite the emphasis on the recognition of Indigenous concepts of culture and appreciation of the sacred nature of these particular sites, a recent analysis of the implementation of the provision for the protection of cultural landscapes revealed that there is a Eurocentric nature to the sites listed and cites the fact that there has been a gap in recognition of the role of Indigenous peoples and Indigenous involvement in those cultural landscapes. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights also applies here, as does the Convention on Biological Diversity 1992 and of course the draft declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples.
So the issues around cultural flows are recognised internationally. Australia is still to adequately deal with the issues surrounding cultural flows. Cultural flow issues certainly were not given recognition in the Water Act 2007 and are not included in the Water Amendment Bill 2008. We believe it is time that we start recognising these issues and start including a legislative basis for cultural flows. We acknowledge that further work needs to be done on how to implement cultural flows, but we believe we are far past the time when we should have given this issue a legislative base.
The Greens amendments on sheet 5660 relate to a number of issues, including the recognition of Indigenous water rights and the delivery of cultural flows, and we have used the MLDRIN definition of ‘cultural flow’. The amendments provide mechanisms by which we can start to incorporate cultural flows in the act and then start to implement those commitments, if the amendments are accepted, into the legislation—for example, establishing an Indigenous water subcommittee including people with expertise in Indigenous water rights and cultural flows. The amendments include recognition of cultural flows and also how we start to include cultural flows in decision making.

Indigenous water rights are an issue that I am personally aware of and about which I have had some discussions with Indigenous representatives. I understand that the Murray-Darling system has enormous cultural significance for many Indigenous people and communities within the basin. I think this is a timely reminder that the natural wealth of the Murray-Darling system has sustained countless generations of Indigenous people but, by contrast, the people and cultures that have come to Australia in recent times have only taken a century or so to preside over the current crisis we see in the Murray-Darling. What I have suggested to Senator Siewert is the consideration of clauses 10 and 11. The remainder of the amendments, at this stage, probably go a little beyond where I think the current discussion and Basin Plan arrangements are at. I am very conscious of the importance of considering Indigenous issues in relation to basin water resources through the Basin Plan process. In my view, the best approach to take would be to allow that to occur through the development of the Basin Plan and the consultation that is expected and required.",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-11-27,"—I thank the minister for her comments. Obviously, we are extremely disappointed that the government does not think it can go as far as accepting the recognition of Indigenous water rights in the Water Act. We think this is a particularly important issue. Aboriginal people have been disconnected from the management of the Murray-Darling Basin over the last 200 years, and these amendments seek to re-establish and give a legislative base to Indigenous water rights.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-11-27,"—In order to clarify, I will amend my amendment. I apologise for this amendment writing on the run. The wording is: ‘An Indigenous water subcommittee, to guide consideration of Indigenous matters relevant to the basin’s water resources.’ I also seek to amend clause 11, which deals with the basin community committee’s membership, by changing the wording to: ‘An individual with expertise in Indigenous matters relevant to the basin’s water resources.’

"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2008-11-27,"—I move opposition amendment (1) on sheet 5657:
(1)    Schedule 1, item 1, page 11 (after line 2), after subsection 18H(1), insert:
      (1A)    Until the States of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia have each achieved the objective of increasing the flow of water in the River Murray as required by the Living Murray Initiative, these States’ water savings programs are to be independently audited and, as soon as the saved water becomes available, the water must be allocated to the Living Murray Initiative and must not be used for any other purpose.
This amendment goes to the Living Murray Initiative. People will be very aware of these water saving programs under this initiative. The amendment is aimed at preserving saved water for environmental flows. The amendment’s purpose is to ensure that water saved through the Living Murray Initiative is not held back from the Murray but is returned to it. It is a very straightforward amendment. We think it is an entirely appropriate amendment to include in what has been a very long list of amendments. It actually enforces the government’s own EPBC decision that the north-south pipeline should not use Living Murray water.",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-11-27,"—For the reasons that Senator Nash outlined, and at the great risk of being seen to be an apologist for the opposition, the Greens will be supporting this amendment. We believe that the integrity of the catchment should be maintained and that, at this critical time when there is simply not enough water, water should not be taken out of the basin. There are perfectly good, and much wiser, options that the Brumby government has not undertaken—and I do not mean the building of a desalination plant but the use of the water that falls over metropolitan Melbourne much more wisely—that would obviate the need for this diversion of critically needed water out of the Goulburn River basin and, therefore, out of the Murray-Darling Basin as a whole.",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-11-27,"—I want to make a number of points about this amendment. I want to make the point, first, that there is already an audit process covering the Living Murray, known as the Independent Audit Group. On the issue of the protection of water from the Living Murray, there are detailed arrangements in place for this purpose, such as the provisions of the Living Murray Business Plan and the Living Murray Intergovernmental Agreement. Section 28(1) of the Water Act for the Basin Plan, the environmental watering plan, has the purpose of safeguarding existing environmental water. I also make the point that, on completion of the water recovery project, an independent review is undertaken by one or more members of an independent review panel to ensure there is evidence of project implementation and outcomes, and this report comes to the ministerial council, which I chair, before the savings are listed on the formal register. So the agreements associated with the Living Murray already provide that this water is not used for other purposes.
In terms of Senator Brown’s apologist comment, I simply would make the point that this was a Howard government initiative—in 2004, from memory—but, obviously, this amendment was not moved by them in the context of their Water Act 2007. But I would make the point that we do not regard this amendment as necessary, given that there are already very clear audit requirements and intergovernmental agreement requirements that those opposite were actually party to as part of the Living Murray arrangements—and which they are seeking to supersede now they are not in government. Regarding Senator Brown’s point about the Sugarloaf, this amendment, as I understand it, is not needed to ensure compliance with the EPBC conditions. We had a lengthy discussion, Senator Brown, and I cannot recall for what aspect of that discussion you were in the chamber, but I am sure you are aware that there are compliance provisions under the EPBC Act which are directed at ensuring compliance with those conditions. So, as I understand it, this amendment is not necessary in terms of compliance with EPBC conditions.
The advice I have, given what I have read out in terms of Living Murray arrangements, is that it is unlikely to alter the audit mechanisms that are already being applied pursuant to the intergovernmental arrangements which apply under the Living Murray and which the previous government was party to. I would make the point that this directly goes to issues that are relevant to the states, so the states would have a direct interest in the amendment that is before the chamber, and it certainly was not something that was discussed or negotiated in the context of the intergovernmental agreement. So I come back, in terms of the opposition, to your consideration of how much risk you are prepared to put this legislation to, and that will be a decision that awaits you when this returns from the lower house.

(2)    Schedule 2, item 50A, after subsection 21(10), insert:
    (10A)    To avoid doubt:
              (a)    the delivery of water for the initiatives of the Water for Rivers project was an existing use of water prior to 3 July 2008; and
              (b)    the taking of water for the initiatives of the Water for Rivers project is not contrary to subsection 21(8); and

This amendment put by the opposition is about the Water for Rivers project. There were some concerns raised with us. We believe that none of the amendments moved on the bill would have an impact on the various sources of environmental water for the Snowy River, but we recognise that those concerns have been raised and that it has been requested that some confirmation be provided that the amendments could not be misinterpreted.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-11-27,"—It is self-evident that the opposition have had to hurriedly put a further amendment in to protect the Snowy River Water for Rivers arrangements in light of the amendments they previously moved in their attempt to criticise the Sugarloaf issue and make that the central issue of water reform in the Murray-Darling Basin. This demonstrates exactly one of the things that we said was a problem with that amendment: that it is all about political gains and trying to make the pipeline the political issue—not the broader and much more significant policy issue of the Murray-Darling. The chamber needs to be aware that this is an amendment which recognises—from the opposition’s own pen—the risk and unintended potential consequences of their amendments in relation to the pipeline, which were clearly politically motivated. I will put that on the record, because I think there is no doubt about that, looking at the history—in particular, looking at the Victorian Liberal Party position and what motivated that.

I indicate to the chamber that, subsequent to further discussions with stakeholders, an amendment is appropriate here to more clearly reflect the intent of the amendment.",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-11-27,"—The Greens will not be supporting this amendment. Yesterday we moved that there be an independent assessment of the impact on the aquifers and the catchment of mining exploration and/or mining before licences be granted. That is a very sensible proposition. I say at the outset: where is the logic in having a mining corporation being allowed to proceed to exploration and then doing a water study, which would show that mining interrupted and degraded the aquifer, and therefore the productivity of the farmlands above, so that the mining is halted? Clearly, the study should be done before any licence for exploration or mining is carried out. That is the clear logic that was accepted by the coalition yesterday. Overnight, the Australian Mining Industry Council and the big miners have moved in, alarmed by this sensible proposition, and have talked the opposition, in particular the National Party, into reneging on the decision to support this amendment.
I understand the lobbying power of the mining industry as against the farming industry, but I do not understand the logic of saying that we will require a study of the impact of mining on the catchment but not before exploration takes place. The mining industry itself ought to look at this because it is being invited to expend large amounts of money on exploration at the risk that an independent study will show significant risk and the mining cannot then go ahead.
The second amendment here is the important one that I will be asking the opposition to look at again, because it effectively says that no matter what happens or what is found in an independent study it will not impact on the go-ahead for mining. I want to quote from the debate yesterday. Firstly, Senator Williams said:
We need to have a proper independent inquiry into underground aquifers in these areas … It is vital that the truth be brought out about these prime agricultural areas. It is vital that this study be undertaken;—
that is, to have a study before licences are granted for exploration—
hence I offer my support for this amendment.
He goes on:
The National Party has worked on this area over the last 12 months. My state colleagues Andrew Fraser, Rick Colless and Andrew Stoner have had a close look at the issue. We need to ensure that the long-term viability of this agricultural land is not put under threat at any stage …
That includes, of course—and I am interpolating here—before exploration is undertaken. Senator Joyce said:
I hope the message is conveyed to the people of the Caroona area …
And we are talking here about the Liverpool plains, where there is a farmers’ blockade of BHP Billiton’s plan to explore farmlands for the potential underground mining operation. Senator Joyce went on:
… that we will support them on this matter, create the numbers so that this amendment will succeed.
Well, overnight, suddenly the support is gone, the numbers are going and the people of Caroona have lost that support. Senator Joyce said:
As Senator Williams rightly said, there is no point in compromising the prosperity of the future and our capacity to feed ourselves for the sake of a 30-year window in mining.
Yet these amendments being put forward by the National Party today would do just that. Senator Joyce went on to say:
I hope the wonderful people of Caroona and Breeza Plains and the Haystack Plains realise that, for something to succeed, you need at least 39 senators to vote for it and you need more than half of the lower house to vote for it. I hope that is recognised and taken back to the people of the Liverpool Plains, and I hope we get a chance to read about it in the Northern Daily Leader.
I hope if it is in the Northern Daily Leader that Senator Joyce will read it, because overnight he has reneged. Suddenly the numbers that are necessary to get this vital amendment up—and, yes, it did come from the Independent member for New England, Mr Windsor—are very different. Senator Boswell said:
I find it very unusual that we seem to be getting closer and closer to the Greens. We have not seen eye to eye with the Greens on this for the last seven or eight years.
I suspect, actually, that we have seen eye to eye but there is some political mystique here which is getting into the commonsense that is required to ensure that, in the interests of farmlands right throughout the Murray-Darling Basin, a proper study of the impact on aquifers is done before exploration or mining takes place. Nevertheless, Senator Boswell went on to say:
As Senator Barnaby Joyce has pointed out, you can have all the best ideas in the world, and you can have right on your side, but if you do not have the numbers it does not mean one iota.
Well, right was on the side of the people of Caroona yesterday, and right is on the side of the people of Caroona today. The only thing that has changed is the National Party, which is withdrawing the numbers. It is going from right to wrong. It is going from right to wrong because they do not have the lobby firepower in this place. The Australian Mining Industry Council and BHP Billiton have got at the National Party overnight and have changed their minds. And the people of Caroona still have right on their side. It is the National Party and the coalition that are wrong here today. It is the Australian Mining Industry Council, which has might on its side, which is overriding the people of the Breeza Plain, who have right on their side. Senator Boswell went on to say:
Today we have delivered the numbers in the Senate to carry this amendment, and that will give them—
the farmers—
some sort of satisfaction. I again point out to those people that Independents can do nothing.
That was aimed at Mr Windsor. I think it will be left to the people of the Liverpool Plains as to who is doing something for the farmers as against the big mining companies who have suddenly got hold of the coalition and changed its mind. Senator Boswell said:
Anyone can huff and puff, but it is only the numbers that will deliver on these issues.
He is not here today. There is no huffing and puffing going on. There is nothing. And suddenly the numbers are not going to deliver. Senator Nash said:
It is about a study to be undertaken about due diligence.
I totally agree, because due diligence means you do the study before the exploration which leads to the mining takes place. You do not wait till after the exploration and you certainly do not insert an amendment like her second amendment, which says: ‘If you find that the aquifers are going to be interrupted and significant damage will occur to the potential of the farmlands and their productivity, you don’t have to do anything anyway. Remove that clause.’ Senator Nash went on to say:
What we are seeing here is a very sensible measured approach to ensuring that the operations of mining in rural areas do not impact in an untoward fashion on the water system.
She was right yesterday and she is wrong today. The only thing that has happened is that, overnight, BHP Billiton has got to the National Party. Yesterday Senator Nash said:
Perhaps in the Senate the minister might be rather more agreeable to what is a very sensible, very pragmatic and very good amendment.
But what was ‘very sensible, very pragmatic and very good’ yesterday is today neither sensible, pragmatic nor good. Suddenly this amendment is being eviscerated by the National Party because that is what BHP Billiton and the Australian Mining Industry Council want.
Let me go back to the basis of the amendment here, which came from Mr Windsor, who has done a lot of work on this and who has simply said it is good sense to do a study on the impact on the aquifers and the catchment—because the above-ground water and the below-ground water are interconnected—before you go to explore or mine. That compelling good sense has not changed overnight. I will tell you what has changed, Chair, the Mining Industry Council and BHP Billiton have said: ‘Suddenly this is for real. Suddenly this is important. This amendment may be adopted by the government in the House of Representatives in order to get this important piece of legislation through, because it is an amendment of compelling good sense. We’d better get down to the National Party and the Liberal Party and change it from good sense to bad sense.’ That is what has happened, and I am disgusted by it. I appeal to the National Party to get back to what was described just yesterday by Senator Nash as ‘very sensible, very pragmatic and very good’.
We will, of course, oppose this amendment because it means that the impact of mining on the groundwater systems would not have to be studied before exploration proceeded, the implication being that, once exploration had found that the mining should go ahead—and big mining corporations rarely put millions into exploration if they are not intending to mine—you then do a study. The second amendment here says, ‘And when you’ve done the study, if you find a significant impact is going to occur to the water system, you don’t have to take any notice of that. We abolish that clause as well.’ I will be moving for some consistency when we get to the second amendment. I think this is a very sad outcome. The principle has not changed but the people have. The representation in here has changed because the mining lobby got at the National Party overnight. That is not good enough.",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2008-11-27,"—Perhaps I could just very briefly respond. There has been no deviation as Senator Brown is indicating, in spite of his rather lengthy dissertation. One of the things that I have always admired about the Senate is its ability to accommodate improvements in legislation where they are identified. This is one of those cases where, again, I am very impressed with the Senate’s ability to do that. The revised amendment very clearly still echoes the intent of the first, requiring the studies to take place before mining commences.",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-11-27,"—That is the problem, isn’t it? Senator Nash says the revised amendment ‘echoes’ the original amendment. We do not want an echo; we want substance. It is the National Party that is the echo—of yesterday. The substance has gone overnight. All we are left with is an echo. What are the farmers going to think about that? Let me just explain this to the committee. Farmers at Caroona—and these are not deep green activists; these are quality, long-term, committed farmers on the Breeza Plain—have gone out of their normal routine productive lives to blockade BHP Billiton coming onto their land to drill for what is obviously going to be a massive subterranean mining operation. Their last resort was to put themselves in the way.
Let me tell you that they did not do that lightly. They effectively may end up on the wrong side of the law because the natural law of protecting their farmlands comes first and because they are outmanoeuvred in Sydney when it comes to the legislature, which empowers the mining corporations to cut their fences and move in and do exploration. This process, by the way, is being echoed, to use the senator’s term, up on the plains near Dalby, where there is another mining exploration underway which farmers object to. And we are going to see more of it.
What the farmers sensibly want is a study of the impact on their farms of that mining if and when it comes. That is what the amendment that I brought forward, through the grace of an earlier amendment of Mr Windsor in the House of Representatives, will do. But it is being emasculated by the National Party and the Liberal Party here today. You have got to feel for those people sitting with their tent and their stalls and their display and what it means to them out in the bush south of Gunnedah today. They were not able to come here overnight and fight what they know is a manifest wrong. They are disempowered by this process. Who is going to argue that these are not quintessential Australians standing up for their patch of land, being overrun by—a minister objected to this term yesterday but I will use it again—the big end of town. It is unfair, and they deserve the numbers of representatives who stand up for the bush to be in here today. A big issue was made of that yesterday, that the coalition was giving them the numbers. I am not shy to say that I will make a big issue of the fact that those numbers evaporated overnight and we are left, in Senator Nash’s terms, with an echo of the defence of those people’s rights which we heard here yesterday.",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-11-27,"—In terms of some technical issues, we put on the record yesterday our view about the best way to deal with these issues, and I set out the provisions in the act which enable the basin plan to deal with the assessment of interception activities such as mining. I pointed to the sections of the existing act which enabled that to occur. We do think the amendment represents some improvement in terms of one of the technical issues that I raised. We retain concerns particularly in relation to amendment (2), which I understand has not been moved. We do retain concerns generally about the constitutional validity of the second part of the original amendment.
I want to make a broader point about what is happening here, in two parts. First, when this amendment was first supported by the National Party—and I notice, Senator Brown, that yesterday you had a lot of friends on your right, on the opposition benches, who are noticeably absent from the chamber now—I wondered whether Senator Nash and others had actually consulted with their Liberal Party colleagues, particularly from mining states, and the shadow resources minister. I wonder whether overnight they have worked out they have got a problem and now they are moving an amendment and clearly reneging on an arrangement they had, from what Senator Brown said, with the Greens.
More broadly, what we have seen is that the historic coalition between the Greens and the Liberal and National parties that the shadow minister spoke about yesterday was historic in part for its briefness. Less than 24 hours later, we see that there is already a breach of what was agreed yesterday, certainly a change in position. People can make their own judgement, but I suggest that this brief and historic coalition was good for the Liberal Party to try and get them on television looking a little bit green for a period of time but actually does not deliver very much at all, other than good pictures. It remains our view that those on the other side are not interested, from what they have said in here, in behaving in relation to this bill in a way that recognises their own leader’s position in the past, and I assume now, and the responsibility to act on these future challenges.
I assume that we will separately debate the second amendment. We have been consistent, and Senator Brown has also been consistent. We think this is an important issue, but we do believe the best way to approach it is the way I outlined yesterday. I will not re-traverse those arguments.",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-11-27,"—The minister has pointed to a section of the bill which she says would enable a study of the impact on the water catchment to be undertaken if the authority were to so ordain. I ask the minister: will she or will the government seek to have an independent study of the potential impact on the aquifer of BHP Billiton’s plan undertaken? And is she prepared to have the Commonwealth fund such a study, to at least clear the air on the potential impact on the Liverpool plains of the proposed massive mining operation that BHP Billiton have in mind?",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-11-27,"—Senator Brown, in fairness, I think I answered those questions yesterday. You may not have got the answer you wished, but I responded directly to the same questions yesterday. We have been debating this for a very long time. I only propose to refer you to my previous answers on this, because we did traverse this in detail.",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-11-27,"—I cannot allow that to pass. It is a complete duck. I expected a bit more directness from the minister than that. This is a changing landscape. It is a moveable feast, because there is inconsistency on the opposition benches. But there have been a number of proposals for a study of the impact on the integrity of the groundwater in the Gunnedah Basin. I refer to the proposal from the Liverpool plains Land Management Committee which involved three universities and other independent assessors. Part of the proposal states:
… a clear, scientifically-robust statement of the areas where coal development might proceed with least impact on the water resources and land productivity of the region will be available for the approvals/assessment process.
It should be there before the assessment process. My understanding is that it means exploration. The proposal goes on to state:
This project approach provides a comprehensive water resources assessment process—spatial risk assessment underpinned with sound natural resources science directed and implemented by a community group—whose principles would be applicable in many situations of competitive development. It will be the first time that an extensive model of the geological and hydrogeological context of the Liverpool Plains has been achieved. This alone will significantly improve the basis upon which natural resource management and development decisions are made.
I simply ask the minister if she will look favourably at this submission from the Liverpool plains Land Management Committee, because it is a reasonable submission. And if her asseveration that the prospect is there in the legislation for such a study to take place is correct, here is the upfront test case. Ministerial authority, government authority, carries a lot of weight here. This is an utterly disappointing day for the bush and for the people of the Liverpool plains. I ask the minister: will she not have the resources of government brought to bear—she says the way is open for it—and will she not commit the government to ensuring that this study is undertaken?",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-11-27,"—Senator, with respect it was not a duck; it was a recognition that we have been in the chamber for hours. I think even the opposition would agree that I gave a quite detailed response to those questions on the last occasion. I was pointing out that we do not believe the amendments that were originally moved by you and supported then by the opposition were necessary, because the effect of interception activities could be dealt with through the Basin Plan in the circumstances I outlined, and the basin authority obviously has the independent authority to enable that to occur if it sees fit.
I also gave you information that the National Water Commission was funding a project to develop tools and guidelines for the assessment of groundwater mining. My recollection is that involves in the order of $2 million. I also recollect that the Liverpool plains is one of the case studies that is being looked at. Senator Brown, I am not going to—and, in terms of appropriate decision making in government, I hope you would not expect me to—make a decision on funding a project on the basis of a senator asking me a question about it across the chamber. What I will say is that these are issues that do require attention. The act enables them to be given attention for the reasons I outlined. We also need to do more work to enable better assessments within states about the impacts on groundwater of mining. So that is the purpose of the project that I funded.
I appreciate Senator Brown’s views on this. We have been consistent about the approach we think ought to be taken in relation to this issue. We were consistent when this previously came up. We retain the same position.",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-11-27,"—I will not delay the committee, but I will just say that if we cannot debate a matter like this and get an answer out of government on the floor of the chamber, the public is left to think that what is more important is those lobbyists who come in the stilly, stilly night, as happened last night with I think Mr Mitch Hooke and the Minerals Council of Australia, to change the whole position and outcome of legislation against the wider interests—

—Senator Wong objects and says she hasn’t changed her position. The problem is she does not have a position. When I asked specifically about ensuring that a study be done, the position was the same as the National Party’s and the Liberal Party’s. That is the problem, isn’t it?
Let me end this by saying we heard in here yesterday from the Nationals—most of whom are missing now—that Independents are not worth their salt and you have to have the numbers. Well, if ever in this parliament there was a demonstration of the value of an Independent committed to his electorate, it is the value of Mr Tony Windsor to his electorate of New England. I am a Green. I would describe Mr Windsor as a conservative, and one thing he wants to do here is conserve the farmland. We are perhaps on opposite ends of the spectrum. But he is dinkum in this, and he is standing up for his electorate. It is just a pity that that electorate has been sold out in this way in the last 24 hours.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Nash’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2008-11-27,"—I move opposition amendment (2) on sheet 5677:
(2)    Schedule 2, item 161A, omit subsection 255A(2).
In doing so, I want to raise a couple of points. It has been quite interesting that over the last few days accusations about playing politics have been made from one side of the chamber across to the other. But I do not think I have seen a more extreme example of that than what Senator Bob Brown has done this morning. The issue of water is very serious. There is no doubt about that. In spite of Senator Brown’s new-found professed love for farmers coming to the fore, it is the very fact that he could turn this into such a political statement—indicating that his Independent friend from New England might be able to solve the problems of the world by himself—that makes it quite simply untrue. There were also comments made about the Nationals and some changes of position. This amendment seeks to ensure that the outcome that Senator Brown so clearly referred to before, about farmers being able to have a study undertaken on the effects of mining on groundwater and surface water systems before mining commences, still stands.
Senator Brown can use as many words and take up as much time as he wants to. It is entirely his prerogative to grandstand on this issue and to play politics, but that does not help the people of Caroona. It does not help the people right around the Murray-Darling Basin who are extremely concerned about water, which, to the end, is what this debate is all about. This is about the Water Amendment Bill 2008 and all the issues related to it. I would suggest to Senator Brown that he might like to stop playing politics with this issue. He knows full well that the substance of the amendment remains. That an independent expert study will take place before any mining commences is what we are putting forward in this amendment today. Senator Brown may well take up a whole lot more time. As the minister and I have been here for some 10 or 11 hours, a bit more time will not make any difference. Take up as much time as you like, Senator Brown. We will stay as long as you want. But it does not matter what you say or what you indicate. The substance of our position remains. Yesterday my Nationals colleagues indicated very clearly that their position to have a study undertaken substantively remains.",SENATE,<title>WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-11-27,"—The Australian Greens oppose this amendment absolutely. I move Australian Greens amendment (1) on sheet 5678 to opposition amendment (2) as circulated:
 (1)   At the end of the amendment, add ‘, substitute:
         (2)    Where a substantial risk is identified licences must not be granted.”
This amendment is to ensure that we are very clear about this issue. Senator Nash said, ‘There will be a study done before mining is undertaken,’ under the previous cave-in amendment of the coalition. That does not change the fact that there is no longer any need for a study to be sensibly done. The bush common sense that she agreed with yesterday is that the study should be undertaken before exploration takes place. The amendment that we now have from Senator Nash means that yesterday’s position—jointly held by the Greens, the Nationals and the Liberals that, where a substantial risk is identified, exploration licences must not be granted—is abolished. When you look at that, together with the amendment that the Nationals have just moved, you get to the point where the amendment from Senator Nash would mean that, where a substantial risk is identified, licences for mining are not altered. You can identify a substantial risk but the mining can go ahead.
My amendment is simply to accept, as the numbers beat us, that a study does not have to be undertaken before mineral exploration; it now has to be undertaken before mining. My amendment would mean that, where a substantial risk is identified, the mining licence must not be granted. I ask the coalition to look at that carefully. If what Senator Nash says is true then my amendment should be supported. It is consistent with the last amendment that was made. We have lost the fight to ensure that a study is done before exploration is undertaken. It now has to be undertaken, as Senator Nash says, before mining is carried out. My amendment is to ensure that, where a substantial risk is identified in that study, the licence for mining is not granted.
I see that there are hurried discussions between Senator Nash and Senator Wong. That is fine. But I think this is very important. What I am doing here is ensuring that, where a substantial risk is identified, the licence to go ahead with the mining is not granted. I beseech the coalition to support this amendment. It is entirely consistent with what Senator Nash has been putting to the committee this morning. It is a very important and logical amendment and I would expect that the government would also support this amendment. What is the point of having a study if a substantial risk is identified and it does not make any difference?

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-11-27,"—That is shocking. And the government should hang its head in shame as well. I note that Senator Wong is laughing about that, but let me—

Senator Wong interjecting—

—Whatever you were laughing about it is inappropriate at this time.
—Order! Do you want to take a point of order, Senator Wong?
—Mr Chairman, I rise on a point of order. That is incorrect, Senator Brown. That was not what I was laughing at and I do not appreciate being verballed in that way.
—Senator Wong, that is not a point of order.
—You are quite right, Chair; it is not a point of order.
This is shocking. Here we have a situation where yesterday we had the opposition supporting the requirement that there be an investigation—a scientific study—of the impact on water catchment of mining operations before those operations took place, including exploration. Then, where a substantial risk was identified, the mine would not go ahead. Now we have got the government and the opposition turning down this absolutely pivotal requirement. Where damage to the farmlands in the short term or long term can be identified, and there is a substantial risk of that damage, both the big parties say, ‘Well, we will leave that to the lobbying power of the mining organisations.’ This is a dreadful sell-out of common sense, let alone the farming communities that are getting the wrong end of this outcome.
Senator Nash may say that I am making a political statement here. Well, I am. I am a politician elected not just to get better outcomes for the people of Australia but to surely levy common sense in situations like this. I ask Senator Nash, or Senator Wong: how can you justify turning down a parliamentary requirement that where substantial risk is identified to farmlands, like those of the Breeza Plain or the Liverpool plains or indeed anywhere in the Murray-Darling Basin, there should not be action following that to protect those farmlands from that identifiable substantial risk? What is the point of doing a study if you then do not act upon it? It is incredible. This is an astonishing turnaround. I understand the excruciating position Senator Nash is in, and I ask her if she would say who it was from the Minerals Council of Australia—was it Mr Mitch Hooke or someone else—who so effectively got to the coalition overnight with this extraordinarily negative outcome.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2008-11-27,"—I rise to continue my contribution in this debate on the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Emergency Response Consolidation) Bill 2008. Having spoken for only a short time previously, and a number of weeks ago, I wonder if I could query the time allocated. I thought that I had spoken for five minutes and that I had 15 minutes left. Is that the case?
 (Senator Mark Bishop)—We will double-check your time allocation. When we have done that we will reset the clock if necessary. Otherwise you have four minutes at this stage.
—I may well be seeking leave to incorporate the rest of my speech if that is the case. The passage of this bill is now required more urgently to restore the permit system in the Northern Territory as soon as possible. This is, for most Indigenous communities in the Territory, an essential piece of legislation. At present, the public can access communities by air or sea without a permit. Aboriginal people have made it clear that restoration of the permit system is a major priority. On passage of this bill, the permit system will be restored with a few minor changes. For example, the minister will make the necessary determination to allow access to communities for journalists and government contractors acting in their professional capacity.
The removal of the permit system was overwhelmingly opposed by Indigenous people and the land councils in the Northern Territory. I outlined that in my previous contribution to this debate. Of course, this was totally ignored by the previous government in their arrogant approach to most matters by that stage. The Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs received a submission to the inquiry on this legislation from the Law Council of Australia, which related information that they had been able to obtain only under freedom of information regarding the previous Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and responses to his discussion paper about the permit system. The previous minister produced a totally irrelevant and simplistic so-called discussion paper with a range of absolutely spurious reasons for needing to remove the permit system. As pointed out by the Law Council of Australia in their submission:
… no correlation or relationship had been established by the former Government or its agencies linking the permit system to child sexual abuse in Aboriginal communities.
Paedophiles had not been protected by the permit system. Journalists with a sound reputation were not denied access to communities. Business was not deterred; in fact, far from it—businesses abound on Aboriginal land. Businesses range from small art centres, to which buyers freely come; tourist ventures; and many large mining operations, bringing in huge revenue. So the permit system, as it was, put up few barriers to access, but enabled, for example, police at Maningrida to stop vehicles and, if they had no permit, to search them. In several cases, they actually prevented grog and drug runners from harming the community.
It is not in the least clear how the previous government seriously believed that removal of the permit system would do anything to protect the children. One can only suspect that it was ideologically driven, especially considering that not one single response to the discussion paper produced by the former government said to remove it. A few recommended some amendments but, despite this, the Howard government abolished the permit system. Obviously it was an ideological move, not one based on evidence. The Law Council of Australia also stated in their submission that, of the 80 responses to the discussion paper and community consultations, all of them revealed unanimous support for no change to the permit system. Even two mining companies that were consulted did not want the permit system abolished, but one wanted some amendments.
In his second reading speech to the original bill in 2007, the former minister for Indigenous affairs claimed that it was disturbing to find that people had approached department officials after community consultations to say they supported the removal of the permit system but had been too scared to say it in public. Never once did that minister reveal the true findings of these permit consultations, which were provided to him well before this speech. Not surprisingly, he hid them well. Furthermore, the Law Council stated in their submission that they found no record in any of the documents provided by FaCSIA to support the previous minister’s claim that community members had made any unofficial or private submissions outside of the public consultations.
The power to determine who may and may not enter their land is viewed by Aboriginal people as an important part of their land rights, but never, in my experience, has that right been abused. Let me give a bit of a history of the permit system under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act. The permit system has operated in relation to Aboriginal land under the Aboriginal Land Act since 1978, and it has legal and policy purposes. Legally, the scheduling of Aboriginal reserves, which were crown land, as freehold under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 bestowed a right on the owner—for example, a land trust—to exclude any person for any reason, other than Aboriginal people with traditional rights of access. This right was recognised by Justice Woodward in his 1974 report as being integral to the concept of Aboriginal ownership of land. Justice Woodward recorded that it was strongly supported at the time by both the Northern and Central land councils on behalf of their Aboriginal constituents, and the right as regulated by the permit system continues to be strongly supported by them. Justice Woodward recognised that, in contrast to ordinary grants of freehold, a regulatory scheme was required because it was necessary for persons with a legitimate or justifiable purpose to be able to access Aboriginal land—especially communities but also for road maintenance, public works, mining and other developments—and that such persons should not be subject to arbitrary or capricious exclusion.
The statutory scheme in the Aboriginal Land Act of the Northern Territory thus regulates the right to exclude, ordinarily encompassed by an estate in freehold, by ensuring that certain persons have a right of access—for example, members of parliament—and other persons have a right to apply for access and have it properly considered by the minister or the land council in accordance with law. To ensure flexibility, traditional Aboriginal owners may also grant a permit regarding their country—section 5(2)—and the land councils may delegate their power under section 5(4). In practice, although they have no statutory role, Aboriginal communities or community councils facilitate permits in conjunction with traditional owners.
From a policy perspective, the scheme is intended to ensure that Aboriginal communities and people are not subject to breaches of privacy or inappropriate or culturally insensitive actions by unauthorised persons on Aboriginal land. It is also intended to ensure that persons with a legitimate or justifiable interest may enter Aboriginal land. Such inappropriate actions are not uncommon and, in a non-court context, have included inappropriate presence or reporting regarding culturally sensitive matters such as funerals or ceremonies, unauthorised photography, and indefensible misrepresentation regarding important issues. Professor Jon Altman, from the ANU, in his statement to the Senate committee made this point:
I have not seen evidence that journalists have been excluded. I have seen one very well publicised case where a journalist was prosecuted for being at an Aboriginal community without a permit.
And he went on to suggest that any landowner would be upset if journalists had free access to their land. And it should not be a surprise that the one journalist mentioned by Professor Altman was one of the only people to speak against reintroducing the permit system. Other than that, there has been support from a wide range of journalists for the introduction of this permit system.
The Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs heard from Mr William Tilmouth, the CEO of Tangentyere Council. At the hearings in Alice Springs, Mr Tilmouth said:
… there is no evidence that the permit system has resulted in harm to children. On the contrary, it appears to have assisted police in controlling undesirable people entering communities—
That statement was later supported by the Northern Territory Police Federation in the hearings in Darwin. In summary, Mr Tilmouth said that the permit system gives a community the ability to weed out undesirables and move them on, whether Indigenous or non Indigenous—for example, where there was too much alcohol involved or where there were family disputes.
Mr Ron Levy, representing the Northern Land Council, as a witness to the Senate committee in Darwin, said that there were reasons other than permits that meant journalists did not go to court cases in Aboriginal communities, including the fact that the important cases ended up in Darwin or Alice Springs anyway and it usually cost a lot to travel to communities. He stated that, of 50 applications from journalists, he is aware of only two having been refused by the NLC. He cited the example of the NLC Chairman being at an event at Yirrkala on the day of the hearings—a community with open access—but very few journalists were interested in going to the event, as it would take up the whole day with travel and cost a lot, all for one news item. So, as the NLC has pointed out, it is very rare that we see journalists seeking to go into these communities, as cost alone prohibits them. Mr Levy provided some figures which showed that about 30,000 people live on Indigenous communities in the Territory and the NLC alone issues about 22,000 permits a year. So permits are hardly very restrictive. The CLC and other land councils gave evidence that they in fact have issued many more than that.
It is quite hard for non-Indigenous people to fully comprehend what their land means to Indigenous people, who have a totally different viewpoint and different values about land. We tend to value land primarily for its economic value or worth. We buy our block of land, which is then part of our ‘wealth’, and we rate that worth in dollar terms. For Indigenous people, their land is not valued in dollar terms, but rather as cultural and spiritual assets to be guarded and looked after for future generations. They believe they came from the land and they will return there. They have an intimate knowledge of their land. The rivers, the creeks, the valleys and the features of the landscape all have a part in their history and their legends. All major features are associated with some part of their history, ancestry, beliefs and culture. This may be a beach where special ancestors came ashore or a valley created by the Rainbow Serpent. Whatever it is, it has a special meaning for Indigenous people. One has only to visit communities such as Ngukurr, Groote Island, the Dhimurru land management group in Nhulunbuy or the people in Maningrida and their land management groups to see the pride they have in managing their land. They see the importance the rest of the community attach to this work.
So the land is of absolute, paramount importance to Indigenous people, and an element of control over who can enter and for what reasons is equally important—and this should be understood by all fair-minded Australians. The request to reinstate the permit system should be supported by this federal parliament. This part of the bill is very strongly supported by Indigenous people and organisations—and, as I said, this aspect of the bill should be supported and passed.
In finishing, I want to remind the Senate that this bill also contains measures to prohibit the broadcasting of certain R18+ pay TV channels in the prescribed areas under the intervention, but only if the community so requests. Finally, some further minor sections amend omissions from the initial bills—in particular, with respect to licensing some road houses as stores and allowing for the transport of some prohibited items through the prescribed areas.
If we truly want to ensure that we develop a new relationship with Indigenous people in this country, we need to listen to what they are saying—and I direct my comments specifically to Senators Xenophon and Fielding. The reinstatement of the permit system is something that Indigenous people in the Northern Territory want, and they have strongly made representations to this Senate, to those senators and to me to ensure that this is what is granted through the passage of this bill.",SENATE,"<title>FAMILIES, HOUSING, COMMUNITY SERVICES AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EMERGENCY RESPONSE CONSOLIDATION) BILL 2008</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech

"Trood, Sen Russell",LP,2008-11-27,"—I want to make some remarks in relation to the Migration Legislation Amendment (Worker Protection) Bill 2008. This bill seeks to strengthen the legislative framework relating to sponsorship of noncitizens coming to work in Australia under what are commonly called 457 visas. It is important legislation, given its focus. It is important because 457 visas have proliferated since they were first introduced in 1997-98. In the first year that they were introduced, 30,880 visas were issued, and in 2007-08 the figure rose to 110,570 visas. So there has been a fourfold increase in the use of these visas over the period of time in which they have been available.
In Queensland, my own state, they have consistently constituted about 17 per cent to 18 per cent of the visas issued nationally—8,000 in 2006-07 and 9,800 in 2007-08. There are currently 19,000 employers making use of 457 visas and they are spread very widely throughout the economy, largely in the professions and also in the trades. The largest categories in my own state, I note, are in the health and medical professions—nurses and particularly medical practitioners. So the health professions in particular, in Queensland at least, have taken full advantage of the opportunities presented by the 457 visas. With numbers so large, it is clear that there is a need to strengthen the legislative framework under which they operate.
The opposition supports this objective and, indeed, it supports the general thrust of the bill. We do have some concerns, however, and, in voicing these concerns, I suppose it is important that I draw attention to the fact that there has been some argument that the 457 visa process has been abused. It has been argued that there has been some bad behaviour in relation to these bills. Before the Senate committee, an argument was put by the representatives from the CFMEU that there were several instances of abuse that could be noted, although the evidence seemed to be a bit vague as to the nature of these abuses. The statistic that arrests my attention is that, over the period of 1997-98 to now, something in the vicinity of 340,000 visas have actually been issued, and there seems to be a relatively small number of abuses that have been recorded. This is not in any way an avalanche of abuses. There has not been rampant contempt for the rules under which the visas have been issued. So I think we should be cautious about accepting the claims that are being made in the public domain, particularly on behalf of the union movement, that this system is in need of substantial change. But there is a need for greater regulation, and the opposition supports that proposition.
The particular concern that I have about it is the kind of legislative technique—if I can describe it in that way—which is being used in relation to the way in which this bill has been introduced. Several witnesses before the Senate committee drew attention to the fact that, whilst the bill laid out a framework of activity, it provided little detail as to the nature of the obligations which employers, and indeed employees, might be obliged to undertake in the future, and these details were going to be provided in the regulations. Mr Kessels from Fragomen, who gave evidence before the committee, said:
What we are all doing is sitting around making submissions and discussing a bill which is essentially just a framework, but the real substance that is going to make the real difference is unknown at this stage, and that is the fundamental problem.
I agree with that proposition. I do think it is a fundamental problem. Mr Kessels’ evidence was by no means the only evidence following that particular line. In fact, there were many witnesses who came to the committee who expressed precisely the same kind of concern about the structure of this piece of legislation.
The difficulty here is that we have no clear idea of the nature of the regulations which might be provided. To say the least, in my view, this is an undesirable way of proceeding. I suppose that there is a possibility that when the coalition was in government we may have, on a few occasions, taken this particular course of action. There may have been occasions when we took this course of action, but I do not necessarily approve of that course of action either. So I do not think that the government can take any comfort from the fact that this may have been a way of proceeding in the past. If this were a trivial matter then we might let it pass through, but we are actually talking about the rights of people and we are talking about issues which are fundamentally important to the way in which we manage businesses and the way it affects our economy. These rules and regulations, when they eventually emerge, could in fact have quite a profound impact on both employers and employees. But we do not have, as Mr Kessels said, any real clear idea about how onerous they may well be when they are turned out.
The Senate committee noted that there were a range of concerns. I will not deal with these in detail other than to note that the committee drew attention to the problem of penalties and the enforcement regime that might apply in the regulations. It drew attention to the sanctions that might apply for breaches and, in particular, to concerns about the inspection regime. It also drew attention to what I think are two rather more significant issues. The first of these is the onerous obligations that could well be imposed upon employers as a result of the new regulations. Under these new regulations, it seems that employers will be required to undertake responsibility for costs such as for the education of children, travel and airfares, medical care, and licences and registrations for professions and trades et cetera. All of these have a capacity to impose considerable additional burdens on businesses. For some sponsors, some organisations, some enterprises which already make considerable use of 457 visas, these could be very onerous obligations indeed, particularly for small businesses. We ought to be careful about the consequences of these regulations and the kinds of imposts that we are going to be placing on businesses, particularly small businesses, especially in the economic climate we now find ourselves in.
The second major concern I have is in relation to retrospectivity. We in the coalition have never been enthusiasts for retrospectivity in legislation. It is not entirely clear how retrospectivity might apply in this particular bill, but it seems likely under the framework and the structure that exists that, when the regulations are promulgated, the new obligations will apply to existing 457 arrangements. Employers who have entered into an arrangement with a new employee under a 457 visa might suddenly find themselves hit with very large additional responsibilities which could affect the costs and bottom line of their enterprise. We ought to be very careful about imposing these kinds of imposts on small businesses. I am encouraged by the fact that it seems that the government intends that there be widespread consultation in relation to the new regulations. That is indeed encouraging. Of course, we will look to see that that actually takes place and wait to see that that undertaking is discharged.
In concluding, I just want to make a broad point. There is a great deal in this legislation that is taking place under the regulations and a great deal of which we, at this stage, are unaware. We can speculate and we can guess, but until such time as we see it written down we have absolutely no confidence that this will not in fact impose new and deeply onerous obligations on employers. Whether it is as a result of incompetence, inadvertence or design, we find ourselves in a situation where this kind of legislative technique has been applied in an area which is of very great importance to the economy. I trust that it is not the intention of this government to proceed in this way in relation to much legislation in the future. It seems to me to be a highly undesirable way to deal with matters of considerable importance to employers, to people with small businesses in particular, and to those who might come to Australia on short-term arrangements. We will look forward to the regulations when they appear. We will be giving them close scrutiny, and we hope that there will not be any great surprises in those regulations.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WORKER PROTECTION) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2008-11-27,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

I am pleased to support the Migration Legislation Amendment (worker protection) Bill 2008 This legislation is designed to introduce a new framework for the sponsorship of non citizens seeking entry to Australia.
The legislation is a timely and necessary response to the problems associated with the operation of the 457 visa program.
The government is determined to strengthen the integrity of the program and to ensure that workers who come to Australia to assist this nation build for the future are treated with fairness, dignity, and equity. This will be achieved through four main measures:
Providing the structure for better defined sponsorship obligations on employers and other sponsors;
Improving information sharing across all levels of government;
Expanded powers to monitor and investigated possible non-compliance by sponsors; and
The introduction of meaningful penalties for sponsors found in breach of their obligations.
The use of temporary visas, particularly 457 visas, has increased dramatically over the last few years.
This increase is a direct result of the Howard government’s failure to develop a strategic approach to building the skill base of Australia.
Widespread skill shortages have been an impediment to the improved productive performance of this nation and are a clear example of the failed economic policies of the previous government.
The government is determined to build a sophisticated national skill development programme and reduce reliance on temporary overseas labour to build the nation.
This is why we are investing $19.3 billion in education and training.
This $19.3 billion commitment is an investment in Australia’s future.
We will invest $1.9 billion over five years to fund up to 650,000 new training places.
These training places will be the engine that drives personal skill development and lifelong career progression.
While the government’s policy will increase the skill base of our country, significant progress on reducing skill shortages will take time.
This means Australian industry will continue to seek access to the 457 Visa systems.
Given the global economic crisis and the inevitability of Australia being caught up in the worldwide economic downturn there is a high probability that the future use of 457 visas will decline.
Nevertheless, the need to treat all workers in a fair, dignified and acceptable manner is fundamental to the governments approach in this legislation.
Contributions in this debate from the opposition point to a minority of companies being engaged in unacceptable conduct towards 457 Visa holders.
It seemed to me that the plight of migrant workers was being reduced to a statistical analysis.
This is unacceptable to the government.
It is illuminating when you analyse the statistics used by the opposition to defend the 457 visa system.
Senator Fierravanti-Wells argues that only 1.67% of sponsors were found to have breached their sponsorship obligations.
Given that Senator Fierravanti-Wells also points to the fact that nearly 19,000 employers use 457 visas then approximately 317 employers are breaching their obligations.
In my view, this understates the problem as many workers are fearful of reporting breaches due to intimidation from employers.
317 could be the tip of the iceberg.
Even on the opposition `s own figures thousands of workers are being exploited.
If one migrant worker is exploited then that is one worker too many.
If one migrant worker is killed or injured as a result of employer exploitation then that is one worker too many.
If one migrant worker is denied equal pay for work of equal value then that is one worker too many.
If one migrant worker is intimidated then that is one worker too many.
If one migrant worker believes Australia is a bad place to work then that is one worker too many.
I note the opposition claim that the union campaign of opposition to 457 visas had been over sensationalised by the media.
Far be it from me to defend the media however it is fare and reasonable and in the national interest to report the death, injury, exploitation, and intimidation of any worker including migrant workers.
I have had personal experience attempting to assist 457 visa workers who have been outrageously exploited.
The problems with the system have also been documented by the Victorian Magistrates Court, the Victorian Workplace Rights Advocate, and the Australian Human Rights Commission.
The Visa Subclass 457 Integrity Review conducted by the industrial relations expert Barbara Deegan also raised major issues with the programme.
The Australian human rights commission documented numerous examples of the exploitation of workers on subclass 457 visas. Issues raised by people making complaints include:
Not being paid overtime
Working longer hours or days than non-Visa employees
Limited access to sick leave and dismissal if the Visa holder takes sick leave
Dismissal because the Visa holder was pregnant
Dismissal for taking leave to care for a sick spouse or child
Overcharges on rent or other expenses organised by the employer
Sexual harassment
Despite the predictable opposition by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry to the changes in this legislation, other employer groups such as the Motor Traders Association of Australia noted their “in principle support to strengthen the integrity of the subclass 457 Visa procedures, while ensuring smooth access by employers” they go on to support “the principles of fairness that underpin the subclass 457 Visa regime”
The Queensland government stated that “the support of the Queensland government for the 457 Visa programme is contingent upon a clear understanding that it does not undermine Australian employment opportunities, wages or working conditions”
The Minerals Council of Australia “strongly support the need for the system to be operated with integrity so that all parties have confidence that Australia remains internationally competitive in facilitating Labour movement whilst at the same time safeguarding employment and training opportunities for Australian workers and protecting overseas workers from exploitation”
The New South Wales government “supports the Australian government’s efforts to reform the employer sponsored temporary migration program. These reforms should ensure the program is flexible and responsive to the needs of Australian employers, while respecting the rights and dignity of employer- sponsored migrants and ensuring transparency, accountability and integrity in the administration of the program”
The Deegan report has formulated a range of recommendations (67 in all) that go to the problems with the 457 visa system and proposed resolution to the problems.
The government has referred the report to the Skilled Migration Consultative Panel which comprises representatives from business and industry groups, state government and unions.
The panel will provide feedback and advise the government on the report, which includes recommendations to:
Abolish the minimum salary level in favour of market rates of pay for all temporary visa holders on salaries less than $100,000
Develop and accreditation system risk matrix to ensure rapid processing of low risk visa applications so employers can meet skills needs quickly
Develop new lists, setting out the skilled occupations for which temporary work visas can be granted
Limit Visa holders to stay no longer than eight years in Australia (i.e. two four-year visas or four two-year visas) while providing a pathway to permanent residency for those who have the required language skills.
The Minister for immigration and citizenship, Senator Chris Evans has said that the recommendations and the views of the consultant of panel will inform the development of the government’s reforms to the temporary skilled migration program as part of the 2009 budget.
In the meantime this amendment will:
Lead to effective and efficient identification of non compliance through expanded investigative powers.
Discourage inappropriate use of the temporary skilled visas program;
Provide an effective price signal to encourage the hiring and training of Australian citizens and permanent residents and, most importantly;
Protect overseas workers from exploitation;
The legislation strikes an appropriate balance between:
facilitating the entry of overseas workers to meet genuine skill shortages;
Preserving the integrity of the Australian labour market, and:
Protecting overseas workers from exploitation.

You will be aware that in my short time in this place, I have shown steady interest in matters relating to migration law.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Minister and his office for their efforts to provide regular and detailed briefings over the past three weeks, particularly in relation to the Governments’ plans to review timelines for judicial review of migration decisions.
I wish to acknowledge the Minister’s offer to take a personal interest in the case I have raised previously in relation to a young Afghani refugee who had a number of family members killed by the Taliban, as well as other cases that are brought to his attention which demonstrate unique and exceptional cases.
I would also like to again commend the Circle of Friends for their advocacy in relation to such cases.
I appreciate his position in relation to Ministerial Intervention and look forward to future discussions which will hopefully produce a fairer appeals and approval system, which will make such intervention less necessary.
I am certain that we will not see eye to eye on every matter in this complex and contentious area of policy, but I respect the Ministers’ efforts and thank him.
That said, I support the broad intention of this bill and indicate that I will be supporting its second reading.
I commend this bill with its intent that it will better protect foreign workers from improper practices by Australian migration sponsors.
I note that the bill aims to make changes to sub class 457 temporary residence visas to provide greater flexibility in Ministerial approval of group sponsorships, improved information about sponsor responsibilities, increased powers to explore non-compliant sponsors and harsher penalties.
I will not take up more time of the Senate going through the specific mechanisms by which this will be achieved. However, I have a number of points on which I would like clarification from the Minister in the committee stage.
Firstly, this bill sets up a framework in which regulations will be developed to enable the bills broader goals. Could the Minister please provide information on the nature and detail of these regulations as they currently stand?
Secondly, I note that red tape, requirements for quantifiable training programs and external training providers can make sponsorship onerous for smaller and niche businesses. In what ways will these changes, if any, will these changes make it easier for these businesses to become approved sponsors?
Finally, I note that medical examinations and English testing can produce significant delays in departmental processing of individual applicants and suggest that these new provisions are to reduce some of these delays. Is this an accurate interpretation? And if so, what measures does the Minister plan to reduce these delays for all 457 visa applicants?
With these things in mind, I support the second reading of this bill and look forward to the Minister’s response in the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WORKER PROTECTION) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2008-11-27,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

I rise today to speak on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Worker Protection) Bill 2008.
The bill is a welcome move in proving a more robust framework for temporary working visa arrangements, particularly for workers on 457 visas.
457 visas have been a very contentious part of Australia’s broader immigration system. The Australian Greens have always had serious concerns about the scheme while recognising the policy intent behind it.
It is a scheme that needs to balance a genuine need for skilled workers in certain industries and occupations with protection for those workers. There is also a need to ensure the scheme does not provide a disincentive for the provision of training opportunities for workers in Australia.
This is a difficult balancing act. In the past we believe the balance was not met. We along with many others were concerned that 457 visas were becoming the first option for employers, often resulting in workers being exploited.

Bill provisions

The bill before us today is a start in beginning to address some of the problems of 457 visas.
The bill addresses four key areas:
Expanded powers to monitor and investigate employer non-compliance with the 457 visa scheme;
A framework for punitive penalties for employers found to be in breach of their obligations
Improved information sharing between government agencies to improve compliance; and
A redefined sponsorship obligations framework for employers of 457 visa workers and a range of other temporary work visas
The improved compliance regime, inspectorate powers and information sharing provisions are welcome. It is always the case that the integrity of a scheme such as this depends as much on compliance than on the standards to be complied with.
We support the provision setting out the investigative powers to monitor workplaces and conduct site visits to determine whether employers are complying with the redefined sponsorship obligations and making those powers similar to the powers of workplace, inspectors under the Workplace Relations Act 1996.
We expect sufficient resources will be provided by the Department to ensure that the compliance framework is effective and those sponsors that do try and exploit workers will be discovered and investigated.
We further support the instigation of a civil penalty regime with fines of up to $33 000 as well as the ability to cancel an employer’s approval as a sponsor or bar them from making applications for approval as a sponsor for a period of time. We believe a civil penalty regime is entirely appropriate for the breaching of sponsorship obligations.
Some concern has been raised from the business community about the transitional provisions of the bill extending these measures to existing 457 visa sponsors. The Greens support the transitional provisions and the application of the new compliance regime, powers of inspectors and information sharing laws applying to current sponsors. We also support any new sponsorship obligations made by regulation to apply to current visa sponsors and workers.

Lack of regulations

The main concern we have with this bill is that it provides for sponsorship obligations to be made by regulations but we have not yet had a chance to consider what the Government believes those obligations should be.
It would have been preferable to debate this bill in the context of draft regulations.
I ask the Minister to guarantee that he will release an exposure draft of the regulations, particularly those establishing the sponsorship obligations, before they are finalised.
While the regulations will be disallowable, a disallowance is a blunt instrument for dealing with details and these regulations will be full of details. An exposure draft on the regulations will allow a debate on the details.
I would also like to take this opportunity to draw the Senate’s attention to the United Nations Convention on the Protection of All Migrant Workers and their Families. It is not a Convention Australia has signed but it does lay down the basic rights of migrant workers. Particularly with respect to workers rights issues, we would expect the Government to take the Convention into consideration.
The convention holds that migrant workers should be afforded basic human rights such as not being held in slavery or servitude or be required to perform forced or compulsory labour; that migrant workers have freedom of expression and freedom of religion; that migrant workers shall to be subject to arbitrary or unlawful interference with their privacy or be arbitrarily deprived of property - all pretty non-controversial I would think.
Equally with respect to employment it should be non-controversial to apply these Convention standards - that migrant workers shall be treated equally in respect of remuneration, and other condition of work such as overtime, hours of work, rest breaks, holidays with pay, health and safety and termination of the employment relationship.
The Convention also states that migrant workers have the right to medical care and that the children of migrant workers have the right to access education.
We urge the Government to take into account the Convention and consider a “rights based” approach to protecting temporary workers.

Pacific Islander Seasonal Worker scheme

A rights based approach is particularly important if the seasonal worker program will be covered by this bill in the future.
We are unclear at this stage whether it is the Government’s intention for the seasonal worker program to be governed by this legislation. The framework certainly suggests that it should be, with regulations being able to establish different obligations for different visas, and with the enforcement and compliance regime.
The Greens are not opposed to the trail of a seasonal worker scheme but we are concerned to ensure that the exploitation of 457 workers that has occurred is not repeated again.

Issues with 457 visas

Turning now to some of the issues that have been raised about the 457 visa program:
We agree with the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union when in welcoming more robust regime of obligations, reporting, regulation and enforcement, it also indicated:
“it remains our position that the fundamental issues that must be addressed relate to the reintroduction of labour market testing, mandatory payment of market rates and employment of 457 workers on collective agreements.
We believe that these reforms would remove the motive and capacity of employers to use 457 workers in circumstances other than those where a legitimate skills shortage exists. They would also mediate the inherent vulnerability of 457 workers attributed to the direct link between the employment relationship with a single employer and the right to stay in Australia to work. Failure to address these questions will leave in place the source of the current problems.”
The submissions to the Deegan Review and the Discussion Paper provide a useful summary of the problems encountered by many 457 visa workers and point to issues that the Government needs to address.

Wages and costs

The issue of wages for 457 workers is important for a couple of key reasons. Appropriate wages ensure that migrant workers are not exploited but they also mean that the temporary worker scheme is not used to undermine wages for other workers.
We welcome the increase in the Minimum Salary Level made recently but we question whether the MSL formula is the most appropriate way of dealing with wages. We would like to see a requirement for salaries to be at market rates. The 457 scheme must be about bringing in needed skilled workers, not cheap labour.
The Greens are also inclined to support requirements for sponsors to pay travel costs, costs associated with recruitment migration agent services and registration or licensing fees. We also believe there is a strong case for sponsors to pay for income protection and medical expenses or health insurance for visa holders.

Exploitation

It is not just through low wages that temporary migrant workers can be exploited. There is no question that there have been and are 457 visa workers who have exploited. The trade unions have played an important role in exposing these situations such as appalling accommodation, unjustified deductions from pay, workers doing work they are trained for.
Most significantly we recognise that many 457 workers, especially those working in the semi-skilled jobs, are vulnerable to threats of deportation.
As John Sutton from the CFMEU said at the Senate Inquiry hearing into the bill:
“Wherever there are manual workers coming from a developing country, a poor country, and they are under a sponsorship arrangement where they have the knowledge that, if the sponsorship is terminated, the department will ask them to leave the country in 28 days, there are some pretty powerful forces at work that not in all instances but in many instances lead to pretty serious exploitation.”

Skills/training opportunities

A final important matter I wish to touch on is skills and training. The 457 visa program is specifically designed to allow temporary workers with skills not readily available to employers. The program needs to be carefully directed to areas with genuine skills shortages and to ensure that 457 visas do not become a substitute for local skills development.
While we recognise that no matter how fast we can train people up, some industries will continue to need temporary workers. The engineering profession for example demonstrated the shortage could not readily be made up though local training —we just aren’t graduating enough engineers.
But the government needs to make sure that employers are also investing in the local workforce for long term sustainability. We support obligations on employers to demonstrate a commitment to education and training for the long term.
Similarly, the Greens support a requirement not to use 457 workers as strike breakers. This goes against the intention of the program and could undermine the local workforce exercising their democratic rights.
These are some of the matters we expect the regulations setting out the sponsorship obligations to address.

Conclusion

On a number of the issues I have raised today I wish to seek some clarification from the Minister.
The Greens believe the 457 visa program cannot be an easy or cheap alternative for employers. We support the measures in this bill to improve the integrity of the scheme and in particular the compliance framework.
We would have preferred to have debated this bill having had an opportunity to consider draft regulations. The obligations on sponsors that the regulations will contain are pivotal to the future integrity of the scheme.
The Greens will be considering the regulations carefully and as I mentioned before expect the Minister to provide an exposure draft and open them up to appropriate debate and scrutiny.
Despite the lack of regulations the Greens are prepared to support this bill now given the other elements of the bill relating to a stronger compliance framework will apply to current sponsors of 457 workers.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WORKER PROTECTION) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2008-11-27,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

I rise to speak on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Worker Protection) Bill 2008.
This bill was introduced to the Senate by Senator Evans, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to provide for better protection of migrant workers in Australia.
The amendments before the Senate today arose out of a review of the 457 visa program which the Rudd Government announced earlier this year.
The subclass 457 or Temporary Business Entry visa was introduced by the Howard Government in August 1996 to provide temporary relief for businesses suffering from skills shortages.
Under the 457 visa, an employer can sponsor an overseas worker to work in Australia on a temporary basis.
The 457 visa was intended as a stop-gap measure —not a substitute —for the shortage of skills in Australian industries.
However, the explosion of 457 visa applicants in recent years is symptomatic of the failure of the Howard Government to address Australia’s skills crisis.
In the first year of the visa program’s operation, 1997-98, there were just over 30,000 visas granted.
These figures include eligible secondary applicants – or family members living in Australia with the primary applicant for the period of their stay.
The number of visas granted has steadily increased over time, but appears to have increased dramatically in the past three or four years.
By 2005-06 the number of 457 visas granted had reached just over 70,000, up from 48,000 the previous year.
In the year to June 2008 (the year just gone) a massive 110,000, of what are now known as Temporary Skilled Migration Visas, were issued.
The rapid growth in 457 visas is symptomatic of the Howard Government’s failure over its twelve long years in office to plan for the skills needs of Australia.
While they were raking in masses of revenue off the back of the resources boom, they had plenty of opportunity to invest in the skills and qualifications of Australians.
Instead they allowed Australia’s skills crisis to continue unchecked.
The Rudd Government, on the other hand, is serious about addressing the skills crisis.
One of the roles of government is to forecast the skills needs of the country and to take steps to skill our workforce so that Australia’s skills needs can be met first and foremost by Australian workers.
The Rudd Government will give priority to training and skilling Australian workers so that our own workforce can meet the skills needs of industry.
We will work to ensure that Australia’s workforce has the capabilities necessary to fill as many Australian jobs as possible.
This is why we announced in the May Budget that we would make a $19.3 billion investment in education and training to provide employment opportunities for Australians.
We have committed to this investment for the future because we recognise that skills are a vital element in a productive economy.
Having said that, we recognise that developing qualifications takes time and so, therefore, will not meet the immediate skills needs of industry.
Consequently - we support the 457 visa program as a temporary measure to meet short term skills shortages.
But a program for temporary overseas workers should not end up becoming a long term response to Australia’s failure to plan for its own skills needs as it was under the previous government.
The other unfortunate side effect of the 457 visa program has been the mistreatment and exploitation of workers.
While the vast majority of employers do the right thing, the Rudd Government share concerns, with others, about the incidence of employer breaches in the subclass 457 visa program.
There were 1353 employers formally warned and 192 sponsors formally sanctioned in 2007-2008.
Comparatively in 2006-2007 there were only 95 sanctions and 313 formal warnings - so you can see that this government is acting to protect these workers.
Australia cannot take pride in its 457 visa program until we take serious steps to combat the human misery visited on overseas workers by some unscrupulous employers.
I quote Senator Evans who recently stated:
“The temporary working visa scheme is only sustainable if the community is confident that overseas workers are not being exploited or used to undermine local wages and conditions”.
This is what the bill before the Senate today seeks to address.
On 28 August 2007 the Sydney Morning Herald reported three deaths of workers sponsored on 457 visas.
In two of the three cases, the workers were undertaking menial labouring work instead of the skilled work they were brought over for.
They had also complained to their families that their working conditions had been a lot tougher than they were told to expect before they came to Australia.
In the third case, the worker was killed by a tree while operating a chainsaw—a job for which he had no previous experience.
All three left behind families including wives and children.
Clearly employers are breaching their obligations under the temporary skilled migration program if they expect overseas workers to engage in work that do not employ the skills they were apparently brought over for.
However, it is one thing to have reasonable obligations for sponsors of 457 visas, it is another entirely to have the monitoring and oversight to effectively enforce those obligations.
The workers referred to by the Herald’s article may have survived had they felt confident to complain about the conditions they were employed under.
These cases reveal an unfortunate feature of the 457 visa program which is the vulnerability of workers to exploitation.
This vulnerability has been exposed in various court cases.
For example fifteen 457 visa holders employed by Hanssen Pty Ltd signed unapproved Australian Workplace Agreements for which their employer failed to provide information statements.
The workers did not speak up for fear of deportation and their employer exploited that fear.
A similar vulnerability was identified by the Federal Magistrate in the case of Zefirrelli Pizza Restaurant, who underpaid employees on 457 visas.
There have been other examples where visa holders who question the actions of their employer have been dismissed and then deported as an example to other workers to ensure their compliance.
When we hear about cases of workers on 457 visas who got justice because one of them was brave enough to complain to the authorities, it really should make us wonder how many more cases go unreported.
As I said in my speech on Fair Work Australia, there is no greater financial or human cost in workplace relations than the failure to have effective Occupational Health and Safety arrangements.
Such arrangements rely on the ability of workers to raise complaints and issues.
457 visa workers cannot raise OH&S concerns if they are silenced by fear.
OH&S is especially important for 457 visa workers as they tend to be employed in high-risk industries such as construction, manufacturing and mining.
This is why the temporary skilled migration scheme needs proactive monitoring, why workers need to be made aware of their rights, and why employers need to have their obligations enforced with penalties that provide an effective deterrent.
I note that last Monday, in an article in the West Australian, the Shadow Minister for Immigration said that the Opposition would support our reforms.
The Shadow Minister, Sharman Stone, went on to admit that the 457 visa scheme led to exploitation of workers.
While I welcome the Opposition’s support, I would like to know why they decided to wait for the Rudd Government to put forward the legislation before supporting reform.
Have cases of worker exploitation only recently come to their attention?
We identified exploitation of overseas workers years ago and have been calling for changes to 457 visas ever since.
So why did the Opposition fail to lead on temporary skilled migration reform when they were in Government?
I would be very interested to hear Dr Stone explain in The Other Place why she suddenly sees reform of the temporary skilled migration system as necessary after the litany of complaints and concerns that were raised for many years while her party was in Government.
Of course the Rudd Government recognises that reform is overdue and we are leading on it.
On 18 April 2008, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Evans, established an independent integrity review into the 457 subclass visa.
The terms of reference of the review included:
measures to strengthen the integrity of the 457 visa program
the employment conditions that apply to workers employed under the temporary skilled migration program
the adequacy of measures to protect 457 visa holders from exploitation
the health and safety protections and training requirements that apply in relation to temporary skilled workers
the English language requirements for the granting of temporary skilled migration workers’ visas, and
the opportunities for Labour Agreements to contribute to the integrity of the temporary skilled migration program.
The Migration Amendment (Worker Protection) Bill is the Government’s response to the review’s recommendations.
It contains a number of measures to strengthen the integrity of Australia’s temporary skilled migration program and to minimise the exploitation of workers.
The bill contains improved sanction powers—including new powers—against a sponsor who fails to satisfy a sponsorship obligation.
In the event of a sponsor failing to satisfy their obligations, the Department of Immigration may initiate civil proceedings against them in the Federal Court.
A penalty of up to 60 penalty units (currently $6,600) can be imposed on an individual or 300 penalty units (currently $33,000) on a body corporate.
The Department may cancel the sponsor’s approval as a sponsor and bar them for a time from making further applications for approval as a sponsor.
The bill also contains provisions for improved monitoring and information sharing.
It will allow the Department to collect contact details of 457 visa holders from larger employers for the purpose of providing them with information about their rights and entitlements while in Australia.
The bill will allow for greater information sharing between the Department, the sponsor and the visa holder allowing all three parties to be better informed of each others’ circumstances.
There will also be provisions for information sharing between Commonwealth, State and Territory governments to facilitate a whole-of-government approach to compliance.
Provisions in the bill will amend the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to allow the Commissioner of Taxation to disclose tax information to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship.
This will allow the Department to confirm with the Tax Office what taxable salary is being paid to visa holders for the purpose of ensuring that the minimum required salary is being paid.
The bill will introduce a better regime for monitoring compliance with the obligations of the visa.
New inspector powers will be granted modelled on the workplace inspector powers in the Workplace Relations Act 1996.
Inspectors will have the power to
enter the premises without force,
inspect the premises,
interview any person,
require the production of documents, and
copy such documents.
The bill will also improve the framework for sponsorship, setting out obligations for approved sponsors in Regulations that for the first time will be enforceable by law.
The Regulations will be developed in consultation with stakeholders and finalised in the coming months.
The Regulations will establish a process to vary an approval so that an approved sponsor does not have to go through the whole sponsorship process again just to seek a variation to their sponsorship.
The bill introduces a range of provisions to better protect temporary overseas skilled workers. It includes:
improved monitoring powers,
the introduction of civil penalties for sponsors who breach obligations,
clarifying sponsor obligations and ensuring they are enforceable under the Act, and
greater information sharing between governments and Government agencies
This reform process is central to maintaining the integrity of Australia’s temporary skilled migration regime and restoring community confidence in the protection of the rights of overseas workers.
While these reforms are important and necessary, the Government is open to advice and feedback on further reform.
The Rudd Government has therefore established a Skilled Migration Consultative Panel comprising representatives from State and Territory governments, the business community and other industrial stakeholders.
This Panel will consider proposals for temporary skills migration reform and advise on their impact on business, the Australian workforce and the broader community.
In conclusion, let me re-iterate:
The Rudd government has worked to strengthen the integrity of the temporary skilled working visa program by:
As of 1st August this year increasing the minimum salary level for subclass 457 visa holders (for the first time in two years) and that applies to existing visa holders.
Appointed an Industrial Relations Commissioner, Barbara Deegan to review the integrity of the current subclass 457 visa program with the aim of better protecting overseas workers.
This report will be referred to the Skilled Migration consultative Panel which is made up of industry, union and state government representatives.
And introduced the Migration Legislation Amendment (Worker Protection) Bill 2008 which has four main provisions:
expanded powers to monitor and investigate concerns of non-compliance by sponsors
the establishment of penalties for employers found in breach of their obligations
Improved information sharing to allow immigration officials to check the tax records of employers and employees to ensure they are paying the correct wages; and
Better defined sponsorship obligations for employers and other sponsors.
The details of the obligations will be finalised in consultation with the consultative Panel by early next year.
I would like to congratulate the Minister on his initiative in bringing this reform proposal to the Senate and for the sake of 457 visa holders throughout Australia I urge all Senators to support it.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2008-11-27,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important piece of legislation.
In my first speech, I wished the Leader of the Senate and Immigration Minister well as he attempted to untangle the mess that the previous government made of our immigration system.
In particular, I highlighted that the exploitation of workers under 457 visas still needed to be resolved.
I pointed out that, unless all workers in Australia enjoyed the same rights and entitlements, even those whose licence to stay here is only temporary, our immigration system would be undermined
The Australian public, and Australian workers in particular, need to be assured that the immigration system is not being used as a backdoor way to undermine Australian working conditions
I am pleased the work needed to restore faith in our immigration system is now underway through this bill and other work forthcoming.
This bill is a positive reform that will help put a stop to unscrupulous behaviour.
It will help put an end to the exploitation of workers, who arrive in Australia with skills that assist our economy to grow, but who experience abuse and mistreatment.
It will put an end to the unplanned and unregulated explosion of the Subclass 457 visa program.
It will help ensure that Australian workers wages and conditions are not undermined.
This is particularly important in these times of economic uncertainty
457 visas are, in and of themselves, not the villain in this picture.
457s were originally brought about to address the widespread skills shortages.
My home state of Western Australia has particularly benefited from the skills that temporary workers have brought to our state and our economy.
The resources boom has provided employment for many, particularly in WA.
And still more skilled workers were needed.
But as we know, this was partly because the previous government had failed to invest in skills development, in long term education and training.
Addressing the skills shortage is a priority for the Rudd Labor Government
We are addressing the skills shortage - not only by fixing up the 457 visa program - but also through the provision of $19.3 billion in education and training opportunities in the 2008-09 budget.
The Government has committed an investment of $1.9 billion over five years for up to 630,000 new training places.
We’re building the skills and knowledge for the jobs of the future.
The subclass 457 visa program has benefited employers by providing access to migrants with ready skills that have helped businesses to grow.
It has also given some temporary migrants the opportunity to work in Australia:
to use and develop their skills;
to earn good wages; and
to enjoy good working conditions.
But that hasn’t been not the case for all temporary migrant workers.
Increasing demand for skilled workers, particularly over the last five years, has put pressure on the 457 visa program.
The scheme has grown rapidly.
It has expanded to include lower-skilled occupations
And this expansion has brought with it many temporary workers with lower levels of English language skills.
This context has led to increased exploitation and abuse of workers under the scheme.
Workers have been exploited in a number of ways - including being underpaid and not paid at the correct salary level and even not being paid at all.
The AMWU has brought to my attention many examples of the ways in which workers are being exploited under the scheme.
Cases like that of the company Aprint.
In September last year, this company withheld $93,000 in wages from four Chinese 457 visa workers.
The workers were made to work more than 60 hours a week.
More than ten thousand dollars was taken from their wages for lawyers and travel fees.
The company was fined $9,240 for breaching the Workplace Relations Act.
But amazingly, the company was not subject to any penalty in relation to breaches of their obligations under the 457 visa scheme.
Recently, I met with a group of Filipino workers who are currently in Australia on 457 visas.
I heard their stories of exploitation.
One group of workers told me they were required by their employer to live in one house.
Rent was deducted from their wages for the privilege of living in this house.
They were not free to move to other, more suitable or cheaper accommodation.
Two of the workers wanted to move out.
They wanted to live in different accommodation.
They wanted choice over this critical aspect of their living conditions
But after repeatedly requesting that the company stop deducting rent from their wages, they were told that the house they were living in was owned by the company, and therefore, that rent deductions would not be stopped.
This is not an isolated case, there are many others just like it
The union advocated on behalf of these workers, and finally, they were paid back the amount of rent that was deducted from their wages.
Before this union advocacy, they had no choice, no options and no say.
This kind of exploitation has led workers, their unions and many employers to raise serious concerns about the integrity of the program.
What such examples of exploitation make clear - is the need for penalties to be applied to unscrupulous employers.
And this legislation does just this.
Labor is committed to ensuring that employers know their rights and responsibilities under the scheme and act accordingly
The government is also committed to making sure that local workers do not lose job opportunities to workers on 457 visas.
Employers must abide by conditions that make sure that we keep providing employment and training opportunities for Australian workers.
$19.6 million has been allocated in the 2008-2009 budget by the Rudd government to improve the processing and compliance aspects of the 457 visa program.
The bill will expand powers to monitor and investigate non-compliance by sponsors of workers
This is of critical importance because it will allow for more trained officers who will be able to conduct site visits to make sure sponsors are complying with their obligations.
These inspectors will be able to
Inspect the premises;
Interview people
Require that sponsors produce particular documents, and
Copy documents
Sponsors who do not cooperate with a written request to produce a document may face up to 6 months imprisonment.
The exploitation of workers through not paying wages or paying incorrect wages will be dealt with by penalties such as fines of up to $33,000 for companies that breach their obligations.
The bill will also improve information sharing across government to make sure that the correct salary is being paid to workers.
Again, this will help put a stop to the exploitation of workers.
It will also provide clarity in relation to the obligations of employers and other sponsors.
This includes providing clarity on the time period within which a sponsor must meet their obligations and the way in which the obligations are to be satisfied.
And these obligations will be, for the first time, enforceable by law.
Sponsors who have already been approved may not need to go through the whole process of seeking sponsorship approval when they want to vary their sponsorship.
This will make the whole sponsorship approval process much more efficient.
So this legislation will be good for employers and it will be good for workers.
It is the first step in the process of rectifying a system that contributed to the exploitation of workers under the previous government.
But there is more to be done.
I was pleased to meet with workers on 457 visas recently here in parliament and with delegates from the AMWU, the ANF and the CFMEU about this issue.
Through this delegation and through individual meetings with visa holders I have heard that there is a real need to improve access to health and community services for workers and their families.
Employers should not be able to direct workers as to whether seek medical attention.
As the AMWU points out – imagine a situation where a worker is sick and needs medical treatment but pressure is put on them not to attend health services by the employer because of the cost.
That is not an acceptable situation for any worker.
Many of these workers, and the families that sometimes accompany them, live in isolation.
For some, their world is limited to the workplace –
Even their accommodation is dictated by their employer
But more than that, workers are even isolated in the workplace, isolated from fellow workers who are Australian residents
457 visa holders should have the right to collectively bargain their wages and conditions alongside their work colleagues who are Australian residents.
They should not, as some do now, experience fear and intimidation when trying to find out what their rights are.
They should not, as some do now, experience fear and intimidation when they want to talk to other workers about their pay and conditions.
They should be in a position, as all Australian workers should be, to feel confident that contacting their union will not bring with it retribution of some kind.
This workplace isolation is compounded by the isolation that families of 457 workers experience.
Those that are fortunate enough to have their families with them sometimes feel cut off from their communities and from services they should be able to access.
I note there are some very successful programs operating in my home state of WA to break down the isolation experienced by temporary migrant workers and their families.
The AMWU has been successful in working with community organizations and particular groups of workers to develop social networks, so that this isolation can be broken down and workers can get to know their rights.
The government knows there is more work to be done.
That’s why earlier this year the Minister for Immigration appointed Barbara Deegan to conduct a broad review of the integrity of the 457 visa program.
Ms Deegan’s report clearly states the complexity that 457 visa holders and their sponsors face.
The report details the ways in which 457 visa holders are exploited and the way in which the system, through rapid growth and long term neglect has perpetuated this.
The report paints a way forward including replacing Minimum Salary Levels which visa holders are currently paid under with a fairer market rate system for all workers earning under $100, 000 per annum.
Lack of information about rights and obligations by 457 visa holders is a common theme through the report.
Giving information to workers about their rights can lead to ending exploitation.
Recommendations such as giving information to new applicants regarding realistic pathways to permanent residency such as skill and English language requirements.
And providing clarity around the right to end their employment and seek work with another employer.
This is to stop insidious situations in which workers feel they cannot speak up about poor and unsafe work practices in case it jeopardizes their application for permanent residency.
The report also recommends that employers be barred from taking money from workers as a result of the worker gaining employment with them and from deducting wages for the payment of any agent.
The report made an important recommendation on the issue of fair pay. Arguing that 457 visa holders should be paid the same as the Australian workers they work alongside.
This is in the best interests of these workers, equal pay for the same work. Such provisions will also help ensure that employers don’t seek to bring in 457 workers just because it is cheaper, but will only do so when there is a legitimate shortage of appropriate labour. In the current economic climate in an uncertain labour market this is vitally important.
Stopping the exploitation of workers, making sure they have access to information about their rights and making the system run more smoothly and efficiently is the first priority.
And for that reason I commend this bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WORKER PROTECTION) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2008-11-27,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

It is a pleasure to speak today on a bill that will lead to some much needed reform of Australia’s migration policies. My office deals with many constituent enquiries surrounding migration and these enquiries are rarely solved quickly, but require much research and time. Often these enquiries are about reuniting family members, finding employment or gaining citizenship, all situations that can cause significant stress.
Under the previous Government, Australia’s immigration policies were cause for international condemnation, particularly our detention policy. Many people - even Australian citizens - were kept in detention for years, despite posing no danger to the community and children were also trapped in those environments.
This destructive detention scheme caused much pain to many and cost taxpayers a lot of money. The Rudd Government is working to change all this and is working to reform the system to take a risk based rather than punitive approach to detention policy.
This government is committed to protecting our nation from the potential dangers posed by some unauthorised arrivals or unlawful non-citizens, but we are also committed to treating people with dignity.
We are not putting our country’s security in jeopardy as we make these changes; we are simply putting the concept of human decency back into Australia’s immigration policies. Labor does not believe that we can only protect our nation at the expense of other’s rights and quality of life.
The Government is still maintaining mandatory detention for those unlawful people who are not Australian citizens and who present an unacceptable risk to the community or who repeatedly refuse to comply with their visa conditions. Unauthorised boat arrivals will still be subject to mandatory detention for health, identity and security checks. But let me be clear that we will only use detention centres as a last resort and for the shortest practicable time.
The Joint Standing Committee on Migration is currently conducting an inquiry into Immigration Detention in Australia. As a member of the committee, I have visited a number of detention centres in Victoria, Christmas Island and Western Australia with the inquiry and these experiences have given me a deeper understanding of the system. The issue of immigration is always an emotive one and detention centres are something that people are extremely passionate about, one way or the other; this was evident in the 133 submissions received by the inquiry.
The committee has held public hearings in Darwin, Christmas Island, Canberra, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. The information presented by witnesses at these inquiries is often moving and always informative.
The inquiry so far has proven to be very beneficial to the Government and I thank everyone who has taken the time to take us around detention centres, appear as witnesses and make submissions. We are making informed decisions as we move Australia forward.
I am pleased to note that these moves forward haven’t gone unnoticed. Earlier this month the Sydney Morning Herald published a story regarding the Rudd Government’s fast assessments of 26 Afghan and Iranian Asylum seekers on Christmas Island.
Steven Glass, a volunteer for the Refugee Advice and Casework Service is quoted as saying “ a number of the asylum-seekers are not behind fences and the kids are all going to the local school. My overall impression is [the department]- and GSL are going to whatever lengths they can to make conditions as good as possible. They are looking at planting trees, tearing down fences.”
The Citizenship Test is another Howard Government policy that caused great distress to my constituents last year. They visited and phoned the office asking many questions with much confusion and fear in their voices. The Rudd Government has also expressed its concerns about the structure and content of the test. For this reason we recently conducted an independent review to determine its fairness and effectiveness.
On Monday, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Evans tabled the report resulting from this review. The review found that while 99 per cent of skilled migrants were passing the test, almost one fifth of those who come to Australia as part of the Humanitarian Program are not. This shows that the test is acting as a barrier between people and Australian citizenship, not equipping them for citizenship as intended.
The Review Committee’s central recommendation is for the legislative requirement to have an “adequate knowledge of Australia and of the responsibilities and privileges of Australian citizenship” be linked to concepts and information people need to understand in order to make the Pledge of Commitment. This recommendation is supported by the Government.
Another reform that the Government has made is the abolition of the temporary protection visa regime, a regime which actively prevented refugees from being able to rebuild their lives. The regime denied refugees the entitlements and security of permanent residency, despite our international obligations. Not only was this a further stain on Australia’s reputation but it also entirely failed to serve its claimed purpose.
Evidence shows that the temporary protection visas did nothing to prevent unauthorised boat arrivals, in fact, numbers actually increased not long after the introduction of the regime.
This treatment of refugees was disgraceful. It is important that we treat these people with respect and recognise the varied benefits of accepting others into our country, including filling skills shortages. The resources boom, low levels of unemployment, and the failure of the previous Government to invest in the education and training, have contributed to skills shortages across the country.
Labor has tackled these skills shortage which were ignored by the Howard Government for so long. In May we released a Budget that invests $19.3 billion in education and training to ensure we continue to provide employment and training opportunities to Australians.
The Budget outlined the Government’s commitment to invest $1.9 billion over five years to fund up to 630,000 new training places. These new places will skill Australians for the jobs of tomorrow and close existing skills gaps.
While this investment into the education and training of Australians for the future is crucial, we need to take action that will give us immediate results too.
Over the last five years Australian employers have increasingly turned to the temporary skilled migration program to bring in the skilled workers they need. The Rudd Labor Government has eased the pressure on employers by adding an extra 31,000 skilled migrants to the 2008-09 migration program.
We have recognised that this record 30 per cent intake increase could put strain on a department already struggling with demand, and so we are working to tighten up processing procedures and improve servicing standards.
The Rudd Government knows that business needs as many skilled people it can get, so we are working to make the process easier for both employers and employees.
In light of the current economic situation, the numbers of skilled migrants coming in may change. The migration program is designed to fill positions that can’t be filled locally and Minister Evans is working to better target the program to the areas most in need, including; IT, engineering and health care.
While making amendments to existing programs, the Rudd Government has looked at new ways to assist Australian employers. The Australian horticulture industry reports that up to $700 million in fresh produce is left to rot because of the unmet demand for low skilled workers. We have developed the Pacific Island seasonal worker scheme to address this crisis.
The scheme will enable Pacific Islanders to work in Australia as seasonal guest workers, by expanding the existing subclass 416 visa to cover workers who have been invited by an approved organisation. The pilot scheme will run over three years and will allow up to 2500 seasonal workers from Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, Tonga and Vanuatu to work in the horticultural industry in regional Australia for up to seven months each year. This type of scheme has received widespread support from organisations, with the World Bank stating that ‘there is no doubt that expanding economic opportunities for Pacific Islanders will translate into a stronger Pacific and that is in the interests of all countries in the region.’
We have also taken action to reform the 457 visa program and this bill will take that reform even further. The previous Government allowed the 457 visa program to run without sufficient safeguards to prevent the exploitation of temporary skilled foreign workers or the undercutting of wages and conditions of Australian workers. Many stories emerged of 457 visa holders being exploited. One case which then Shadow Minister for Immigration, Integration and Citizenship, Tony Burke, spoke of last year was of a person who was being paid the official immigration rate of $42,000 a year, but had had to spend $20,000 to purchase the job. And that $20,000 was being deducted in equal instalments every day he was paid for the first year.
So he was being paid a further $20,000 less than what the visa said he was going to be paid and of course once the twelve months was up and he’d repaid the debt, he was immediately terminated without cause. The economy desperately needs access to temporary skilled labour, but this is only sustainable if the community is confident that temporary overseas workers are not being exploited or used to undermine local wages and conditions. The Rudd Government is committed to improving the 457 visa scheme, whilst protecting the rights of overseas workers along with the employment opportunities of our own citizens.
On the seventeenth of February this year we announced a package of migration measures designed to help alleviate Australia’s skills and labour shortages and ease inflationary pressures including:
adding 6000 places to the general skilled migration program;
expanding the reciprocal working holiday visa program for young people;
allowing working holiday makers who work for at least three months in the construction sector to apply for a further working holiday visa; and
appointing an external reference group to advise how temporary work visas could contribute to the supply of skilled labour.
The Government has made great progress in positive immigration policy reform, and the bill before us today is the next step in that reform process. The Migration Legislation Amendment (Worker Protection) Bill makes amendments to the Migration Act 1958. The aim of these amendments is to enhance the framework for the sponsorship of non-citizens seeking entry to Australia.
The new framework will strengthen the integrity of temporary working visa arrangements, including the existing Subclass 457 visa program.
This will be achieved through four main measures:
providing the structure for better defined sponsorship obligations for employers and other sponsors;
improved information sharing across all levels of government;
expanded powers to monitor and investigate possible non-compliance by sponsors; and
the introduction of meaningful penalties for sponsors found in breach of their obligations.
Let me go through these in more detail. The bill proposes to amend the Migration Act to provide that the Migration Regulations 1994 may specify the obligations to which particular classes of sponsor will be subject, together with when those obligations apply and how they may be satisfied. These obligations are not specified in the bill as a high degree of flexibility is necessary for the program to operate effectively over time and there will be a need to prescribe additional obligations as more visas are brought in with the new framework. If the obligations were written in this bill, it would make putting additional obligations in a very slow and difficult process.
Though the obligations have not been written, I can say that when prescribed in the Migration Regulations, they will:
lead to effective and efficient identification of non-compliance - this could be done for example by obliging sponsors to cooperate with monitoring by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship;
discourage inappropriate use of temporary skilled visa programs - this could be done for example by obliging sponsors to reimburse the Commonwealth for location, detention and removal expenses should the visa holder abscond; and
provide an effective price signal to encourage the hiring and training of Australian citizens and permanent residents; and, most importantly protect overseas workers from exploitation.
The current provisions for the disclosure of information have proved insufficient for effective and efficient operation of the temporary skilled migration program. For example, the Department cannot at present lawfully collect contact details of Subclass 457 visa holders from larger employers for the purpose of providing those visa holders with information about their rights and entitlements in Australia.
The Migration Legislation Amendment (Worker Protection) Bill will rectify this by expanding the range of circumstances in which the information may be shared between the Department, the sponsor and the visa holder. These amendments will ensure that the three parties involved in the program will be adequately informed of each others circumstances.
The bill will insert new provisions which amend the Taxation Administration Act 1953. These amendments will allow the Commissioner of Taxation to disclose tax information, if the tax information relates to a visa holder, former visa holder, approved sponsor, or former approved sponsor. This will allow the Department of Immigration and Citizenship to confirm with the Australian Taxation Office what taxable salary is being paid to visa holders.
The third main measure is another move designed to increase the protection of our workers from overseas. Amendments proposed in the bill will give specially trained employees of the Commonwealth the power to monitor compliance with program requirements, including the redefined obligations. These officers will be known as Inspectors and will be appointed by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship.
Inspectors will be able to conduct site visits as well as request relevant documents from sponsors in writing within specified timeframes.
The powers of these Inspectors will include:
inspect the premises;
interview any person;
require the production of documents; and
copy such documents.
The final measure I wish to discuss is the introduction of penalties. Current administrative sanctions have failed to encourage compliance in all circumstances. The amendments proposed in the bill introduce a civil penalties framework to actively discourage non-compliance.
This will allow civil legal action to be taken against sponsors who are found in breach of the redefined obligations found in the Migration Regulations. The maximum penalty per offence, which will be determined by a Court taking into account all relevant circumstances, is $6 600 for an individual and $33 000 for a body corporate. It is hoped that these penalties will encourage sponsors and visa holders to meet their obligations so that this system can be as fair and effective as possible.
Migrants play an important role in our country and they deserve to be treated as equal to Australian citizens. This bill will work towards that equality by ensuring that the working conditions of sponsored visa holders meet Australian standards. I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WORKER PROTECTION) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2008-11-27,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

The 457 visa program allows overseas workers to enter for a period of up to four years to work in skilled occupations.
I am happy to speak to this bill today as I have had a long running interest in this topic.
2007-08 saw almost 60 000 visas granted to overseas workers. This bill introduces a range of provisions to better protect temporary overseas workers under the Migration Act (1956).
There are four main elements to this bill:
The bill will improve monitoring powers
See the introduction of civil penalties for sponsors who breach obligations
Clarify the obligations that sponsors have and ensure that they are enforceable under the Act
And importantly, this bill will facilitate greater information sharing among agencies.
The new laws will enable specially trained officers with investigative powers to monitor workplaces and conduct site visits to determine whether employers are complying with the redefined sponsorship obligations.
Fines of up to $33 000 are proposed for employers found in breach of the obligations in the Migration Regulations.
Additionally, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship will retain the ability to cancel an employer’s sponsorship approval or bar sponsors from re-applying for approval for a set period of time.
This bill includes amendments which will allow the Commissioner of Taxation to disclose tax information of visa holders, former visa holders, approved sponsors, or former approved sponsors to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship in order ensure correct salary levels are being paid to all visa holders.
This amendment is complemented by several additional elements that will ensure the long-term success of the 457 visa programme.
As an important initial measure, this government introduced a wage increase of 3.8 per cent as of October this year. This increase comes after a two year freeze on the wages for 457 visa holders under the previous government.
Moreover, in April this year, industrial relations commissioner Barbara Deegan was appointed to conduct a broad review into the integrity of the temporary skilled migration program.
Ms Deegan’s recommendations will inform the development of longer-term reforms to the 457 visa program that will be brought forward in the 2009 Budget.
In June 2007 the previous Government introduced a Bill that included provisions which:
tightened the monitoring and sanction provisions that applied to 457 visa holders;
allowed for information sharing between the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and the ATO on 457 visa holders and their sponsors; and
clarified the obligations of 457 visa sponsors.
This was the previous Government belatedly attempting to address stories and examples of abuse of the 457 visa system.
Many of these abuses and cases of exploitation of workers were being characterised by commentators as “horror stories”. Yet in the face of these horror stories, the previous government did not prioritise the legislation and the bill was not passed before the 2007 Election.
Even still, a total of 192 sponsors were formally sanctioned and a further 1353 employers were formally warned in 2007-08. This compares with 95 sanctions and 313 formal warnings issued in 2006-07.
Examples of the horror stories involving 457 visas include the situation that arose with the company Dartbridge Welding.
This matter attracted a great deal of national media attention when it arose in late 2006. Dartbridge Welding recruited approximately 40 welders from the Philippines.
The welders were charged a $3,000 recruitment fee by a Filipino recruitment firm. They were also charged high levels of interest on this debt. Upon arrival in Australia, the welders were immediately taken to a bank and were presented with direct debit authorities to sign to give the employer and recruitment company the right to directly debit funds from the welders bank accounts.
The welders were placed in houses on the western outskirts of Brisbane, and charged $175.00 per week for rent, medical insurance and transport. The employer placed 8 people in each house, with two per each bedroom. The first job the welders undertook at Dartbridge was the fabrication of their beds.
The workers were subjected to a great deal of verbal abuse and threatening behaviour by the owner of Dartbridge. Following contact with the AMWU the welders joined the Union. Three of the most outspoken welders were dismissed from their employment.
Many more were threatened with dismissal and deportation.
In September 2007, Mr Yu Tu Chuoan of Aprint, withheld $93,000 in wages from four Chinese 457 visa workers. Mr Chuoan made the four work more than 60 hours a week and deducted more than ten thousand dollars from their wages for lawyers and travel fees.
Chuoan was fined $9,240 for breaching the Workplace Relations Act. He was not subject to any penalty in relation to breaches of his obligations under the 457 visa scheme. Under this legislation this will no longer be the case.
Recognising the need to address the cases of exploitation and abuse of the system, this Government has revived the bill and extended its scope.
The Migration Amendment (Workers Protection) Bill 2008 now includes important extra provisions:
The bill now applies to all temporary worker visas. For example, this now Includes, occupational trainees and medical practitioners.
This is to stop employers from simply moving to other visa classes to avoid the bill’s provisions
The bill now applies to visas issued under labour agreements. Again this is to stop employers from simply moving into labour agreements to avoid the bill’s provisions.
And the bill now includes provisions which make the system more flexible for employers.
The Department of Immigration and Citizenship has been allocated $19.6 million over four years for the implementation of a range of 457 visa integrity measures, including this bill.

$0m     $5.1m      $5.0m      $4.9m      $4.3m
The Improved sanction powers:
This bill maintains the sanctions of barring and cancelling where there is a breach of a sponsorship obligation, while providing for two new sanctions– civil penalty proceedings, and infringement notices in lieu of civil penalty proceedings.
The bill provides that if an approved sponsor fails to satisfy a sponsorship obligation, the Minister may seek an order in the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court that they pay a civil penalty of a maximum of 60 penalty units for an individual (currently $6 600) and 300 penalty units for a body corporate (currently $33 000).
The bill makes clear that if the sponsorship obligations are not satisfied, the department may impose one, several or all of the sanctions on the approved sponsor (or former approved sponsor). For example, if an approved sponsor was not paying the minimum salary level (MSL) to an employee (and it is a prescribed obligation to pay MSL), the department can cancel the sponsor’s approval. The department may also bar them from making applications for approval as a sponsor for a set period of time and initiate civil penalty proceedings in the Federal Court or Federal Magistrates Court.
The improved sanctions are important step forward by this government.
In recognising the contribution that the 457 visa programme makes to our economy, this government remains aware that it is also responsible for ensuring safe and fair workplace for the visa holders while working in this country.
Improved monitoring and information sharing
This bill introduces new powers for inspector which can be exercised for the purpose of monitoring compliance with sponsorship obligations and for other purposes prescribed in the Regulations.
The new inspector powers are modelled on the workplace inspector powers in the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (‘WRA’). This is to facilitate the carrying out of inspector functions by officers of Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR).
The bill provides that inspectors have the power to enter, without force, any place the inspector has reasonable cause to believe that there is anything relevant to the purposes for which they may exercise their powers.
These powers include:
The power to inspect the premises;
The power to interview any person;
The power to require the production of documents; and
To copy such documents.
These inspections can be conducted at any time during work hours, or at any other time necessary for the purposes of the power.
The bill inserts new provisions which will amend the Taxation Administration Act 1953. These amendments allow the Commissioner of Taxation to disclose tax information, if the tax information relates to a visa holder, former visa holder, approved sponsor, or former approved sponsor whose identity has been disclosed to the Commissioner of Taxation by the Minister for Immigration.
This will allow DIAC to confirm with the ATO what taxable salary is being paid to visa holders.
An improved sponsorship framework
The bill provides that the approved sponsor must satisfy prescribed obligations.
The prescribed obligations clearly set out the period of time in which an obligation must be satisfied, and the manner in which the obligation is to be satisfied.
The result being that for the first time, the obligations are enforceable by law.
The obligations were the result of wide-ranging consultation with relevant stakeholders.
Already approved sponsors will not need to go through the sponsorship application approval process when seeking a variation to their current sponsorship arrangements.
This will obviously create efficiencies for the client and for the Department.
The bill provides that additional sponsorship obligations set out in a labour agreement will be enforceable through the Migration Act.
Regarding Transitional arrangements – existing 457 visa sponsors
Existing standard business sponsors will be subject to the sponsorship obligations from the date of commencement of the bill and will no longer be subject to existing undertakings.
All aspects of the new sponsorship framework will apply to existing standard business sponsors.
The Rudd Government is committed to ensuring the Subclass 457 visa scheme operates as effectively as possible.
The Rudd government recognises that the 457 visa programme is essential to contributing to the supply of skilled labour for this country.
However, the Rudd government recognises that the benefits of the 457 visa programme must not be enjoyed by this country without ensuring the protection of the employment and training opportunities of Australians and the rights of overseas workers.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WORKER PROTECTION) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2008-11-27,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

I rise to add my support to the Migration Legislation Amendment (Worker Protection) Bill 2008.
This bill seeks to restore the integrity of the Subclass 457 visa program and, in doing so, rebuild community confidence in this important scheme.
It will introduce various measures designed to better protect those who come to Australia under this temporary workers’ arrangement from exploitation.
The bill proposes to amend the Migration Act (1958) to make sponsor obligations clearer, introduce civil penalties for those who fail to fulfil their 457 visa responsibilities, improve monitoring of the scheme and facilitate broader information sharing between government agencies.
Unlike a Bill introduced but never debated and never put to a vote by the former Howard government, this proposal importantly encompasses all temporary worker visas - including occupational trainees - and covers visas issued under labour agreements.
The changes we are introducing in the bill before us today are designed to prevent employers simply shifting to other visa classes or labour agreements to avoid their obligations.
As well as being structured to reinstate and safeguard the rights of workers, this document is designed to make this system more flexible for employers.
A properly functioning Subclass 457 visa scheme is an important contributor to the health of the Australian economy.
It is an important cog in the government’s efforts to continue to put downward pressure on interest rates and inflation by increasing the supply of skilled labour in this country.
It is no secret nor should it be a surprise that we are suffering an acute skills shortage in this country.
Unfortunately, eleven-and-a-half years of neglect in this area by the previous Howard Government made sure of that.
Addressing this serious and urgent need is one of the Rudd Government’s major commitments.
Our first priority is to attack this problem by educating and equipping Australians, so that employers’ skills demands are matched by the skills set of our community into the future.
In this year’s Budget, the government made a $19.3 billion pledge to get Australians ready and prepared for work.
A $1.9 billion investment committed within this sum will deliver up to 630,000 new training places provided over five years.
However, a skills crisis born out of indifference and inattention, and exacerbated by a resources boom and low unemployment, cannot be remedied overnight.
Industry needs skilled workers now and we simply do not have enough Australians appropriately trained and prepared to take up those jobs.
We need 457 visas, the overseas workers who receive them and the employers who sponsor those workers—and it is in everyone’s interests that it is a robust and transparent scheme.
The system originally was designed to be taken up by a small number of highly skilled, professional, English-speaking temporary migrants.
But in the past five years, as the skills crisis has worsened, the scheme has been forced to grow rapidly in response to industry demand.
In 2003-4 there were just fewer than 40,000 457 visas issued.
In the most recent financial year, this total had ballooned to more than 110,000.
Professionals—such as registered nurses and GPs and business, information and computer specialists—still make up the bulk of 457 visa workers.
However, labour market demands have been shifting across the life of the scheme.
The program has begun to attract greater numbers of tradespeople, as well as more workers from non-English speaking nations such as India, China and the Philippines.
With greater communication difficulties and lower levels of education, this growing group of employees has been at much higher risk of exploitation by unscrupulous employers.
Sadly, under the watch of the former Howard Government, exploitation became a scourge on the scheme.
Initially denying any problems with the 457 visas, then defending her department by virtue of the fact it could not properly monitor the scheme, the former minister ultimately ordered a stop on the public release of information about the program in 2006.
However, through the media, the Australian public began to hear about employers who were undermining local wages and conditions by bringing in 457 visa workers.
By June last year, the then Minister for Immigration Kevin Andrews started to move on trying to plug the holes in the scheme.
However, stakeholders were not properly consulted in this process.
This failure meant many of the system’s shortcomings were not identified, let alone acted upon.
Of the changes that were made, some were too heavy-handed, resulting in an increase in red tape across the scheme—even for the majority of employers who had been doing the right thing.
Overall, it was a case of too little, too late.
The program needed a real overhaul, not just some minor tweaking.
The Rudd government recognises the need for Australia’s temporary overseas worker program to be in tune with global migration trends.
This is essential if we are to stay competitive in the world labour market.
And we need the confidence of stakeholders at home if we are to engage employers to take up the economic opportunities the scheme offers.
One important element in the attempt to gain the confidence of the major players is wages.
In August this year, the government indexed the minimum wage for 457 visa workers for the first time in two years.
This has meant an increase in the non-regional base salary level from $41,850 to $43,440 per annum and from $57,300 to $59,480 for ICT professionals.
The Government also appointed Barbara Deegan, an Industrial Relations Commissioner, to review the integrity of the current 457 visa program and recommend measures to better protect overseas workers.
And in the 2008/09 Budget, the Rudd government gave real and meaningful backing to its commitment to improve the temporary skilled migration program by allocating $19.6 million towards that end.
That funding for a range of 457 Visa integrity measures, includes this bill.
It also covers the establishment of a departmental working group which is charged with the task of creating a longer-term reform package.
Ultimately, the Subclass 457 visa system needs to be streamlined and transparent if we are to prove its integrity to the Australian people.
It must not undermine the pay and conditions of Australian workers if it is to be accepted as legitimate.
And it must not allow the exploitation of the overseas workers it seeks to attract to employment in Australia.
In order to achieve these necessary advances, we have begun analysing and addressing stakeholder apprehensions with the scheme.
And we have begun to act—as I have generally outlined today—in a decisive, timely, considered, collaborative and coordinated fashion.
This bill is a crucial plank in that plan of action … that commitment to improve the Subclass 457 Visa system for all involved, particularly the employees and employers on which the scheme relies.
We have also taken into consideration the effects of the scheme on the Australian people and the Australian economy.
I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WORKER PROTECTION) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2008-11-27,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

I rise today to speak on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Workers Protection) Bill of 2008. I have taken an interest in this legislation and this area since I was heavily involved as the Deputy Chair of the Joint Committee on Migration into the inquiry into 457 temporary visas conducted last year.
That inquiry, “Temporary Visas, Permanent Benefits,” served as a wakeup call to a number of us about the 457 visa scheme. While we maintain that the highest priority must be placed on providing Australians with job opportunities and training, the simple truth is that the labour shortage and the skills crisis meant that for a number of businesses it was necessary to get hold of labour as soon as possible. The 457 program should never overshadow the need to develop the training and skills of working Australians.
That is where the 457 visa program comes in. By providing temporary skilled migration, it allows Australia to continue its economic development without being handicapped by a lack of skilled labour. It was designed to address areas of skills shortages within Australia. However, as the skills crisis has deepened, the needs of the labour market demand has changed. The scheme has begun pulling in a larger proportion of people in trade level occupations, as well as increasing numbers of workers from non English speaking countries. These particularly include the Philippines, China and India.
It is now recognised that workers in occupations below the professional level and from non English speaking backgrounds are at much higher risk of exploitation, particularly in the areas where we have traditionally seen industrial relations problems.
During the inquiry we travelled all across Australia and heard some horror stories about mismanagement of employees, exploitation and quite frankly disgusting treatment of a number of foreign nationals brought here to work under the 457 scheme.
We heard from unions about workers too scared to talk to the Department about their mistreatment, or even more appallingly forbidden to talk. Even worse we heard about how some of the workers, lacking in basic English skills, were completely unable to function in Australia.
We heard that some migrants who came here on the 457 program were being exploited in slave like conditions and weren’t being paid the minimum agreed wages. We heard the sad case of Pedro Balading from the Philippines. Mr Balading came to the Northern Territory expecting to work on a farm. Instead his job became fence posting and one day he was thrown from the vehicle he was riding in and died from his injuries. Not only was he lied to about his job and duties, but he then faced the indignity of his wages being garnished for his living expenses.
There was also the case of Mohammed Nayem who came here from Singapore who was forced to work 50 hour weeks, paid for 38 hours a week and then had $100 forcibly deducted from each pay packet as rent for his room – a converted office that he shared with five other men.
Australia didn’t turn out to be the land of opportunity for them.
I was truly shocked at the level of abuse of the scheme that was occurring. These abuses convinced me at the time that the Scheme, required serious reform if it was to continue.
I congratulate the Minister for this reform to address these concerns.
While the 457 Visa scheme is a wonderful idea, the sad truth is that the previous Liberal/Coalition Government failed to implement a number of simple oversight measures in the original legislation that even their own members should have been able to see were necessary. In that respect it had all the hallmarks of a Howard Government labour scheme – unfair and poorly thought out. A number of the recommendations we put forward in our report into the scheme were simple common sense ideas that really should have been present in the original scheme.
That they were not is a sad indictment on the motivations of the Howard Government.
I commend this legislation, and Minister Evans, for addressing a number of the concerns that we raised in that report. This bill will introduce a range of provisions designed to better protect temporary overseas workers.
These include:
Improved monitoring powers;
The introduction of civil penalties for sponsors who breach obligations;
Clarifying sponsor obligations and ensuring that they are enforceable under the Act;
Ensuring that there is greater information sharing amongst Government agencies.
It is vitally important that these reforms are passed in 2008. We have consistently demonstrated our commitment to improving the integrity of the 457 visa program over a number of years and here is tangible proof of that commitment.
The integrity of the 457 visa program has been undermined by its rapid growth and changing role, but it is only now – by the Rudd Labor Government - that its problems are being addressed.
For those in the Chamber who may be unfamiliar with this program, the 457 visa program is designed to allow overseas workers to enter Australia for a period of four years and to work in skilled occupations.
The scheme has increased four-fold in the last four years with around 110,570 people currently on the scheme in Australia.
In June of last year, the previous Government introduced a Bill that was belatedly aimed at addressing some of the problems that we had noticed in the 457 program. However that Bill was never debated and not passed prior to the previous Election. The Minister at the time, Kevin Andrews put forward these changes too late, and in a heavy handed way which meant that everyone involved in the scheme was caught up in extra red tape.
The Rudd Labor Government recognises that the ground here is shifting and that the role of the temporary skilled migration programme is changing. In order for Australia to remain competitive in the global labour market it is essential that we offer a robust, streamlined and transparent temporary migration program.
That is why we have put forward this bill. That is why we have already introduced a number of reforms aimed at improving the 457 scheme.
It includes a number of important extra provisions.
The bill applies to all temporary worker visas. It doesn’t matter if you are an occupational trainee or a medical practitioner you will be covered. This measure was brought down in part to stop employers simply moving employees between visa classes to avoid the bill’s provisions.
The bill also now applies to visas that are issued under labour agreements. This is another common sense solution to stop employers simply moving their employees onto a different agreement.
The new bill also includes a number of provisions to make the system more flexible for employers.
The Government has improved sanction powers under the bill. It provides for two new sanctions to employers who violate their obligations. These are civil penalty proceedings and infringement notices, which can be provided in lieu of civil penalty proceedings.
If a sponsor fails to meet their obligations under the Act, the Minister now has the power to seek an order in the Federal Court or Federal Magistrates Court to ensure they pay a civil penalty. This is currently $6600 for an individual and $33,000 for corporations.
It is also now made explicit that a failure to satisfy a sponsorship obligation may result in the department imposing ALL of the sanctions on the sponsor. This is designed to act as further deterrence for employers.
One of the major issues that we found in the Migration Committee investigation was the lack of proper information sharing between Government agencies. Often it was more than a case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand was doing, and it led to serious breakdowns in communication which disadvantaged workers.
We have introduced new inspector powers which can be used to monitor employer’s compliance with their obligations. They are modelled on the powers given to inspectors in the Workplace Relations Act of 1996. They allow officers of the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations to carry out the following functions.
Inspectors have the power to, at any time they feel necessary, enter without force any place the inspector has reasonable cause to believe holds anything relevant to their case.
These powers allow them to:
Inspect the premises
Interview any person
Require the production of documents
And copy these documents as required.
It is to be hoped that these changes will prevent such sad cases as the one we read about in recent months in The Age. Industrial Relations Commissioner Barbara Deegan described how foreign middleman can demand excessive fees to gain or renew the visas, and then encourage Australian employers to exploit the workers by demanding ‘unlimited hours’ for minimum wage.
In addition to these changes, the bill will allow the Commissioner of Taxation to disclose tax information if the information relates to a visa holder, former visa holder, approved sponsor or former sponsor. This is at the discretion of the Minister for Immigration and will allow the Department to confirm details with the Tax Office with regard to salary and other allowances payable to visa holders.
Of course we are aware that it is important that measures to provide oversight to 457 visa holders must be implemented quickly. That is why existing business sponsors will be subject to the sponsorship obligations from the date the bill commences. All existing undertakings will be replaced by the new provisions of the bill.
This is necessary, not only to safeguard workers as I stated earlier, but also to maintain the integrity of the program. Without an abrupt cut off date, a situation would be created where some workers in a workplace were subject to the new monitoring and inspection powers and others were not. This is obviously not an ideal situation for anyone.
We have decided that this bill will commence within a period of 9 months from Royal Assent. This is important. The 9 month period will allow the recommendations of various review committees to be taken into account when drafting the necessary regulations and procedures.
This 9 month period will also be beneficial in educating all existing 457 sponsors and visa holders as to the changes that are being proposed.
As I stated at the outset of my speech, my previous involvement with the Migration Committee has given me some background on the issue of the 457 Visa program. I am extremely pleased that Minister Evans has introduced this bill and acted to end the inequities that were present in the scheme.
The 457 Scheme is something that serves a worthwhile purpose, however it is so important that it is used properly. The Rudd Government realises that the first priority must be to equip our own workforce to meet the skills of the labour market.
That is why in the 2008 Budget the Treasurer announced that the Rudd Government is making a $19.3 billion investment in education and training to ensure that we continue to provide employment and training opportunities for Australians. However we realise that investing in the education and training of Australians will not meet employers immediate skills needs.
That is why it is imperative that we restore public confidence in the 457 Visa programme. It is in everyone’s interests to have a robust and transparent scheme in place. A loss of public confidence in the 457 scheme can translate into a loss of popular support for the scheme and will act as a barrier to employers to take up the economic opportunities that the 457 visa scheme offers.
The challenge for this Government is to prove to the Australian people that the 457 visa program has integrity and that it is not undermining Australian wages and conditions.
That means that it is used to cover up legitimate skills shortages and not as simply an avenue for cheap unskilled labour.
That means that those who come here under the scheme receive every opportunity to report poor treatment instead of being condemned to slave like conditions.
That means that we as a Government ensure their conditions are monitored, and that they are being fairly treated.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2008-11-27,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

The Migration Legislation Amendment (Worker Protection) Bill 2008 amends the Migration Act 1958 and seeks to enhance the framework of the sponsorship of noncitizens to enter and work in Australia with the objective of ensuring the working conditions of 457 visa holders meet Australian standards and the costs of sponsorship are more fully identified and met by the sponsor.
The Coalition is supportive of the overall objectives of the legislation, believing that a framework for sponsor obligations is necessary but understanding that we have grave reservations about lack of availability of the regulations attached to this Bill. I understand that draft regulations are to be made available in the first part of 2009, and of course these will define the operation of the framework.
The failure by the Government to produce these regulations treats with contempt the needs of sponsors to have a clear understanding of their obligations and will keep in the dark many Australian businesses that have an overwhelming need for temporary sponsored visa holders in their workforce.
Even with the economic downturn in States like Western Australia and Queensland we are still hearing of skills shortages and the need for 457 visa holders.
The sponsorship framework provided for in the Bill is maintained by four main measures which:
Outline the framework for a system of statutory regulations for sponsorship obligations in relation to 457 visas;
Widen the sanctions that can be applied if a breach of those regulations is made by the sponsor;
Detail a system of monitoring, compliance and information sharing powers; and
Set out the transitional arrangements between the current and new regime.
On the face of it none of these measures, which are general in nature, could be termed controversial. It is the absence of detail going to cost, penalties and obligations of sponsors that causes concern.

Background

It is firstly worthwhile however to review the background of the 457 visa scheme.
In 1996 the Coalition introduced new visa categories to allow employers to sponsor skilled workers on a temporary basis, between three months and four years, to help ease chronic labour shortages.
The Temporary (long stay) Business Visa (subclass 457) is the most commonly used category. After a specified time, workers and their families can apply for permanent skilled migration.

Size and growth of the program

The annual intake for the 457 visa program has steadily increased from some 15,000 in 1997-08 to 22,370 in 2003-04 to 46,680 in 2006-07. In February 2008 there were 125,390 457 visa holders in Australia including 67,410 skilled workers and 57,980 family members.
There are currently nearly 19,000 employers using 457 visas. Nearly 30% of 457s are employed in NSW.
On average 457 visa holders stay two years and approximately 50% move to permanent residence via the Employer Nomination Scheme or the Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme. Apart from providing a temporary supply of skilled workers, the 457 Scheme has also proved to be a good source of permanent skilled migration.

The Bill

Under the proposed Bill visa holders can be sponsored by employers who must meet a series of “undertakings”. These “undertakings” are now to be specified in the new (as yet unseen) regulations.
According to the Rudd Government the regulations will be drawn up in the following months, followed by six months of consultation and education about the changes. All currently engaged sponsors will ultimately be transferred to the new regime.

The Bill’s Framework:


Sanctions

In addition to the current options of barring or suspending a sponsor for breaching an agreement, there will be new civil penalties of a maximum of $6,600 for an individual and up to $33,000 for an incorporated body. The Minister may also issue an infringement notice with a fine of up to one fifth of the maximum penalty. It is essential that, in relation to any sanctions, any element of retrospectivity is avoided. This is something on which we will place careful scrutiny.

Monitoring and Compliance

The power of Inspectors to monitor and investigate is modelled on the Workplace Relations Act; with for example, the same powers to request a document etc. Again these powers will have to be carefully scrutinised.

Information Sharing

The Minister will be able to reveal information about the sponsor to the visa holder and vice versa.
The Bill also contains an amendment to the Tax Administration Act so the Commissioner of Taxation can provide information to DIAC to find out if the company is “a good corporate citizen”. Understandably for the individual and the sponsor there will be sensitivities which must be safeguarded. How one defines a ‘good corporate citizen’ remain to be seen.

Transition Provisions

When the new regime comes into effect, all 457 visa sponsors will be moved to the new regime. The expected commencement date is mid 2010.

Discussion

While the framework in the Bill is supported by the Coalition as a further evolution of the obligations of sponsorship which the Coalition introduced through the Migration Amendment (Sponsorship Obligations) Bill in June 2007, a serious problem lies in the delay of the production of the regulations by the Rudd Labor Government. As I have said, the Coalition will subject them to close scrutiny when they are finally tabled.
The April discussion paper this year of regulation options released by DIAC does however give us some idea of potential new payment obligations for sponsors of 457 visa workers and their families.
These new options include:
meeting all of the education costs of minors accompanying the worker;
covering all medical costs, either through insurance or direct payment, including covering medical costs where the insurance company refuses to pay;
paying any migration agent’s fees, or other costs of recruitment up to a maximum specified;
paying all travel costs to Australia (before only travel from Australia was required);
paying any licence and registration fees associated with the worker taking up employment in Australia.
The Rudd Labor Government has also proposed that sponsors not be allowed to use temporary overseas labour during periods of lawful industrial action or to influence enterprise bargaining negotiations. This could have very interesting interpretation challenges.
The framework refers to a new system of compliance and monitoring work. We need to be concerned that employers and sponsored visa applicants are not frustrated by greater red tape burdens.
There are also proposals that 400 series temporary work visas which have not required sponsors in the past, eg for those staying for less than three months, may in future require sponsors who will also need processing and monitoring. The Rudd Government will need to ensure that this does not put even greater pressure on the capacity for the Department to deliver efficient processing of applications for this group of visas and undermine the high regard in which the Australian migration system is held. It is important that the accessibility and flexibility of this programme is maintained whilst ensuring its integrity is maintained.

Financial Impact

The 2008/2009 budget allocated $19.6 million over four years including $0.4million in capital funding for 2008/2009, to develop the legislation, better define employers obligations, improve investigative powers, a more robust sanctions framework and a detailed information campaign. It is essential that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship be adequately resourced to effectively implement these measures.

Summary

It would be detrimental to Australian employers if the cost of bringing in skilled labour and the time the process it takes leaves Australia less competitive in the global market for the highly mobile skilled worker. Indeed, in it’s submission to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry submitted that the changes ‘seemed disproportionate to the actual scale of sponsorship problems’ and thought that the cost of measures might be prohibitive for many businesses and would discourage the use of the programme by Australian employers experiencing genuine skills shortages.
Indeed the DIAC’s annual report for 2006/07 stated that only 1.67% of sponsors were found to have breached their sponsorship obligations. A representative from Australian Mines and Metals Association informed the committee ‘we seem to be at odds as to where the justification for such a bill came from.’ Even the Minister Senator Evans was reported in the Australian Financial Review on 11 November 2008 as conceding that the ‘majority of employers did the right thing’.
In conclusion while the Coalition will support the Bill it will reserve the right to assess the regulations on the basis of what is best for Australia.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WORKER PROTECTION) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2008-11-27,"—In summing up, I would like to thank senators for their contributions to the debate on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Worker Protection) Bill 2008. I would also like to thank those who incorporated their responses due to the tight legislative timetable. I apologise for them having to do that, but there will be a record of their contributions.
This is an important piece of legislation. It was drafted in the first instance by the previous government and was not introduced in time before the last election. It has changed, but the basic policy intents—remedying some of the deficiencies in the arrangements surrounding sponsorship and dealing with sponsors who fail to do the right thing via sanctions and inspection regimes—were issues considered by the previous government. They took a decision that they needed a legislative response, because there have been restrictions on the capacity of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship to ensure the integrity of the system. My great concern as a defender of the temporary migration program is that it has been seriously undermined, and public confidence in it has been seriously undermined, by the exposure of cases of abuse of overseas workers. That represents a small number of incidents in terms of the overall program, but it is not an insignificant number. I would say to the Liberal senators who tried to suggest that the union movement’s concerns were not warranted: you are wrong—dead wrong. We have had serious problems and, as you know, the previous minister—
—We just asked for it to be put in context, Minister.
—I always put it in context, if you look at my speeches. I appreciate the opposition’s support on the bill, but the legislative impetus for this came from the previous minister because of his concerns. If you look at what he did in areas like the IT and meat industries, you see that he responded—in a fairly ham-fisted way, in my view—to concerns that he had about the exploitation of workers in those industries. This is not something that is unique to me as minister.
There have been serious issues of abuse. They are in the sorts of areas where you see industrial relations problems. The industries where there have been problems are the industries where you have problems with exploitation more generally. We have had examples, like the exploitation of cooks in the restaurant industry in Canberra, which have had to be dealt with. There are concerns. My consistent position has been that you can only defend the scheme if you make sure it has integrity. You can only allow it to work for employers who do need the skills if you ensure its integrity. This is about making sure we have the balance right in that regard, and it will give us the ability to ensure that it does have that integrity and that we can weed out the small numbers of sponsors who fail to do the right thing.
Regarding the question of consultations, unlike under the previous minister, who announced changes without any consultation—major changes in this area and major changes, more broadly, in the migration area—this consultation has been exhaustive. It started with me appointing an employer reference group, which has three representatives of industry, led by Mr Coates, whom Senator Trood may well know and who is senior executive and chairman of Xstrata. They looked at the 457 system and how we might make it more responsive to employers’ needs. On receiving that report, I implemented all but two of their recommendations. One which I did not implement was changing the name of the program, but I would like to do that at some stage. I think the program has seen a vast improvement in its responsiveness to employers and the processing of applications. If you talk to employers using the scheme, you will find that they are very complimentary about the changes and what those have meant for allowing them to access the scheme.
That was one point of consultation. The second was that I appointed the industrial relations expert Mrs Barbara Deegan to conduct an integrity review of the program, and she has spoken to hundreds of people throughout Australia and consulted with all the key groups. I released her report a matter of weeks ago. We also had a discussion paper that went to possible reforms that would be part of the regulations for this legislation. Again it was public, and again it received submissions—more than 80 were received. All of that is to be considered as part of the drafting of these regulations by the Skilled Migration Consultative Panel I established, which includes four members of senior industry bodies like ACCI, AiG and the Minerals Council, four union representatives and four representatives of the largest state governments. All are engaged in the process of getting the issues and integrity of the 457s right.
Senator Trood made a good point which is the key to all this: the scheme grew very quickly, and the public policy settings around it have been inadequate to cope with the growth not because of the numbers but because of what has happened in terms of the skill classifications and countries of origin. Under the scheme originally, we were bringing in highly trained medical professionals, engineers et cetera—people with obvious qualifications going into high-paid jobs sponsored by large companies. There were no problems with that. From an immigration point of view, I just want to know that they have a passport, a visa and no criminal history. Whether they get $250,000 or $300,000 from BHP every year is their lookout.
But with the expansion of the program we have seen the skill level come down so that we have a lot of people coming in at tradesman level. We have also seen the source country change. Source country change is important because we have people who do not have English as a first language, some of whom have very little English at all. That is where the exploitation occurred. People from China, the Philippines and India, lacking the English-language skills, have been brought in by labour hire firms into industries with sometimes poor IR records, and that is where the problems have been.
—Some are run by the unions, too.
—I do not know about being run by the unions. All I am saying is that the risk profile has changed and the public policy settings around it are not competent now. That was recognised by the former minister. I think it is broadly recognised in the parliament. This is about getting the right public policy settings around it. It is not about increasing costs to employers—I do not want to make the scheme such that it becomes prohibitive. Equally—
—They don’t know their obligations, Minister.
—They will know their obligations. They have been—
—You do a lot of consultation, but—
 (Senator Mark Bishop)—Order!
—We have done a lot of consultation because we want to get it right. They say to me that the former government never talked to them like we do about the detail of these things. I am constantly talking to industry about it. We have to get the balance right. We want to be clear, though, that we want 457 workers to be more expensive than Australian workers, because we do not want people to employ overseas workers in preference to Australian workers—a principle that the previous government used to articulate as well. One of the major requirements out of the Deegan report is about market rates of pay. We have the situation now where some overseas workers coming into the country are paid less than their Australian counterpart—that is, there is an incentive to use a foreign worker over a local worker. I do not think anyone in here would endorse that. The market rates argument is very important and will be central to any reforms.
I also want to pick up another point that Senator Trood made, although I do not want to go on for too long. The discussion paper deliberately raised the gamut of issues, including education costs because these are actually starting to impact on state education systems. In Queensland—your own state, Senator Trood—we suddenly had an influx of a large number of workers who then had kids who went into the public schools, which did not have the facilities to cope. Most of the rural communities are very glad to have them, because a lot of those towns are dying. They are very welcoming and there have been some really great stories about all of that.
At our primary school, which my youngest son has now left, they have now got 40 overseas students who do not speak English. But they have got no ESL teacher. The teachers are finding that the resources to cope with those students are not there. The P&C association has recently paid for the six-month employment of an ESL teacher because the teachers have been finding that they have not been able to give enough attention to the other students—a real problem that comes as a result of having overseas workers. It is not irrelevant; it is a cost to the taxpayer and a cost to the state education system—costs that have got to be considered. Personally, I am not going to look to lumber employers with those costs. We cannot pretend that we are not going to have a public policy debate about those because there is not an issue. There is, and state governments are raising it with me because the larger the number of overseas workers the bigger the drain on their resources.

Senator Fierravanti-Wells interjecting—

—That is right. Some of them are the biggest users, Senator, but this is complex. That is what I am saying: it is complex. So the discussion paper picks up all those issues. As I have said, there is an enormous amount of consultation and discussion going on around these changes. The Skilled Migration Consultative Panel are going to have the draft regulations referred to them. They will not agree on them all—I am sure of that—but we will have this process, the arguments will be held and in the end the government will have to make a decision.
I know there has been interest by Senator Xenophon and the Greens in this issue of regulations. I have made it clear that I am happy to distribute the draft of the regulations earlier in the year before they are introduced. I am happy to do that for the Liberal opposition and Senator Fielding so everyone sees the draft and everyone can give feedback. But I absolutely reject any suggestion that there has not been consultation about all this, and I am happy to compare the consultation on these measures with that on the former minister’s more substantive measures which were just announced.
There is a serious attempt here to tackle an emerging problem about the public policy parameters around the temporary skilled migration program. There are more emerging, quite frankly, as the economy turns down a bit. I appreciate the support from around the chamber. As I said, I will make draft regulations available to people before they are introduced and they will certainly go to the industry’s Skilled Migration Consultative Panel. Hopefully, at the end of this we will have a good outcome. Obviously it will not be agreed upon by all, but I think we will have regulations that provide integrity to the scheme, which has been under pressure, and protect overseas workers but ensure that Australian workers are protected from overseas labour undercutting employment opportunities for Australians. That is the right balance that we have got to get. I think that when we come to the draft regulations we will be able to get that balance right. I thank the Senate for its support for the bill.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2008-11-27,"—I suppose it is a reflection on the way in which the parliament works, where all of the attention is directed only to matters of political controversy, that the Evidence Amendment Bill 2008 will pass through this chamber in a matter of a few minutes without any significant debate, yet the bill, which the opposition supports, is probably one of the most important pieces of legislation that this parliament will consider this year. It has a long history. As honourable senators would be aware, originally the whole of the law of evidence was judge made. But in 1979 the then Fraser government made a reference to the Australian Law Reform Commission to inquire into the possibility of the comprehensive rationalisation and reform of the rules of evidence. The ALRC produced a substantial research paper and draft legislation in 1985 and a final report on the possibility of uniform evidence legislation in Australia in 1987. In 1991 the Commonwealth government and the New South Wales government each introduced legislation substantially based on the ALRC’s draft. The parliaments of those two jurisdictions passed in 1993 evidence bills which came into effect from 1 January 1995. They are a model for the gradual process by which Australia’s rules of evidence will become both statutory and uniform, and that has happened in some but not all jurisdictions. The current bill is the first full-scale review of the operation of the 1995 legislation and it will bring into effect a number of very important changes.
To most people, I suspect, the rules of evidence would be a very dry and prosaic subject, but to me as a lawyer they are endlessly fascinating. I regard the law of evidence as being—along with the symphonies of Beethoven or the architecture of Christopher Wren or the poetry of John Milton or Einstein’s general theory of relativity—among the great achievements of the human mind. The complexity, the subtlety and the sophistication of the rules are indeed remarkable, and the manner in which legislative draftsmen have captured the complexity of those rules, which consist of a large number of categories, subcategories, sub-subcategories, exceptions and subexceptions, is a great tribute to them. The rules of evidence have been expressed by great legal textbook writers like James Bradley Thayer and Wigmore, in America, and by the incomparable Sir Rupert Cross, at Oxford University, who, like a 20th century Teiresias, laboured through blindness to create his monumental work on the law of evidence.
They have now been reduced to statutory form, and the statutory formulation in the 1995 bill has now been improved upon. But these are more than merely technical changes. Again, these are the sorts of things that perhaps could only get a lawyer very excited. There have been significant changes to the exceptions to the hearsay rule. There have been very important changes to the rules regarding the competence and compellability of witnesses. There have been important changes to the testing of the credit of witnesses. The question of privilege, which does trespass a little more beyond the technical legal nature of these changes, is also addressed in this bill.
For those of us who are interested in the rules of evidence—I suspect there are not all that many in the parliament—this is a very, very important day. This is a very, very important bill. The opposition hopes that it will speed the process towards the day when all of the Australian jurisdictions adopt a uniform set of rules.

—I was just being self-indulgent, Senator McLucas.
—Oh, not at all. The Evidence Amendment Bill 2008 includes a number of amendments to improve the overall workability of the uniform evidence laws. In particular, the bill contains important reforms to make it easier for children and people with cognitive impairment to give evidence, by promoting the use of narrative evidence and disallowing improper questioning of vulnerable witnesses under cross-examination.
Other significant reforms contained in the bill include improving the procedure for taking oral evidence, including expert evidence, about the traditional laws and customs of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people to accommodate the very form by which these laws and customs are maintained; and extending the compellability provisions in the Evidence Act to recognise that people involved in same-sex relationships should not be forced to give evidence against their partner unless a court is satisfied that there is a compelling reason to do so. This is consistent with the government’s commitment to remove same-sex discrimination in Commonwealth laws.
This bill is a significant step in progressing the harmonisation of evidence laws across Australia. As the Attorney-General has previously said, the Australian government is keen to encourage all jurisdictions to implement the model uniform evidence laws. This will result in a more uniform and coherent approach to evidence law and, in particular, reduce complexity and costs associated with juggling two evidence regimes in non-uniform Evidence Act jurisdictions. I commend the bill to the chamber.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2008-11-27,"—The Transport Security Amendment (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill 2008 does not put me in mind of Beethoven, John Milton, Albert Einstein and Christopher Wren, as did the last piece of legislation. It is a much more prosaic bill. Its purpose is to amend the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 and the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 to streamline some legal terms and conditions that will enhance the effectiveness of security outcomes. The bill does not merge the security arrangements of the aviation, maritime and security sectors but rather seeks to ensure that a similar regulatory framework is in place for each industry to enhance the overall efficiency of transport security.
The background of the bill arises from the events of September 11 2001, when the international community recognised a need to implement systems to protect the maritime and aviation transport sectors against the threat of terrorism. As a result, the International Maritime Organisation developed the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code in December 2002. Under this code, all security regulated port facilities, offshore facilities, port and offshore service providers and ships are required to implement security plans to undergo security risk assessments.
In Australia the Maritime Transport Security Act was introduced by the coalition government in 2003 and it implemented the international guidelines developed by the International Maritime Organisation. After subsequent amendments, the act was amended and renamed the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003. The Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 established a regulatory framework which requires that certain aviation industry participants have approved transport security plans. It implemented Australia’s obligations under the Chicago convention—that is, the Convention on International Aviation.
In 2007 a task force was established within the Office of Transport Security, a division of the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, which designed a review to examine ways in which the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 could be improved to increase flexibility and clarity in maritime security planning. The outcome of the review led to the proposals which are the subject of this bill, which the opposition supports.
The bill amends both the Aviation Transport Security Act and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act to clarify that the department’s secretary may permit both aviation and maritime industry participants to hold multiple security programs and plans at once and that, prior to the commencement date of the amendments, the operation of the Aviation Transport Security Act and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act does not prevent industry participants from holding multiple security programs or plans.
Additionally, in relation to the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act, the bill is intended to insert a definition of ‘Australia’ into the act so that the act’s operation extends to include external territories; allow the department’s secretary to approve a maritime, ship or offshore security plan for up to five years but no less than 12 months; enable regulations to be made to prescribe mapping standards for maritime security zones and security regulated port boundaries, and standards for the presentation of information detailing offshore security zones, required to be produced by industry participants; and ensure the consistent usage of definitions and terms throughout the act. As I indicated earlier, this is a law reform measure which the opposition supports.",SENATE,<title>TRANSPORT SECURITY AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2008-11-27,"—in reply—I thank Senator Brandis for his contribution. The Transport Security Amendment (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill 2008 does not propose to vary any of the policy settings underpinning Australia’s transport security regimes. However, the bill will strengthen the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 in a number of ways. The bill will allow for maritime, ship and offshore security plans to be approved for less than the current five-year period but not less than 12 months. It will enable regulations to be made to prescribe mapping standards for maritime security zones and security regulated port boundaries. The bill confirms the operation of the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act in external Australian territories and ensures the consistent usage of definitions and terms throughout the act.
The amendments clarify that industry participants may hold more than one approved security plan or program at the same time, and they recognise the validity of all existing plans held prior to the commencement of the bill. The passage of this bill will assist industry participants to comply with security obligations with greater clarity and certainty, thereby enhancing their capacity to get on with what they do best: keeping our transport industries moving. The passage of this bill in the current sitting of parliament will enable industry participants to focus on implementing and maintaining the measures outlined in their security plans and programs, thereby contributing to the strengthening of Australia’s transport security arrangements.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2008-11-27,"—The objective of the National Measurement Amendment Bill 2008 is to introduce a national system of trade measurement. Annually the trade measurement system in Australia underpins transactions worth more than $400 billion per annum—75 per cent of these transactions are business to business and 25 per cent are retail. While the Commonwealth has constitutional responsibility for weights and measures under section 51 of the Constitution, under the National Measurement Act 1960 the Australian government has responsibility only for defining measurement units and standards, traceability of measurement and patent approval of instruments used for trade or legal purposes. Inspection and enforcement powers, except for utility meters, and the setting of the various regulations surrounding trade measurement reside with the various state and territory governments, meaning that Australia has eight different sets of trade measurement regimes.
This bill will establish a national system of trade measurement which will formally commence on 1 July 2010 but which will commence on 1 July 2009 for transitional purposes. It will override state based legislation, which will eventually be repealed by the various states. The national trade measurement system will be run by the National Measurement Institute in the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research. All current regulation, licensing and enforcement measures surrounding trade measurement will be run by the Australian government from 1 July 2010. This will entail some 240 state based inspectors formally being transferred to the Commonwealth and made APS employees, as well as the transfer of existing trade measurement and associated enforcement equipment. This is a direct cost-shift from the states, which will no longer have any trade measurement costs. Funding of $31.65 billion was provided to the department of innovation for the transition to a national trade measurement system and for its first years of operation from 2007-08 to 2010-11. Ongoing funding of $23.653 million will be provided from 2011-12.
The majority of the bill is given over to setting out appropriate offences and penalties, and enforcement powers for Commonwealth trade measurement officers. According to the explanatory memorandum and the government, these various clauses reflect those found in the states’ and territories’ legislation. There are only two differences of significance: (1) inspectors will now be able to seize materials other than measurement equipment; and (2) the bill explicitly creates a ‘right to silence’ defence based on the grounds of self-incrimination. This is not present in some state based laws. The bill establishes three levels of offences: ‘fault’, ‘strict liability’ and ‘infringement notice’. The most common penalty amounts under this bill are 200 penalty units, or $22,000, for fault offences; 40 penalty units, or $4,400 for strict liability offences; and five penalty units, or $550, for infringement notice offences. This largely reflect the penalties in the state legislation.
As well as implementing a national system for the first time in Australia, the bill introduces on a voluntary basis the option for manufacturers to use the average quantity system, or AQS, rather than the minimum quantity system currently used. The AQS is the international standard for international trade in prepacked goods and is used in nations including Canada, China, the EU, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation and the United States of America.
The AQS provides a statistical measure that a batch of goods would be, on average, within statistical normal distribution, while the current NQS, and its associated testing regimes, requires many producers to overfill their products—albeit marginally—in order to meet minimum quantity requirements. Adopting AQS would increase efficiencies in production and measurement while ensuring consumers remain protected. It will also make Australian prepacked items more accessible to international trade. Making it voluntary enables those producers who wish to remain with the current system, for cost or other reasons, to do so.
It has been a long and winding road to get to the position of being on the cusp of establishing a national trade measurement system. On 13 April last year, the Council of Australian Governments, under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Howard, agreed to establish a national system of trade measurement, to be administered by the Commonwealth from 1 July 2010. This bill implements that agreement.
The issue of establishing a single national system of trade measurement has been on the agenda for more than 20 years. In 1985, the Department of Science commissioned a review of the trade management system known as the Scott review. This review recommended that federal weights and measures legislation be amended. However, the Commonwealth, state and territory ministers, with the exception of Western Australia, instead decided that each jurisdiction should implement uniform trade measurement legislation.
In 1995, the Department of Industry, Science and Technology commissioned a review known as the Kean inquiry. Kean noted that the objectives of the uniform legislation had not been achieved. For example, fee structures differed between jurisdictions, industry was expected to meet varying requirements and the legislation had been implemented and applied inconsistently. As a result, Kean also recommended that the Commonwealth assume full responsibility for trade measurement.
In February 2006, COAG identified six priority regulatory hot spots where overlapping and inconsistent regulatory regimes were impeding economic activity. Trade measurement was one of these six hot spots. COAG requested the Ministerial Council on Consumer Affairs to develop a recommendation for a national system of trade measurement, which was subsequently agreed to by COAG on 13 April last year.
There is no doubt a national system of trade measurement will eliminate common and difficult-to-quantify business concerns such as legislative differences, the need for multiple licences and different enforcement regimes. However, in its 2006 report, relied upon by COAG, the MCCA undertook a series of cost-benefit analyses of implementing a national trade measurement system. Perhaps surprisingly, this analysis was unable to quantify significant benefits for the economy, with an overall net positive value to the economy of only $5.7 million: $16.2 million cost to government; $22 million benefit to business. It is in this context that it is disappointing that the government has failed to produce a regulatory impact statement for this bill. COAG principles for national standards setting and regulatory action hold that:
Proposals for new regulation that have the potential to restrict competition should include evidence that the competitive effects of the regulation have been considered, that the benefits outweigh the likely costs and that the restriction is no more restrictive than necessary in the public interest.
According to advice from the office of the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, Dr Emerson, the Office of Best Practice Regulation review determined that an RIS was not required as this bill does not change the regulatory burden on business; it merely transfers powers from state and territory governments to the Commonwealth and, in some cases, the burden is reduced. However, as seen from the cost-benefit analysis done by the MCCA in 2006, it is not clear that the national trade measurement system will have a significant net positive value. In this context it is surprising that further analysis was not done in the form of an RIS.
Labor talks a lot about cooperative federalism, yet it tried twice, in the 1980s and 1990s, to deliver national trade measurement and failed. It took the coalition in government, in 2007, to deliver this historic agreement. Labor is now merely implementing the coalition’s hard work. Labor has failed to provide a regulatory impact statement on the basis that this bill is merely a transfer of powers, not an extension. It is disappointing that, with such a major regulatory change, it has failed to provide such a statement. Nonetheless, the coalition is of the view that a national trade measurement system will be of benefit to all Australians and, on the basis of assurances given by the government that this bill does accurately replicate existing state laws and does provide sufficient safeguards to individuals involved in the weights and measures sector, we support the bill.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL MEASUREMENT AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2008-11-27,"—in reply—In summing up debate on the National Measurement Amendment Bill 2008, I would like to thank Senator Abetz for his comments. Of course, we all recognise that there are many things that we undertake in the parliament that are way beyond politics, and this is one of those. This is about setting a framework for a national system of trade measurement, and its intent is to replace each of the current state and territory based systems.
In a seamless national economy it makes no sense for our trade measurement system, a system which underpins commercial transactions across Australia and into our export markets, to be regulated by nine different jurisdictions. That is rail gauge economics and it belongs in the last century, or even the century before. It is what the government has been working so hard to change through the Council of Australian Governments’ Business Regulation and Competition Working Group, which is co-chaired by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. This national system that we have debated today builds on the experience of state and territory administrations, and it will remove current inconsistencies and definitely will help to reduce business costs. It will allow Australia to adopt the new technologies and processes that will help our industries to actually compete better internationally. The National Measurement Institute will be responsible for administering the new national trade measurement system and will offer employment to inspectors and others who are currently working in trade measurement in the states and territories.
The bill is the product of a COAG decision in February 2006. As I said, some things are beyond party politics. COAG identified trade measurement as a priority hot spot reform area where overlapping and inconsistent regulatory regimes were impeding economic activity. The bill has been developed through industry consultation and supported by a legislative working group of state and territory officials convened by the National Measurement Institute. It lays the basis for a new national system of trade measurement, which will provide a level playing field across Australia for all transactions that are based on measurement. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2008-11-27,"—I will commence by saying that the opposition will support the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority Bill 2008but not without some lingering doubts. For the last 12 months I have had to get my head around the idea that the Minister for Education, Ms Gillard, and Ms Gillard’s representative in the Senate, my good friend Senator Carr, are both economic conservatives. I am just starting, after 12 months, to get my head around this paradox, and now the new paradox is that Ms Gillard and my good friend Senator Carr will put the education of Australian students, young Australians, ahead of the teacher unions. That also I have had to grapple with. Interests sometimes clash between teacher unions and the education of our children. But they have said they are going to put the education of our young people first. It is another paradox, from past behaviour, but I am coming to terms with it.
We agree with the Labor government on the principle of this bill, but one of the concerns I have is about implementation. I have spoken—indeed many on the coalition side have spoken—much about the implementation of government policy over the last 12 months. In the sphere of education there has been much talk—much of it taken from New York and from Tony Blair’s website—but the implementation of policy has been third-rate. I speak of an issue I have raised many times in this chamber—the computers in schools policy in the Digital Education Revolution, and trade training centres. The policy is not necessarily bad; the implementation of the policy has been a shambles.
The Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority Bill establishes a new Commonwealth body, the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority, ACARA, which will replace the interim National Curriculum Board. ACARA will develop and administer the new national curriculum and collect data, providing analysis and research to governments. Its main role, however, will be the development of a national curriculum. The opposition sincerely hopes that ACARA will develop a world-class curriculum free from ideological bias and with a strong foundation in the basics that have been neglected to the detriment of too many children in recent decades—a sad legacy of the infatuation of the education establishment in this country with trendy foreign ideas.
Another great paradox in this country is that so many public intellectuals say Australia suffers from a cultural cringe, yet the same people adopt often pathetic foreign educational fads uncritically, to the detriment of too many Australian students for too long. When I used to teach at university, nearly everyone was a postmodernist. They would talk about deconstructing the text; it was terrific stuff. But you have to be able to read before you can deconstruct. That has been the basic problem that we have seen over the last 20 years in this country.
I have said we are going to support the bill, and we do hope it works. But we will be carefully studying the progress in relation to issues such as the timing of the curriculum’s introduction and its connection with school funding, and the place in the system of existing curricula, such as those at the University of Cambridge International Examinations schools, the Montessori schools, the Steiner schools, the Christian schools, the Islamic schools and the Jewish schools. We will also pursue with great interest the issue of potential future additions to the four core curriculum subjects at the moment, such as languages and music. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the opposition will carefully study the final product to make sure that it serves students rather than some ideological agenda or some new intellectual fad.",SENATE,"<title>AUSTRALIAN CURRICULUM, ASSESSMENT AND REPORTING AUTHORITY BILL 2008</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2008-11-27,"—I rise today to make some comments in relation to the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority Bill 2008.I note that the establishment of the authority was agreed in October at the Council of Australian Governments meeting and that this bill establishes the authority as an independent body corporate with a number of functions. These include: developing and administering a national school curriculum for school subjects specified in the charter, which is determined by the Ministerial Council for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs; developing and administering national assessments; collecting and analysing student assessment data and other data relating to schools and comparative school performance; facilitating information-sharing arrangements between Australian government bodies; publishing information relating to school education, including information relating to comparative school performance; providing curriculum resource services, including education research services; and providing resources, support and guidance to the teaching profession.
So this is a very interesting and, I have to say, a huge responsibility for the authority that is being set up. I note that its initial budget is some $37.2 million over four years, $20 million committed to the National Curriculum Board and $17.2 committed to the independent National Schools Assessment Data Centre. The bill provides for a board to be made up of a chairman; a deputy chair; a representative each from the Commonwealth, states and territories; a representative from the Independent Schools Council of Australia; and another one from the National Catholic Education Commission. A board member is appointed by the minister if agreed to by the ministerial council and if the person has certain professional expertise.
I particularly want to note here that the membership of the board does not include any representative of public education except for state governments. The non-government sector is independently represented on the authority in two positions. I know that the government would presumably argue that, because the state governments and territories have a position on the board, public education will be taken care of. However, I think that public school education should be independently represented on the board because governments have an interest in the entire education system in their states and not just public schools. I am concerned by the fact that there will not be an independent public education expert on the board but there will be two from the non-government schools and just the state government representatives, which in fact will perpetuate the divisions in Australia between private education and public education as they currently stand.
I do not intend to move an amendment to that effect. I have certainly canvassed that but I would hope that the government would take it on board. In looking at the appointments that it makes to the board, recognising there will be nominations from state governments and so on, I hope that people with serious expertise in public education will be put forward as nominees to the board so that that does not occur. It is something that I feel very strongly about. I cannot see why it could not happen because the determination to say people have to have professional expertise suggests that they will have that background, so it is not a significant shift. I would like to see somebody independent of state governments, who is an expert in public education, appointed to the board.
The assessment and reporting scheme is one of the most contentious elements of the government’s education proposals. That was very clear from the Senate inquiry that we conducted into the bill. The framework for the assessment and reporting requirements will be decided by COAG and, as I have indicated before, the role of the authority will be to collect, analyse and publish the data. Already there is extreme nervousness around the country about what that means in terms of what exactly will be collected, how it will be used and how it will be presented to the community so that we do not end up with a league table analysis. The fact that the government has flagged the sacking of principals or the closing of low-performing schools makes the community even more nervous about what data will be collected, how it will be presented, how it will be used and whether the data collected will all be publicly available so that other people can run that data through various models and actually use it in a way that perhaps had not been contemplated by the authority at the time of the data collection.
There is nothing more divisive than stories out in the community about one school performing poorly on this, that or something else, and people saying that they would not send their kids to that school or the other school and so on. Once you get that kind of league table mentality happening in the community then you get the community responding by asking, ‘What is the measurement that we are being asked to report on?’ and then schools start teaching to the measurement and not educating in the manner which they think is the most appropriate. Essentially you get a ‘teaching to the test’ mentality. That is not a good way to go in education.
If you get the performance of teachers tied to the performance of schools in a league table context, how are you going to get your best teachers to teach in the most difficult and most challenging educational environments? If you are going to reward teachers with performance bonuses tied to school performance outcomes then what you are inevitably going to get is a move by people to the schools which are performing better against the analysis. So you are going to find it harder and harder to staff some of those difficult schools, which will be to the detriment of those students. As we all know, the most challenging students and the most challenging school environments deserve the best teachers in order to make up those gaps in educational success that we clearly know are there for one reason or another.
I am very concerned about Mr Joel Klein and about what he advocates from his New York model. And I am rather concerned as well about the evidence that has been coming out of England. Just as Australia seems to be heading down the track of adopting this kind of approach, there are considerable doubts as to its effectiveness in raising standards and, in fact, there have been unintended consequences coming out of the way that these models have been implemented overseas. I must say it always seems that, just as some of these new processes are being discredited overseas, Australia gets around to adopting them. I am really concerned about this. Unless performance pay for teachers tied to school performance is managed in a sensitive way—frankly, I cannot see how it is going to be managed in a sensitive way—we are going to have some unintended consequences for those people in communities who are the most adversely affected and who do not have choices about where they might want to send their kids to school. They are going to be the ones suffering the greatest consequences.
I put the government on notice here that what is needed in public education is a regime that is fair to teachers. There are a myriad of reasons why a school may be performing or not performing against a set of data. I want to make sure that the best approach to lifting standards in schools and improving the attractiveness of teaching as a profession is adopted. Frankly, the best way of doing that is to fund public education adequately. If you support teachers in their work, if you put in additional resources to assist teachers and to assist students who are struggling for various reasons, then you get better outcomes. The fact of the matter is that Australia has underfunded public education for more than a decade. The problem we have got in this country is that the state governments’ underfunding of education, with the lift in funding that the federal government has given, particularly to the non-government sector, has increased the gap between performance in public education and what private schools or non-government schools have been able to offer, particularly in terms of resourcing.
It is absolutely critical that this weekend’s COAG meeting takes account of that, because what I fear with the global economic downturn is that state governments are going to cut back on their education funding, just as the Commonwealth brings in its league tables and its performance criteria for teachers and so on, and that teachers are going to be expected to do the impossible with fewer and fewer resources and less and less money. Then the Commonwealth may bring in new schemes to attract the best graduates into teaching by way of some arrangement with industry, saying ‘We’ll bring these graduates into teaching, they’ll be there for two years and then they can go back to industry.’ That is really just a small step. Yes, you might get some of those outstanding graduates, but to be a good teacher you not only have to be intelligent and insightful but you also need experience. The more experienced you become, the better you become at teaching. If we are going to just bring people in for two years and then allow them to go off again, then we are not going to have the permanent benefit to the education system of getting those teachers.
If you want your best graduates to go into teaching, you have to pay them. You have to pay teachers decent wages because, in a comparative sense, teachers are poorly paid. That is why you are not getting your best graduates going into teaching. It is a challenging profession and if it is poorly paid people do not go into it. You can set up any number of arrangements you like for a two-year experience of teaching, but you need those people to stay in the education system. The way to do that is to fund schools, to educate students and to pay teachers a wage that is attractive in comparison with other options that they might have upon leaving educational institutions, tertiary institutions, around the country.
The final point that I would like to make is in relation to the protection of data that is collected by the authority. I alluded to that before. As I said, while the minister may or may not want to produce league tables, league tables will be able to be produced if the data is all released by the authority. I want to ensure that the regulations or protocols that are going to be used to protect the data are very, very well designed and thought through and that we do not have an unintended consequence of the collection of the data being that that data can be run through anybody’s models—with anybody’s assumptions going into those models—to be used for whatever purpose anyone might choose to use it for.
In terms of the national curriculum itself, there has been for a long time a discussion around the country about what happens when students move from state to state and have difficulties or otherwise integrating into systems. At the University of Tasmania just this week I was listening to an honours student’s presentation about an analysis of the experience of students moving from interstate to Tasmania and the difficulties they may or may not have encountered in entering the school system. What was interesting about that honours student’s analysis was that the issue was not so much of what was taught in the curriculum; it was first of all the different age structures. For example, a student may come from one state where they are going into grade 7 and go to another state and be put back to grade 6, or however it might operate. That issue of getting some consistency around the country is a critical issue in terms of childhood development.
The other issue is to support those students in their social integration into the schools, so that they are not isolated and going for weeks without having any friends or any real interaction in their school. It was suggested that just a buddy system is not enough. There need to be programs developed to sort of force the integration of the new students into the existing programs of the school in various ways so that we do that better. I think it is an interesting point that the national curriculum will not overcome some of the social issues associated with moving from state to state and some of the issues around age, for example.
On the content of the national curriculum, we heard a lot from the previous government about political correctness, but over the Howard years there was a major attack on public education—a suggestion that public education is not a values based education. I want to reiterate here that a national curriculum is important, but the values of public education have always been there and they remain, and they are values about equity, equal opportunity, excellence, compassion, tolerance, inclusiveness and innovation. All of those things are in public education, have always been in public education and will continue to be there, but they can be better demonstrated by a larger investment in public education.
I hope that the Commonwealth’s negotiations with the states make sure that the states do not get away with cutting the education funding and therefore increasing the gap between the funding of non-government schools and the funding of government schools. Fund education and fund teachers properly and you will attract the best graduates and you will get a better performance in schools.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2008-11-27,"—by leave—I thank the Senate for leave to make this statement. A similar statement will be made by the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives. Overnight in the Indian city of Mumbai there has been a series of coordinated attacks on hotels, train stations and other public places. It is unclear at this stage who is responsible for those attacks, although one organisation has claimed responsibility. The Australian government unreservedly condemns the atrocious attacks on innocent people in Mumbai, whoever carried them out. I know that is a sentiment that is shared by all senators in this chamber.
As we speak, events are still unfolding, but we understand that up to 80 people have been killed and 250 injured. Our sympathy and condolences go to the victims and their families. Attackers still may be in hotels and there are reports that hostages have been taken. The government is seeking to confirm as a matter of urgency the safety and welfare of Australians who may be affected. We have 317 Australians registered with us as being in Mumbai. Our consular staff are currently attempting to contact all of the Australians who are registered. At least two Australians have been injured and our thoughts are with them and their families. We have been advised that Australian casualty numbers may rise. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been in contact with the families in Australia and of course is providing consular assistance in Mumbai. Australians who are concerned about the welfare of loved ones can contact a hotline that has been established by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The number of the consular hotline is 1800 002 214.
The Prime Minister has just spoken to the Australian High Commissioner to India, who is in Mumbai and is leading the government’s consular response. Officials from the Australian Consulate General in Mumbai and the Australian High Commission in Delhi are checking with local authorities to determine exactly how many Australians may have been caught up in these incidents.
The group that has claimed responsibility for this attack calls itself the Deccan Mujahideen. At this stage little is known of this group, at least those using this name. But whichever group perpetrated this attack they are cowards. It is likely to take some time to identify all the perpetrators. This cowardly attack on India’s stability, peace and democracy reminds all of us that international terrorism is far from defeated and that we must maintain our vigilance. We have to continue to work closely with our allies and partners around the world to defeat terrorism.
In light of this attack, we have revised our travel advice for India today. I am advised that the previous advice stated that travellers should exercise a high degree of caution in India because of the high risk of terrorist activity by militant groups. The revised travel advisory advises Australians to avoid travel to Mumbai at this time. We are offering, through the Australian Federal Police, assistance with counterterrorism and forensic policing to Indonesian authorities, and we are ready to assist India in any way it needs.
This latest attack on Indian peace, stability and democracy reminds us that we must remain vigilant. Terrorism continues to pose a threat around the world and we must resolve afresh to work with our allies and friends around the world to defeat the terrorists who threaten us.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Mumbai Terrorist Attacks</title>,Ministerial Statements,21,1,speech

The document read as follows:

At the 2 October 2008 meeting, COAL agreed to progress reforms to roles and responsibilities between the Commonwealth and States and Territories for community and residential care services for aged people, community care and residential care for people with disabilities, and community care and support services for people with a mental illness.
The Home and Community Care program (HACC) is one program under consideration as part of this reform agenda.
Our aim is to provide people with better services that are easier to access and which can respond more flexibly as people’s needs change.
These proposed reforms aim to create single integrated service delivery systems in each reform area.
This is so that people with disability, mental illness, or aged Australians, have to deal with only one access point getting the services they need.
This will reduce confusion, buck passing, and better integrate services, making it easier for people to get the help they need.
The Commonwealth retains its strong policy role in all of these areas.
For example in the disability area, under the proposed reform the Commonwealth will retain a central role in policy making, and development of new reforms.
Already, in disability the Government has an ambitious reform agenda and has already injected significant additional funding—including the $100 million for capital announced by the Prime Minister in May, and $900 million into the new disability agreement for accommodation, respite and care services. State and Territory Governments also agreed to contribute additional funding of $900 million.
The next wave of reform will introduce national tools to identify service benchmarks; plan for changing needs; identify people at risk; and work towards program and service delivery consistency across jurisdictions.
The Australian Government is mindful of the concerns of service providers and employees whose role in providing community care services is vital.
Under the proposed reforms the current mix of community care service providers will continue, including local government, state agency and non-government providers.
We will work with stakeholders to ensure that the future system of community care builds on the strengths of the existing service infrastructure, the experience of the workforce and the needs of local communities.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Disability Services</title>,Questions Without Notice: Additional Answers,23,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2008-11-27,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (Senator Conroy) to questions without notice asked today.
I never thought I would actually feel sorry for Senator Conroy, but I do when I consider Senator Conroy’s performance in the chamber today. Not only has he been mugged by the extravaganza of his broadband process but, on top of that, he seems to be blissfully and totally unaware, as the Minister representing the Treasurer, that the Treasurer said that growth will be slower than forecast just three weeks ago in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook.
What is emerging from the Rudd Labor government’s lazy handling of the economy is that, after just one year, they have run up the white flag. They have pronounced it all too hard and they have declared that Australia is headed for a budget deficit and possibly a recession. If this sounds familiar to Australians—to mums and dads, working families and small businesses—it is because it is, very familiar. The ghost of Labor governments and their extreme failure to run the economy competently is well and truly back with us.
The last time Labor went into a budget deficit, it lasted six long years and saddled Australians with $96 billion worth of debt and, if my memory serves me correctly, unemployment that peaked at nearly 11 per cent. Just three weeks ago, in the MYEFO, the government was projecting growth of two per cent. Remember that Mr Rudd was proclaiming that the growth forecast had a two in front of it? Well, not anymore. The Treasurer, who is understandably a very worried man, yesterday conceded that growth will most probably be slower than he had forecast just three days ago.
If growth is slower then, as night follows day, Labor’s unemployment forecast will also likely be out. The OECD predicted, just overnight, unemployment of six per cent by 2010. What, we might ask, is Labor’s plan for the economy? We have had the events of the last six weeks and the bungled deposit guarantee scheme that lurched along until eventually Labor fell over the line and put in legislation to support the wholesale term funding guarantee that we had suggested they needed six weeks ago. It is clear that, while Labor have a political strategy, they do not have a plan to keep the budget in surplus or to keep the economy strong. In just one year in office, they have galloped through the surplus. They are already predicting a deficit and are now softening up the electorate, softening up the community, for the possibility of a recession.
This is sloppy economic management and it is unjustified. What has changed in the last three days to cause the government to believe that we will go into deficit and a possible recession? We certainly did not get much enlightenment from Senator Conroy’s bumbling performance in question time. The government is already spending one per cent of GDP on a $10.4 billion stimulus package for the economy. It has not even hit the ground yet and Labor have already, in effect, given a vote of no confidence that the stimulus package will work.
The OECD said only yesterday that Australia would avoid a recession. The government has forecast growth of two per cent, with Mr Swan softening a bit on that yesterday. The government has in place the stimulatory package, as I mentioned. The Reserve Bank cash rate is still at 5.25 per cent. There is a lot of room to move, if you are competently managing the economy in terms of monetary policy, to bring interest rates down to stimulate the economy. There is certainly no need for the government to abandon the discipline of keeping the budget in surplus.
Labor’s talk of deficit is nothing less than a vote of no confidence in their own strategy and in their own stimulus package to keep our economy in growth. The hard decision for the Rudd-Swan government is to keep the budget in surplus and the economy in growth. The lazy decision is exactly what they are doing—for the government to run up the white flag on deficit with the economy in growth. Here is a prediction for you, Mr Deputy President: we will not have a temporary deficit; we will have one that lasts for as long as we have a Labor government. (Time expired)

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2008-11-27,"—If one had to find two words to define the quality of the economic administration of this country in the 12 months since the election of the Rudd Labor government, those words would be ‘flexible’ and ‘responsible’. What do I mean by flexible? It is a very simple proposition. When economic conditions change, when change is imposed on this country from outside, those who are responsible for determining the economic policy settings of this country respond by changing those settings as well. That is how you do it if you are being flexible—you change when the circumstances change.
What does it mean if you are being responsible? In changing those policy settings to respond to the global financial crisis which is being felt in this country, you properly have regard to jobs, inflation, interest rates, the terms of trade and the current account. They are the key drivers of economic policy that any responsible Treasurer and any responsible leader would have regard to when a situation comes upon this country out of the blue, not forecast by one reputable body or economist around the world, which requires a response by the government of the day. You have regard to jobs, inflation, interest rates, the terms of trade and the current account.
What do we know in terms of those five matters? We know that this country has full employment and growth is still around the corner and is of the order of a positive two per cent—unknown in the rest of the Western world. It does not matter whether it is the United States, the United Kingdom, Korea, France, Germany or major powerhouses like China and India; all of those countries have negative job growth and real job declines.
Secondly, in terms of inflation, what is occurring in this country is that inflation is coming down—on every key measure inflation is coming down. Thirdly, in terms of interest rates, there have been record reductions of interest rates—the cost of money to families, the cost of money to business—in this country in the last 12 months, and undoubtedly interest rates will continue to reduce over the next six or 12 months, which will be an incentive required, organised, requested and encouraged by this government to get the economy moving again, to get investment going into business and to get people maintained in employment.
Similarly, in terms of the current account, we do not accept that because, for the first time in over 14 years, for two successive months there has been a significant surplus on the current account, that is enough. All of the things that were outlined by Senator Conroy today in terms of work, a responsible approach to changed circumstances, getting the policy levers right, and the things outlined by Senator Carr in response to questions in terms of getting a new labour market regime by having innovation in science and technology responsive to the demands of a changing economy, will result in the current account remaining in surplus, which in turn will result in investment coming into this country and jobs being maintained.
As Senator Conroy said, they are not just the views of this government. What are the views of reputable outside observers? Senator Conroy, in response to one or two of the questions, made the point that two senior public economists, from Westpac and ANZ, had said that it is necessary when circumstances change that you revisit the need to have a huge surplus or to go into deficit. Senator Conroy was exactly right when he said that there is a current need for a temporary deficit to allow sufficient funds to go into the economy for the government to borrow to keep economic growth active, to keep economic growth going and to keep people and families employed in jobs. He was right to quote Mr Eslake and Mr Evans from those two banks— (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2008-11-27,"—Senator Bishop’s fine oratory cannot hide the facts of the matter. The facts of the matter are simply that this government has no idea what it is doing when it comes to the financial management of our country. That was exemplified today by the answers given by Senator Conroy. I do not want my discussion to be seen as a personal attack on Senator Conroy, who I quite like. I think he is a fine fellow. Not being from the Victorian Left, I guess I can say that. I bear him no personal ill will. But have a look at the answers today: poor Senator Conroy is completely out of his depth.
It is quite clear that Senator Lundy—a person who has had a long involvement in broadband and clearly understands it far better than Senator Conroy, with the mess he has got himself into—should have been the broadband and communications minister and Senator Sherry should be doing the Treasurer’s work. Senator Sherry could not be worse than Wayne Swan, with his appalling position last night on the ABC’s The 7.30 Report, or Lateline, was it, with Kerry O’Brien—Kerry it is, Wayne, not Terry. Poor old Mr Swan could not answer a question. He could not define how long this temporary downturn would be, the temporary deficit that the Labor Party have now admitted the government will have. As Senator Conroy said today, Mr Swan and Senator Conroy were standing by the midyear economic financial outlook projections. But already, two weeks later, they are resiling from them.
As I say, fine words from Senator Bishop, but what are the facts? The Labor Party claim that they are putting big money into this building fund and by spending the building fund that will indeed get the country out of the recession that it is heading towards. But this building fund that he talks about was totally and entirely the work of the previous government. The money came from T3, it came from last year’s surplus and it came from the telecommunications fund—all three funds set up by the previous government. So what the Labor government is now doing is spending the savings of the previous government to try and get the economy going.
I think most Australians were prepared to give Labor a bit of a go. They started off with a $22 billion surplus given by the previous government, but within a year that will disappear and we will be borrowing again. Those of us who have been around for a while sat through the years when Labor borrowed up to $96 billion. It was $96 billion the Labor Party had to borrow to try and keep Australia running. What happened when the coalition took over government? We did not have any fat to deal with. We had to start and pay off Labor’s $96 billion. Over six or seven long years we scrimped and saved, ran the economy well, got the economy into a positive economic outlook, created jobs and paid off Labor’s $96 billion debt. Could you imagine how this government would be today in the face of the economic downturn facing Australia if they had inherited a $96 billion deficit rather than a $22 billion surplus? Can you just imagine the state Australia would be in? When we took over in 1996, Labor left us huge double-digit unemployment and just about double-digit inflation, plus a $96 billion deficit. If they had been left with that in December last year, the country would be just about in ruins at the moment. Unfortunately, and I regret to say this, I, and I think increasingly every other Australian, have absolutely no confidence in Mr Rudd and Mr Swan in managing our economy.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Economy</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,25,1,speech
"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2008-11-27,"—I must say that I have been absolutely amazed at the arrogance of the opposition this week in question time. Senator Feeney made the point yesterday: when are the opposition going to deal with the issue of the economy? It is the big issue facing the whole global community, yet question time was being taken up with anything but the economy. We have this born-to-rule arrogance on the other side. I take the view that the opposition are in an absolute time warp. You refused to accept that global warming was a reality, and you are now refusing to accept that the economic crisis that is facing economies all around the world is a reality. You only have to listen to the contributions here today on the issue of a deficit. There is absolute incompetence and absolute denial of the economic factors facing this community.
You really want to hark back to the theories of Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman that the government should do nothing. All you want to do is say that the budget should stay in surplus and should stay there forever. That is the argument you are putting up. It does not matter that all other countries in the world facing this problem are setting about stimulating their economies, with decisive government intervention to ensure that their communities, their workforces and their families have a future in terms of some security. This Labor government will not stand by idly and watch while this economy is driven into the ground by government incompetence. We will deal with it fairly, we will deal with it effectively and we will deal with it decisively. We will not repeat the incompetence of the last Liberal government.
You go back and claim this great historic economic credibility. Let me tell you about your economic credibility. Under Menzies you allowed this country to plod along with no major economic intervention or change for the good for decades. You plodded along on the sheep’s back under Menzies. And under Howard we had a decade of lost opportunity, when we had the mining boom to build the future of this economy. And what did you do? You laid back and let the market rip and did nothing in terms of positive intervention to ensure that we built for the future. The Labor government will not do that. We will ensure that in the face of a global economic crisis the government acts decisively, that the government acts responsibly, and we will look after the communities of Australia. We will not argue about some theoretical point about maintaining a budget deficit, which you are arguing here is a great, great evil. If a budget deficit means keeping communities at work and keeping our economy ticking along, then we will take a budget deficit in the interests of this nation.
It is absolute nonsense for you to argue here that there is no economic problem that requires a government to make a change in its economic policy in terms of the budget. In fact, your line is being criticised by some of the economists who you quote all the time, your favourite economists. Look at Chris Richardson of Access Economics on Lateline last night. What did Chris Richardson say? He said:
The debate about deficits is a silly one.
As silly as the performance of the Liberals here today. He went on:
It’s a politicians’ debate. They’re the ones who’ve drawn the line in the sand about deficits being evil. We don’t want deficits to be a habit, but we want them to help and we do need them now.
We need intervention in the economy in the interests of the nation, and yet you sit back with your silly carping views, your born-to-rule arrogance and your arguments that are in the past. You do not accept the reality of the global economic— (Time expired)

"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2008-11-27,"—The government promised Australians to partner with the private sector to upgrade the existing fibre network to deliver speeds of a minimum of 12 megabits per second to 98 per cent of Australians. That is what the government promised. Not only have they not delivered it; there is no vestige, no remnant, of a prospect that they will. This is tragic for Australians at large, particularly those in currently underserviced areas. The government’s promise is in tatters, as exhibited and writ large by the tender process thus far. Prior to this there have been public comments by tenderers and would-be tenderers about the frustrations that they have experienced in trying to say what they would do to bid to be part of the government’s proposal, while the government has refused to set out what the regulatory environment would be, what the regulatory rules under which a successful bidder would operate would be.
Worse than that, we have essentially seen a stand-off between Telstra and the government, with Telstra wanting one thing and the government refusing to commit to that thing or to something else—or to anything else. And then at the last minute a would-be tenderer effectively puts in a proposal, a proposition, an invitation to treat—we know not what it is. What are the other tenderers who have complied with the government’s rules thus far—as best they can, given that they do not know what they will be, should they be successful—supposed to think of, do with, provide for in respect of a proposal put up by another would-be bidder? The environment is totally uncertain. It is wholly unsatisfactory. And this is a tragedy for Australians.

The removal, search for and discovery of Ms Vivian Solon


Final Report (December 2005)


Government Response


Introduction

The events surrounding the removal of Ms Vivian Solon in 2001 have become symbolic of the problems that emerged in the immigration portfolio at that time.
This case was made public in 2005, and was investigated by both Mr Mick Palmer AO and Mr Neil Comrie AO.
The Committee and the investigation by Mr Comrie both highlighted the failure of DIMIA, as it then was, to more thoroughly investigate Ms Solon’s identity prior to her removal, given that at the time Ms Solon insisted she was an Australian citizen.
The most shocking element to this case was that when Commonwealth officials subsequently discovered that they had removed an Australian citizen, action was not immediately taken to remedy the situation.
In this context and in response to the earlier reports of Mr Palmer and Mr Comrie the Department has engaged in a process of business and cultural reform.
As part of this organisational transformation, DIAC has implemented improvements to training, data management and information systems, compliance activity, case management, detention services, client services, health services and identity verification. These improvements have been most profound in the areas of instruction and training on the initial decision to detain an unlawful non-citizen, structured reviews of detention decisions, and the case management of non-citizens in detention.
These reforms have been supported by strengthened governance, stakeholder engagement, risk management and quality assurance processes, to ensure high professional standards in decision-making, particularly in relation to decisions to detain and remove people. Many of the initiatives that DIAC has implemented are cited here in response to the recommendations of this Senate Committee Report.

Recommendation 1

The committee recommends that in relation to the interviewing of detainees, if a detainee is unable to sign the record, there must be certification by a third party that the record of interview is correct.

Response - Agree

Since the finalisation of the Senate Committee Report, considerable efforts have been made by the Department to ensure transparency and fairness for those people in immigration detention who are unable, for whatever reason, to sign and endorse the record of interview. Revised instructions require officers to consider whether the person may require a third party present during the interview and inquire whether the person wishes a friend, family member or other third party to be present for support.
Where an assessment has been made prior to interview that a person can be interviewed but is unable to sign the record of interview, a third party will be made available to attend the interview and provide certification of the record of interview.
Officers are also required to consider before an interview whether the person is well enough to be interviewed. Priority is given to addressing any health issues before an interview is conducted. As part of the case management of people in immigration detention, consideration is given to circumstances where the person appears to be in a confused or distressed state or experiencing a mental illness. In such circumstances, DIAC will seek expert advice from its detention health services’ provider about the best way to proceed.
Where the health services’ provider advises that a person in immigration detention is not competent to make decisions about his or her welfare or provide informed consent because of mental health issues or intellectual disabilities, the Department, the person’s family or a representative may apply to the relevant State Guardianship Board for the appointment of a Public Guardian to act in the person’s interests.
Finally, in the case of people in immigration detention who are unable to sign because of insufficient competence in English, DIAC’s procedures require the record of interview to be signed by the interpreter assisting in the interview as well as the person.

Recommendation 2

The committee recommends that DIAC staff are reminded that independent and accredited interpreters must be used and that the use of a departmental officer as an interpreter should only occur in exceptional circumstances.

Response - Agree

In relation to compliance and immigration detention activities, departmental instructions remind staff to use independent qualified interpreters, such as those available from TIS National (Translating and Interpreting Services), wherever the client has difficulties understanding or speaking English. This is consistent with DIAC’s commitment to the Charter of Public Service in a Culturally Diverse Society. In exceptional circumstances, such as where an independent and accredited interpreter is not available (for example, because interpreters for some emerging community groups are yet to achieve National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters (NAATI) accreditation), DIAC seeks to use people who it is satisfied are competent to interpret in the circumstances. This may include departmental officers.
DIAC’s College of Immigration also provides compliance officers with formal training sessions conducted by NAATI relating to the professional use of interpreters. This training reinforces and reminds these officers of existing departmental instructions that require them to seek the assistance of accredited interpreters.
DIAC’s intranet provides staff with contact details for TIS National. When contracting the services of an interpreter, TIS National gives preference to interpreters who are NAATI accredited or recognised.
DIAC staff with language skills are sometimes used to assist in a wide range of departmental services and activities which do not relate to compliance or immigration detention activities. These include citizenship and settlement activities, over-the-counter services, offshore services and services for refugee and humanitarian entrants.

Recommendation 3

The committee recommends that DIAC carefully consider the process to ensure that someone in a confused and distressed state has access to legal advice.

Response - Agree

During the reception process, people in immigration detention are informed that they can seek legal representation or contact a consular representative. This is done through a written notice which is available in a number of community languages.
As part of the case management of people in immigration detention, consideration is given to the particular circumstances of each individual, including their competence to make decisions about their welfare or to provide instructions to a legal representative. Where a person appears to lack mental competency, the Department will receive expert advice from its detention health services’ provider. Depending on the advice of the health services’ provider, the Department will then consider appropriate case management and where required will approach the State Guardianship Board for consideration of the case in respect of whether a guardian should be appointed under the relevant state or territory legislation.

Recommendation 4

The committee recommends DIAC review checklists regarding identity checking and the decision to detain and remove process to ensure that the actions outlined above regarding contact with the police and advice regarding legal assistance are captured so they are addressed by DIAC officers when effecting removal.

Response - Agree

DIAC has made major changes to policies and procedures relating to the detention of unlawful non-citizens. These focus on establishing correct identity and escalating matters where identity is not able to be confirmed at the outset, and are reinforced through the training program DIAC compliance staff now undertake.
DIAC will continue to review and refine these procedures to ensure that all reasonable lines of enquiry are pursued and embedded into our processes to ascertain a client’s true identity. DIAC will include specific references to include the requirement that local police be contacted where a possibility exists that a person of interest may have been subject to actions which could have affected their capacity to clearly establish their identity, such as assaults or motor vehicle accidents. The capture of this information will be supported with policy advice on how this information may be used to help establish a person’s identity. Responsibility for the investigation of alleged criminal action would remain a matter for the appropriate law enforcement authority.
DIAC has also implemented procedures that ensure that a person is not removed from Australia without a formal assessment of the case being done by a senior officer. This assessment includes satisfaction about confirmation of the person’s identity and immigration status as well as satisfaction that visa applications, litigation and other proceedings relating to immigration status have been finalised. The assessment may also involve assessment of whether proceedings with relevant authorities such as the police have been settled.
The measures in place for ensuring that people in immigration detention are afforded reasonable facilities for obtaining legal advice are discussed in response to recommendation three above.

Recommendation 5

The committee recommends that the Australian government review the adequacy of section 189 of the Migration Act 1958 and/or the introduction of a regulation that stipulates the evidence required for a person to be detained as an unlawful non-citizen.

Response - Agree

Since the Committee’s report and informed by both the Palmer and Comrie reports, the previous Government initiated considerable improvements to the policies and operational procedures around the power to detain at section 189 of the Act. These improvements are based on the proposition that immigration detention is a last resort, and many have been developed and implemented in consultation with the Commonwealth Ombudsman.
For example, current procedural instructions on the application of section 189 of the Act specify a list of objective indicators upon which officers must base their knowledge or reasonable suspicion that a person’s status is unlawful. These instructions are reinforced in the departmental College of Immigration training program.
In August 2007 the Ombudsman’s office commenced ad hoc inspection visits accompanying departmental compliance teams. These visits are being conducted under the preliminary inquiry powers at section 7A of the Ombudsman Act 1976. The Department also provides the Ombudsman with six-monthly reports on instances of people detained under s189 who were subsequently released having been determined to be lawful.
Further improvements to policy settings, training and quality assurance have been made to enhance sensitivity to the individual’s circumstances. These reforms include, amongst others:
the development of improved training and instructions relating to the application of section 189, and what constitutes the formation of a reasonable suspicion;
the establishment of a quality assurance framework, including mandatory managerial review of all decisions to detain people under the Act;
the appointment of Detention Review Managers to provide independent assurance, removed from compliance activities, that decisions to detain are made lawfully and reasonably; and
a Compliance, Case Management and Detention Integrated Business Model, developed to ensure the provision of coordinated services that achieve immigration outcomes in a timely, fair and reasonable manner.
These approaches have halved the rate at which unlawful non-citizens located by departmental compliance work are taken into immigration detention. Thirty per cent of compliance locations resulted in detention in 2004-05, but for the 2007-08 year to date this figure is down to under 15 per cent. The overall number of people in detention has also been reduced from 862 in June 2005 to 456 at 14 March 2008.
This Government proposes to continue and extend these changes where necessary and to provide humane, fair, reasonable and timely outcomes for people who are detained as unlawful non-citizens.

Recommendation 6

The committee recommends that the development of appropriate standards for health and care needs for detainees in transitional detention – identified in Recommendation 9 in the Ombudsman’s report – specify mental health as an area to be addressed.

Response - Agree

The Detention Health Framework articulates the broad principle that fair and reasonable standards of health care, including mental health care, be provided to people in all forms of immigration detention within the immigration detention network. Fair and reasonable health care means a comparable standard of health care in terms of quality and timeliness that is available to members of the Australian community.
The Detention Health Advisory Group (DeHAG) advises DIAC on policy and procedural matters related to immigration detention health issues. Following a DeHAG recommendation, DIAC has worked with the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) to develop health standards for immigration detention centres. Where people are immigration detained in a community setting, DIAC’s health service management organisation prefers to engage health care services which are accredited against the RACGP Standards for General Practice.

Recommendation 7

The committee recommends that the explanation of rights regarding the medical examination be included in a relevant checklist as discussed in recommendation 4 above.

Response - Agree

People in immigration detention are provided a standard of health care commensurate with that available to the Australian community. Consistent with this, all people in detention who are offered medical examinations are informed of the purpose of the examination and have the right to refuse (i.e. consent is sought). The requirement for consent to a medical examination is part of the Department’s health induction assessment and discharge health assessment protocols.
A refusal to agree to a medical examination is recorded in the client’s health file. Advice is provided as to any health risks associated with such a refusal. Advice to the Department on the health status of a person is based on the best available health information when so requested.
Where clients are medically examined as part of a removal process they are advised of the purpose of such an examination unless clinical advice to the contrary is given by the health service manager. In this unlikely event, the information would be recorded in the Removal Availability Assessment, a document which is provided to the responsible SES Band 1 Officer, seeking approval for the removal to proceed.
The requirement for consent to medical examination is contained in the RACGP Standards for health services in Australian immigration detention centres (June 2007) which is the Department’s policy document regarding this issue.

Recommendation 8

The committee recommends that DFAT review internal processes regarding the treatment of concerns expressed by other governments that have the potential to affect bilateral relationships, with a view to ensuring that appropriate senior officers in Canberra and in relevant posts are made aware of these concerns.

Response - Agree

DFAT has looked closely and critically at its involvement in Ms Solon’s case. A number of steps have been taken to ensure effective checks are in place and that any similar cases in the future are exhaustively followed up. The steps include tightening DFAT’s rules requiring reporting and tasking of overseas posts to be communicated through the cable system, thereby ensuring significant developments – which would include expressions of concern by other governments – are brought to the attention of senior staff.

Recommendation 9

The committee recommends that DIAC review its procedures to ensure that formal procedures are in place for the reception of people being removed from Australia in circumstances similar to Ms Solon and that their final destination is recorded on file.

Response - Agree

DIAC notes that the responsibility for citizens of a country to which they are returned lies with the authorities of that country. The Australian Government can only have a limited role in the initial reception of non-citizens upon return to their home.
In keeping with DIAC’s case management approach, individuals’ needs for post-removal support or reception arrangements in their country of destination are assessed on a case by case basis. Depending on the needs identified in a person’s specialised case management plan, the post-removal care provided by DIAC may, for example, involve arranging:
for individuals to be transported to or met by medical and/or welfare staff;
short term accommodation or clothing;
contacts for post-removal health support and continuation of treatment regimes, where possible; and
a small allowance and provision of information on welfare organisations.
Reception arrangements for individuals are detailed in the removal planning documentation, and escorts are required to complete a post-removal report which is retained on the person’s file.
In some cases DIAC may not be informed of a person’s final destination within the country of removal. However, where there are contact details available for the removed person in the country of removal, these will be recorded by DIAC officers and retained on file.

Recommendation 10

The committee recommends that DIAC review and advise staff when their responsibilities for a detainee begin and end, noting there may be circumstances like that of Ms Solon where there may not be a strict legal obligation but a moral obligation to ensure their welfare.

Response - Agree

The Government recognises that sometimes the welfare of people can initially be affected by their removal from Australia. Extensive training has been, and is being, delivered to DIAC staff to ensure any removal arrangements appropriately reflect the needs of the individual.
In addition, initial post-removal support can be, and is, arranged for clients who are identified by their departmental case managers as having special needs. Under the revised procedures, before any person is removed from Australia a formal assessment of the case is done by a senior officer. This assessment includes satisfaction about confirmation of the person’s identity and immigration status, and satisfaction that visa applications, litigation and other proceedings relating to immigration status have been finalised, and that arrangements for the removal including any on-arrival arrangements are appropriate.
These arrangements provide clarity for DIAC staff on the extent of their responsibilities for immigration detainees. However, once a person has been properly and lawfully removed or deported from Australia, Australia’s obligations in relation to that person have been substantially discharged.
There are limits on what Australia can do in other countries’ jurisdictions.

Recommendation 11

The committee recommends that the independent investigation into whether the actions of individual officers breached the APS Code of Conduct include consideration of any systemic issues that may have contributed to the lack of action. Furthermore, if the investigation identifies any systemic issues that it make recommendations to address them.

Response - Agree

Mr Dale Boucher, the former Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Government Solicitor, finalised his independent investigation into possible breaches of the APS Code of Conduct arising from the recommendations of the Comrie inquiry report in September 2006.
The Terms of Reference for this investigation required that Mr Boucher investigate allegations of staff misconduct. Mr Boucher was not required to consider potential systemic issues that may have contributed to the lack of action in this matter. As a consequence, Mr Boucher did not undertake a review that focused on these potential issues.
The report, however, does make comment on the need for DIAC to provide advice to staff on how to deal with and escalate difficult client service related issues associated with people in immigration detention. This has been addressed through DIAC’s approach to individual case management of people in immigration detention who have particular needs. The issue was discovered in the course of undertaking the investigation inquiries specified in the Terms of Reference, and not as part of a broader review of potential systemic issues.
Systemic issues have been addressed throughout the Department in a broader reform process which includes the implementation of the Palmer, Comrie and Ombudsman reports’ recommendations.

Recommendation 12

The committee recommends that DIAC and DFAT remind staff of the correct procedures to be followed when making requests for passport information.

Response - Agree

DFAT has ensured that staff are reminded through regular passports and consular training that they are required to bring to the attention of senior departmental staff any requests from other agencies for passport information.
DIAC has issued an instruction for compliance staff which clarifies the procedures for obtaining Australian passport information, including the procedures for making formal requests for passport information from DFAT.

Government response to the report on 
Australia’s aid program in the Pacific
 September 2007


Pacific Partnerships for Development

The Prime Minister announced an intention to commit Australia to a new and elevated engagement with Pacific island nations in the Port Moresby Declaration in March 2008.  A central focus of this new engagement with the Pacific is the Government’s commitment to pursue Pacific Partnerships for Development which will provide a new framework for Australia and our Pacific neighbours to commit jointly to making more rapid progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and partner countries’ achievement of their own development objectives.
In line with the Port Moresby Declaration, the Partnership will respond to individual circumstances of our respective partners, reflecting the fundamental underlying principles of mutual respect and mutual responsibility. These principles are given effect in the following ways:
Mutual respect: through commitments which underline Australia’s recognition of Pacific partner country leadership and ownership of development strategies. The Partnerships also provide for acknowledgement by partner governments of the Australian Government’s responsibilities to its own citizens to ensure Australian development assistance is used appropriately and effectively to promote economic and social development; and
Mutual responsibility: the partnerships are explicitly based on mutual, long-term and measurable commitments. The Partnerships will provide a framework for mutual commitments by Australia and Pacific island nations to achieve shared goals, noting Australia’s willingness to provide increased development assistance over time in return for commitments by partner governments, including; to improve governance, increased investment in economic infrastructure, better outcomes in health and education, and to undertake agreed measures to achieve this. The Partnerships also commit Australia and Pacific island countries to strive for better development results and good practice in aid effectiveness through a sharper focus on shared accountability based on regular, joint reviews of progress and evidence-based decision making.
As initial countries to be offered Partnerships for Development, PNG and Samoa have welcomed the initiative. The Government intends to pursue similar agreements with other Pacific partners who share Australia’s ambition for better development results in the region over the coming years.
Australia’s commitment to the Pacific is demonstrated through the recently released 2008-09 Budget for Australia’s International Development Assistance Program, which foreshadows development assistance for PNG and the Pacific estimated at $999 million in 2008-09, a substantial increase on the amount budgeted in 2007-08 of $872 million.

Recommendation 1


The Committee notes the importance of financial services in the development of Pacific Island economies, and recommends that the Australian Government develop a focused strategy to encourage financial services development, including microfinance.

The Australian Government agrees that it is important to increase access by the poor to financial services. Achieving this at scale and on a sustainable basis requires a broad focus on the financial sector, including but not limited to support for microfinance services.
The Australian aid program has provided an average of $10 million a year in direct support to microfinance initiatives around the world over the last 8 years. Recent projects in the Pacific include support for the Bougainville Microfinance Association; the establishment of Microfinance Pasifika, the regional microfinance network; the Foundation for Rural Integrated Enterprises ‘N’ Development, (FRIEND) in Fiji; and volunteer support placements with microfinance provider Vanuatu Women’s Development Scheme (VanWODS). Australia’s support for programs such as the Asian Development Bank’s Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative goes, in part, to improving access to finance through the introduction of new technologies and by extending financial services to outlets such as schools and shops.
AusAID is currently exploring a range of programming options to increase the number of poor people accessing financial services in the Pacific, and to give them more choice in products and providers. These options include strengthened support for regional and multilateral organizations that support Pacific microfinance providers, and an examination of ways to encourage private lenders, not-for-profit financial providers and NGOs.

Recommendation 2:


The Committee recommends that the Australian Tax Office, in conjunction with AusAID, consider and report on the merits and practicalities of Mr Roland Rich’s proposal to amend the Australian tax rules to encourage companies to become directly involved in building private sector capacities in developing countries in the Pacific by allowing them to deduct from their taxable income the full costs incurred in providing such assistance.


The Government does not support this recommendation.


The Government already provides tax concessions for organisations undertaking charitable development programmes in developing countries under the Overseas Aid Gift Deduction Scheme (OAGDS). The OAGDS provides a tax deduction for public donations collected by organisations that are considered under the scheme to be overseas relief funds, to assist with their overseas aid and development activities.


Moreover, an outlay to assist Australians directly involved in building private sector capacities in developing countries would be preferable to government providing additional tax concessions. Direct delivery programs are more transparent and can be better targeted to achieve desired outcomes.

For example, the Enterprise Challenge Fund awards grants of $100,000 to $1.5 million to business projects that will have pro-poor outcomes, and that could not obtain financing from commercial sources. At least 50 per cent of the project costs must be met by the partner business, and all projects must be commercially self-sustaining within three years. This program encourages business activity in areas where the private sector may be reluctant to undertake projects or have difficulty obtaining finance because of perceived risks, lack of information or the high costs of creating new markets.

Recommendation 3


The Committee notes the evidence of the importance to Pacific Island economies of access to developed economies for seasonal workers, and recommends an active and serious evaluation by the Australian Government of the possibility of such a scheme.

The Australian Government understands the importance of labour mobility to many of the economies in the Pacific and the desire of Pacific island states to pursue greater access to the Australian labour market for unskilled and semi-skilled workers.
On 17 August 2008, the Government announced a three-year Australia - Pacific Seasonal Worker Pilot Scheme. The pilot aims to enable workers to contribute to economic development in home countries through employment experience, training and remittances. It will also examine the benefits to the Australian economy and to employers who can demonstrate they cannot source local labour.
The pilot scheme will focus initially on the horticulture industry, which claims up to $700 million of fresh produce is left to rot because of a lack of reliable workers. The details of the pilot scheme are subject to further consultation with Pacific island countries and Australian employers and industry groups.
It is anticipated that the pilot could begin as soon as the end of 2008 with a small group of workers. The pilot will provide opportunities for up to 2500 workers over a three year period, subject to labour market demand.

Recommendation 4


The Committee supports the consideration of each of the issues raised by the students, and in particular recommends that the Australian Government conduct a regular review of the stipend rate for Pacific Island students on Australian Development Scholarships to ensure that it remains commensurate with the cost of living, and is at a reasonable level for those students with accompanying dependents.


AusAID provides scholars with comprehensive pre departure briefings which include information on the cost of living in Australia and training in budgeting. AusAID scholarships do not provide stipends but comprise a package of benefits including a contribution to living expenses (CLE); overseas student health cover; an allowance for additional study assistance and attendance at professional development opportunities (depending on the conditions of the scholarship); an establishment allowance to cover the cost of establishing living arrangements in Australia;payment of all tuition fees; reunion airfare(s) and airfares to/from Australia.


In response to concerns raised by scholars in early 2007, AusAID funded an independent review of scholarship benefits. The 2007 review included an examination of the CLE. This component has been increased, with effect July 2008, in recognition of the increase in the cost of living in Australia, and to maintain competitiveness with other comparable scholarship programs. In addition, as part of this review, AusAID also extended the reunion fare benefit to all unaccompanied scholars regardless of their marital status (previously it had only been available to those who left spouses in their home country).

Recommendation 5


The Committee recommends that the Australian Government consider establishing a Pacific Island Youth Ambassador Scheme (similar to and possibly linked with the Australian Youth Ambassador Scheme, or AusAID scholarships), whereby young skilled Pacific Islanders can apply for placements in an Australian host organisation workplace for the purpose of work experience and cultural exchange.

Young Pacific islanders can participate in the Australian Leadership Awards Fellowships Scheme (ALAS) that provides a mechanism for placement with Australian host organisations. Fellowships grants are available for short-term study, research, and professional attachment programs in Australia delivered by Australian organisations. Fellowships target current and emerging leaders from the Asia-Pacific region and foster existing linkages between community, civil society, private sector, research, academia and Australian government agencies. Prospective Fellows identified by Australian organisations must be professionals already in leadership positions or have a potential to assume leadership roles that can influence social and economic policy reform and development outcomes, both in their own countries and within the Asia- Pacific region.
A review of Australian Government support for overseas volunteer programs, including the Australian Youth Ambassadors for Development Program will be undertaken in the second half of 2008. As well as looking at the development effectiveness of volunteer programs, the review will assess the demand for volunteers in Pacific island countries and how the contributions of volunteers could be enhanced, including through other models such as the “exchange” concept as recommended in the JSCFADT report on Australia’s aid program in the Pacific.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reports: Government Responses</title>,Committees,28,1,speech
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2008-11-27,"—On behalf of the Chair of the Standing Committee on Economics, Senator Hurley, I present the report of the committee on the provisions of the Corporations Amendment (Short Selling) Bill 2008 together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,28,2,speech
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2008-11-27,"—I think I had uttered one sentence on the matter of the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Emergency Response Consolidation) Bill 2008 before we went to government business at 12.45 pm today. I will continue, but this will not be a long contribution.
The amendments proposed in this bill by the government relate to a number of issues: the viewing of R18+ programming, the transport of prohibited materials through prescribed areas, the status of roadhouses as community stores in some remote communities and the resumption of the permit system. These amendments seek to make changes to the special measures to protect Aboriginal children in the Northern Territory that were introduced by the former coalition government through the Northern Territory National Emergency Response Act 2007 and the Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Northern Territory National Emergency Response and Other Measures) Act 2007.
I want to speak briefly this afternoon about the particular changes the government’s amendments will make to the permit system in the Northern Territory. They will repeal the changes to the permit system that were put in place by the former government in order to give public access to certain Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory. The changes have been in force since February of this year. The government’s amendments will reinstate the permit system for major Aboriginal communities, while enabling the minister to allow access to certain people, such as journalists.
A number of my colleagues in the coalition have spoken already about the negative impact the reinstatement of the permit system will have, particularly on women and children in remote Aboriginal communities, and our concerns in relation to that. I do not think that the seriousness of this impact can be taken lightly, and we certainly do not do so. From some reporting over recent times, it seems that as a result of the intervention—especially the introduction of income management and the rollback of the permit system—after experiencing well-documented abuse and violence and poverty, in some cases, women in remote Aboriginal communities are finally finding their voice and the ability to assert some greater control over their own lives and, consequently, the lives of their children. In fact, this week on Tuesday, 25 November, I was interested to read in the Age newspaper some writing by Russell Skelton on the positive impact the intervention, including the abolition of the permit system, has had on the lives of women through remote areas in the Northern Territory, transferring power—I suppose that would be the word—away from the ‘big men’, as they were described in that article and others, of these communities. Professor Marcia Langton, foundation chair in Australian Indigenous studies at the Melbourne university, has called it ‘big bunga’ politics. That sort of politics has allowed relatively small cliques of very powerful men to assert their control over communities without the sorts of checks and balances that we might expect. There are many reports of the abuse and the violation of process and the disadvantage that have flourished under that, with patronage the decisive factor in the allocation of jobs, of houses, of cars and of other benefits.
The abolition of the permit system by the previous government’s legislation was part of the means of addressing that situation—of shining some light into those areas and on, most importantly, those leaders. It put them in a position where they were not able to avoid the scrutiny of the management of resources in the same way. Now, as should be the case, the leaders in these communities have to account for the way that government funding, particularly, is managed and one would hope, consequently, put the security and the safety of their people and the communities first.
An equally important consequence of this aspect of the previous government’s legislation was to allow a door to open a little further to greater economic development in some of these communities. It seems to me to be logical to contemplate that long-term security and viability of remote and regional communities is absolutely tied to effective development. I cannot see how it is in fact logical to close them off. By abolishing the permit system, amongst other impacts, the former coalition government endeavoured to give the communities a greater chance at economic development. Any decision to reinstate this permit system by this government in such communities would be a disappointing setback to the possibility of this economic development.
That is not just my view or our view in the coalition. There have been a number of reports in this calendar year and more in recent months and weeks about these issues. In the Australian in January this year former president of the Australian Labor Party Mr Warren Mundine said:
If we are looking at building economies in these communities then we need to have a free flow of people to create commercial activities. The permit system didn’t stop crime. In fact, if you look at all of the reports that have come out in the last few years, crime has flourished under the permit system, so it’s a fallacy to say that it helps law-and-order problems. It really embedded these problems because some powerful people were able to get away with things without being watched.
He further said:
If you want to create a real economy you’re going to have to have more commercial activity happening and that happens by allowing people to flow in and out of places.
I think the government would do well to listen to those words and words of others who have raised similar sorts of concerns.
I wanted to make a couple of other comments in relation to economic development and to the potential for benefits that go far beyond the security and prosperity of remote and regional Aboriginal communities. An Access Economics report commissioned by Reconciliation Australia and released in August this year found, in relation to the economic impact of Indigenous disadvantage, that, if the health, educational and economic circumstances of Indigenous Australians improved to match those of the Australian average, ‘government revenue in 2029 would be $4.6 billion higher than otherwise’ and ‘government expenditure in 2029 in key portfolios relevant to Indigenous Australians would be $3.7 billion lower than otherwise’. I do not think a government can afford to be insensitive to those sorts of compelling figures, nor to any step that might help in getting even closer than we currently are.
I began my remarks today on the need to ensure the safety of women and children in remote communities. I want to finish with some brief words about the other changes that the bill will make that could impact negatively on those children the intervention was in fact designed to protect.
The government’s amendments will change the nature of bans on pornographic material in prescribed areas and on the transport of such materials through prescribed areas. In communities where it is reported that children do remain at risk from a range of factors and where there are serious concerns about levels of functionality, there is no reason at this time to be loosening these sorts of restrictions. It seems to me to be a regressive step and one which I regard very seriously.
As has been stated in the other place and by other speakers to this legislation in this chamber, the opposition’s amendments reflect these concerns. I will reiterate those points and will of course call on the government to adopt them. The opposition has called on the government to impose a blanket ban on all pornographic material in prescribed areas and to prohibit the transport of pornographic material through any prescribed areas. We further urge the government to leave in place the permit system amendments, which have enabled greater access to public land.",SENATE,"<title>FAMILIES, HOUSING, COMMUNITY SERVICES AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EMERGENCY RESPONSE CONSOLIDATION) BILL 2008</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2008-11-27,"—I also wish to contribute to the debate on the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Emergency Response Consolidation) Bill 2008, but I want to confine my remarks simply to the permit system, the abolition of which I think was a step in the right direction. The provisions of this bill, which effectively bring back the permit system, are in the worst interests of Indigenous people and indeed of all Australians.
I refer the chamber to the Australian Crime Commission’s report into the abuses that occurred in Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory. The task force chief said as recently as June of this year that the permit system had been put in place to keep wrongdoers out of communities but history had clearly shown that it protected the wrongdoers. Powerful clans and families had manipulated the system to prevent the scrutiny that I and the majority of sensible legislators think is necessary to give these communities, particularly young people in them, a bit of a chance.
It almost seems that governments have been prepared to accept this permit system because it meant that nobody really got in to see what was happening in these remote communities. I ask this question: if the permit system was so amazingly good, how is it that some of the worst prevalence of criminal behaviour in the world has occurred in these prescribed communities, which are hidden behind a veil of silence? There is also a question of basic human rights in relation to the reintroduction of permits. Under the changes proposed by the Labor Party, Indigenous organisations such as land councils will decide who can come and who can go, indicating who Indigenous people can associate with and who they can do business with. The right of free association that other Australians enjoy is going to be denied to Indigenous communities. It seems to me quite contradictory that when the emphasis is on creating proper jobs for Indigenous people, for improving communications and encouraging cottage industries and tourism, that, rather than turning these isolated communities into open communities engaged in commercial enterprises, the permit system puts up the shutters. Nowhere else in Australia would this fundamental denial of the right of association and interaction be tolerated. Yet legislators and bureaucrats in Canberra, the people who always know what is best for Indigenous people, are going to put in place this system that will deny Indigenous people that basic right of association.
Just a few weeks ago I had the pleasure of re-engaging with the Hon. Fred Chaney, who, you will recall, has amongst his many other pursuits an involvement with Reconciliation Australia. We met up while looking at remote desert communities. Mr Chaney is a former—and I think well-regarded by everyone—federal Aboriginal affairs minister. Mr Chaney launched a campaign to draw attention to remote Australia, a region which he described as a failed state awash with dysfunction, violence and illiteracy. Mr Chaney quite perceptively said that, when it came to Indigenous policy, nothing good ever came out of Canberra. I fear that this government legislation is going to again give proof to those prophetic words.
On a different note, I also find it quite offensive that any Australian should be denied the right to go to any other part of Australia. I do not for a moment suggest that anyone should have the right to invade my house and my background—although they do, I might say, but I reject them having that right; it is criminals who do that. Your home is your private castle, and the same is the case for Indigenous people. Certainly their traditional lands, their cultural lands, their homelands, should be protected. But it seems to me offensive that access to roads into a public community and that access to public assets like schools, halls, police stations and shops in these areas should be denied to other Australians. It seems to me that preventing certain people from going to certain parts of Australia that are public property is a way that Australia should not head.
Mr Acting Deputy President, you might recall that, in Mr Brough’s original legislation, there was a distinction made between those public areas and private areas. I urge the government to think very seriously about that and readopt those provisions that Mr Brough inserted. I am searching for my notes which list those. Not being able to put my hand on them, I refer senators to the original list of areas that were addressed in Mr Brough’s legislation.
Under the Brough reforms, permits were no longer required to travel to Aboriginal townships on designated roads. Sacred sites and traditional lands were protected, and access to them was made strictly off-limits. These were the protected lands and sacred sites—traditional lands. But in the run-up to the last election—and I quote the respected journalist Russel Skelton here:
… the ALP campaigned vigorously, and dishonestly, against the reform, saying grog-runners and art carpetbaggers would swamp communities and sacred sites would be trampled on by insensitive and unknowing tourists.
It was, as Mr Skelton pointed out, nonsense but it did win support for the ALP. It is the sort of typical populist mantra that you would run around in an electorate like the Northern Territory. No doubt the Labor Party did that and did it in other parts of Australia and succeeded in that populist promise on the basis of improper facts.
Under the proposed legislation, as I understand it, only journalists, some public servants and police will be exempt. Everybody else will be required to get a permit from an Indigenous organisation in order to go there, although I understand that, under this bill, the minister has power to allow people in. She has already indicated that she will give permission to journalists to enter. If journalists get into these communities by grant of the minister, one wonders how constrained those journalists might be in what they write. It seems to me unclear whether the grant given by the minister will be given to any journalist for any day or whether the approval will be given on a restricted and selective basis. Perhaps the minister, in responding to this speech in the second reading debate, might be able to elaborate on that.
Who else will be able to go into these closed Indigenous communities? I have seen somewhere in my research that political candidates can go in. Isn’t that lovely? No other Australian has the right to go there, but if you happen to be running for a political party then, sure, that is all right—you can slip into the community; you can promise what you like. I am aware of some of the promises that have been made in the Northern Territory by candidates in both federal and state elections. I have to say—putting this as delicately as I can—that some of the promises made by ALP candidates at the state and federal levels have been very ‘puffed’, if I can say that in polite-ish sort of way. No other Australian can get there. They cannot go to these communities, but political candidates can. Tell me the sense in that.
The whole purpose of this legislation was to address the evils that we became aware of a few years ago. According to the head of the Northern Territory Police Association, there is no evidence that the permit system hinders illegal behaviour. He is quoted as saying:
The permit system does not stop grog-running or sexual assault. It did not stop these things in the past; it will not stop them in the future. These are policing issues unrelated to the permit system.
Quite frankly, there is no moral, legal or other justification for imposing this permit system on these parts of Australia. Others in this debate have quoted—and the figures are readily available—that:
… grog smuggling is largely conducted by indigenous men who live in the dry communities and not by outsiders. If there has been a fall in the incidence of grog smuggling, and that is questionable, it is because there are more police on the ground to enforce bans.
Police and authorities directly involved have said this on a number of occasions. Plainly, the grog-running problem is a problem not about outsiders but about insiders.
I think a lot of the bill is fatally flawed, especially that part dealing with permits. The original system of doing away with the permits was made to ensure that normal interactions of society can occur, including external scrutiny. It would allow individual Aboriginal people to engage with and benefit from a market economy without the hindrance of someone else telling them who they can deal with and who can come into their communities and cut a deal with them. It would distinguish, under the Brough legislation, between communal or public space and private space on Aboriginal land.
That is the same as it is in the community I live in in rural North Queensland. There is a public area, such as roads, parks and shopping centres, where anyone can go and then there is my private area—my house and my yard. Nobody is allowed there unless I invite them. The legislation as it now stands, which this legislation is now trying to overturn, ensures open access to public space, including townships and related roads. The legislation as it now stands protects the privacy of those private spaces, including residences and most Aboriginal land. It respects Aboriginal culture on traditional lands, particularly through the support it gives to the protection of sacred sites and ceremonies. The legislation as it currently stands, which this bill is trying to alter, continues to allow for effective land management by Aboriginal groups. It was to be simple to administer, preferably by government, to ensure transparency and accountability.
I conclude by simply asking again: if the permit system is so good, why have we become aware of so much trouble there in recent years? That alone would seem to me to suggest that we should try anything else. I urge the Labor Party, the Greens and the crossbenchers to understand the failures of the past. We should not fall into the same old trap of thinking that we in Canberra know what is best for Indigenous people. We have to understand Indigenous traditions, as we understand the Scottish traditions of my ancestors. My ancestors used to wear funny skirts around their waists, instead of manly trousers, until they were cleared from the Highlands by those horrible English all those centuries ago. But I and the rest of modern society have moved on. I no longer wear a skirt—well, only occasionally, and with St Andrew’s Day coming up if I can borrow one I might wear a kilt—but it is something you do on traditional occasions. Nobody can ever take that from me and I am not suggesting that that should happen to any people, most particularly Indigenous people.
You cannot live in the past. You have to accept that the world moves on. We live in an age of being able to get from Sydney to London in 18 hours on a regular commercial aeroplane these days. Life has moved on. Technology has moved on. Science has moved on. We have all benefited from that. When I say we have all benefited from that, I mean we on the outside have benefited from it. I cannot see that Indigenous people have shared too much in the benefits of science and good fortune and wealth that the rest of Australia has seen. What we have done in the past has not proved to have been very good. It has been done with the very best of intentions by those doing it, but it simply has not worked.
I had a conversation just recently with Mr Mundine and the Bishop of the Northern Territory about the fact that we are doing the wrong thing if we are trying to quarantine Indigenous people from modern life and all the benefits it can give them. Indeed, the retrograde bill before us, which puts back into place a permit system which will lock up the problems that we all know are there, is just wrong. I plead with the Labor Party and the crossbenchers and the Greens not to allow this bill to proceed but to go back to a system which will allow Indigenous people to be part of the world in which we all live.",SENATE,"<title>FAMILIES, HOUSING, COMMUNITY SERVICES AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EMERGENCY RESPONSE CONSOLIDATION) BILL 2008</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2008-11-27,"—Just over a year ago, both Labor and the coalition agreed to put in place a range of emergency measures in response to the problems of child sexual abuse confirmed in the Little children are sacred report. The legislation was a sweeping and far-reaching response to a terrible problem and it went more broadly to addressing Aboriginal disadvantage. It relied on a momentum powered by widespread revulsion across the Australian community at numerous cases of child abuse. The Little children are sacred report found evidence of child sexual abuse in every one of the 45 communities visited. Indigenous people in the Northern Territory, particularly children, deserve better. They deserve a life that is free from child abuse and free of alcohol abuse and illegal drugs—a life that offers hope of an escape from poverty through good education, health care and housing.
Last year the Senate agreed the situation in the Northern Territory was an emergency and passed legislation that was a radical change in policy direction and that would have long-term implications for Aboriginal people and their communities. The concern last year, when the emergency response measures were about to be put in place, was that the measures would alienate some Aboriginal people and increase the gulf between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. However, Family First came to the conclusion—and still believes—that we should not and must not leave things as they were when children were at risk from abuse. That is the reason Family First supported the previous government’s sweeping and far-reaching proposals for change.
A key part of the emergency response involved removing the permit system so that visitors to the communities would not have to obtain a permit. It was removed as part of the previous government’s national Indigenous emergency intervention to stop child abuse in remote communities. How disappointing, then, that the Rudd government has failed to fully remove the permit system, potentially leaving children’s lives at risk. In February this year the requirement for permits to visit 73 Indigenous townships was abolished, but the government did not remove all the permits on the access roads. Therefore, no-one can use the access roads to get to the communities. Unless you fly in or go by boat, you cannot get to many of those communities. How can we judge whether the parliament’s decision last year to remove permits has worked or not, when some access restrictions remain?
Many in the parliament have argued over the last few months that the permit system effectively shuts off Indigenous communities and creates barriers between Australians. Again I say: how do we know that this is the case? We do not, because the Rudd government was unwilling to test it thoroughly. For those of us who are considering the permit system, that decision has robbed us of an informed choice, because the information coming from this trial is flawed.
I have seen firsthand the challenges facing Indigenous communities, including the deeply entrenched problems of alcohol abuse and child abuse, and the hopelessness that many of these people feel. It was shocking and profoundly sad—particularly the stories of children who have been caught up in domestic disputes fuelled by alcohol and subjected to horrific sexual abuse. However, alcohol is a huge problem not just in the Northern Territory but right across Australia. In the Northern Territory, nearly every conversation ends up being about grog. Australia has a huge drinking problem in the broader community, but what I saw in the Aboriginal community is much worse. The sheer acceptance of the alcohol problem by most people in Aboriginal communities is staggering. It seems to me that this is ‘just the way it is’. The term ‘dry community’ seems farcical when, outside the gates of these communities, you see dozens of empty tinnies littering the entrance as you drive in.
The enormity of the problems I saw was overwhelming. The Aboriginal people and the welfare workers who are trying to make a difference all sounded tired and worn out. People told me government departments were part of the problem because of the lack of care, lack of action and lack of funds. It is horrifying to contemplate that the next generation is already being condemned to an endless cycle of abuse. It is shameful that this exists in our country and that we have allowed it to happen. I believe this is an issue that affects all Australians. When our Prime Minister said sorry to Indigenous Australians, it began the process of healing the long years of pain between white and Aboriginal Australians. But, since then, not enough has happened. Children are still at risk from abuse and exposure to pornography and alcohol. Poverty remains an issue. Violence and despair are a way of life.
Will the Prime Minister be apologising to these communities in years to come when abuse and violence continue to fester? I do not want to give the impression that governments are responsible for everything. Clearly, Aboriginal people and their communities have to bear some responsibility too, but they need a helping hand. With the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Emergency Response Consolidation) Bill 2008, the Rudd government wants to make changes to the emergency response measures generally agreed to last year. The changes the Rudd government wants to make are as follows: schedule 1 to the bill restricts R-rated material on pay TV to 35 per cent of programming; schedule 2 allows pornographic material to be transported through communities; schedule 3 reintroduces access restrictions to communities by way of permits; and schedule 4 allows certain roadhouses to be deemed as ‘community stores’ and be subject to the same licensing standards as community stores.
Given the serious issue of abuse within communities, as highlighted in the Little children are sacred report, I am staggered that the Rudd government would start with schedule 1, which basically says it is okay to allow up to 35 per cent of programming on pay television to be R rated and beamed into communities that are grappling with addressing child abuse. It also seems crazy that the government would then have schedule 2, which removes the existing restrictions that prohibit the transport of pornographic material across communities. Is this really a priority?
Schedule 3 reintroduces the permit system. Family First was aware that, when the permit system was removed last year, it would be of concern to some Indigenous people. But Family First was of the view that towns should be public areas. Family First believes that permits isolate some Australian communities by saying that only some people can enter. Permits have not protected communities from child abuse, alcohol or drugs. Family First is happy for the Senate to reconsider the permit system but believes it is too early to make any decision to reintroduce permits at this stage. Schedule 4 allows certain roadhouses to be deemed as ‘community stores’. Family First can see merit in this proposal as it will provide more locations where people can get access to the services that are provided through licensed community stores.
Family First believes we should not allow the broadcasting of pornography into communities that are already riddled with cases of child abuse. This fails to properly tackle this terrible problem. We already know that pornography is a real concern for communities. Judy Atkinson, the Head of the College of Indigenous Australian Peoples at Southern Cross University, said that Aboriginal communities are ‘saturated with pornography’. She said she had seen ‘uncles watching hardcore, violent pornographic movies while three- and four-year-olds in nappies played in the dust at their feet’.
Family First remains convinced that permits isolate some Aboriginal communities and simply build barriers between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians—barriers that we should all be working towards removing. Family First is not convinced that reintroducing the permit system will protect Indigenous communities from child abuse, alcohol or drugs. Family First cannot support this bill.",SENATE,"<title>FAMILIES, HOUSING, COMMUNITY SERVICES AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EMERGENCY RESPONSE CONSOLIDATION) BILL 2008</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2008-11-27,"—The Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Emergency Response Consolidation) Bill 2008 makes amendments that consolidate the legislative framework for the Northern Territory emergency response, which was enacted last year. Notably, it delivers on the government’s election commitment relating to the permit system for major communities in the Northern Territory and extends the pornography measures previously enacted.
In summing up the second reading debate on the bill, I would like to thank all senators for their contribution on this important legislation. In particular, I would like to acknowledge the contribution from the crossbenchers. Senator Siewert raised the important issue of the application of the Racial Discrimination Act. This government is firmly committed to the Racial Discrimination Act and will not make any laws that are inconsistent with the principles of that act. That is why we have carefully crafted this bill to ensure that there are no new provisions which exclude the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act. The independent review board considered the issue of the application of this act in the review of the Northern Territory emergency response measures. The government takes the view that the NTER will not achieve robust, long-term outcomes if measures do not conform with the Racial Discrimination Act. The minister has announced that legislative amendments to bring existing NTER legislation within the scope of the Racial Discrimination Act will be introduced in the spring parliamentary session next year.
Senator Siewert sought assurances from the government about the use of ministerial authorisation to allow classes of persons access to Aboriginal land without a permit. The ministerial authorisation provision was inserted by the previous government and is refined by the bill now before the Senate. The minister intends to use the power to allow journalists access to major communities without a permit to report on events. The Department of Family, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs has consulted with the land councils on the wording and the nature of the ministerial authorisation allowing journalists access. These consultations have included the land councils and the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance. I can convey to Senator Siewert that the minister has committed to consulting appropriately in the event that future ministerial authorisations are made. These consultations will, of course, include talking to the land councils.
Thank you, also, to Senator Xenophon and Senator Fielding for their contributions. I acknowledge the extensive workload that these senators are undertaking on the consideration of critical public policy issues. In response to Senator Xenophon’s request for more time to consider these critical issues, the government agreed to delay the detailed committee stage of the bill so that the senator could fully consider the important legislation we are putting forward. I also want to acknowledge the constructive discussions that have been held with Senator Fielding on the issues raised in this legislation. We now call on Senator Xenophon and Senator Fielding to make the right decision based on the practical importance of this legislation for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory.
Before summing up the bill in detail, I would like to specifically address comments from the Liberal opposition about the permit system and the trafficking of alcohol into communities. Media reports that the permit system does not prevent alcohol entering prescribed areas are misconceived. It has been suggested that permits are unnecessary because most alcohol is brought into prescribed areas by Aboriginal people. This shows a misunderstanding of the permit system. Senators opposite may not realise that the permit system can operate to exclude Aboriginal people who are not traditional people from an area in appropriate circumstances.
The Northern Territory Police Association has stated that the permit system does play an important role in policing these communities and keeping out grog and drug runners. The government recognises that permits are only one tool in the fight against grog running. More police are also essential to keep out the alcohol and drug runners. That is why we are putting more police into remote communities to address the rivers of grog described in the Little children are sacred report.
The Liberal opposition has muddied the waters on the important issue of combating substance abuse. The previous government introduced amendments to abolish the requirement for people to seek permits prior to visiting alcohol communities. The current government, however, does not think these amendments contribute to the emergency response. In the view of this government, Indigenous people should, like other Australians, be able to decide who can enter their land. This bill honours our election commitment—let me re-emphasise that: this bill honours our election commitment—to revoke the public access permit changes introduced by the previous government. As part of this measure, the bill will clarify the power of the minister to authorise people to enter Aboriginal land. When the bill is passed, the government will make sure that journalists are able to enter communities for the purposes of reporting on events in those communities. This will be achieved by means of ministerial authorisation.
The permit changes in the bill before the Senate include in the legislation an explicit reference that the minister may not authorise entry to a sacred site under the ministerial authorisation power. This flows from a suggestion made by the Australian Greens during the inquiry into the bill by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs—a suggestion with which the government has agreed. Similarly, the government has agreed to a request from the Northern Territory government to extend to candidates for local government elections the existing exemption from permit requirements for candidates for federal and Northern Territory Legislative Assembly elections.
Last year’s major legislation included prohibitions on the possession, control and supply in prescribed areas of certain pornographic material. To address a further area of concern expressed by Aboriginal people in the Little children are sacred report about R-rated material available through pay television subscription, this bill makes further amendments that are in addition to the provisions enacted by the previous government in 2007. The X- and R-rated pornography bans introduced by the former government remain firmly in place. This bill extends the former government’s measures to pay TV R-rated material. It does not usurp or replace them.
The Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and the Northern Territory National Emergency Response Act 2007 are being amended to establish a new class licence condition for subscription television narrowcasting service licences. The new condition will prevent these licensees from providing subscribers in a community declared by the Indigenous affairs minister with access to a subscription television narrowcasting service declared by the communications minister. So that services like the pay TV World Movies channel can continue, services cannot be declared unless they transmit more than 35 per cent of R18+ program hours over a seven-day period.
A community cannot have its access to the television service restricted unless it is in a prescribed area under the Northern Territory National Emergency Response Act 2007. Also, the restriction will depend on the Indigenous affairs minister being satisfied, following consultation, that the restriction is appropriate. A restriction can be requested by any one person in a community or on behalf of any one person. Community agreement is not required and the minister makes a decision having regard to the wellbeing of women and children. Consistent with the pornography amendments already made to the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995, the new arrangement will include a five-year sunset provision.
The R-rated pay television provisions in this bill now include minor workability improvements recommended by the industry and raised by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. The provisions, as presented to the Senate, cut red tape by allowing industry to self-declare an R-rated service and improve the record-keeping requirements. The alcohol bans under the emergency response make allowance for alcohol to be transported through a prescribed area to a destination outside the area. For greater consistency with the alcohol bans, this bill will amend the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 to allow prohibited pornographic material to be transported through a prescribed area to a destination outside the prescribed area; thus, industry members conducting their business will be able to transport goods lawfully to areas that are not prescribed. This will mirror the existing alcohol related provisions.
Lastly, the bill will make sure that if a roadhouse effectively takes the place of a community store in a remote area, it can be properly treated as a community store in having to meet the new licensing standards introduced last year. The new community store’s licensing regime is intended to ensure that community stores meet minimum standards and also gives assurance that stores have the capacity to participate in income management. When a community substantially relies on a roadhouse for grocery items and drinks, the roadhouse should be able to be part of the scheme applying to community stores. In other cases, roadhouses will continue not to be regarded as community stores.
As the government has made very clear, we are committed to closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians on life expectancy, educational achievement and employment opportunities. The government is keen to work in partnership with Indigenous communities and the Northern Territory government to tackle the problems of child abuse and improve the prospects of Indigenous children and their families. We are also committed to an evidence based policy. We have now had the report from the independent review of the Northern Territory emergency response. The review board found that the emergency response is making some important progress. To name a few important achievements: families in remote communities report feeling safer because of the increased police presence; there is a reduction in alcohol consumption and there are additional night patrols and safe houses; women say that income management means that they can buy essentials for their children such as food and clothes; school nutrition programs are running, and child health check-ups and follow-ups are being conducted.
The existing legislation for the Northern Territory emergency response contains provisions for income management, changes to land and housing arrangements and changes improving law and order and the safety and wellbeing of children and their families. The legislation also contains provisions which deem the measures to be ‘special measures’ and exclude them from the operation of part II of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. Given our commitment to maintaining the overall direction of the emergency response and to focus on effective implementation, the bill contains some amendments to existing measures which continue to be covered by the operation of the racial discrimination provisions in the legislation for the Northern Territory emergency response. Importantly, the bill contains no new provisions which exclude the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act. The new R18+ measures have been designed as special measures and do not have a provision excluding the operation of part II of the Racial Discrimination Act. The government intends, in the spring 2009 sittings of the parliament, to introduce legislation to lift the RDA suspension. I thank senators for their contribution.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2008-11-27,"—I rise tonight to support the Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 5) Bill 2008. Like many of the TLABs that come before the Senate, this bill contains a number of unrelated schedules that make minor amendments to taxation law with the intent of improving the operation of the Australian tax system. The bill has five schedules, and I will deal briefly with each schedule.
Schedule 1 is an integrity measure that seeks to amend the 1999 GST act by making changes to the GST margin scheme to prevent entities manipulating their affairs so as to reduce their GST liability. Like a number of schedules in TLABs that have come before the Senate this year, this schedule is based on the work undertaken by the previous coalition government. I will briefly discuss the background to this schedule. The measures addressing the GST margin scheme were initially announced in 2005 as part of the Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 2) Bill 2005. That bill proposed amendments to the GST margin scheme which the former Treasurer announced on budget night in May 2005 in Budget Paper No. 3. The coalition, after the announcement, embarked on extensive and widespread consultation regarding the changes. Following consultation, on 7 June 2005, the then Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, the Hon. Mal Brough, foreshadowed amendments to the bill and the coalition government deferred the tax integrity measure so that there could be further consultation. The consultations continued after the change of government, leading to the amendments seen in the bill that we are debating today. The point is, of course, that this has had a very long gestation.
The GST margin scheme essentially allows for the GST on certain taxable supplies of real property to be calculated on the margin—the margin being the difference between the purchase price and the sale price. The first aspect of schedule 1 ensures that, where the margin scheme is applied to real property that was previously acquired on a GST-free basis, the value added by the entity that made the GST-free sale is included in calculating the GST payable under the margin scheme. This ensures that the rules are brought back into line with the original intent of the legislation. The second aspect of schedule 1 ensures that the eligibility to use the margin scheme cannot be reinstated by interposing a GST or non-taxable sale. The third aspect of the schedule strengthens general anti-avoidance provisions for schemes that are entered into with the sole or dominant purpose of gaining a GST benefit. According to the explanatory memorandum, schedule 1 is expected to have a positive impact on revenue collections of $523 million over the forward estimates.
Schedule 2 is a noncontroversial schedule that amends accounting standards in relation to the thin capitalisation regime. Specifically, it modifies the accounting treatment of specified assets and liabilities in relation to thin cap provisions. This amendment was necessary because of the adoption of the Australian equivalents of international accounting standards in 2005.
Schedule 3 is another noncontroversial schedule that extends an exemption from interest withholding tax for state and territory government bonds. This schedule amends section 128F of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and is expected to see a reduction of $64 million in revenue over the forward estimates.
Schedule 4 is also a noncontroversial schedule that makes changes to the fringe benefits tax treatment of jointly-held benefits. In National Australia Bank Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation, the court held that an employer could reduce the entire taxable value of a fringe benefit provided jointly to an employee and third party—typically their partner—in relation to an income-generating asset. This was a significant departure from the generally held tax principles of income and deductions. Schedule 4 seeks to address this anomaly by requiring an employer to adjust the taxable value of the fringe benefit according to the proportion of the jointly-held asset that the employee owns. This schedule is expected to deliver a revenue-positive amount of $49 million over the forward estimates.
The last schedule in this bill, schedule 5, amends division 6C of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to change the eligible investment business rules for managed investment funds. This is likely to be an interim measure. The measures in this schedule, subject to certain conditions, include a definition of the term ‘investing in land’ to include fixtures, chattels and moveable property. The schedule also expands the range of financial instruments in which a managed investment trust can invest from the current specified instruments that are listed in division 6C. The schedule also introduces the following safe harbours: a two per cent safe harbour for non-trading income set at a whole-of-trust level and a 25 per cent safe harbour for non-rental, non-trading income from investments in land for public unit trusts investing in land for the purpose of deriving rent.
This bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics for inquiry and recommendation. The committee received six submissions and also held a public hearing in Canberra on 28 October 2008. And I should record my thanks to the committee for their usual diligence and good work—with, I must say, an enormous workload in looking at many bills. During this inquiry, only schedule 1 attracted any significant criticism, which was why I spent a little more time on it earlier in my remarks. The committee, likewise, also paid attention to the detail of schedule 1 in its report.
The Urban Development Institute of Australia and the Property Council of Australia both expressed concern that the proposed legislation would act as ‘an increased tax on new housing developments’, thus ultimately being passed on to the home buyer. Treasury, however, disagreed and suggested that groups like the Urban Development Institute of Australia and the Property Council of Australia had overstated the effect that the proposed changes would have on house prices and housing supply. Interestingly, the committee’s view of this was:
The committee agreed with the Treasury that the proposed changes to the legislation would not have a significant impact on the cost of housing. The measures—
in schedule 1—
only affected a very small proportion of the housing market. Moreover, only a proportion of the cost would be passed onto homebuyers, with some passed back to the suppliers of land and some borne by the property development sector in reduced profits.
So, obviously, I have put some weight on the committee’s finding. It was the recommendation of the committee that the Senate support the bill, and that is a view that I share. Again, on behalf of the coalition, I indicate our support for this bill.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 5) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2008-11-27,"—I think Senator Coonan has outlined very clearly the schedules involved in the Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 5) Bill 2008. Indeed, as Senator Coonan said, the Senate Standing Committee on Economics spent most time looking at schedule 1, which was the subject of the submissions to our committee. Schedule 1 seeks to amend the GST act—A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999—to overcome tax minimisation involving the use of the margin scheme and the sale of real property as a tax integrity measure. There is no suggestion that people have been acting illegally in the past, but there was concern that it might have become an avoidance measure under the act. This schedule seeks to align the antiavoidance provisions in the GST act with the antiavoidance provisions in part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act.
This arose because special rules existed for real property that allowed taxpayers an alternative means of calculating GST. These rules became known as the margin scheme. The margin scheme was generally used for new residential property developments. The example was given that party A, a GST registered party, sold land under the margin scheme to party B, a GST registered property developer. Party B began construction on new residential premises on the land and then sold to a third party as a GST-free going concern. The third party then completed the construction and sold to the consumer. In this case, the only GST collected from the transactions between A, B and C and the final consumer left a loophole where no GST was paid in the interim period. That had some justification, I think, because the example used was where farmers, for example, developed land to a certain stage and then on sold it. There was no suggestion that the farmer as a going business should pay GST on the partly developed land, but there was a concern that it had developed into an avoidance provision.
There was then the concern, as Senator Coonan mentioned, that the measure to close the loophole might add to the cost of housing property. Of course, at this particular time, this is a great concern. So the committee did consider this in detail. The committee did accept the Treasury’s position that it would not cause a significant increase in property prices. The ABS data of building activity in Australia indicates that only 1.5 per cent of all residential property sales will be affected by the amendment, thus counteracting any concerns as to housing affordability. So there would be a minimal impact on house prices from this measure. It will ensure a level playing field for those in the property industry; whereas, under the current scheme, there may be an opportunity for above normal profits for certain property developers. The committee agreed that this measure overcame an anomaly in the GST act. The financial impact of the proposed change will be a total of $523 million over the next four years. This is within the context of the total taxable value of new residential property, which is estimated at least $120 billion over four years. I think this small proportion of properties that would be affected allayed the committee’s concerns about any impact on housing prices arising out of this measure.
The other schedule which attracted some interest from submissions was schedule 3, which seeks to extend the interest withholding tax exemption to state and territory government bonds to bring about a better functioning state and territory bond market. This was strongly supported by two submissions and does indeed allow state and territory governments to have a better functioning bond market. The main concerns of the state central borrowing authorities were that the current arrangement segments the market, reduces liquidity and efficiency for the state markets and causes some hampering of the role of the state bond market. The extension of the eligibility for the interest withholding tax to domestically issued state government bonds was welcomed by operators within that market and, so I understand, state governments. I commend this bill to the Senate and am pleased to support all the schedules contained within it.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 5) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2008-11-27,"—I thank all honourable senators who have made a contribution to this debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 5) Bill 2008. The GST and sale of real property measure was announced in the 2008-09 budget. This measure will ensure that the GST law is consistent with the policy intent that GST applies to value added to real property by registered entities from 1 July 2000. The bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics. The committee reported on 10 November 2008 and recommended that the bill be passed by the Senate.
The committee agreed that the proposed GST and real property amendments would not have a significant impact on the cost of housing. Further, the committee noted that if the amendments did not proceed there was a risk that property development transactions would be structured in a way that would give rise to a significant and inequitable loss of GST revenue. The GST and real property measure is an important integrity measure that will ensure that the appropriate amount of GST is collected on sales of real property. The changes will only apply prospectively from the date of royal assent so as not to impact on existing contractual arrangements.
Schedule 2 modifies the thin capitalisation rules to allow entities, when identifying and valuing assets and liabilities for thin capitalisation purposes, to depart in certain circumstances from the treatment provided by Australian accounting standards. The amendments are necessary to adjust for certain impacts of the adoption of Australian equivalents of the International Financial Reporting Standards on the thin capitalisation position of complying entities.
Schedule 3 makes bonds issued in Australia by state and territory central borrowing authorities eligible for exemption from interest withholding tax. This amendment will result in the states and territories being able to bring their offshore bond issuances onshore, unifying their issuances into one pool of funds, and improving depth and liquidity in the market. This should lead to a lower cost of capital and financing costs for the states and territories and aid in easing some of the pressures currently facing the Commonwealth government securities market.
Schedule 4 rectifies an anomaly in the fringe benefits tax law to ensure that fringe benefits associated with jointly held investment assets are calculated appropriately. Under certain salary sacrificing arrangements, associates of employees can receive a share of a fringe benefit made available to an employee. The current anomaly is that the associate’s share of the fringe benefit may often not be considered in the calculation of fringe benefits tax. As a result of these changes the fringe benefits tax law will now recognise the benefit being provided to associates of employees who hold investment assets jointly with the employees. The measure will have effect from 7.30 pm Australian Eastern Standard Time on 13 May 2008. However, there will be a transitional period for employees who have already entered into salary sacrificing arrangements with their employer. Arrangements that were put in place prior to announcement in this year’s budget will be able to continue under the existing law until 1 April 2009—that is, the end of the current FBT year. This will provide time for employers and employees to adjust salary packages as appropriate for those private arrangements.
Schedule 5 implements amendments to the eligible investment business rules for managed funds contained in division 6C of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. These amendments were designed following extensive consultation with the managed funds industry and with professional bodies. The safe harbours address industry concern with the operation of division 6C by making it easier for managed funds to comply with the eligible investment business rules. The amendments reduce the scope for funds to breach these rules inadvertently, thus lowering their compliance costs.
These amendments are part of the government’s plan to make Australia a financial services hub in the Asia-Pacific region. To date, the government has taken action on a number of fronts to further this objective, including reducing the level of withholding tax on distributions from Australian managed funds to non-resident investors. The government has also asked the Board of Taxation to review the taxation arrangements applying to managed investment funds. The board is due to report to government by the middle of 2009. These amendments are an initial reform, pending the outcome of the board’s review. I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2008-11-27,"—The Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to introduce the education tax refund. The education tax refund will provide a 50 per cent refundable tax offset for eligible education expenses up to a maximum of $750 for children undertaking primary education studies and $1,500 for children undertaking secondary education studies. The coalition will support this bill.
The education tax refund is a budget measure which has its origins in a 2007 Labor Party election policy. The education tax refund will apply to eligible expenses incurred from 1 July 2008 and will therefore be claimable from 1 July 2009. Eligible expenses for the education tax refund include the purchase, lease or hire-purchase of computers and computer related equipment, computer software, home internet connections, school textbooks and other paper based school learning material, and prescribed tools of trade.

Senator Parry interjecting—

—I may get to that shortly, Senator Parry. The government is right to be concerned about primary and secondary education in this country. I have little doubt about the sincerity of the Minister for Education, Ms Gillard, and indeed the minister representing her in the Senate, my good friend Senator Carr. They are right to say that the challenges that face us are large. And while the detail is still sketchy, I am pleased to note the new approach to schools and teaching outlined recently by Ms Gillard. Standards, accountability and transparency are goals very well worth pursuing. I wish the minister luck and I hope that she will not be hindered in pursuing these reforms by recalcitrant teaching unions, as the Howard government sadly was.
The Chief Executive of News Corporation, Mr Murdoch, said in his recent Boyer Lecture that education in this country is not a pretty picture. He said:
The unvarnished truth is that in countries such as Australia, Britain, and particularly the United States, our public education systems are a disgrace. Despite spending more and more money, our children seem to be learning less and less—especially for those who are most vulnerable in our society.
Mr Murdoch’s views are supported by research conducted by the Australian National University. This research published early this year found that despite per child spending on education having increased substantially since the 1960s, literacy and numeracy performance among Australian students is no better now than it was back in the 1960s and the 1970s.

Senator Conroy interjecting—

—The finding that the literacy and numeracy of Australian students has not improved since the 1960s truly is a disgrace. Mr Murdoch is right about that. This is not a partisan point, Senator Conroy. This is a point that goes not so much to federal governments but also to state governments. The fact that there has been this extra expenditure by state and federal governments and no increase in literacy and numeracy is a disgrace. Moreover, Mr Murdoch concludes:
… a public school system that does not serve the least of society betrays its mission. The failure of these schools is more than a waste of human promise, and a drain on our future workforce. It is a moral scandal that no one should tolerate. A basic education—and the hope for a better life that it brings—ought to be the first civil right of any decent society.
It is all very well to talk about equality but schools must also be held accountable. I was very lucky and had a good education and indeed I think most people here did as well. But it is always the children of the disadvantaged that suffer the most and have fewer options than the elite because of poor education. As Mr Murdoch points out, it is not that the poor are getting poorer; it is that the economic rewards to the skilled and the educated are making them much richer. Certainly the Senate Standing Committee on Economics and their report on this bill unanimously agreed with that and said:
Cross-country comparisons of economic growth generally suggest that increasing education is beneficial for the economy (in addition to its other merits) …
It is not only the interests of the individual students and their families that benefit from this program but society much more generally. I have always thought that education is more than simply an economic good. It promotes civility, it appreciates complexity and it provides those with an education a critical capacity and a sense of perspective and of proportion. These are all things that I am sure you would agree were perhaps lacking seriously in the 20th century.
The coalition supports this bill because it does provide some relief to parents in relation to certain education expenses. But we believe that the bill could have been improved by more fully promoting choice and promoting flexibility.
The government’s proposal centres on information and communications technology. While important perhaps—and we concede that—these expenses are not necessarily the most important faced by parents. Parents should have greater flexibility to make choices about the sorts of expenses they can claim under the education tax refund. For example, for many low-income families their greatest priority is not securing a computer or internet access but getting uniforms and paying the costs of excursions and school camps. Many parents might believe that their refund would be better spent on these more immediate priorities.
While the government has said much about early childhood education and has even devoted a member of the executive with a special responsibility for early childhood education, the opposition also notes that education expenses in relation to preschool education are not eligible for the education tax refund. Again, parents might believe their child would benefit from assistance with these expenses more than with the narrower opportunities provided pursuant to this bill.
Perhaps the most fundamental problem with this bill is that, whereas the government is keen to assist parents in ICT related matters, that assistance will only go so far. We now know that the cost of computers, for example, is only about one-fifth of the total cost of operating them. We now know that the Rudd government has grossly underbudgeted its digital education revolution by failing to take into account those one-off and ongoing costs connected with the installation and maintenance of computers. We also now know after exhaustive sessions in Senate estimates, from public stoushes between the federal government and state Labor governments, including former New South Wales Treasurer Mr Costa’s infamous attempt to extort money from the Commonwealth government, as well as documents available under FOI, that state governments have refused to pick up the tab and pay the costs of implementing federal Labor’s election promises. And who can blame them?
The Labor government has promised to deliver computers to the one million year 9 to 12 secondary students in this country. They have budgeted $1,000 for the capital costs of each computer and all the associated costs such as internet connection, software, computer support, upgrade and electrical wiring, storage, insurance and so on. Everyone now knows that even if each laptop only costs $500—and that is a very low and a very generous estimate—based on the one to four ratio I mentioned earlier, all the additional one-off and ongoing costs will be at least $2,000 on top of that. So $1,500 has not been budgeted for.
Just tonight, very cunningly, at five to five this evening, in response to a question on notice I had asked at Senate estimates about the Commonwealth’s estimates of the ongoing costs of computers—guess what? The final report entitled Review of legitimate and additional financial implications of the national secondary school computer fund was released. I might add that it is dated 3 September 2008. So it has been sitting on the desk of the Deputy Prime Minister and education minister, Ms Gillard, since 3 September. Now we have it, nearly three months later.
I quote from the top of page 7: ‘The Commonwealth’s review has determined that a reasonable overall estimate of the cost of deploying each additional computer is $2,500 over four years.’ So, after all the horror, all the tempestuous behaviour at estimates, in the end the government finally conceded that the $1,000 they budgeted for is $1,500 under budget per computer. Multiply that by a million computers—my maths is not very good, but that is about $1.5 billion.
But I also learnt something very interesting a bit after five o’clock this evening. The government proposes to give $800 million to the state governments at the COAG meeting on the weekend to help pay for this, so there is another $800 million that has not been looked at in the forward estimates that will also be added to the budget deficit—$800 million at least—and the government itself says that will not be enough. So we are really looking at an extended budget deficit probably in excess of another billion dollars. It is a huge turnaround, but at least, after making an election promise in November last year, the government has at long last—12 months later—finally released some estimates to the public. The government is pretty generous to itself; they are very low estimates, but even the government has said $2½ thousand. On page 27 of the report, we see the estimates that the states believe and they are nearly always between roughly $4½ thousand and $5,000, which is roughly twice the estimate of the Commonwealth government. But, even if we take the Commonwealth government’s very, very low estimates, it is still $1½ billion underbudgeted. We will no doubt hear a lot more about that in the ensuing week.
The New South Wales Labor government have said that they will not pay the difference and they will not take any more computers until the federal government accepts the expenses and commits to footing the bill. Other governments say the same thing. Whether the $800 million secured for COAG by the Commonwealth government this weekend will satisfy the states, I do not know, but it is another $800 million to the deficit.
Just as with all other initiatives of the Rudd government: voter beware! So it is too with this bill. The refund will cover some but not all the costs of acquiring and running a computer. It is a good start perhaps, but parents should be mindful that it is not a one-stop-shop solution to their educational IT needs at home. The coalition believes that greater flexibility in the sorts of eligible expenses claimable as an education tax refund would be beneficial to parents and students, especially expenses such as school fees. This was the coalition’s policy before the last election, and we believe that such flexibility would greatly enhance the utility of this bill. Still, this bill is a step forward for education in this country, and the opposition will support it.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (EDUCATION REFUND) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,34,1,speech

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2008-11-27,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

I am delighted to rise in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008.
This Bill will be of great benefit to parents across the nation—and it is a Bill that many people have been waiting for over a very considerable time , over 11 years, but of course it falls to us, a Rudd government to deliver it.

About the Bill

This Bill will deliver to parents a refund of 50 per cent of eligible expenses incurred in meeting the costs of their children’s primary or secondary education.
Parents will be entitled to a tax offset of up to $375 per child in primary school and $750 per child in secondary school.
Assuming these amounts aren’t increased this adds up to a saving of $7,125 per child over the course of their schooling.
Some of the equipment for which parents may incur expenses eligible for the Education Tax Refund ( or ETR as it is commonly known) include laptops, home computers, internet access, printers and paper, educational software, school textbooks and prescribed trade tools.
This Bill delivers on the Rudd government pre-election commitment to introduce the ETR and provide some welcome relief for families with schoolchildren.
And of course, every parent wants their child, or children, to have the best opportunities in life - and that means giving them the best education possible.
Providing even the basics for a child’s education involves some financial sacrifice and that can put some strain on the family budget.
This Bill will deliver realistically in the budgets of ordinary, everyday families. It will help to ease some of that burden.
The Rudd Government made this commitment before the last Federal Election because we recognise that you can’t have an Education Revolution without parents being able to meet the basic costs of putting their children through school.
The ETR will be provided to families on the basis of need.
This is why parents will be eligible the Education Tax Refund in respect of children for whom they are also eligible for Family Tax Benefit Part A.
However, there are concessions for certain families that fail to meet the full eligibility for the ETR.
The ETR has been expanded to include these concessions so that its administration is fair and it is applied where it is most needed.
For example, if a parent has a child who receives income support such as Youth Allowance, AUSTUDY or the Disability Support Pension—but would otherwise have been eligible for Family Tax Benefit Part A in respect of that child,
they will still be eligible for the ETR for that child.
Families who share receipt of Family Tax Benefit Part A or have shared care arrangements will share the ETR just as Family Tax Benefit Part A is shared.
If a child enters or leaves school in any year, their parents will be eligible for an amount of the ETR attributable to the half of the financial year that they attended school.
If a student transitions from primary to secondary school during a financial year their parent will be eligible for the ETR based on the secondary school rate.
Parents with home-schooled students will be eligible for the ETR if their child is registered with the relevant state or territory authority.
Students living independently will also be eligible for the ETR.
It is estimated that eligibility for the ETR will extend to 1.3 million families extending to 2.7 million students.
And may I say, one of the great things about this Bill is that it doesn’t matter which school you go to.

Promoting the ETR

I have written to a number of schools in Tasmania advising them of the Rudd Government’s commitment to legislating for the Education Tax Refund.
Some schools have communicated this information to parents through their school newsletters or other means.
I have done this because it is important for parents to be aware of the ETR even before it has been legislated.
I have been urging parents to make sure that they keep receipts for expenses incurred in respect of their children’s schooling in case they are eligible to claim the ETR in their 2008-09 income tax return.
Parents should keep receipts for any expenses incurred after 1 July 2008 for which they think they may be eligible for an Education Tax Refund.
Of course, parents should seek advice from the Tax Office or a registered tax agent if they’re not sure whether they are eligible for the ETR or don’t know what expenses they are entitled to a refund for.
Those eligible to claim the ETR will be able to claim it for the first time in their 2008-09 tax return.
There are some parents eligible for the ETR who will not otherwise be required to lodge a tax return.
For these parents, a simple form will be available from the Tax Office to allow them to claim the ETR without having to complete a tax return.

Importance of the ETR

It is estimated that the Education Tax Refund will cost $4.4 billion over the next four years.
It’s important to remember that when the Prime Minister—then Opposition Leader—announced Labor’s policy of delivering the ETR during the 2007 Federal Election, it was released at the same that we announced our income tax policy.
We were able to fund the ETR by holding off tax cuts that the Coalition had proposed for people earning a taxable income of over $180,000 per year.
It was our view at the time—and it remains our view—that people earning that sort of money are probably doing okay at the moment.
We thought that parents struggling to meet their children’s school expenses are in a bit more need of help.
Of course, we could have just as easily offered a general tax cut to parents of schoolchildren so that they would have had a choice to spend it on whatever they liked.
But the ETR is about more than just assisting parents to meet the expenses of raising school age children.
It’s about providing incentives for parents to invest in their children’s education.
And what better incentive is there than reducing those costs each year by $375 or $750 per child?
A general tax cut could be spent indiscriminately, but some of the constituents who have contacted my office have commented to my office that they are considering purchasing computers for their children’s education if they are eligible for the ETR.
Given the prevalence of information and communications technology in schools nowadays, being able to study on a home computer puts students at a huge advantage.
Of course, there are many other basic expenses that parents could have subsidised by the ETR.
Many public and private schools prescribe specific textbooks for their subjects.
The way the Australian dollar has been performing recently as a result of the global financial crisis means that prescribed textbooks sourced from overseas will now be more expensive than before.
School textbooks will now be more affordable from year to year, as will the large quantities of stationery that parents often have to buy.
As has been the continuing case since the change of government last year the Coalition has yet again criticised a Rudd government initiative.
There have been comments made that the ETR is not broad reaching enough, but let’s consider what would have happened had they been elected.
Not only were they going to retain their tax cuts for people earning over $180,000 a year, … but that were going to add to that an Education Tax Refund that would have cost three times as much as ours.
Of course they only came up with their policy for a tax refund as a direct response to ours.
But faced with a proposal that was so well received by ordinary Australians—one that helped families with schoolchildren meet the costs of living but also gave them some incentive to invest in their children’s education—they reverted to their instinctive response -which is to try and spend their way out of trouble.
Rather than consider how best to target assistance they took a scattergun approach and decided to try and outbid us.
This was a pattern they began in 1998 and it saw them through several elections, so much so that their response to a political crisis became almost involuntary in their response:
Oh! We have a problem with this specific demographic—let’s throw some money to that area—and hopefully this will get us votes.
It was partly because voters were sick of this reckless spending and , of course, they knew they were being misled—that many people decided to vote the Coalition out
It has only been by putting the brakes on reckless spending that the Rudd Labor Government was able to build up a $22 billion surplus, a surplus that was continually attacked and eroded in this place by those opposite.
I would like to know how the Coalition would have responded to the global financial crisis without a decent surplus to use to stimulate economic activity.
They would have had two choices, revert to borrowing for their economic stimulus or ignore the crisis and let the economy suffer.
While Australia’s economy is in a better position than most to withstand the global financial crisis, our position could have been much improved had the previous Government not failed to invest in the drivers of productivity.
And one of the greatest drivers of productivity is education, training and skills development.
That’s why Australia needs an Education Revolution.

The Education Revolution

The Education Tax Refund is an important plank in the Rudd Government’s Education Revolution.
All up the 2008-09 Budget includes $19.3 billion to deliver the Government’s election commitments to education over the next four years.
The Rudd Government has established an Office of Early Childhood Education and Child Care in the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations.
One of the Office’s major roles is to implement our commitment to deliver universal access to 15 hours a week of early childhood education for four-year-old children.
The early years of a child’s life are the most crucial in regard to brain development.
And scientific research points to the critical importance of an appropriate learning environment for very young children.
I cannot emphasize enough how important this fact is.
In fact—the foundation of neural structures in the frontal lobes of the human brain are not fully developed until approximately the age of twenty-four.
This means the brain continually develops, and we know that in order to achieve full potential a child needs interaction in all types of environments, and it is easier to learn new skills and take in knowledge when young as opposed to later in life.
An extra year of early learning could make a huge difference in the educational attainment of Australia’s children.
The Rudd government focus is revolutionary.
It starts with very young children and if we want to look for the areas of greatest disregard by those responsible for education during the Howard years, then this is where we begin —because there has been many OECD surveys pointing to the shameful underperformance of Australia when it comes to investing in the early years of education.
Let’s remember that in 2006 Australia was ranked 25th out of 26 countries on the OECD indicator looking at the proportion of students enrolled in pre -primary education—hardly a ranking to be proud of, in fact members of the Howard Government should hang their heads in shame.
Let’s also remember, there was a comprehensive failure by the Howard government to invest in the professional training of those who care for very young children.
That is an area where the education revolution is being focused: on investing in the qualifications of those who care for our very important young people.
The Rudd Government believes it important for students to develop the basics in education and we want a focus on skills in literacy and numeracy.
The Government’s National Action Plan on Literacy and Numeracy targets the students who need it most and includes funding specifically targeted at Indigenous students.
Another important initiative is the development of a National Curriculum, which will ensure that there is consistency across states and territories in what students learn.
One of the advantages of the National Curriculum will be that students can move across state borders and continue their education where they left off with minimal disruption.
It will also help to develop more comparable university entrance criteria.
We also need to make sure that students of the twenty- first century are equipped with the tools of the twenty- first century.
The Rudd government is working hard to develop a highly skilled workforce, including funding for trades training centres in secondary schools which will encourage more secondary students to learn a trade.
Our pre-election commitment to provide 450,000 new training places over four years was extended by the 2008-09 Budget.
We will now provide 630,000 new training places over five years including 85,000 apprenticeships.
We have established Skills Australia to advise on current and emerging skills needs.
The Howard Government in its 11 years failed to undertake a serious assessment of Australia’s skills needs and it was this failure that led to the skills crisis that we faced when we took Government in 2007.
The Rudd Government will also be undertaking a major reform of employment services, which will provides incentives to Job Network members to support the most disadvantaged job seekers.
Finally, we have created an $11 billion Education Investment Fund, which includes the $6 billion from the existing Higher Education Endowment Fund.
This fund will support capital works at educational institutions throughout Australia including universities, research facilities and vocational institutions.
The Education Revolution may be a series of programs, but it is a comprehensive series that addresses the various aspects of education that need addressing.
We have provided funding that supports the built infrastructure in our educational institutions.
We have invested in early childhood education and are undertaking reforms to ensure that schools provide quality education right through primary and secondary school through our initiatives on school accountability, the National Curriculum and literacy and numeracy.
We are investing in skills through new training places and trades training centres.
And finally, we are undertaking major reforms of employment services to make sure that all Australians regardless of their educational attainment are able to find work, especially the most disadvantaged jobseekers.
All these policy proposals do not stand alone but fit together like a jigsaw puzzle to create a comprehensive, quality education system from early childhood right through to vocational education and training and university.
Throughout the development of the Education Revolution, we are implementing our policies through a process of negotiation through COAG.
This is a recognition of the role of the states and territories in education as well as the need for a national education agenda.
This is why a spirit of co-operation with the states and territories is vital to the Education Revolution.
It is a stark contrast with the big stick approach to dealing with the states taken by the previous Government.
Instead of negotiating with the states they threatened to withhold new funding unless the states did things their way.
You would think that they would have used this power for a serious undertaking like comprehensive reform in education or helping lift the performance of underperforming schools.
But instead, they used it to make sure that schools installed flagpoles.
I don’t recall flagpoles ever being particularly high on the COAG education agenda.
So where does the Education Tax Refund fit in to the Education Revolution?
It recognises the important role of families in supporting students through school.
It provides an incentive for parents to invest in the education of their children and to take an interest in their children’s material educational needs.
The ETR is of particular importance to my home state of Tasmania.
According to ABS statistics, Tasmanians earn less income on average than any other Australian state.
One of the really unfortunate impacts of socioeconomic disadvantage is that some parents, while able to get a quality education for their children through the public school system, cannot always afford to support them with the basic expenses that inevitably arise.
Ironically, education is most reliable way of getting out of a cycle of poverty.
The ETR will go some way towards helping families meet those expenses.
The fact that it is a fully refundable tax offset rather than a deduction, means that although it supports families of various means it still provides relief to those most in need.
It is with great pleasure I stand here to talk about this very important bill which delivers on the promises that Labor made during the campaign and continue to fund and maintain while in office.
I commend the Bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (EDUCATION REFUND) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,34,1,speech
"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2008-11-27,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

Mr President, thank you for allowing me this opportunity today in the Senate to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008.
This Amendment was one of our key election commitments. It will enable thousands of Australian school children to obtain necessary items for their schooling.
Parents understand the importance of their children’s education. That’s why Australian parents work so hard to give their children the best possible start in life. Parents make sacrifices so their children can succeed. Parents face a range of pressures and they have many responsibilities.
The Education Tax Refund comes in the wake of reports over several years that have highlighted the difficulties of schooling costs for low-income families.
For example, the Brotherhood of St Laurence’s 2007 Education Costs Survey found 72 per cent of respondents could not afford items for that would ‘improve the education experience of their children’ and two-thirds did not have a home computer with Internet access. About 60 per cent had difficulty paying for books and almost half reported difficulty paying for equipment.
Federal Labor believes that Australian parents are doing a great job. But we also understand that parents appreciate a bit of extra help when it is available.
The cost of equipping children for school is significant. Computers, printers, scanners, computer software, internet connection, text books—these all add up.
Families are already facing a range of cost pressures—mortgages, petrol prices and grocery bills, just to name but a few. Add the costs of getting your kids ready for school, and then supporting them throughout the year with uniforms and school camps fees present a real challenge for a lot of families.
Research from the Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs suggests that the costs of raising a child increase as children grow older.
The costs for one child can increase from $8,300 a year for a six year old, to over $10,000 a year for a 14 year old. These are gross costs, before government payments and child care costs.
We recognise this, and that is why we are offering this help.
Surveys show that parents of primary school children can expect to pay between $58 and $129 in books alone, and an average of over $1,300 for computer and Internet costs. For secondary school children it can cost parents from $148 to $619 for books, and an average of over $1,600 for computer and Internet costs. This survey is across government, Catholic and Independent schools.
Investment in education is central to the next wave of economic reform that will position Australia as a competitive, prosperous, knowledge-based economy that can compete and win in global markets.
If Australia is to continue to succeed economically it needs a highly skilled and productive workforce. The key to building such a workforce is ensuring that all kids get a world-class education.
Our $4.4 billion Education Tax Refund builds on Labor’s Education Revolution - a core part of Labor’s strategy to drive Australia’s long-term economic prosperity.
The Rudd Labor Government is committed to implementing an Education Revolution. We recognise that education is the engine room of prosperity and helps create a fairer, more productive society.
Ultimately, it is the most effective way we know, to build prosperity and spread opportunity.
The Education Revolution is a key element of the Australian Government’s agenda as it is central to the goals we have for this nation:
Building a Stronger Future—Increasing Australia’s capacity to sustain higher economic growth with low inflation through increasing the skills base of the labour force and aligning that skills base with the needs of the economy.
Building a Fairer Australia—Raising the skills and capacity of all Australians, particularly those with low skill levels, is essential to ensuring equity in the economic, social and political life of the nation and
Preparing for Future Challenge—Australia faces significant changes to its social and economic environment through an ageing population and increasing international competition.
The nation must invest in developing a world class education system and drive development of a workforce that is highly skilled, flexible and adaptable in responding to increasing global competition for skills.
If Australia is to rise to these challenges, we need a revolution in the quality of our education outcomes, the nature of our investment in education and in collaboration between governments and the education and training sectors.
The Australian Government considers that the COAG reform agenda must deliver real changes in three core areas:
Raising the quality of teaching in our schools.
Ensuring all students benefit from schooling through strategies based on high expectations of attainment, engagement and transitions for every student, especially in disadvantaged school communities.
Improving transparency and accountability of schools and school systems at all levels.

A key part of our education revolution is helping parents meet the everyday costs of their children’s education.

We want to helping parents meet the costs of the books and the computers and the software our kids need, to get the best start.
That’s why the Federal 08/09 Budget included $4.4 billion to create a new Education Tax Refund.
The Education Tax Refund is a refundable tax offset of 50 per cent of eligible education expenses for children undertaking primary and secondary school studies.
About 1.3 million families, with 2.7 million students, will be eligible for the Refund.
Under the plan eligible families will be able to claim 50 per cent of eligible education expenses up to $750 for each child undertaking primary school, to provide a maximum tax offset of $375 per child, per year.
For children undertaking secondary school studies families will be able to claim 50 per cent of their eligible expenses up to $1,500 per child, to give a maximum tax offset of $750 per child, per year.
Families entitled to Family Tax Benefit Part A for children in primary or secondary school in the relevant financial year are eligible for the Education Tax Refund.
Eligibility for the Education Tax Refund also extends to parents with school children who would be eligible for Family Tax Benefit Part A but for the fact that the child is receiving certain payments or allowances, such as Youth Allowance, ABSTUDY Living Allowance, Disability Support Pension, payments under the Veteran’s Children Education Scheme and payments under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004.
We have also taken into consideration families with shared care arrangements. In this instance, arrangements for the Education Tax Refund will be shared, just as Family Tax Benefit Part A is shared.
Families with home-schooled students, who are registered with their State or Territory government, may also be eligible to claim the Education Tax Refund. It is important to note that students undertaking school studies who are independent of their parents may also be eligible.
For students making the transition from primary to secondary school in a single financial year the full Education Tax Refund, based on the secondary-school rate, can be claimed. Families with students who enter or leave school in any school year are able to claim the Education Tax Refund for the half of the financial year that they attend school.
Eligible expenses that have been incurred by a parent or guardian with more than one child with an Education Tax Refund entitlement can be pooled and claimed against the children’s combined Education Tax Refund entitlement, provided that the children all have access to the purchased items.
As you can see, this program is available to many students. This program will help so many working families meet their children’s educational expenses. This Government cares about working families, and, unlike the previous Government, we are not going to deny our children of the education they deserve.
Eligible expenses for the purposes of the Education Tax Refund are laptops, home computers, printers, paper, education software, school textbooks and associated materials and trade tools.
This includes purchase, lease, hire or hire-purchase costs of these items. In addition, the expenses of establishing and maintaining a home Internet connection are also included.
This measure is designed, together with other measures in Labor’s Education Revolution, to lift school retention rates long-term —where Labor’s target is to increase year 12 equivalent retention to 90 per cent by 2020.
According to research by the OECD, the growth rate of the economy would be up to 1 per cent higher if the average education level of the working-age population was increased by one year.
This plan is an excellent example of how the Rudd Labor Government is doing the right thing by working families.
The tax offset will apply to eligible expenses incurred from 1 July 2008. Those eligible for the Education Tax Refund should start keeping receipts to allow them to claim the tax offset in their 2008-09 income tax return from 1 July 2009.
For those not required to lodge an income tax return, they will be able to access their entitlement to the offset through the Australian Tax Office by lodging a separate form at the end of the 2008-09 financial year.
This scheme will help families invest in their children’s education —at the same time that the Government is investing in a better education system.
Federal Labor believes that better education is the cornerstone of a decent society. We know that education increases productivity and participation, it builds prosperity, and it also offers the hope of breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty.
While our predecessors spoke of improving Australia’s education system, we are getting on with the job of real education reform. Those opposite should be ashamed of their record on education.
May I take this opportunity to remind the Senate that the Howard Costello 2007 Federal Budget delivered private schools a $1.7 billion increase over the next 5 years to rise to $7.5 billion, while public schools received only $300 million to rise to $3.4 billion.
It is shame that those opposite used their position in the Senate to underfund our public school system and blatantly spoon feed money to private schools.
In our first Budget we allocated $19.3 billion to education initiatives over the next four years to help deliver our commitments on:
A national curriculum in English, Maths, the Sciences and History;
$1.2 billion Digital Education Revolution;
$2.5 billion Trades Training Centre program; and
Guaranteed funding to both government and non- government schools.
The Liberal Government talked about teacher training, performance standards, literacy and numeracy, but after 12 years, 24 reports and 220 recommendations, there was nothing much to show of it.
No national teaching standards. No national curriculum. Too many kids still leaving school too early. Too many who are unable to read or write. We understand there is much to do to right to the wrongs of the past. We have to make up for 12 years of neglect.
Our Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education Julia Gillard are working very hard and acting now for Australia’s long-term future.
During last years’ Federal election campaign, Kevin Rudd did something that hadn’t happened at national level in 12 years. He put education at the front and centre of the public policy debate in this country.
On November 24 last year, the Australian people voted in favour of the Education Revolution and voted against the 12 years of neglect administered by the Howard Government.
After 12 long years of neglect, we can’t deliver an education revolution overnight. But, the Rudd Labor Government has made a solid start because we want every child to get the best possible start in life.
The Rudd Government is committed to creating an education revolution to build a world class education system, which would establish Australia as one of the most highly educated and skilled nations.
This commitment recognises the central role that education plays in the economic and social strength of our nation. Education not only drives productivity but also empowers individuals to reach their full potential, and helps overcome disadvantage.
So I say to the eligible parents in Australia of this Education Tax Refund, KEEP YOUR RECEIPTS!
I commend this Bill to the Senate and I encourage those opposite to do the same. Working families need this support. Our children deserve to be equipped with the best technology that will enable them to learn and be equipped for the future. A key part of the Education Revolution is helping parents meet the costs of their children’s education.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (EDUCATION REFUND) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,34,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2008-11-27,"—I would like to thank all senators who have taken part in the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Education Refund) Bill 2008. An important aspect of the government’s education revolution is assisting parents with the everyday costs of providing an education for their children. That is why the government has provided for a $4.4 billion investment in the education tax refund, as announced in this year’s budget.
The education tax refund is aimed at parents and other caregivers and consists of a refundable tax offset for 50 per cent of eligible education expenses for children undertaking primary and secondary school studies. Importantly, this bill delivers on the government’s election commitment to assist families with the costs of educating their children. From 1 July 2008, eligible parents and guardians will be able to claim a 50 per cent refund each year on up to $750 of eligible education expenses for each child undertaking primary studies. This will provide a maximum refund of up to $375 per child per year. For children undertaking secondary studies, families will be able to claim a 50 per cent refund on up to $1,500 of education expenses per child. This will provide a maximum refund of up to $750 per child per year. Not only does this refund apply to primary and secondary students attending school; it also applies to home-schooled students who are studying a primary or secondary course, provided that they are registered with their relevant state or territory.
There are a wide range of eligible educational expenses which can be claimed as part of the education tax refund. These include laptops, home computers and associated costs, printers, computer software, trade tools for use at school, school textbooks and stationery, as well as a home internet connection. These educational costs can be incurred by way of purchase, lease, hire or hire-purchase, which gives families choice in how they go about incurring the expenses. This will be particularly helpful for those families who cannot purchase a laptop or home computer outright, as they will have the opportunity to obtain these types of educational items by way of a lease or hire arrangement.
Parents and others entitled to family tax benefit part A and who have children undertaking primary or secondary studies will be eligible for the education tax refund. Eligibility for the education tax refund is also extended to those who would be eligible for family tax benefit part A in respect of a child but for the fact that the child, or they on the child’s behalf, is in receipt of other support payments, such as youth allowance or ABSTUDY living allowance. Students who are living independently from their parents may also be eligible for the education tax refund in respect of their own expenses.
The education tax refund will apply to eligible expenses incurred from 1 July 2008. So I would say to all eligible parents: if you have not already started doing so, please start keeping receipts for educational items so that you can claim the tax offset in the 2008-09 income tax return from 1 July 2009. As the education tax refund is a refundable tax offset, this means that even if you do not pay tax you will still be able to benefit from this offset. For those people in this situation who are not required to lodge a tax return, they will be able to claim the tax offset by lodging a separate form to be available from the Australian Taxation Office. The first claims for the education tax refund will be accepted following the end of the financial year, from 1 July 2009.
This bill implements the government’s election commitment. I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question agreed to.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2008-11-27,"—I rise to support the Temporary Residents’ Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 and the Superannuation (Departing Australia Superannuation Payments Tax) Amendment Bill 2008 as they are important, much needed reforms to the way that superannuation accumulated by temporary residents is treated when they leave the country. The purpose of the first bill, the Temporary Residents’ Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill, is to require superannuation funds to pay the unclaimed superannuation of departed temporary residents to the Tax Office. The purpose of the second, related bill, the Superannuation (Departing Australia Superannuation Payments Tax) Amendment Bill, is to enable departed temporary residents to claim their superannuation benefits through the existing departing Australia superannuation payment process before it becomes unclaimed. These bills are necessary because of the increasing number of unclaimed superannuation accounts from departed temporary residents, including backpackers and other temporary residents.
According to the Australian Taxation Office’s 2006-07 annual report, the number of unclaimed or lost superannuation accounts is over 6 million, equating to over $12 billion remaining unclaimed. Whilst compulsory superannuation has served workers in Australia very well, one of the downsides has been that because of the complexity of the way the system operates a number of people have lost money that they have legitimately earned. Whilst this money is still available to them if they come back to claim it, it is often the case that they do not know about it, are simply unsure about how to claim it or, indeed, are unwilling to claim it because the amount of administrative time spent chasing an often small amount of money from overseas is just not worth it.
It was the previous Howard coalition government that had the foresight and wisdom to seek to change the legislation to clean up the system and stop these problems from occurring. The then coalition government announced in the 2007-08 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook that these reforms would be implemented by 1 July 2008. However, the legislation did not pass because of the federal election. The Rudd government continued with this legislation but deferred its commencement to allow for more time for consultation. The coalition will be supporting this legislation because it was initially our proposal last year, and we welcome this legislation’s improvement to the current arrangements.
I will now go briefly to the specifics of the bills. When these bills come into force, superannuation funds will be required to pay to the Taxation Office any unclaimed superannuation balances of any temporary residents who have not claimed their benefit within six months of leaving Australia. Superannuation is currently concessionally taxed because of the acceptance of the principle that retirement savings are a public good that should be encouraged. Under current arrangements, when a temporary resident leaves Australia they can apply for their superannuation balance to be paid as part of a departing Australia superannuation payment, or DASP. Departing Australia superannuation payments attract a 30 per cent withholding tax for the taxed element of a benefit and a 40 per cent withholding tax for the untaxed element.
Under the scheme proposed in these bills, the Australian Taxation Office will be required, after a six-month period, to advise superannuation providers that a former temporary resident with a superannuation account has departed Australia. The superannuation fund will then be required to remit to the Taxation Office the balance of the superannuation account less any benefits that have already been paid. After the balance has been transferred to the Australian Taxation Office, the departed temporary resident may apply to make a claim for the Australian Taxation Office to pay their benefit to them, their legal representative or, indeed, another fund if they again return to Australia. The Australian Taxation Office will then be required to pay the balance, less any applicable withholding tax payable. Effectively, this means that six months after leaving the country a departed temporary resident will have to apply for their DASP through the Australian Taxation Office instead of the original superannuation fund. This effectively means that it is far easier to track down lost super from the time when someone was, for example, on a working holiday in Australia. This centralised process will be an improvement to the current system whereby there are, as I mentioned a little earlier, 6 million lost accounts, which of course is unsatisfactory from anyone’s viewpoint.
The inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Economics into these bills found that they have support, and the committee recommended that the bills be passed by the Senate. Once again, I do want to commend the serious work done by the Senate Economics Committee. They have a huge workload and always produce reports of a consistently high standard in relation to these often quite complex bills. Because they are referred to in the report, I will only speak very briefly about a couple of minor issues that were brought to the attention of the committee.
The coalition senators on the committee noted that this bill will automatically force benefits to be transferred six months after the temporary resident either leaves Australia or his or her visa expires. Even if the person is actively managing their account—that is, staying in touch with their fund—under this legislation, at the six-month mark their account will be closed. There has been a call for the government to do more to promote awareness amongst people leaving Australia that they are able to claim any superannuation that they have accumulated. The fact that there are six million lost accounts suggests that we have not done as well as we could in informing departing residents of the process for claiming the DASP they are entitled to. I accept that this is a difficult challenge. I faced it myself many years ago, and it is obviously still a significant issue. I would ask that the minister in his remarks in his reply indicate to the Senate what additional plans he may have in mind by way of an information campaign to better inform departing temporary residents. I make these remarks not critically but simply to note that existing mechanisms are not having the desired effect and some better mechanisms need to be employed.
According to the Bills Digest, the financial consequence of the bill is a net positive increase in the underlying cash balance of the Commonwealth over the forward estimates. These bills will help to streamline the claims process for lost superannuation and will remove the compliance burden caused by inactive accounts. This, as I mentioned a little earlier, is an original coalition initiative. I think it is a very worthwhile improvement that has been proceeded with by the current government and I am pleased to commend this bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>TEMPORARY RESIDENTS’ SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,35,1,speech
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2008-11-27,"—I am pleased to speak for the Temporary Residents’ Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 and the related bill. As Senator Coonan indicated, this measure was initiated by the former government and it is a useful measure that has been continued after a consultation period by the current government. The current situation is that people working temporarily in Australia have superannuation paid by their employer, as is usual for all employees, and then have the option to take it with them when they go back to their home country. But, often, it is left in superannuation accounts in Australia and in many cases these very small amounts of super are eaten up by fees charged by the superannuation fund. This measure makes sense in a lot of ways. That money will instead be paid into the government revenue and will be held there in case those temporary residents wish to claim it. In that case, they will pay the relevant departing Australia superannuation payment, the DAS payment. I think this is a very sensible arrangement.
During the Senate Economics Committee process, some concerns were raised about this, and the committee listened very carefully to those concerns. One of the chief ones was that some temporary residents paid money into their super account above and beyond the required statutory payment, expecting to be able to come back and claim that money, with the tax concessions given by the Australian government, at a later date. The committee accepted the view that the tax concessions allowed by the government for superannuation in Australia are to ensure that Australian citizens make sufficient provision for their retirement income and in turn create a smaller burden for future taxpayers. But there is no reason that the Australian government should in any way make concessions for temporary residents who go back to their own country. Temporary residents can of course withdraw their superannuation on their departure if they wish, in which case the government recoups some of the tax concession they have been given by applying that final tax through the DAS payment.
The concern about the retrospectivity aspect being unfair on these former temporary residents is not really valid. It is not the role of the Australian taxpayer to subsidise an ongoing savings vehicle for former residents who have left the country. The committee found that there was no reason for the taxpayer to continue to do that. It acknowledged that it is a change in the system but that there is no guarantee for those temporary residents that that advantageous system for them would continue.
There were also concerns expressed by some from the superannuation industry about the cost and time of implementing the changes. Again, the committee listened to these problems carefully. As has been noted, this was initially proposed last year, there was consultation done by the former government and it was well signalled that this was the proposed change. The incoming Labor government then took it out for further consultation. Super funds have known for some time that this was a likely outcome. So the committee did not accept that superannuation funds could not have expected this measure to be implemented. The committee also noted that, if there was a delay in implementation of these bills, there would be a delay in the revenue available to the government. The superannuation industry was fully involved with the government’s consultation process. We heard evidence in the Senate Economics Committee that there was no convincing case that the work they claimed would take 12 months could not in fact be done by the end of April next year. The committee took into account that superannuation funds might be a little reluctant to lose the fees on the accounts that they do have and would not necessarily be keen to implement the changes quickly.
The third and final strand of submissions, as Senator Coonan noted, was that there was some concern that people were not fully informed about their entitlement to take their superannuation entitlements when they left the country or indeed to claim them when they were back in their home country. The committee did make a recommendation that there should be better education of temporary residents about their entitlements. In particular, we heard from the student representative council of the University of Sydney, who were concerned that students who come to study here and do some part-time work were not well informed about their entitlements.
The committee asked that the government look to making a better system to ensure that people knew of the superannuation payments and to ensure that there was a range of promotional material in a range of languages provided to universities so that they could hand them out to their foreign students to remind them to claim their superannuation before they departed. There was also a request that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship consider the feasibility of writing to international students and other workers on temporary visas, reminding them about withdrawing their super just before their visa was due to expire. The Senate Economics Committee concluded that these bills should be passed and I commend them to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>TEMPORARY RESIDENTS’ SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,35,1,speech
"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2008-11-27,"—I rise to contribute to the debate on the second reading of the Temporary Residents’ Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 and the associated bill, the Superannuation (Departing Australia Superannuation Payments Tax) Amendment Bill 2008. The overall objective of the bills is, as I understand it, to address the situation where superannuation earned under the Compulsory Superannuation Guarantee requirements by temporary residents is left indefinitely unclaimed in super funds. The first step in doing this should be to do what is reasonably possible to ensure that those who actually own those superannuation funds have the opportunity to access them. Beyond this, where it is not possible to reasonably ensure temporary residents are reunited with their superannuation and they lose contact with it, I think it would be reasonable to take steps to consolidate that super into consolidated revenue.
The detail of this legislation will have the effect of gathering all moneys held by temporary residents in super accounts in Australia out of those accounts once they have been gone for six months, regardless of the wishes of those people, the degree to which they remain in contact with the super funds, whether they are actively managing their Australian super funds or even whether they have voluntarily deposited sums themselves into their super accounts on the understanding that they can invest it in Australia until they reach retirement age. The legislation contains no provision to try to ensure that these people are aware of amounts they might have deposited into super accounts before leaving or to make it easier for them to claim them. The only notification that they get is a question on the departure card as they are getting on the plane to leave.
This legislation does contain some concerning aspects and could come at a significant cost to Australia, to Australians and to our ability to attract talented people to work and study in Australia. As always, the devil is in the detail. The proposed legislation presented by the government has attracted strong and, in some cases, very reasonable representations from stakeholders highlighting a number of legitimate concerns, many of which appear to have been brought to the attention of the government and subsequently ignored. Effectively, what the bills do is as follows. Once a temporary resident has left the country for six months, or it is six months after their visa has expired, all funds paid into their super funds whilst earning in Australia will be paid into consolidated revenue to be used without restriction by the government. This is the case regardless of whether those funds were paid into super funds as part of the superannuation funds guarantee requirements or as voluntary contributions over and above those requirements. It is the case regardless of whether the owner of those funds knows they are there, remains in direct contact with the relevant super fund or is actively managing those funds. There is no requirement that those funds be ‘lost’ in the sense that the fund managers have lost contact with the owner.
Of course, the owners of those funds can access them upon the leaving the country—if they are aware of the existence of those funds, are able to understand and complete the relatively complex paperwork and are able to provide the proof required. But, even if they can, they will be required to pay an increased departing Australia superannuation payment of 35 per cent of the total amount in the fund. I do not have any issue with people being required to pay what is effectively a penalty tax on early access to their super; it is an appropriate thing. The money was paid into their super account on a concessional basis, and if they access it earlier it is right and proper that they pay a penalty. But this increased penalty tax, when combined with the 15 per cent contributions tax, gives a flat rate of tax paid on those funds of around 50 per cent. It applies even to people who have made voluntary contributions to their super funds on the expectation that they could withdraw it upon turning 60 on the same terms and conditions that apply to Australian permanents turning 60. It is worth noting that such individuals will end up paying a higher rate of tax than if they had taken that money as a cash salary.
It is important to remember that for some temporary migrants their time in Australia may well have been the only opportunity that they have had to save for their retirement and that they did so based on the then legislation. An additional issue is that, once the ATO has gathered up these people’s money into consolidated revenue, no earnings or indexation are to be applied while funds are held by the ATO, even if they hold them for 20 or 30 years until their owner retires and remembers that they have some superannuation that they earned whilst working in Australia all those years ago. What they will get if they actually do access it at that point is the exact amount paid in less the 15 per cent contributions tax and less the 35 per cent DASP. There will be no indexation, no interest and no dividends. The timing of the measures imposed by the bill has also been raised as problematic, and it seems to me that it is a probably a legitimate issue. Super funds have submitted that it is unrealistic to require them to provide the first report on temporary residents to the ATO by April 2009. One industry group estimated that the cost of trying to implement the measures across the industry in accordance with that time line could be up to $100 million. I do not know what the actual cost will be, and that remains to be seen. But it is apparent to me that there would some additional cost in trying to meet the deadline.
Suggestions were also made at the Senate Economics Committee inquiry hearing that not enough is being done to ensure that temporary residents are put in contact with their super before they leave the country and that education and awareness campaigns or direct contact through immigration would help address this issue. One suggestion by the student representative council of the University of Sydney—and I note that Senator Hurley mentioned some of their recommendations; all of them were good—was that, when those temporary residents on working visas apply to open a superannuation account, the visa holder must declare their visa and supply a domestic and overseas address. Once the final tax return is lodged and/or persons known to be on a temporary visa have not made a superannuation fund payment for six months, the fund could directly contact the person with information about temporary residents and their right to take their superannuation with them when they leave Australia, along with the application form to make that possible.
Other options exist to ensure that the owners of these funds are better informed about their existence and their rights over them, but of course exercising these options would necessarily decrease the overall quantity of funds available to the government, and hence they are probably not an attractive option. One solution to most of the problems in this bill would be to provide the possibility of giving temporary residents a choice to opt out of the relevant provisions of this bill in circumstances where they can demonstrate that they are actively aware of their Australian super funds and in contact with their fund provider. This would enable temporary workers who move base or other temporary residents who may return to Australia to retain their superannuation investments in Australia until they choose to claim them—subject to a penalty if before retirement age and on the same terms as any Australian if at or after retirement age.
These proposed changes to superannuation do not just affect temporary residents in an immediate sense but could affect Australia’s ability to attract and retain skilled workers. They could act as a disincentive to our attracting skilled and unskilled workers to fill demand needs and capacity constraints in Australia. The principle behind this bill is good and should be supported, and this is the reason why the coalition is supporting it, but to me some aspects of the bill do raise issues of concern that I think could be addressed.",SENATE,<title>TEMPORARY RESIDENTS’ SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,35,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2008-11-27,"—I indicate my support for the second reading of the Temporary Residents’ Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2008. I want to traverse neither the same ground that Senator Bushby did when he articulated so well a number of concerns that were raised, nor the concerns raised by Senator Hurley in the context of the Economics Committee in relation to this. I am also grateful for the time that I have had today with Senator Sherry to discuss with him some of the concerns I have had in relation to this bill. I circulated amendments earlier today in relation to the issue of compliance. Whilst I still have reservations about matters of compliance—the superannuation industry has indicated that there would be a cost of between $10 million and $100 million—I am not proposing to proceed with that amendment on the basis of the discussions I have had with Senator Sherry. I think we will have an opportunity to discuss this in the committee stage, or perhaps Senator Sherry could respond in his summing up to the claims made by the industry of costs between $10 million and $100 million. That is something that has worried me, but I was reassured to a considerable degree by matters raised by Senator Sherry in the context of discussions I have had with him today.
I will go to the nub of what principally concerns me: the issue of retrospectivity. The proposed legislation is retrospective in nature; there is no other way of looking at it. It means that temporary residents who have earned superannuation in Australia in the past on the understanding that when they turned 60 they could have access to their superannuation under existing legislation will now be subject to very significant taxation implications, often paying tax at a higher rate than the top marginal rate they were paying on the income they were earning in the first place. This impact is compounded for those income earners who, in good faith, made a decision based on the tax and super laws at the time to increase their level of contributions to their fund. I am in great sympathy with the comments made by Mr John Fauvet, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers, who gave evidence at the Senate economics committee inquiry:
It is just really a question of the rate and of the retrospective nature that applies to those individuals who are serious savers for their retirement, who were encouraged to do so … all of the time when they were here. This may well have been the only opportunity they had to save for their retirement, so they did that based on the then current legislation, expecting to be able to withdraw that superannuation in the same way as Australians can: tax free at age 60.
The argument is, ‘They’re not Australian citizens; why should we prop them up?’ but they made these investments in good faith, and I am in agreement with the argument put by Senator Bushby. These are people whom I think we should not dud, to put it colloquially, by making this retrospective in nature.
If this legislation is about lost or unclaimed super, I commend the minister for the work that he has done in relation to this. In fact, earlier this year, when I was trying to make a quid before I got to this place, I was doing a stint as a talkback radio host—I think it is a good thing I am here in the Senate and not doing talkback—and Senator Sherry was my guest on the program, talking about unclaimed super. We got quite a few calls that afternoon because people are concerned about this—lost and unclaimed super. Senator Sherry is to be commended for tackling an issue that ought to have been tackled much earlier. There has been a lot of talk about this in the past, and he is doing the right thing by looking at the whole issue of unclaimed and lost super. But in this particular case, when it comes to temporary residents, if a temporary resident is making an effort to keep in touch with their fund and is doing the right thing in the context of maintaining regular contact with their superannuation provider, I do not think it is fair that they should be subject to this new regime. I think it is fundamentally unfair. It is retrospective in nature, and I can foreshadow that I will be moving an amendment at the committee stage to ensure that that does not occur, both for those who already have funds in place and for those temporary residents who continue to maintain contact with their fund, because to me it is a fundamental equity issue. There may be other countries that do not treat Australians working overseas fairly, but that does not mean we should do the wrong thing by those temporary residents who are working here and, I believe, doing the right thing by keeping in contact with their superannuation fund.
Essentially, I believe that this is welcome legislation. I did have reservations—I still do to an extent—in relation to the issue of compliance costs, and I would be grateful if Senator Sherry would put on record his views in relation to that, but my principal concern is in relation to the issue of retrospectivity and for those temporary residents who are doing the right thing by keeping in contact with their super funds. That cannot be described as lost super, which I think is the mischief that this legislation is principally intended to deal with. It is not lost super if you keep in contact with your super fund.",SENATE,<title>TEMPORARY RESIDENTS’ SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,35,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2008-11-27,"—in reply—Firstly, I would like to thank all of those who have contributed to the debate on the Temporary Residents’ Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 and the Superannuation (Departing Australia Superannuation Payments Tax) Amendment Bill 2008. There has been a considerable amount of interest in this measure. I will make two points initially. Firstly, I want to make it clear that a departed temporary resident does not lose their legal right to claim the moneys in their account. Even though it is transferred from what are generally lost accounts—although we have no breakdown, I will accept there is some that is not in lost accounts—the transfer occurs to the ATO. Senator Bushby raised a concern about the interest. At the moment, Senator Bushby, as you would be well aware, there is no interest.
—Over time! It is going back over several years.
—It is going backwards. I accept the validity of the point of long-term rates of return in the context of super. But I would make the point that there will be no admin fees. Often, in a lost account, the admin fees send the account backwards despite the positive interest that would accrue over the long term. So there is an advantage in this methodology that is being taken. Secondly, whilst it is difficult to estimate, there will be a higher claim rate from departed temporary entrants simply because it is easier for them to go to the ATO, an Australian government instrumentality, than to have to find their money in one of 600 superannuation funds, including about 12 eligible rollover funds. So there are actually advantages in being able to access their money back in Australia for those departed temporary residents who do not claim their money when they leave. Whilst it is relevant to lost superannuation—I have made many comments over the years about lost superannuation, and most of the temporary residents’ accounts would be included in that pool of lost superannuation—what the government believes is the ultimate solution to Australians’ lost superannuation accounts is a related but separate issue that I hope we deal with next year.
I want to thank Senator Coonan in particular, because the foundation for this measure actually goes back some five or six years to when Senator Kemp was the Assistant Treasurer. He introduced on behalf of the former government a measure to allow temporary residents to transfer their money out of the country, which they did not have a right to do. Secondly, there was a tax applied on that transfer to offset the tax concession. This measure actually has its genesis in that measure introduced by the former government. Then we move forward to last year. As Senator Coonan has rightly pointed out, and I accept this—we can sometimes be bipartisan in this place—this was an initiative of the former government. It was announced before the election. There were consultations that had commenced with industry before the election, but it was not legislated before the election. We indicated our support for the measure during the election campaign.
I referred the preliminary proposals to go into legislation out for further consultation earlier this year. We did make some substantial changes to the initial proposals as put forward by the former government. We did listen, and we were principally concerned about a number of administrative and practical issues. I can for the record, and it is in the EM, state that the upfront cost for industry as a whole to establish this is $30 million and the ongoing cost is about $3 million. Prior to that consultation occurring and change in the administrative features, the industry had indicated that the upfront cost was going to be $100 million or thereabouts and the ongoing costs about $10 million.
Through the listening process, the consultation process, we did change the administrative operation of this measure very significantly. For example, it was initially proposed to collect the money before the temporary entrant left Australia. We decided that it would be far simpler and less costly administratively if it were done six months after they had left the country. The industry made, I think, some valid points about administrative costs. We took notice of those points, and the final legislation reflects that. It also usefully overcame what I think would have been a serious moral issue of detriment: if the money had been collected before the temporary entrant left the country, they would not have had death and disability insurance. By collecting the money after they have left, they still maintain death and disability insurance cover. If they are, unfortunately, injured or die on a building site, for example, they are still covered by insurance. So there were some very legitimate issues raised in that initial consultation. As I said, the former government did do a great deal of work. It was their measure, and we are here considering the legislation tonight. As I have indicated, it will help reduce the number of lost accounts and the amount of unclaimed moneys in our compulsory system, which arise when temporary residents depart Australia without taking their superannuation with them.
I will just briefly digress to the point that Senator Xenophon raised about a person being effectively required to take their money out of the system. The government would argue that it is not appropriate for a nonresident—unless they come back into the country and become a permanent resident; they are treated differently—to receive ongoing tax concessionality once they leave our Australian system. The purpose of the Australian superannuation system is not to provide an ongoing tax concessional subsidy, and presumably tax-free super at age 60, for nonresidents. It is not the purpose of our system to do that. It is not the purpose of Australian taxpayers to cross-subsidise those individuals once they move outside of the Australian system.
As Senator Xenophon has raised, the treatment of Australian temporary residents working in, say, the US or the UK is pretty shameful. If you are in their system, you get nothing back. The money stays in the pool of their consolidated revenue overseas; you get not a cent back when you return to Australia if you are a temporary resident working overseas. It is not true of all jurisdictions, but it is certainly true of places like the UK and the US, where Australians tend to work. While temporary residents who depart Australia are able to take their superannuation with them as a departing Australia superannuation payment, many do not do so. We have a figure. We estimate less than 10 per cent actually transfer it. This contributes to the total amount of lost moneys in the system. The amendments contained in the bill seek to address the lost account problem by requiring superannuation funds to pay the unclaimed superannuation to the tax office. The government has consulted on the measure. We released that discussion paper in May, we made significant changes and we have the legislation that is presented here today.
There are a couple of other matters I will try to cover off prior to the committee stage. Regarding the issue of the communications campaign, it is extraordinarily difficult to contact these people. Senator Coonan knows from her experience just how difficult it is when people leave the country and provide no ongoing forwarding information and no ongoing contact with their fund. To the credit of the previous government, they did introduce onto the back of the departure cards an ongoing forwarding address space. We will be building on that. The ATO is going to develop a communication strategy. The measures will include mail-outs to fund members informing them of the changes, website information, and media and editorial programs. Articles communicating the changes will be submitted to various internal and external publications. This will include targeted publications read by backpackers, international students and other groups associated with temporary residence. Current publications will be updated to reflect the changes. I do not in any way want to suggest to the Senate that this is easy—it is not, as Senator Coonan knows—but we will be making best efforts, and I am happy to provide further details once that campaign is finalised.
There is one other issue I want to comment on briefly, an issue that has not been touched on by those who attended the Senate Standing Committee on Economics and which is a legitimate issue that has come to the government’s attention only in the last couple of months as a consequence of the global credit crisis. I think it was legitimately pointed out at the hearings that at the present time superannuation funds are experiencing a greater than normal switching or flow of funds from non-cash investment options to cash investment options, and that places a greater pressure on funds to ensure liquidity in these current times. APRA, as the regulator, is well supervising and managing this particular issue, but this measure would place additional pressure on some funds. This was raised at the hearing.
As a consequence of that, the government believes that this is a legitimate concern. It was a new issue that had not been considered by either the former government or us back in May. It is a consequence of recent developments in financial markets. Therefore, we have indicated—we will get to the amendment—that, for a fund where there is a liquidity issue for transferring the moneys, if an application is made to the regulator, APRA, who has responsibility for prudential regulation, including liquidity, and APRA comes to the conclusion that there is a legitimate liquidity issue, the moneys are not forgone but there is consideration and they can be paid at a later date. We think that is a reasonable approach if the fund can show legitimate concerns about liquidity in these current uncertain times.
I think those are the main issues that are being raised in debate. This is obviously an important revenue measure. It is almost $1.2 billion in revenue, so it is significant. I conclude my remarks at this stage. We will get to the amendment to be moved by Senator Xenophon. We will not be supporting the amendment; we have some significant concerns, and I will outline those concerns in the committee stage. I thank all those who have taken an interest. This has been a complex measure by any consideration. It comes at a sensitive time. There is a lot of interest in superannuation at the best of times and, indeed, the not-so-best of times, as the funds are experiencing at present. I thank the various industry organisations and the funds for their ongoing interest and the very positive suggestions they made in the initial rounds of consultations. I thank and acknowledge the former government, including the former minister, Senator Coonan, and thank everyone for their contributions.
Question agreed to.

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2008-11-27,"—Tonight I was going to speak on some of the policy issues presently facing Australia, but I have to confess at this early juncture that I was so astonished by the performance of the opposition in question time today that I decided it was impossible to allow some of the statements that were made by opposition senators to pass without comment. In question time today Senator Abetz started the ball rolling by asking in his best and most affected sarcastic tone: ‘When will the government deliver a budget surplus?’ What an astonishing question! Does not Senator Abetz recall that the budget brought down by the Treasurer in only May of this year provided for a surplus of $21.7 billion? Of course, the delivery of that surplus is dependant on the passage of the budget through this parliament. And what contribution has Senator Abetz and his magnificent team opposite made to delivering that surplus, that surplus which he argues is so very essential? His contribution has been to block and obstruct the revenue sections of the budget. It is as simple as that. He opposed the luxury car tax. He opposed the tax on alcopops. He opposed measures that contributed more than $3 billion a year to that very surplus he now pretends to worry about.
The Rudd government came to office determined to maintain a strong budget surplus, and it brought down a budget that provided for that very thing: a strong budget surplus. The government wanted a strong surplus in order to put downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates. In the economic circumstances of May 2008, that was absolutely the economically sound and responsible thing to do. Let us cast our minds back. The Labor Party and the new Rudd Labor government had found itself custodians of an overheated economy, an economy that had endured interest rate rise after interest rate rise as it struggled to cope with, amongst other things, the flagrant, outrageous and economically irresponsible pork-barrelling of those opposite. Irrespective of the macroeconomic setting that this country needed, those opposite were determined to spend their way out of political problems.
We did not have to maintain a strong surplus. We could have spent that $21 billion achieving other objectives. We could have spent it fixing some of the things that the Howard government neglected for 11 long years. We could have spent it on schools and universities, on infrastructure and vocational training, or even on raising pensions. But we did the responsible thing and maintained a strong surplus. That fact alone puts paid to the socialist fantasists opposite who are concerned that Labor are not the economically responsible managers that indeed we have proved ourselves to be.
And, in that circumstance, what did the opposition do? They did their best to sabotage the surplus by blocking the key revenue elements of the budget in this Senate. Then they raised a noisy, dishonest, hypocritical campaign—a campaign even they were embarrassed about—demanding that we increase the base rate of the pension. Never mind that they did not raise the pension when they had the power to do so.
—We gave you the strongest economy in the Western world! You’ve never given us one of those economies; you gave us a $96 billion debt!
—Order! Senator Mason, it is the adjournment debate. I am listening with great care to what Senator Feeney has to say. I would ask you not to interrupt Senator Feeney.
—I’m only speaking the truth, Mr President—as I always do!
—You can put your name on the list if you want to speak the truth. Senator Feeney, continue.
—The truth is a stranger to those opposite. I remind the honourable senator opposite that the golden rule in politics is never argue with the bloke with the microphone! So, never mind that they did not raise the pension when they had the power to do so. Never mind the fact that the Howard cabinet, including Senator Minchin, Senator Abetz and Senator Coonan and the rest of the fabulous four over there, rejected Minister Mal Brough’s cabinet submission to raise pensions in the 2007 budget. They presumably rejected that submission at the time because Senator Minchin and others said we could not afford it. Notwithstanding that, the hypocrisy of those opposite, boundless as it is, meant that Dr Nelson went on to say, in the aftermath of all of these anti-budget measures, that this was a government that was itself putting the budget at risk. Next they demanded that the government cut fuel excise by 5c a litre, of course a desperate bid by a failing opposition leader to cash in on the dissatisfaction in the community about what was then a spike in world oil prices earlier this year.
If the government had acceded to the opposition’s various demands, absurd as they were, and allowed them to block our revenue measures in the Senate, the total cost would have been $5 billion a year—almost a quarter of the budget surplus announced in May this year. That is the critical context when contemplating the shambolic performance of those opposite in question time today, when they emerged as the new-found defenders of the budget surplus—just as effectively, I might say, as when they tried to come out as the defenders of pensioners earlier in the year. Mr President, there is a good saying in politics: ‘The mob always works you out.’ And let me tell you, those opposite do not have a scintilla of credibility on these critical issues.
Today Senator Abetz sought to lecture us on the importance of maintaining a surplus. But what did his colleagues say about the surplus earlier this year? Dr Nelson said that his populist demand to increase pensions could be ‘taken out of the more than $20 billion surplus.’ Tony Abbott said that ‘it was not economically necessary to have a surplus of $22 billion.’ And what did the Merchant of Venice say? Malcolm Turnbull, on ABC Radio on 13 October, said when considering the proposed pension rise:
Now in addition to the arguments of compassion … there is also the need for an economic stimulus—and this is one economic stimulus that could be delivered in the near term.
So, only last month, Mr Turnbull was in favour of spending a large chunk of the surplus, not only to achieve social policy ends but also to stimulate the economy. That was what Mr Turnbull said, and it was in line with government policy, because what did the Prime Minister announce the very next day? He announced a $10 billion economic stimulus package, including a $4.8 billion package that included benefits for pensioners, benefits for families and benefits for first home buyers.
In response to the global financial crisis which broke out in September of this year, the Rudd government decided to use half the surplus to stimulate the economy and thus safeguard the most vulnerable sectors of our community against the effects of that crisis—which is, as all concede, a foreign-born crisis. And what did Mr Turnbull say about that? He supported it. He said: ‘It has our bipartisan support. It gives justice to Australia’s aged pensioners, in particular, who have been doing it tough.’
What does all of this tell us? It tells us that, when those opposite meet every morning to plot their cunning strategies for question time, they would do well to have regard for the utterances of their leader, and they would do well to have regard for the comments of their frontbench.
That was six weeks ago, but it has been six long weeks for those opposite. Now Senator Abetz tells us that spending the surplus is wicked and irresponsible. In doing this he is not only apparently contradicting his own leader, and he is not only ignoring the opinions of every responsible economist in Australia, all of whom have supported the government’s actions, but he has forgotten his own best efforts earlier this year to destroy the surplus by blocking those key revenue measures in the budget.
Even more extraordinary was the speech of Senator Coonan immediately after question time, while taking note of answers to questions. Senator Coonan seems to be inhabiting a kind of parallel universe which even the Tardis would struggle to reach, a parallel universe in which the global financial crisis does not even exist. God bless Senator Coonan for inhabiting such a place, where there is not such a crisis. She told the Senate that the Rudd government ‘have pronounced it all too hard and declared that Australia is headed for a budget deficit and probably a recession’. She said:
If this sounds familiar to Australians … it is because it is, very familiar. The ghost of Labor governments and their extreme failure to run the economy competently is well and truly back with us.
That is Senator Coonan’s analysis of our current circumstances.
This is of course an opposition that is struggling to find its way, struggling to find a story to convince Australian voters that its own shambolic performance over 11 years should be vindicated. But let us not forget that in the context of a global financial crisis an economic stimulus package has been completely justified—and despite your very determined efforts to try and persuade the Australian people that the government is in the custody of a group of socialists— (Time expired)
