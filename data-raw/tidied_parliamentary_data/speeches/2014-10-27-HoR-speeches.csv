Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (09:01):  For many, myself included, Gough Whitlam was not only an inspiration but also the very reason for our enthusiasm for Labor politics. I had the honour of representing the electorate of Werriwa, which was held by Gough Whitlam throughout his political career.


He was a man with a vision, and certainly a vision for Australia's future. He was one not prepared to be constrained by traditional and historical ties but prepared to venture into new frontiers. Being the first Western leader of a major political party to visit China not only was groundbreaking at the time but also paved the way for our current day relationship not only with China but also with countries throughout the Asian region.


Gough became the member for Werriwa in 1952 and, following a redistribution, he and his wife, Margaret, and their children moved to Albert Street, Cabramatta, in 1955—a fact that is still quoted to me today by many of the more elderly residents at Cabramatta. When he became the member for Werriwa, the boundaries of the electorate map were much different to what they are today. As a matter of fact, his house in Albert Street is just down the road from my electorate office in Fowler. I had the honour of reminding Gough on many occasions that, in representing Werriwa and now Fowler, I have represented both ends of his old electorate.


Apart from meeting him at various party conferences and events, it was not until my by-election in 2005 that I had the opportunity for a more engaged discussion with Gough. Our early discussions around that period were a little frosty, given the fact that I was not the person he was supporting for preselection for his seat of Werriwa. For a while my meetings with Gough generally involved a fair degree of fair and trepidation on my part. In contrast, my wife Bernadette struck up a very close relationship with Margaret right from the start.


Gough was above all a reformer. During his leadership, he was able to reform and modernise the Labor Party. He made the ALP electable. He had the genius of being the first major political figure to comprehend the fundamental changes necessary for the Australian community. He understood that what the country needed was a new political focus on education, culture, social and infrastructure needs, particularly for the residents of the expanding outer suburbs and families of working-class backgrounds. My generation and those that follow are the direct beneficiaries of the Whitlam legacy.


Many people I meet in the various aged-care facilities in my electorate recall their encounters with the Whitlams—whether it was Margaret teaching their kids swimming at the local pool or just having the opportunity to speak to the great man at various local events or branch meetings. Locally, the Whitlams were revered and much loved. Invariably, I am told about Gough's commitment to enhance the basic infrastructure needs of the area. His campaign to establish an integrated sewerage system in Liverpool and Campbelltown in the Fairfield areas is still firmly lodged in the minds of many of the elderly residents of the area. While current generations might well take these developments for granted, if it were not for the tenacity of Gough these developments would have been some time off.


When I did meet with Gough in his office in Sydney it was for me like being in an inquisition. He always asked me about people he knew from the electorate and local branches as well as about developments occurring in the area. He was always interested. He always had his finger on the pulse. He did not regard Werriwa as something in his distant past. This is something I learnt to appreciate about Gough. He was not just the political giant of the Labor movement, which many have already spoken about in this place, but also someone who deeply cared about ordinary people.


I remember one round of discussions I had with Gough in his Sydney office. Somehow we got to talking about his time in the RAAF. He had been in 13 Squadron and flew as a navigator on a Ventura bomber. It was not only his clear recollections of events of this period that was so impressive; what took me by surprise was his unwavering loyalty to his flight crew. He stayed in contact with all the members of the flight crew after they dispersed from the air force. As a mark of the man's compassion, following the death of his pilot he remained in contact with his widow. While it is right that we remember Gough as a great of the Labor movement, it is his attention to people and their own particular circumstances that, for me and for many in my electorate, makes him truly great.


I offer my sympathies to his family. Edward Gough Whitlam, rest in peace.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2014-10-27,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (09:07):  It is my solemn duty to pass on the respects of the people of the Riverina on the death of the Hon. Edward Gough Whitlam AC QC and also to have a few reminisces of Mr Whitlam's time in Wagga Wagga and to pass on a few of the remarks of those who knew him and those who revered him.


In passing on some of the reminisces of Mr Whitlam, I bring to the House a bound edition of the Daily Advertiser—the Wagga Wagga newspaper. I know you are not allowed to use props, but I am sure it is okay on this occasion. So I will show my ALP friends across the other side, the front page of the edition which is headlined, 'Wagga's big welcome to Whitlam—five-hour visit'. The story reads:


The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, and his wife Margaret were Wagga's guests yesterday and for five solid hours wherever they went crowds applauded and whenever they turned welcome hands were extended. More than 480 people—many of them young children—crammed into the Wagga Civic Theatre to extend a Wagga welcome to the man who holds Australia's top political office.


Mr Whitlam visited Wagga to open the Schnelle Harmon grandstand on Eric Weissel Oval—


unfortunately now disused—


and the half-million dollar extensions to the Wagga Leagues Club. Three hundred sporting, civic and service leaders from Wagga and district attended the opening of the grandstand yesterday afternoon. Inside the Leagues Club later in the evening Mr Whitlam and his wife met more than 150 Labor Party supporters in a relaxed and informal atmosphere.


And I am sure the local Labor branch would love to get 150 local supporters at a function these days!


A spokesman for Mr Whitlam said, 'The Prime Minister did not know what to expect coming to a current Liberal stronghold.'


And I am happy to report that I am hopeful that it is now a strong Nationals stronghold.


But he was greeted with a right royal reception. Children, nuns, students, politicians, housewives and hundreds of working men thronged around Mr and Mrs Whitlam for their entire Wagga visit, which was Mr Whitlam's third to the city but first as Prime Minister.'


I can report that it was the first prime ministerial visit that Wagga Wagga had received since Robert Menzies came to town on Friday, 17 November 1961. So it had been quite awhile.


During his welcome to the Prime Minister, Alderman Gissing spoke of the tremendous number of playing fields provided for the community of Wagga and the role of the council and the local leagues club in maintaining these. Mr Whitlam understood the need for the Commonwealth to fund local government directly. He understood regionalism. I have to say that; I have to put that on the record. Mr Whitlam said he was flattered by the welcome he received from the people of Wagga. And you will love this quote, members opposite, and you can just imagine Gough—I will channel Gough here, 'And I was thrilled to see all the decorations as I drove along Wagga's main street,' he quipped, 'but I was later told that they were for Christmas, not me.' You can just see him saying it—those great quotes. He was quite the comedian, but very witty, as we all know.


I would also like to place on the Hansard some of the tributes that he has received from no less than the former Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer, who said in The Daily Advertiser:


Unbelievably, Gough Whitlam as prime minister and ex-prime minister could recite correctly every (train) station from Junee to Narrandera in correct order, and he often did this when we were in conversation. Gough told me he used the wheat silos of the Riverina to assist his RAAF navigation training in World War II.


My final session with him was on the Ghan to Darwin in 2004 and, once again, he recalled in correct order, Marrar, Coolamon, Ganmain, Matong, Grong Grong and so forth.


That is amazing! That is just remarkable recall. The article continues:


Mr Fischer said he did not agree with much of Mr Whitlam's politics, but he respected his deep knowledge of the Riverina and also of military history, including the life and work of Sir John Monash—


who, of course, Tim Fischer is so deeply fond of.


I would also like to quote some of the Labor members of the Riverina, one of whom is my great mate Peter Knox. Peter never agrees with anything I say and nothing I ever do, but he is a great Labor member. I tell you what, if ever the Labor Party wanted to acknowledge somebody with life membership or something in the party, then Peter Knox is that person. He said, 'Gough with the was the reason I joined the Labor Party in 1972.' Mr Knox said he met Mr Whitlam on several occasions and was in awe of him. When he heard the news he said that it was a very big shock—even at his age. And it was a very big shock; the fact that Mr Whitlam passed away on 21 October 2014 at the grand old age of 98. I think he was one of those ageless figures who we all thought would just live on forever. None of us really expected him to go.


When Gough Whitlam visited Wagga Wagga on 15 January 1974, former Wagga Wagga deputy mayor, Mary Kidson, recalls being struck by a very tall and articulate man who made a captivating speech. He was one of those people who could really command an audience. I never met him, but certainly from seeing documentaries on television and reading a lot about him, he was one of those people who had presence. Mary Kidson told how fond she was of him and certainly of her great memories of him.


John Sullivan, who was the Country Party member for Riverina from 1974 to 1977 and who, even though he is an octogenarian, is still contributing greatly to public life as a councillor for Narrandera Shire Council recalled that he was in parliament at the time when Mr Whitlam was. He said:


We've lost one of the great characters of the Australian parliament and a prime minister that will be remembered for a long, long time.


We had a great rapport and I thought very highly of him.


I think that probably stretches across the bounds of parliament, the fact of that great respect that people had. We heard it last week in the condolence motion by the Prime Minister and others on this side for Mr Whitlam. Mr Sullivan continues:


I didn't appreciate some of his actions as leader of the Labor Party but as a man, he was very good.


There are others: Glenn Elliott-Rudder, who I bumped into at the shopping centre yesterday, described Mr Whitlam as a man of vision with a positive outlook. Indeed, he certainly was. Dan Hayes, the young president of Country Labor's Wagga Wagga branch said that the death of Mr Whitlam marked a sad day for the party. It was a sad day for the ALP, but it was also a day when we could celebrate the life of Mr Whitlam and, certainly, the great difference and transformation that he made to this nation.


I do praise Mr Whitlam for many of the things that he did, not least of which of course was also the acknowledgement that Catholic schools require funding from the Commonwealth. And I believe that he also understood regionalism—understood the great belief in decentralisation. If more members of parliament understood the great need for decentralisation the regional areas would be far stronger than they are now.


He also understood the need to have a trade relationship with China. We heard last week how he forged the way for that great relationship to occur. Australia's current ties with China have their origin in his efforts at what would have been a very difficult time. These moves laid the foundation for Australian business to establish a presence. One of the businesses that is really enjoying those links now is a company called Bee Dee Bags, which is based in Wagga Wagga. It is one of the fastest growing regional companies doing that sort of thing in Australia. 'China is going to be the economic powerhouse of the world in the future,' Bee Dee Bags founder Bruce Dicker said, and he acknowledged the role that Mr Whitlam played in that.


There are a lot of people in the Riverina—in fact, I would say most people in the Riverina—who mourn Mr Whitlam's passing, as do I. I really feel the need to pass on the condolences of all people in the Riverina for his loss and to pay respects to the surviving members of his family. May he rest in peace. Thank you for your contribution, Mr Whitlam.

"Parke, Melissa, MP",ALP,2014-10-27,"



Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (09:16):  I am grateful for the opportunity to join others in paying respect to the life and work of Gough Whitlam and I thank all those who have shared their reflections and tributes in the course of this condolence motion. There is no escaping the fact that Whitlam is now not just a man and a Prime Minister, but a government, an idea, a symbol, an era and a legacy. That is a lot of freight to carry on the frame of one person—and yet we know that here was a person who could bear it, and we mourn his passing.


Whitlam was a Labor leader for whom no area of beneficial policy was too small or too large—from sewerage to cities; from legal aid to law reform. Others have spoken about the incredible range, speed, and courage of the Whitlam government's policy program, and of course the list of big-picture policies speaks for itself. I want to make the point that while some of Whitlam's reforms were foreshadowed, and while some of Whitlam's reforms may have occurred in any case, this measuring of preparation and possibility, of what had been started and might have been, should fall into their proper small proportion compared to what did occur and what was achieved by Gough Whitlam and his Labor government.


The Whitlam government changes that resonated for me, especially early in my personal and professional life, include the work on Aboriginal land rights and antidiscrimination, the creation of legal aid and the Law Reform Commission, the lowering of the voting age from 21 to 18, the delivery of one-vote one-value reforms and the decisive shift towards a confident and distinctive Australian national identity—a place with our own stories on canvas, in print and film and our own national anthem.


 As a Labor person growing up in the country, I was keenly aware of how Australia's electoral system at the state and federal level did not provide fair representation. Anyone who believes those discrepancies were minor should consider that in 1968 there were some House of Representative seats with more than 83,000 voters and some with fewer than 47,000. What Whitlam began in the early 1970s at the federal level, I am glad to say Jim McGinty continued in Western Australia some thirty years later.


As someone who trained as a lawyer and worked as the principal solicitor in a regional community legal centre, I know how much better and fairer our system became through the introduction of legal aid and through the work of the Law Reform Commission. And as a person with a deep commitment to the importance of human rights and the international rule of law, I recognise the enormous value of the Whitlam government's signing of more than 130 multilateral human rights and environmental treaties and in passing the Death Penalty Abolition Act, the Racial Discrimination Act and other laws that gave domestic force to Australia's international obligations. I honour Whitlam's attempt to introduce a Human Rights Bill—a reform whose time has well and truly come, yet a reform which remains to be secured.


I also want to say something about how change occurs. Much in the analysis of the Whitlam government and of Whitlam himself in the last week has sought to offer a balance between the momentous achievements, on the one hand, and the disruptions and drama, on the other, as if perhaps a better Prime Minister and a better government would have secured the incredible surge forward of Australia in so many areas more smoothly. This, I am afraid, is at best a lazy dualism and at worst a kind of story-telling designed to frame-out future major reform. Big change by its nature is disruptive and by its nature draws resistance. As Whitlam wrote, 'Mine was a government rich in personal and political drama,' and let us not forget that to a significant degree that drama was supplied by the obstruction and resistance of those who had a preference for the status quo, an attachment to privilege or who simply did not accept the legitimacy of a Labor government.


Through the long telescope of time, people and events become simplified and singular; they seem ordained, legendary, unbelievable. It is in the nature of history that now we see clearly the giant of Whitlam, but less clearly his colleagues and collaborators in government, and that we now mark the long shadows of Whitlam policy achievements, but hesitate, perhaps, to cast forward our own shadows.


For Labor, it seems to me that in remembering the leadership of Gough Whitlam and his cabinet colleagues, we should also remember the Nietzschean tenet that 'one repays a teacher badly if one remains nothing but a pupil'. One of the Whitlam lessons must surely be that each of us, and all of us collectively, have the opportunity to make our own contribution by looking forward, not backward, as we fight on our principles and values for positive change.


Like many Labor people I was privileged to meet Gough and Margaret—of course the telescope has to be wide enough for Margaret too, for she is Whitlam as much as Gough.


I would like to finish by saying that Gough Whitlam was a lovely man—always welcoming and interested, always encouraging and generous and good humoured. It was in the core of his being to give of himself, to impart some of his optimism and energy to those he met, just as he poured his optimism and energy into the course-changing government that he led, a government whose wellspring flows strongly in Australia today.

"Laming, Andrew, MP",LP,2014-10-27,"



Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (09:21):  It is a privilege to deliver a very, very brief anecdote about my opportunity to meet Gough Whitlam. It begins with the observation that probably the lowest act of any hospital house officer is to switch off your pager—stop taking calls from the hospital—and then switch it on a few hours later and hand it over to your colleague who is taking over and tell you it has been a terribly busy shift and you have been unable to do all the work. I have to confess that the day Mr Whitlam was admitted to my hospital for a very brief stay I did that and spent three hours talking to Mr Whitlam. I am sure that my successor will forgive me on this one occasion for not doing my work during that shift. As I was warned in hushed tones by the ward staff as I went upstairs at St Luke's hospital in Sydney: 'Please go and admit Mr Smith, but by the way it's Mr Whitlam,' I could see administrative staff scurrying up from the ground floor where Margaret was dealing with all the paperwork. Many of them were quite daunted by the prospect of dealing with her.


Obviously, when I went in I was very trepid. I asked if I could have a bit of a chat. Mr Whitlam was very accommodating. I offered him a later time, but he said, 'No, no, let's have a chat now.' That was about 6 pm, and we chatted for about three hours. It was probably the longest admission I have ever done, but it was an absolute privilege to hear a complete history of Australian banking reform going back to the early 20th century. I realised as I walked in the room that he was seated on a hospital bed, looking very fit, and that even seated on the bed he was taller than me. I remember that my first political memory was when I was six years of age being hunched over a short-wave wireless radio on a tiny island off the coast of Papua New Guinea and my ashen faced mother looked up and said to me, 'Darling, Mr McMahon has lost.' That is one of the first political memories I have. Obviously it heralded the Whitlam era, for most of which I was overseas.


I guess, when I walked into that hospital room, I sense he could pick a Tory a mile off, with my haircut, distressed denim and pointy shoes, although today he would have a lot of trouble spotting his Labor colleagues as being Tories, sometimes. Basically, he explained his view of the world. It was impressive for me, being a super specialist trainee focused on one or two textbooks, to see a man who could cast his considerable intellect over a range of topics and talk about them almost indefinitely. That has been described before in this place.


He made an observation about Queensland which I loved, about his relationship with Joh Bjelke-Petersen. He did work in a bipartisan way, even with Joh, to get the South Bank cultural centre and museum off the ground. He remarked ironically then that, really, Joh should have named at least one of those great sandstone buildings on the Brisbane River after him, so there was little hint of political naivete, if not overoptimism.


He talked about a range of topics. He was generous in his discussions of other leaders who have followed him. He spoke at great length about people like Bob Hawke and Paul Keating in particular. I felt a little bit humbled to be listening even to those kinds of observations, which were incredibly frank and blunt. This was the measure of a person who spoke without any fear. He was a person who did that through his career, to the benefit of many. He would walk into a room and everyone would notice him and, I think, also enjoy and cherish every minute they spent with him.


There is an oft used and somewhat tired Shakespearian quote that 'the evil men do live after them and the good is oft interred with their bones', but I think even on this side one would have to confess that the great stuff that Whitlam achieved lives on even now and, in many ways, many of the things that we were most angry about at the time seem to have faded away. If that is a measure of his brief but luminous contribution then he has done a wonderful job as a former Prime Minister and we recognise him.

Mr KELVIN THOMSON
 (Wills) (09:25):  It is a great pleasure and privilege to be able to pay tribute to the life and work of Edward Gough Whitlam and to extend my condolences on behalf of the people of Wills to his surviving family members.


Gough Whitlam was a towering figure in Australian political life. I think he was the greatest man that the Australian Labor Party has ever produced, and I think that he was the most influential Prime Minister during the course of the past 50 years. To listen to the speeches from both sides of the House you get a sense of modern Australian political history being divided into before 1972 and after 1972.


He did this after enlisting in the RAAF during the Second World War, which was of course a very dangerous thing to do. My father's brother, John, after whom I have my middle name, did the same thing but did not return. In 1972 I was a year 12 student and I had a bright orange 'It's time' sticker on my schoolbag. I remember after the election one of my school mates said that he too was delighted that Gough had won the election but believed that Gough would not be able to abolish conscription or take us out of Vietnam any time soon. I was crestfallen by this Realpolitik but delighted when something like 24 hours later Gough's two-man cabinet did precisely that.


His leadership and vision for Australia were the key things that inspired me to join the Australian Labor Party back in 1974. That was against the run of play—because, of course, his government was thrown out in no uncertain manner in 1975. But I believe that his legacy has proved to be so longstanding that he can lay claim to being the most influential Prime Minister and political leader of our generation. It is such a monumental body of work that I cannot do it justice here, but I do want to mention a number of aspects to it.


The first is the introduction of free tertiary education, which made such a difference in the lives of so many young Australians. The more I look at this and the more I think about it the more I think that it was a mistake for us to move away from that. The second is Medibank, which of course was the predecessor of Medicare, which gave Australia quite possibly the world's finest health system in which everybody, rich and poor alike, has guaranteed access to high-quality healthcare. The third is environment protection. Gough took Australia into the realm of national environment protection, moving to protect the Great Barrier Reef from oil drilling; introducing the World Heritage Convention to Australia and ratifying that; ratifying the Ramsar convention; and legislating for the National Parks and Wildlife Act. Another is the area of Indigenous affairs, with the passing of legislation to ban discrimination against Aboriginal people and establishing land rights and native title and returning land in the Northern Territory to the Gurindji people. 


People will always draw on the aspects of someone's legacy that are consistent with their own views—and I am no different in that. I want to draw attention to the fact that, in 1974, he wrote that population growth was first amongst those issues which was leading to traditional forms of democratic government being under challenge. In July 1974 he said: 'I do not envisage any dramatic increase in our present population and, indeed, I would not wish to see one.' 


No doubt he made mistakes, but the fact is that anyone who is Prime Minister makes thousands of decisions, and it is not possible to make thousands of decisions without doing that. You have to see his political circumstances against the background of coming to office after 23 years in opposition, bumping up against very entrenched forms of opposition in the public service and, indeed, right throughout Australian political life. You also have to have regard to his coming into office during that period of the OPEC oil shock in 1974 which generated unemployment and inflation throughout the Western world. Indeed, very few leaders who were unlucky enough to be in power at that time survived for very long after. He had titanic struggles with Malcolm Fraser. I can remember United States political commentators and analysts at the time remarking on the abilities of Gough Whitlam and Malcolm Fraser and lamenting the fact they did not seem to have people of comparable political stature or calibre in their own country.


The best thing we can do to honour Gough's work and legacy is to do everything that we can to protect it, whether it is access to tertiary education, access to health care, environment protection affairs or the rights of Aboriginal people. But more than all those things, we should seek to honour the idea of politics as an honourable profession. Gough Whitlam would never have dreamt of a political career as a stepping stone to a cushy corporate job, post-politics. The idea of taking on a job as a corporate lobbyist or company director would have been anathema to him. What he did was go into public life because he believed in the capacity of individuals and of governments to make a difference—to improve people's lives and leave an Australia which was improved for the better. It is often said that everything we achieve, we achieve by standing on the shoulders of those who came before us. This was never more true than of Edward Gough Whitlam.

Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck) (09:31):  I wish to associate myself with the comments of those who have spoken on the condolence motion to honour Edward Gough Whitlam AC, QC, who was Australia's 21st prime minister. I offer my condolences to Gough and Margaret's children, Nicholas, Tony, Stephen and Catherine. Having lost my own father, I am acutely aware of the gap the loss of a parent means.


In death we celebrate the qualities of an individual. We acknowledge the achievements they made and the strides they undertook in order to reform and reflect a contemporary Australia.


In Aboriginal affairs there are three men who stand out significantly as being major reformers in Aboriginal affairs and the way in which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people receive services and programs to enhance their quality of life. There was the Hon. Fred Chaney and the Hon. Ian Viner; but Gough, particularly, was held in hero status by many Indigenous Australians.


The Whitlam government Indigenous affairs policy area was the most transformational change; it changed the way in which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were engaged in issues affecting their lives.


Let me cite a couple of quotes. These quotes are not untypical of those I have heard over the last week:



Mr Whitlam was a great friend of Aboriginal people and the land councils in the Northern Territory.


That was Samuel Bush-Blanasi, Northern Land Council chairman. Maurie Ryan, grandson of Vincent Lingiari, said:


He is part of our folklore, he will be remembered for hundreds of years.


Galarrwuy Yunupingu said:


In his time as Prime Minister Mr Whitlam was a great friend to Indigenous Australians. He always acted in a direct and determined way to resolve issues.


Many others have made similar comments across the nation.


From the perspective of the Aboriginal community, the Whitlam government established a policy of self-determination whereby the Commonwealth supported decision-making by Indigenous communities themselves. They relinquished the paternalistic control that previous governments had wielded over the lives of Indigenous people. Indigenous Australians welcomed the Whitlam government's empowerment of Indigenous people and the opportunity to make input into policy-making, and the abolition of  discriminatory practices that limited their freedoms and opportunities. It was interesting when Gough Whitlam, in his 1972 election campaign speech, made it very clear that one of his focus areas would be to remedy the context and situation in which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people found themselves. He gave an undertaking that he would reform many of the practices and also put into place a way of doing things for Australian governments that would be very different to that of the past.


The establishment of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs meant that for the first time there was a concerted focus by government on the range of issues that impacted on the lives of Indigenous Australians. The Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health was established as a small unit within the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and later on was transferred to Health, where it has become a significant structure that supports Aboriginal community controlled health services, state and Territory governments and Aboriginal communities in the work that is being undertaken to provide quality health care and services that will close the gap in life.


The establishment of Absec and Abstudy ensured that many young Aboriginal people across this nation could access secondary education to the end of year 12. Abstudy provided a pathway into tertiary studies that saw many graduate from university with degrees who would, in the future, hold leadership places. I think of Lowitja O'Donoghue, Charlie Perkins and many others who, through the university pathway, became great leaders who shaped the thinking of many governments. The other element that was important in the Whitlam era, and which is often cited in many of the interactions I have with Aboriginal people and organisations, was that it was the government that established the national Aboriginal council. The council is not just one individual advising government, but a number of people. Guidance to the government was sourced not from one or two, but from many. The practice in our society, in our Australian community, is to seek the views of so many in shaping policy and direction. That has always been a strength Aboriginal people saw in the Whitlam era. That is why there is often that association—that Aboriginal people tend to vote for Labor—because they saw it as a period in which they became a significant part of the agenda. They became a significant part of shaping their destiny and their future in concert with governments and government agencies. That tradition has been carried on and we now see a diversification of the political structures in Aboriginal society, which is in a sense a normalisation that you would expect when there is a bipartisan approach to the way we now deal with those areas where there are still gaps. 


The thing that stuck most in my mind was in 1975 when Gough Whitlam returned land to the Gurindji people, which had been denied them in the 1971 Gove land rights decision. His famous hand gesture of pouring sand into Lingiari's hand was intended to symbolically reverse a similar act in 1834 when John Batman received sand poured into his hand by an Aboriginal elder when they struck their treaty in Melbourne, which was later seen to be not of consequence.


During the Whitlam era, Aboriginal affairs saw some significant changes in Aboriginal people's psyche; we engaged and walked with all Australians as equals. If I look back, from where we are now, to the period of the seventies, I can see that the relationships—the partnering and the friendships, the work that is being done, the economic enhancement that has occurred, the educational opportunities—have been significantly enriched. When you plant a small seed—and it grows into something big for others to follow and to implement—change becomes much more significant.


Our current Prime Minister and the previous Prime Ministers' commitment to constitutional recognition is a process emanating out of the period of the Whitlam government in which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities found themselves to be an integral part of the society in which they lived. I recall all of this because I was part of the leadership fights. We had to fight for reform. We had to fight for the changes that were needed.


We also had to fight for an equal place at the table where our views could be accepted. I remember sitting at a table and asking a question about Aboriginal health. There were doctors on both sides. The answer given was not given to me. The doctor who gave the answer looked directly at his medical counterpart on our side of the table, four people away from me, and gave him the answer. So when he finished I said to him: 'Can I ask you the question again.' And he looked at me and said, 'I have given the answer.' I said, 'No, you did not give me the answer. You gave the answer to my colleague.' I think we have moved on from that time. Now, when you ask a question, the answer is given directly to you. Communities are finding that is much more the case now than it ever was. The paternalistic approaches that prevailed in our history changed when Gough Whitlam implemented Aboriginal affairs programs. 


On behalf of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, I would like to acknowledge the contribution that Gough Whitlam made—the work that he did to transform the future, the work that led to many of the changes that we now take for granted. As I said, if I look back over the last 40 years at the changes and the differences that are felt and experienced in many Aboriginal communities—although they are still problematic in some areas—where we are now is far superior to where we were in 1972. 


So I salute Gough Whitlam and I certainly salute all of those who were part of his journey and the contribution he made to the history of this nation. Thank you.

Mr MARLES
 (Corio) (09:41):  It is an honour to be speaking in this condolence motion for Gough Whitlam. In doing so, I extend my sympathies to Gough and Margaret Whitlam's children and their extended family. There is obviously an enormous sadness that comes with death, but Gough Whitlam's life is a life to be celebrated. It was a huge and a long one. 


On 22 July in 1967 the Corio by-election occurred in Geelong. Gough Whitlam had been the leader of the opposition for less than six months. The Labor candidate in that by-election was Gordon Scholes, a man who was 36 at the time, a train driver and the president of Geelong Trades Hall. The long-time Liberal member for Corio, Hubert Opperman, the very famous Australian cyclist—who was the Minister for Immigration in the Menzies and Holt governments—had retired to become the High Commissioner to Malta, and that triggered this by-election. It was the first federal election that Gough faced as the Leader of the Opposition, the leader of the Labor Party. 


Gough came down to Geelong 10 days before the by-election and spent the full 10 days in Geelong with his whole office and campaign team, marking out the kind of electioneer which he would be regarded in the future as having been. Incidentally, I was born nine days prior to that event, which means that Gough arrived in Geelong before me. So, when I came to Geelong, I found Gough enthroned in my home town. The reason for Gough's effort in relation to this by-election was that Labor had suffered an enormous defeat in the 1966 election; this was the first test for Gough as the Leader of the Opposition. So it mattered. 


What emanated from that effort was an 11 per cent swing to Labor. Gough was embraced by the people of Geelong, as was Gordon Scholes. Corio came back to Labor hands for the first time in a number of decades, and it can be argued that this was the first electoral step that Gough took towards that day in December 1972—when it was, indeed, time. 


Gough retained an abiding affection for Geelong—as he did for Gordon Scholes, who played his own role in Gough's story, as a predecessor of yours, Madam Speaker, on the 11th of November 1975. In a glittering career, one of Gough's greatest achievements was that he became, as Prime Minister, the No. 1 ticket holder of the Geelong Football Club. He returned to Geelong on numerous occasions after that first by-election—indeed, part of the story I am recounting I heard from the great man himself when he was in Geelong in 1997 addressing the Geelong West Football Club on the 30th anniversary of the Corio by-election.


If Gough embodied anything, it was modernity. He inherited a party that had split a dozen years before he became the leader. Indeed, he witnessed that split. He rebuild the party after the split and dragged to Labor into the second half of the 20th century, making us a modern party that was competitive and able to win an election. But that was reflected in the way in which he also was the emblem of modernity for Australia itself. The country he inherited at the end of 23 years of one-party rule was perhaps a country that was going through the stalest part of its democracy. Indeed, there cannot have been a less active and more stale period in this place than in the term of office from 1969 to 1972, when there was no legislative program. In fact, the speech that was made by the then Governor-General outlining the government's program after the 1969 election lasted precisely for one minute and a quarter—by today's standards that speech, outlining that term in government, was a shortened 90-second statement!


That was the country that Gough inherited. But with that, he embodied a whole range of new initiatives: in relation to opening up our higher education system to a whole range of people who had never had that opportunity before; making sure that women's place within our society, our community and our economy was where it should be; seeking to recognise China and to have a more modern outlook in our relationship with Asia; and repairing, as we have just heard from the member for Hasluck—or beginning the process of repairing—the relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia. I could go on, and each of these achievements have been spoken of at length by those in this debate, as is right and proper.


But there is one aspect which I do want to focus on in relation to that legacy, and that is in respect of Gough's view of regional Australia. We have heard a number of speeches about Gough being of Western Sydney and understanding the basic importance of infrastructure in our suburbs and in regional Australia. It is often perhaps most embodied by the step that Gough took in establishing the Albury-Wodonga Corporation, but in Geelong Gough was utterly pivotal in ensuring that the next university in the state of Victoria would be based in Geelong, which is what ultimately occurred with the establishment of Deakin University. But for Gough, Deakin would not have been in Geelong.


Gough saw that regional cities should be places where there are universities, where there are public services and where there are regional economies in their own right, such that Australia grows beyond simply being a series of city states. This was a grand vision, which is absolutely embraced by regional Australia today.


So, for Gough, Geelong was the embodiment of the kind of Australia that he wanted to see. And as Geelong goes through difficult times today, Gough's vision remains for us a beacon of hope about the kind of prosperous future we can achieve.

Mr WHITELEY
 (Braddon) (09:48):  Madam Speaker, I do thank you for the opportunity to speak this morning on the passing of the honourable Gough Whitlam AC, QC, the 21st Prime Minister of this great country.


As the elected member for Braddon I represent everyone in this place. It is my job to give everybody a voice so, notwithstanding that my electorate were very divided politically during the historical constitutional events of 1975, it is more than appropriate for me to pay tribute to Gough Whitlam's passionate public service.


On behalf of the Braddon electorate I do convey our condolences to the family of Mr Whitlam. While many in this place and in the community have spoken great things about the man, his passing will nonetheless be a time of great sadness for his family, who have lost not just their father but their mother in very recent years.


When Mr Whitlam passed away last week, this parliament and the media were flooded with stories of Gough's wit, his wisdom and humour. It seemed that everyone had a personal story of Gough and they seemingly cherished the opportunity to tell it.


I, like many in parliament, was young—not as young as the member who spoke before me!—I was 15 and in my last year of high school, when the events that Gough is perhaps most famous for transpired—obviously, that was on Remembrance Day 1975. But I do remember a towering giant of a man: a statesman; and man who appeared to me to have presence, great wit, great intelligence and, despite any political differences that I may have grown to have, a man who one could not do anything but admire.


I did come to admire this man—not necessarily for his politics or for his time in office, but for the way he handled his dismissal and as the years rolled on. I have heard many people talk of Gough's upbringing, of his entry into politics, of his conviction and his government's success—or otherwise. There is much to be said about a person's convictions and their willingness to come to this place and to act on those convictions in a meaningful and tangible way. But, of course—for all of us—strength of conviction and an array of new ideas alone is not enough to govern a nation. And this, no doubt, is where political historians will do battle for many years to come.


Some in this place have spoken much about the Australia he inherited. But much could be spoken about the Australia he left. But that is not for today. Rather, I will confine my brief comments now to my observations of Gough and Margaret Whitlam in the years following his dismissal.


Too often history is littered with fallen political leaders beset with hatred, bitterness and malice. This was not so, however, with either Gough or Margaret Whitlam. I do not doubt for a moment that in the days and weeks and years that followed the dismissal, leading eventually to his resignation from the parliament in 1978, that Gough and Margaret felt a sense of deep hurt and disappointment in what had happened, and I am sure that forgiveness did not quite stretch far enough to reach the Governor-General of the day. However, it seemed to me that Gough did not allow these events to dampen his convictions or to cease in his contribution to Australian society. This attitude, it seems to me, was a testament to the strength of his character and allowed the legend of Gough to flourish, along with his sense of humour, his wit and his wisdom, as I said earlier. For me, though, his legacy in many areas of public policy will be debated for decades—and that is okay; that is politics. 


But I do believe there is one characteristic of Mr Whitlam's life about which there appears to be agreement across the political divide, and that is his loyalty. What tremendous loyalty this man showed, over 70 years, to the love of his life. What tremendous loyalty this man showed to his children and those close to him. What loyalty this man showed to his mates in the 13 Squadron of the RAAF. But what stood out for me, as a member of parliament in both the Tasmanian parliament and, more recently, here, is that Gough Whitlam remained loyal to the political party that enabled him to become their leader and ultimately their Prime Minister. Through thick and thin, he was loyal to 'the one that brought him'. He stuck around as Leader of the Opposition after the massive and, in my view, justifiable rejection of his government by the Australian people. Following yet another defeat, he chose to move on from the rancour of this place, but he always found it in him to stand by future Labor leaders and prime ministers. I am sure there were many times when he would have privately cursed as he watched Labor prime ministers to come, like Hawke and Keating, in some way deconstruct his legacy. He could have chosen the path of bitterness, irrelevance and obscurity, but he did not. Gough Whitlam was a loyal Labor man dedicated to the cause of the party and always willing to stand up and be counted for his party when it counted. Ironically, this stands in stark contrast to the man who took the Prime Ministership from him on that eventful day in November 1975.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (09:54):  GK Chesterton once said:


Tradition means giving a vote to the most obscure of all classes, our ancestors. It is the democracy of the dead.


Progressives are at our best when our reforms draw out the golden threads of history. The notion that society is a contract between the past, the present and unborn generations is as powerful a guide for progressives as it is for those on the other side of politics. No-one better understood the value of tradition than Gough Whitlam. When Prime Minister McMahon set the date for the 1972 election as 2 December, Whitlam noted that it was the anniversary of the 1805 Battle of Austerlitz, when Napoleon defeated the Russian and Austrian armies. It was, he said, 'a date on which a crushing defeat was administered to a coalition—another ramshackle, reactionary coalition.'


Gough knew his history. Visiting Australia in 1974, Gore Vidal was struck to meet a Prime Minister who took issue with the historical accuracy of Vidal's novel about the Roman Emperor Julian. 'It was,' Vidal later noted, 'an unusual experiment for Australia to choose as its Prime Minister its most intelligent man.' As Julia Gillard noted in her 2011 Whitlam oration, Whitlam, like his near namesake Whitman, could well have said, 'I am large, I contain multitudes.'


Gough Whitlam sought to change Australia but to do so from the standpoint of a deep understanding of the past. As he put it:


Rather than discard our authentic traditions, we want to restore and invigorate them. … Rather than overturn the true values of Australian society, we want to resurrect and foster those values. 


Whitlam saw Australia not as a fearful fortress but as a proud nation with much to offer the world. He secured independence for Papua New Guinea and he cut Australian tariffs by 25 per cent—the beginning of the end for the old McEwenist policy of 'protection all round'. John Button said that Gough would often remark, 'When I opened China to the world.'


Gough Whitlam was no pacifist. The day after Pearl Harbor, he signed up for the Air Force, and he flew hundreds of reconnaissance, escort and bombing missions. But he knew the limits of our military action, and one of his first acts as Prime Minister was to withdraw our remaining troops from Vietnam, a conflict he described as 'disastrous and deluded'. Whitlam was proud of his nation, but he embodied the distinction that George Orwell drew between nationalism and patriotism. You can love your country, Orwell averred, without needing to claim it as better than all the others.


There was a central value that drove the Whitlam government. It was egalitarianism. Speaking in Ballarat in 1973, Whitlam said:


Egalitarianism—by whatever name we call it—is at the heart of the Australian tradition.


Whitlam agreed with Doc Evatt's view that 'Australian democracy was born at Eureka' and noted the 'auspicious coincidence' that the Whitlam government was elected the day before the 118th anniversary of Eureka. He put egalitarianism into action through universal health care, the Schools Commission, the World Heritage conventions, the Trade Practices Act, the Racial Discrimination Act, the land rights deal that led Vincent Lingiari to say, 'We're all mates now,' and sewering Western Sydney, which he said made us the world's 'most ""effluent"" nation'. He abolished imperial honours, and, as the Deputy Prime Minister noted last week, no-one would today imagine reintroducing knights and dames!


Paul Keating called the Whitlam government 'the resparking of Australian social experimentation', which was snuffed out prematurely with Gallipoli and Flanders. Whitlam's term in government was too short. If he had won in 1969—if Don's Party had had a happy ending—then Whitlam would have had three easy years to implement his social agenda. But his government had to face a major global crisis. It seems to happen to Labor governments. James Scullin was sworn in two days before the stock market crash. John Curtin was elected two months before Pearl Harbor. Kevin Rudd was elected a year before the global financial crisis. Gough Whitlam faced the oil shocks and the challenge of stagflation. Any analysis of that government's economic record must take the world economy into account. In Manning Clark's words, Whitlam was an 'enlarger', not a 'straitener'. Keating called him Fabius Maximus, Hawke called him Prima Donna Assoluta, and, yes, he is the only former Prime Minister with a prominent rock band named after him.


But he was always looking to do more. The to-do list he left us includes a republic, a human rights bill, fixed four-year terms and more work on the reconciliation journey.

Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey) (10:07):  I table the report of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Industry's inquiry into country of origin food labelling, A clearer message for consumers.


There have been a number of inquiries into Australia's food labelling system in the last ten years, even though most, including the extensive Labelling logic Blewett review, have focused on a wide range of issues surrounding food labelling and safety.


When considering an inquiry topic the committee was of the opinion that while other reports had made recommendations in the area of country of origin food labelling, considerable public confusion and frustration remained and that the topic was one which was repeatedly raised by consumers on media such as talkback radio.


Accordingly the committee requested support from the ministers of industry and agriculture to mount a specific inquiry into the issue with an aim of recommending possible modifications which would provide clarification to the general public while at the same time taking great care not to inflict anticompetitive burdens on our food manufacturers and growers.


The committee agreed on 27 March to undertake an inquiry into Australia's country of origin food labelling. During the course of the inquiry the committee received 54 submissions; seven supplementary submissions; held seven public hearings in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Canberra; and spent a day in Adelaide visiting and meeting food manufacturers to gauge their views in the workplace environment.


It became clear very early in the inquiry that the 'safe harbour' descriptors were in some cases not providing any information to the general public as to the origin of food products. While in most cases industries are complying with the law, often using the 'safe harbour' descriptors, the general public do not understand what they mean.


It was made quite clear to the committee that the country of origin of food is not overly important to many and that relevant information is considered less important on heavily processed foods. However, to a significant and important sector of the market, country of origin information is important and clear information should be provided to the consumer.


The committee was of the opinion that any country of origin food labelling regime should not present an impediment to importers and/or provide non-tariff trade protection to our industries, but it should provide clear information to consumers who wish to make an independent choice to support either Australian farmers or food manufacturers.


The committee strongly supports the current labelling system's non-prescriptive manner in the way a food manufacturer or marketer should represent a particular food's country of origin status.


Some examples include front or back of pack labelling, focus on particular regions or specific countries for the origin of selected ingredients and logos or individualised wording. These are all acceptable as long as they provide the minimum information and are not false, misleading or deceptive. Consequently, the committee has limited its suggestions for change to the country of origin labelling system to adjustments to the 'safe harbour' claims.


It is the committee's opinion that none of the recommended changes would have any significant negative impact on Australian producers or manufacturers but that the core recommendations concerning the 'safe harbour' claims will provide common sense information that consumers can understand.


At the heart of the recommendations is that each item should have a separate reference to the ingredients and the manufacture of goods. It keeps the best of what is good with the Australian country of origin statements, provides some specialised language that puts some separation between food and other products in the Australian market and most importantly addresses the confusion surrounding the 'Made in Australia' and 'Made in Australia from local and imported ingredients' descriptors.


The committee would like to express its appreciation to all who have contributed their valuable time and shared their experience with us throughout the course of the inquiry. I, and I hope the rest of my committee, will be pressuring the government to respond in a positive matter to these recommendations and adopt them.


In closing, I would particularly like to thank my committee—my deputy chair, the member for Hotham; and other members in the chamber at the moment: the member for Durack, the member for O'Connor and the member for Indi. I thank them for attending this morning and thank the rest of the members of the committee for their hard work on this inquiry. 


I must say that it is one of those experiences of the parliamentary committee system where everybody in the committee was working for a common goal and worked very well and cohesively together. I would especially like to thank the secretariat—in particular, Julia Morris, Anthony Overs and Lauren Wilson, who laboured very hard over these recommendations. (Time expired)

Ms O'NEIL
 (Hotham) (10:12):  I want to rise today to endorse the report that has been given by the chair of the committee. We have been working as a really cohesive and committed team for about the last six months on this very practical and very important question of how we label food so that consumers know where that food has come from. It is important for industry; it is important for farmers and all types of food producers in Australia, but most importantly it is incredibly important to Australian consumers. As the chair has noted, one of the first things that we learnt in this inquiry was that when it comes to particularly fresh food, where that food comes from is actually the single most important factor for consumers in making decisions about what it is that they buy. We know that, in an increasingly globalised world, we live in a rather strange time where things that we eat can come from just about anywhere in the world, and consumers are saying to us that it is very important to them that they know where that food comes from.


Despite the clear importance of this, one of the second things that we learnt through this process is that there is very widespread confusion about how the labelling system works so that consumers can make good choices and so that producers can make it clear where it is that food comes from. Of the issues that we heard, the first is a very practical one. Where on the packaging is the labelling of where the food comes from? We heard that there is a great many categories of how you can label food is coming from one country or another, but those categories all come with different kinds of test how the claims are satisfied. We heard that different claims could be satisfied in different ways, just adding to the confusion there. Sometimes claims have different meanings and there is quite an extensive range of issues about how labels for country of origin in Australia interact with similar systems overseas—in particular, in New Zealand.


I will provide a few examples, so those in the gallery and those at home can get a bit of a flavour for what we are talking about here. One of the common labels that we see on food is the statement 'made in Australia'. Take the apple pie, for example. What we learned through this process is that if the packaging and pastry were made in Australia but the apples were imported from China, the product could be labelled 'made in Australia'. Any normal consumer would read that and think that the key ingredient in the apple pie—apples—would have been grown in Australia, but actually that is not the case. And we know that about 70 per cent of ham and pork that is bought by Australian consumers under the label 'made in Australia' is in fact grown and reared in another country. Again, this is completely confusing and completely at odds with what the normal person would read and think. Another confusing statement that we heard a great deal about was the claim 'made in Australia from local and imported ingredients'. We know that about 90 per cent of the apple juice in Australia that has this label is made from apples that come from overseas. Again, that is not clear to consumers in the labelling. 


Producers also came out in quite some force to talk to the committee about the issues that they were facing. One of the really critical and, I think, damning facts about the current system is that when we talked to food producers around the country we found that they were not using the labels that are available to them. The labels are so confusing to consumers that producers actually make up their own language that they believe that they can satisfy. We can see that when consumers are confused, when producers are not using the system, then it is a system that is fundamentally not working.


The committee have come up with a set of recommendations that we believe will clarify the situation. I will leave it to those interested to access the report, which has been so beautifully written and so well researched by those on the committee staff who helped us. I have a couple of points I would like to make in closing. I want to make a special thank you to the committee staff—some of them are here in the chamber today—to Julia Morris, Anthony Overs, Lauren Wilson, Leonie Bury and Prudence Zuber. They were exemplary in how they resourced the committee, how they explored the areas that came up in the inquiry and how perfectly organised they were. They were fantastic to work with and I think that this report is a real credit to their hard work. To the other committee members—and some of them are in the chamber today—the public do not always see these really constructive moments in the parliament and I have to say that working on this report was one of them. We all came to it with the best of intentions to try to solve this particular policy problem facing Australia. The way that we work together is something that I am very proud of.


In conclusion, thank you to the member for Grey for chairing the committee and I commend the report to the parliament.

We know that about 90 per cent of the apple juice in Australia that has this label is made from apples that come from overseas. Again, that is not clear to consumers in the labelling. 


Producers also came out in quite some force to talk to the committee about the issues that they were facing. One of the really critical and, I think, damning facts about the current system is that when we talked to food producers around the country we found that they were not using the labels that are available to them. The labels are so confusing to consumers that producers actually make up their own language that they believe that they can satisfy. We can see that when consumers are confused, when producers are not using the system, then it is a system that is fundamentally not working.


The committee have come up with a set of recommendations that we believe will clarify the situation. I will leave it to those interested to access the report, which has been so beautifully written and so well researched by those on the committee staff who helped us. I have a couple of points I would like to make in closing. I want to make a special thank you to the committee staff—some of them are here in the chamber today—to Julia Morris, Anthony Overs, Lauren Wilson, Leonie Bury and Prudence Zuber. They were exemplary in how they resourced the committee, how they explored the areas that came up in the inquiry and how perfectly organised they were. They were fantastic to work with and I think that this report is a real credit to their hard work. To the other committee members—and some of them are in the chamber today—the public do not always see these really constructive moments in the parliament and I have to say that working on this report was one of them. We all came to it with the best of intentions to try to solve this particular policy problem facing Australia. The way that we work together is something that I am very proud of.


In conclusion, thank you to the member for Grey for chairing the committee and I commend the report to the parliament.

Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (10:29):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


There have been some constants in my four years in this role. Interestingly, one of the constants has been the problems that communities right around Australia are having with proposals for the establishment of or the change to phone towers. I have been constantly surprised at how often this has come up and the range of areas affected and the range of community groups who are disaffected by these proposals.


Within my own electorate of Denison there was a very controversial proposal to establish a very a elaborate mobile phone tower structure in Sandy Bay, which caused the community all sorts of grief. There was another phone tower erected into Taroona, which again caused the Taroona community a great amount of grief. One proposal, which took up a lot of my time and which has now been built I regret to say, was the erection of a phone tower on the old Cadbury grounds at Claremont in the north of my electorate. This was a particularly troublesome development, one that exercised the community a great deal. When I did a poll of the local community in that part of Claremont, an overwhelming majority of the community did not want that development in that location, and yet it went ahead and it is now being constructed. And even as I speak, there is another controversial proposal for a phone tower at the end of Merton Street in Glenorchy, again in the northern part of my electorate. It is quite a remarkable proposal: this phone tower will be in someone's backyard and, because of the slope of the land, the transmitting rays will literally be just outside the window of a bedroom of an adjoining house.


So there are four examples in just four years in my own electorate. It would be fair enough to assume that those sorts of problems in those sorts numbers and more are occurring in electorates right around Australia. And certainly since I have become outspoken about the issue of phone towers and the anxiety that the developments are causing many communities, I have been approached, my office has been approached, repeatedly by communities right around the country saying that there are developments in their own areas and that and no-one seems to be listening. The telcos seem to have all of the rights, councils have a few rights and the communities seem to have no rights.


Hence, in 2011 I moved a private member's bill that would give communities greater rights. But that bill went nowhere because the then Labor government did not seem to be interested in bringing it on for a debate and for a decision. Even now, with a change of government—a Liberal-National government—there seems to be little appetite for change with the new government either. I do not know what politicians think their role is if it is not to represent their community. But yet it seems in Australia that powerful companies—whether they be the banks or the supermarkets or the telecommunications companies—seem to be all powerful and they seem to be able to dangle governments on fairly short strings, almost like puppets. These big companies seem to be able to do virtually whatever they want.


I will not be deterred because the problem remains. In fact, the problem in some ways is getting worse with the rollout of many NBN towers. The problem remains that there are developments going on all the time around this country that are, for very good reasons, concerning local communities that the developments are inappropriate or in inappropriate places. Yes, we do need phone towers, but the telcos really should be considering other places to put those phone towers. They should not be in the middle of heritage areas; they should not be out the front of a primary school or an early childhood education centre.


The problem is the telcos want the cheapest location and often that is in the middle of a heritage area or out the front of a school. They want it near a road, near power; they are not prepared to pay that little bit extra to perhaps move the tower to a less than perfect or perhaps a slightly more expensive location. So the problem remains and I am moving another private member's bill, one that would give communities greater power. This is not an attempt in any way to stop the rollout of phone towers or the enhancement of existing phone towers around the country. Of course we need these things—on my desk at the moment I have an iPad, I have a smartphone; they need towers—but the issue is where do we put them and do we listen to the communities when communities have legitimate concerns about exactly where those towers are going?


That brings us to this bill, and I would just quickly explain what the bill seeks to do. For a start, it expands the number of people who would require to be notified when a telecommunications tower is proposed to be built or substantially modified. Currently only the owner or occupier of the land on which the new tower will be built must be notified, meaning that owners and occupiers of land immediately adjacent to a major development may not even know about the development until construction commences. Specifically, the bill stipulates notification of those within 500 metres of any new tower. Some people have the misplaced idea that currently there is a requirement that everyone within 100 metres of a new tower be notified, but in fact not even that is enshrined in law and is often ignored.


This bill would extend the amount of time for owners or occupiers of affected land to respond. Currently in law people are given just 10 business days to respond after being notified, and this is obviously a very difficult task for some individuals or for local landholders and even a hard task councils, which often have to consult subcommittees or hold public meetings. This bill would give people who are consulted a much fairer 30 business days to respond after being notified of a development application.


The bill would restrict the type of developments that can be declared under legislative instruments, and in particular it would restrict the low impact determination that allows new developments to avoid scrutiny under the current law.


I do acknowledge that some projects must be classified as low impact and therefore regulated federally to assist development. But there have been numerous cases where low-impact facilities have had a high impact on local communities and there has not been a need for a development application. 


This bill declares that no new telecommunications tower may be categorised as low impact and that, for an extension to a tower to be declared low impact, it must not extend the height of the tower by more than one additional metre.


The bill also would remove the ability of telecommunications carriers to extend the size and capacity of towers under the guise of routine maintenance, which goes on regularly at the moment. In fact, the bill would remove the ability of carriers to extend potentially highly visible antennae without scrutiny, which they can currently do.


In regard to developments in sensitive areas, the bill requires that ACMA—communications management authority—will have to be satisfied that all alternative less sensitive sites have been looked at and have been found to be unfeasible. In any case, the authority would not be allowed to grant a permit for a new phone tower within 100 metres of a community sensitive site such as a school or local landmark.


In closing, I am not trying to shut down telcos. I am just wanting to give the community more rights. At the moment, the telcos do not need a development application for a low-impact development. Even for a high-impact development where they do need to put in a development application, councils tend to approve them because councils know that ultimately the telco has all the power and the right of appeal to ACMA and any council decision can be overturned. So no wonder some councils just roll over. They feel bullied. They feel there is no point fighting the good fight on behalf of the local community even when the council thinks there is a fight to be fought.


This bill simply seeks to level the playing field and to give the community rights. I commend it to the house.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (10:39):  I move:


That this House:


(1) recognises that:


(a) over the next four years, total annual Commonwealth funding to Queensland is increasing by around $5.8 billion (including GST);


(b) despite the tight budget conditions, the Commonwealth is increasing annual funding for Queensland hospitals by 40 per cent, and schools by 47 per cent, over the next four years; and


(c) this represents a combined increase in funding to Queensland schools and hospitals of over 40 per cent by 2017-18, on 2013-14 funding levels;


(2) commends the Government for investing $13.4 billion to build the infrastructure of the 21st century for Queensland, including:


(a) $6.7 billion towards fixing the Bruce Highway; and


(b) almost:


   (i) $1.3 billion towards the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing; and


   (ii) $1 billion towards the upgrade of the Gateway Motorway North; and


(3) notes that the Queensland Government estimated the impact of the carbon tax to be $148 million in its 2013-14 state budget and its repeal will help support jobs and investment.


I am delighted to move this motion and I am pleased to see my Queensland colleagues, the member for Herbert, Mr Jones, who is in the chamber, and I note the member for Forde and the member for Capricornia are both listed to speak. The facts are that this coalition government is dealing with the legacy of debt, deficit and fiscal disaster left to us by the former Labor-Greens alliance, who thought it was fine to borrow vast amounts of money with absolutely no plans for paying it back. But, worse than that, they locked their borrowing plan in the years, hanging a millstone around the neck of future governments and generations of Australian children.


In Queensland, the Newman government is also saddled with massive debt from nearly 20 years of Labor fiscal ineptitude, and now they face the prospect of a Palmer United Party inspired Senate witch hunt backed by Labor and the Greens that will cost the taxpayers tens of thousands of dollars, continuing and demonstrating the fiscal irresponsibility of those three parties.


Yet, against this background and contrary to the misinformation spread by the Labor opposition, the coalition is still able to provide $5.8 billion in funding to Queensland for various key projects. The coalition is the highest education funding government in history as well as spending record amounts on infrastructure and giving my home state of Queensland funding for key projects.


One of those, of course, is the massive $6.7 billion that is being committed to fix the Bruce Highway, to floodproof it so that in the cyclone season towns, cities and producers are not cut off for days and weeks at a time. This is the government that sees problems an acts to fix them. The much-needed second range crossing in Toowoomba will receive $1.3 billion. This is much-needed driver to improve access to drive productivity increases in the agricultural sector in the rich farmlands west of Brisbane. The Gateway Motorway is also being funded, with $1 billion for this neglected area of traffic congestion.


Neglect and debt—a familiar tale in every state and territory which has had Labor leadership. And not just funding for infrastructure—over the next four years federal funding in health for Queenslanders will rise by 40 per cent on 2013-14 levels. That is right: not a cut but an increase of 40 per cent. So much for the false Chicken Little complaints that we hear from the opposition and Queensland Labor. This coalition government is actually increasing spending. The truth that our government does more for health than they ever did is indeed a bitter pill for Labor to swallow.


Education in Queensland will also get an extra 47 per cent over the next four years, yet somehow we hear constantly how the coalition has cut funding to education. It is not just direct funding that has made a difference to Queensland. The axing of the carbon tax has saved Queensland taxpayers another $148 million. This ill-conceived and badly executed economy-wide tax on families and businesses is well gone. It is better to have an empty house than a bad tenant, as they say, and not one family in this country should be sad to see this bad tax repealed.


The Abbott coalition government is the best friend Queenslanders had in at least seven years. Just imagine what we could have done if we had followed a competent government like the Howard government to see how much more we could have achieved. The fact is that the Abbott coalition government is delivering for the people of Australia and is delivering for my own home state of Queensland. I am delighted that my colleagues will be elaborating on those details. I commend this motion to the house.

"Chalmers, Jim, MP",ALP,2014-10-27,"



Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (10:44):  In almost two decades of political activism and involvement, I do not think I have seen a more misleading motion than this one, and I stand up to oppose it. It takes a certain level of dishonesty and deceitfulness and doublespeak to move a motion claiming increased funding for schools, hospitals and infrastructure while simultaneously crowing about savings to the very same areas. For the member for Ryan, the forehead-slap moment will come when she realises you cannot claim extra spending and savings in the same areas simultaneously.


It was very cruel of the Treasurer not to point out to the member for Ryan that this government's own budget papers make the brutal cuts to schools and hospitals very, very clear. In discussing cuts to schools and hospitals, page 7 of the budget overview states:


These measures will achieve cumulative savings of over $80 billion by 2024-25.


These are not figures that the opposition has made up; they are there in black and white in the government's very own budget overview. The member for Ryan should read it. That fact alone torpedoes the claims upon which this dishonest and dishonourable and deceitful motion is built. The fact is that schools and hospitals around Australia will get $80 billion less in funding from this government than they would have got had Labor been re-elected. So it takes a great deal of duplicity for the member for Ryan to get up here and congratulate the government on the budget's funding of schools and hospitals.


Schools in my own area will be some of the worst affected. There are 27,500 kids who will cop funding cuts to the tune of $230 million over the next 10 years. The $30 billion cut to schools across Australia over the next decade is the same as cutting every seventh teacher. Parents, students and teachers in my community cannot afford this government's harsh cuts to education and schools. They certainly cannot afford the cuts to public hospitals either.


I had the pleasure recently of inspecting the Logan Hospital's brand-new emergency department and paediatric wing. The $175 million Logan Hospital redevelopment project was proudly funded by the last Labor government because Labor understands the importance of having a modern and well-funded public hospital system. This stands in stark contrast to the government, who will pull $50 billion—it is in their own budget papers—out of hospitals across Australia over the next decade. 


The Metro South Health network which serves the people of my electorate will miss out on $26 million just over the next four years, with far more cuts to come in the years after that. At the same time, the government is charging people more to access basic health services and imaging services, with people in my electorate set to pay nearly $8½ million every year on the GP tax alone. Just a few weeks ago, we heard startling evidence from the Australian Diagnostic Imaging Association that sick people will need to pay hundreds and even thousands to diagnose their conditions. Bills of this magnitude will be such a blow to people who are suffering from life-threatening diseases. With so many people being targeted by the budget, it is sickening to observe the backslapping and self-congratulation of government members in this motion. 


Their record on infrastructure is not much better, with most of their achievements nothing more than the re-announcement of Labor commitments. And no discussion of infrastructure is complete without mentioning the NBN, which has been stripped and pared back till it is a fragment of Labor's original fibre-fuelled nation-building vision for the program.


The Prime Minister and Premier Newman are as one when it comes to hacking, slashing and cutting the services my community needs and our country needs. The only good news is that Queenslanders will get the opportunity to voice and vent their fury within the next six months. I urge the good people of my electorate to send Premier Newman and Prime Minister Abbott a message by supporting our fantastic local candidates, my friends Linus Power in Logan, Leeanne Enoch in Algester, Mick de Brenni in Springwood, Shannon Fentiman in Waterford, Duncan Pegg in Stretton and Cameron Dick in Woodridge.


This government, the LNP and the member for Ryan cannot be serious when they boast about their achievements in schools, hospitals and infrastructure. They should stop treating Queenslanders as mugs. We know that serious nation-building infrastructure like the NBN is worse off as a result of this government; we know that our schools are worse off as a result of this budget; we know that our hospitals will be worse off as a result of this budget; and no amount of dishonest, deceitful, dishonourable motions will camouflage those facts, as laid out so starkly in the pages of their own budget.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (10:49):  I like the member for Rankin; I think he is hilarious! For him to stand there and say what he said was disingenuous in the extreme. He was part of the staff of the then Treasurer a couple of years ago when the Treasurer's budget speech started with 'these four years of budget surpluses I announce tonight'. He was the bloke who wrote the speech! So for him to come in here and say that we are sitting here saying that there is money going to health and education is a little bit simplistic. I note he does replace the previous member for Rankin, Craig Emerson, and I do thank the member for Rankin for not singing, 'There will be no education and health wipe-out there on my TV'! That is one saving grace of having him here. No doubt we will see the member for Lilley try and explain his position. Maybe the member Lilley can explain those words about the four years of budget surpluses he was delivering that night.


On 7 September last year, Tony Abbott, the Prime Minister elect, stood up in front of the Australian people and said: 'Australia is now open for business.' Joe Hockey, the member for North Sydney and the then incoming Treasurer, said, 'Infrastructure must facilitate commerce.' In Townsville, in my area, in 2011, in the aftermath of Cyclone Yasi, we saw a fantastic street project, a project which was about flood mitigation, pulled out of Townsville, for the funding to be shifted down to the south-east corner of Queensland by the then Labor transport minister, who was Townsville based as well. It is only now that we are getting that thing finished.


When it comes to all these things being their previous announcements, Labor have to understand that it is just like former Prime Minister Paul Keating spoke of the l-a-w law tax cuts; they were not e-n-a-c-t-e-d enacted. They were not enacted. Labor are very good at making promises, very good at making announcements, but it is about the f-u-n-d-i-n-g funding of them and the c-o-m-p-l-e-t-i-o-n completion and the d-e-l-i-v-e-r-y delivery of them. I say the words as well as spelling them for you. 


When it comes to transport, when it comes to getting our goods to market, we must get these things organised. For those of you who do not live in North Queensland, what you must understand is that, every time there is a tropical depression off the coast of Queensland, in a lot of cases there is an immediate 25 per cent loading placed on all transport. That is because they know that, sooner or later, their trucks are going to be parked on the side of the road. 


I was very happy after the 2012 election when Campbell Newman, the state Premier, got together with the federal opposition people to try and get a plan together to fix the Bruce. We have had the member for Grayndler come in here and tell us all about it, but it was all on 50-50 splits. What we have done in the time that we have been in government is do an 80-20 split, which is the way it should have been done, and $10 billion for road funding in Queensland on the Bruce Highway is a great start. 


In my electorate we are now seeing Vantassel Street coming to completion. I have just opened the University Road upgrade, under the Black Spot Program, which is at the intersection of University Drive at Lavarack Barracks. We have announced the completion of Ring Road Stage 4. The Ring Road was, of course, brought in under the Howard government by the then member for Herbert, Peter Lindsay. We are fixing Dalrymple Road, which is a $20 million project. The state government actually fixed Blakey's Crossing. It used to be the Bruce Highway and it was an incredible link into North Queensland. It had never been fixed under any government, but the Campbell Newman state government, after taking my plan to fix it, finally delivered it. The Ring Road has gone to tender, and we have got more to come.


The big one in my region is the replacement of the Haughton River Bridge. The Haughton River Bridge is a shocking piece of work. It is very, very narrow. It has no guard rails. It would not pass anywhere. What we have to do now is put the planning in place to get it started and to get the farm buyback to straighten up the road so that we can get a bridge that actually stands up. I drove the Bruce Highway a couple of years ago—and I have spent a lot of time on the Bruce Highway—but I drove it with a critical eye. North Queensland has very little road verge and the worst bridges of anywhere in Queensland. It is something that we have to fix and it is something this government is fixing. I thank the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Deputy Prime Minister for actually getting these things together and putting rubber on the road when it comes to fixing these things. I thank the House.

"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,2014-10-27,"



Mr SWAN
 (Lilley) (10:54):  I would like to congratulate the member for Ryan on her own goal. Moving this motion today points, yet again, to the cuts of $80 billion in health and education that are being imposed on state governments by this conservative federal government, which will smash the social safety net when it comes to affordable and accessible health and education in this country over the next decade. There is a day of reckoning coming with this $80 billion cut sitting there in the budget papers, in the Budget Overview on page 7: $80 billion—$50 billion in health and $30 million in schools. I congratulate the member for Ryan for coming in here and pointing to this essential fact. I know that she is ambitious. I know that she wants to reach greater heights, but she needs to demonstrate far greater depth than she did today in the presentation. So do all the other conservative members, because Queenslanders, in particular, now face a double whammy of not only these future cuts of $80 billion but also the abolition of the final two years of Gonski and those increases as well. As the member for Rankin said before, that is the equivalent of one in seven teachers across Queensland schools. That is before you get to the cuts in health, which are going to be savage in significant hospitals in or near my electorate: Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Prince Charles Hospital and, in particular, Redcliffe Hospital. Fifty billion dollars is a lot of money out of health in the future. It is a lot of nurses, doctors and wardies who go down the tube. It is a threat to the quality of care.


What is this all about? I think we saw, over the weekend, what it is about, with the speech from the Prime Minister about the future of the Federation. What it is really about is moving to that long-held objective of the Liberal Party of Australia, which is as old as any of the governments that we have seen since the 1970s, and that is to wind back the social safety net, to wind back health and education, to jack up the GST or indirect tax base and to provide more power and money to corporates. It is a shift in the tax mix. What they are going to do now, as these cuts flow through the system Australia wide—a threat to quality health and a threat to quality education—is they will mount the charge for an increase in the GST simultaneously as they open up huge holes in the tax base for corporate Australia, and they will say, 'If we want to provide quality health and education, we're going to have to jack up the GST, jack it up on punters; working people pay more and corporates pay less.' That is what goes to the heart of the speech given by the Prime Minister at Tenterfield over the weekend, and it will go to all of the positioning that we will see. 



I say this: tax reform is about a lot more than jacking up a GST and lessening the burden on corporate Australia—a lot more. It will take a lot more than the threat to health and education to bring the Australian people to support such a change. But make no mistake; that is what is behind the trifecta of trickery that we have seen from the government since the budget early this year. First of all, it is behind their false claims of an economic emergency. It is about false claims about spending and the increase in the rate of spending, and it is about false claims about debt being unsustainable. All of that is to create an environment in which it may be acceptable for the Australian people to accept $80 billion worth of cuts, ripping the heart out of health and education and the social safety net, the GP co-payment and all of those unfair burdens which are currently being put on working Australians, particularly in my home state of Queensland, where, once again, there is a double whammy, because every one of these federal cuts is accompanied by a state cut and they are felt much more keenly in my home state. Of course, when you look at education, the government are going to cut something like $6.2 billion from Queensland schools and over $190 million from the schools in my electorate of Lilley. As I said before, that amounts to something like one in seven teachers. Then of course you get to health. I spoke in the House about that last week. There are savage cuts impacting on the quality of care in hospitals like Prince Charles and the Royal Brisbane. But all that it is about is a fundamental dismantling of the social safety net in this country by the conservatives in this country, who have always, always been very weak at taxing the strong and very strong at taxing the weak.

"Van Manen, Bert, MP",LP,2014-10-27,"



Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (10:59):  It is interesting to follow the contribution from the member for Lilley; and it is instructive to note there is no admission, again, of the fact that for six years he presided over accumulated deficits of some $130-odd billion dollars. He makes no recognition of the fact that as a government we are now left to pick up the mess left by that previous government and bring the House back into order. I thank the member for Ryan for bringing this motion to the House and highlighting the investment of the coalition government in my home state of Queensland.


The member for Ryan touched on the fact that the Commonwealth is increasing funding to Queensland by some $5.8 billion over the next four years. Despite the tough budget conditions inherited from the previous Labor government we are increasing funding to hospitals by some 40 per cent and funding to schools by some 47 per cent. I note that schools in Forde, as a result of this funding increase, will receive over the next four years some $4.8 million of additional funding under the government's Great Results Guarantee—funding which schools in my electorate would not have received under the previous Labor government. I would suggest to the member for Rankin, the member for Griffith and the member for Moreton, who are here in the House, and even to the member for Lilley: there would be schools in their electorates which will also receive additional funding which they would not have received if Labor had been re-elected to government. But we do not hear them speak about those matters.


Also, as a result of the repeal of the carbon tax, the Queensland government has some $150 million of additional funds in its budget to allocate for the provision of services to the great state of Queensland. I also commend the government for investing some $13.4 billion to build the infrastructure which is desperately needed in Queensland: $6.7 billion towards fixing the Bruce Highway and almost $1.3 billion towards the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing. I know the Minister for Industry, Mr Macfarlane, has been fighting very hard for that for many years. One billion dollars goes towards the Gateway Motorway North Upgrade. In the electorate of Forde we have received a contribution of $3 million towards the revitalisation of the Beenleigh CBD, which is a joint project with Logan City Council; the Queensland state government is throwing in some funding as well. The whole objective of this project is to turn Beenleigh into a thriving regional hub. This project has been in the making for more than 20 years and it is heartening to see that finally, under this government, we have received the funding necessary for the project to progress. I would also like to thank the Beenleigh Yatala Chamber of Commerce and many other businesses and local community groups for their support for this project. It is part of my bigger vision for the Beenleigh area that the Beenleigh CBD and surrounding region can provide jobs and employment opportunities for those living in the area.


It is promising to see the coalition government's continuing commitment to infrastructure across Forde. Some of the biggest issues we face stem from a failure of infrastructure to keep up with the pace of growth. I recently had the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure in the electorate to discuss issues to do with the M1 from Loganholme to Daisy Hill; we are talking to the state government about further matters in that regard. We will continue to work with the local community to build our infrastructure requirements, but I note we have spent nearly $1 million from proceeds of crime legislation on upgrading our CCTV network around the electorate of Forde as well. There are more projects we are working on in that space.


This is a government that is prepared to invest in our local communities for the benefit of all concerned, and in Queensland particularly. I thank the government for its investment in the future of our great state.

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (11:04):  This motion put forward today by the member for Ryan, before she scurried out of this place, completely ignores the true intentions of the Liberal-National government's harsh budget cuts. The Abbott government's $80 billion cuts to schools and hospitals is a clear broken promise from a government that promised no cuts to health and no cuts to education. They said they would be a government of no surprises, but the premiers are still reeling from the Treasurer's budget night ambush. The impact of the government's $50 billion cut to health will increase emergency department waiting times in Queensland; it will increase elective surgery waiting times and reduce the number of hospital beds across the country. These cuts will mean fewer doctors, fewer nurses, fewer midwives; they will mean fewer psychologists, radiographers and oncologists. The coalition's $50 billion cut to Australian hospitals is equivalent to sacking one in three doctors or one in five nurses, or shutting down one in 13 hospital beds. As the AMA—that great left-wing institution!—has highlighted, public hospitals are already stretched to meet demand and these drastic cuts will cripple the health system, especially as we age as a society.


In my home state of Queensland, electorates are feeling the sting from both federal and state LNP governments putting health under the chopping block. The Queensland state budget revealed that the federal coalition government is costing Queenslanders $16 billion in cuts to hospitals and schools in my state—the same state the member for Ryan and the member for Forde call home, although this motion suggests the member for Ryan has now moved to La La Land.


Queensland budget papers clearly state:


Of particular concern, the 2014-15 Commonwealth Budget indicated that the Australian government will amend funding arrangements for public hospitals (from 1 July 2017) and schools (from 1 January 2018) to generate savings across all states of over $80 billion in the period to 2024-25. Queensland's per capita share of this saving would amount to a reduction of around $16 billion in Australian government funding.


That is Campbell Newman's own budget papers. This immense pressure being put on states to foot the bill is just this government's strategy to increase the GST—as we heard on the weekend—in an economy where Australians are already struggling to meet cost-of-living pressures. Governments, good governments, should be part of the solution when it comes to cost of living, not part of the problem. 


Queenslanders are now paying a high price for the Liberal-National Party's unfair budget. This poisonous budget means that Queensland families will not get the health care they need, and Queensland students, who we invest in in terms of creating a new tomorrow, will not get the great education they deserve. For example, every single state school in Moreton, every single state school in Forde, and every single state school in Ryan—all of those electorates—will be on average $3.2 million worse off. This is the equivalent of sacking one in seven teachers, or $1,000 less support for every child every year. 


When we look back at the records of the Howard government, they can proudly say they built 3,000 flag poles. The Rudd and Gillard governments built 3,000 libraries. The LNP government cut $3 million from every school, a wonderful legacy which I am sure those opposite are proud of. Principals will be forced to spend their time dealing with funding cuts, when all they want to do is get on with improving their skills. Subject choices, teachers' assistants, sport, music programs and extension and remedial support—all those things that make communities hum and schools sing—will be cut. 


If massive cuts to hospitals and schools are not enough, this federal budget will also impact on Queensland's state seniors card holders and more than 600,000 Queensland pensioner concession card holders. These concessions are currently worth a total of $335.6 million to Queenslanders. Of that, the Commonwealth provides $54 million in 2014-15, money that the Prime Minister is ripping away. The designated public transport concession for seniors card holders will be abolished all together, and I am sure the member for Grayndler recognises how that shows the current government has no faith in public transport.


Queensland's budget confirms that the Prime Minister lied when he said there will be no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no changes to pensions. Before the election, the Prime Minister promised no cuts to education; that is not the case. There is a strong odour or mendacity emanating from those opposite. The Queensland Premier, Campbell Newman knew this, knew the extent of the cuts, but still he has tried to keep it secret, but his budget papers reveal it all. 


Documents recently released show that Queensland schools will be billions of dollars worse off as a result of this government's harsh budget cuts. The information from Queensland's education department reveal the axing of 10 centres for children and families in Indigenous communities around Queensland due to federal government cuts, despite the Prime Minister being the minister responsible for that area. 


This is another example of a successful community program being ripped away from those who are most vulnerable in Queensland.

"Landry, Michelle, MP",Nats,2014-10-27,"



Ms LANDRY
 (Capricornia) (11:09):  I thank my colleagues, the member for Ryan, the member for Herbert and the member for Forde for their input today. Queensland is nearly five times the size of Japan, seven times the size of Great Britain, and two and a half times the size of Texas. As the second-largest state in landmass, with a population of over four million people, the state is very significant to our nation. I am a proud Queenslander, and most Queenslanders are proud Australians. 


However, I must question whether every Queenslander really has the best interests of their state at heart. I refer to a recent decision in the Senate. It is interesting that certain Queensland members of the federal Senate voted to hold an inquiry into the current Queensland state LNP government, a government that is trying to fix up the state's economy and get Queensland back on its feet. 


The move by certain senators to hold an inquiry is questionable, because Labor itself neglected Queensland for many years. They simply ran it into the ground. I guess we should not be surprised, because while the former state Labor government, under Premier Anna Bligh, was running down Queensland's economy, her oddball friends in the federal Labor Party were running down Australia as a whole. The 'Rudd Gillard experiment' left all Australians paying a $1 billion per month interest bill on a huge national debt. The common factor here is that, whenever it is in power, wherever it is in power, Labor destroys the financial credibility of our economy, both state and nationally. 


The Abbott coalition government, however, is supporting Queensland. Over the next four years the total annual Commonwealth funding to Queensland is increasing by around $5.8 billion. Hospitals and schools will enjoy the benefit of this. You already heard that our government is investing $13.4 billion to build the infrastructure of the 21st century for Queensland. And, because Queensland is such a large and important state, we are spending $6.7 billion towards fixing the Bruce Highway. I can report that in my electorate of Capricornia people can actually see where this money is being spent. 


Progress continues on stage 2 of the Yeppen Floodplain improvements on the Bruce Highway at the entrance to Rockhampton. All up, between stage 1 and 2, about $320 million is being spent to ensure the highway into Rockhampton remains open in flood times. This is the major transport corridor that links freight from Brisbane to Cairns. Keeping this highway open will keep goods flowing north and keep Queensland's economy rolling. Without this work, funded by the government, highway transport comes to a complete standstill when heavy rains cause flooding to cut off the city. This costs the local and the Queensland economy millions, if not billions, of dollars. 


Our federal coalition government is also spending $120 million to fix the Eaton Range section of the notorious Peak Downs Highway between Mackay and Moranbah. This is an important transport corridor into Queensland's vital coalmining areas. Speaking of fixing things up, over the next few years—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Porter
):  Member for Grayndler, you have a point of order?




Mr Albanese:
  Yes, I seek to ask the member if she will accept an intervention.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member is under an obligation to say whether she will allow that intervention or not.




Ms LANDRY:
  No, I will not.




Mr Albanese:
  She is talking about projects. I thought that would be good. It would give her a chance to talk about it.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Member for Grayndler, the member for Capricornia has made her decision. Member for Capricornia, please continue.




Ms LANDRY:
  Speaking of fixing things up, over the next few years, five shires in Capricornia—Isaac, Rockhampton, Mackay, Livingstone and Whitsunday—will share in $30 million of federal money to fix council streets and roads under our Roads to Recovery Program. 


I am also pleased to see that three key dam concepts—Connors near Moranbah, Urannah near Collinsville and the Fitzroy Corridor near Rockhampton—have made it to the green paper on agricultural competitiveness. If they are successful in attracting funding, such projects will further boost the potential of the great state of Queensland. In contrast, under Labor you never saw any attempt at such bold water infrastructure. Thank you.

"Butler, Terri, MP",ALP,2014-10-27,"



Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (11:14):  The member for Capricornia obviously does not remember the hydroelectric scheme, but I remember it very well, if we talk about what Labor has done! But I rise to speak to this private member's motion on Commonwealth funding for Queensland.


This motion does not reflect the impact that the Abbott government and its rotten budget will have on Queensland and Queenslanders. As my predecessor said before the last election, 'For Queensland, the Newman government's cuts to public services are just the entree; Tony Abbott will be the main course.'


The Abbott government has failed Queensland. The Abbott-Hockey budget cuts $80 billion from health and education. Before the election the now Prime Minister promised there would be no cuts to education. The Liberals and Nationals claimed they were on a 'unity ticket' with Labor, when it came to the reforms known as Gonski. Those reforms arose from the comprehensive review that David Gonski led of Australia's broken school funding arrangements.


We know that the Liberals and Nationals would have said anything to get elected. For example, they said there would be no cuts to health, no cuts to education, no changes to the pension and no cuts to the ABC or the SBS. Each one of those promises has been broken since the election—every single one of them has been broken and, unfortunately, they were obviously far from the gospel truth from the now Prime Minister. Now, Queensland students and their families, including those in my electorate of Griffith, are paying the price.


The southsiders I speak to are well aware that the Liberal-National government is not making good on its pre-election commitments. Despite claiming that unity ticket with Labor when it came to the Gonski reforms, the Prime Minister has refused to fund the essential fifth and sixth years of those reforms. And Treasury has now confirmed that under the Abbott-Hockey first budget Australian schools will be stripped of $30 billion over the next decade. This is the biggest ever cut to our schools. This is equivalent to sacking one in seven teachers, and will leave the average school $3.2 million worse off with every student receiving $1,000 less support per year.


So, despite the rhetoric in the motion put forward by the member for Ryan, the budget papers themselves state:


In this Budget the Government is adopting sensible indexation arrangements for schools from 2018, and hospitals from 2017-18—


and removing funding guarantees for public hospitals:


These measures will achieve cumulative savings of over $80 billion by 2024-25


That is $80 billion in cuts on the government's own budget papers.


Cutting indexation just to CPI—which the budget papers assume to be 2.5 per cent—at the same time as the ABS Education Price Index is 5.1 per cent, means a significant and compounding cut in real terms. This compares to what was intended under the Gonski reforms, where the intended average federal expenditure increase was 9.2 per cent. So, Deputy Speaker, you can see that this is walking away from the reforms in respect of which they supposedly had a unity ticket. Last year the now education minister described the prospect of three per cent indexation for schools as 'frightening', yet this year he is prepared to introduce a system that will go beyond that.


In Queensland the cuts that are being made amount to $6.7 billion. The 58 schools in my electorate on the south side of Brisbane—that is 58 schools in the electorate of Griffith—will lose $236 million. This means that students in Griffith will miss out on literacy and numeracy programs, extension classes, extra teachers subject choices, music, drama and art programs and sport. The Abbott government has also changed the federal school funding rules, taking a no-strings-attached approach. This means letting states and territories off the hook, allowing them to divert money to other projects, to cut school budgets and abandon reforms to improve student results.


I know that those opposite, on the government side, continue to argue that, really, education is about quality and not just about dollars. But that is just a cynical distraction from the government's destructive agenda to cut funding to schools. Every teacher, principal and parent will tell you that resources actually matter at schools and in the classroom. The research backs that up, and so do Liberal premiers. When I visit my local schools and hear about the benefits they are getting from the new libraries and other facilities they got under Kevin Rudd's Building the Education Revolution policy, it is clear that schools thrive with the right resources. No local school I have been to has said to me, 'Gee, I wish we didn't have that new library.' They love the additional resources because they help to deliver quality education for the students.


So the Gonski reforms are not just about money at all. The purpose of the reforms is to improve the way that money is spent. The reforms are aimed at getting resources to those schools and to those students who need them most, while making sure no that school is worse off. We have an achievement gap of up to three years, and we need to fix it.


Debate adjourned.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2014-10-27,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (12:01):  I am pleased to be able to resume the debate on these bills that are the Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 and the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Care Charges (Amendment) Bill 2014. In doing so, I follow the comments of the member for Moreton, who is in the chamber right now. He was speaking when this debate was adjourned on Thursday afternoon. I endorse his comments and obviously I will add to them in my own contribution to this legislation.


This legislation is another example of right-wing ideology coming from the Abbott government and the Abbott government's obsession with unions rather than with good policy. Regrettably, the real losers as a result of this legislation will be the elderly residents of aged-care facilities, and in particular the weak, the frail and the disabled who are the most dependent on the care provided by aged-care workers from within those facilities. But as has already been made very clear by the Abbott government, it has very little concern or empathy for the most vulnerable in our community and, as we have seen from a range of Abbott government budget measures, the elderly are also being targeted by this government.


The facts speak for themselves. We saw in the budget in May changes proposed to the pension indexation, which will affect some 2.4 million pensioners. The government knows full well that the proposed indexation changes that it has in mind will result in less pension payments being made to pensioners. The government has also proposed to increase the pension age to 70, which again means that people will have to work longer before they are entitled to a pension. Indeed, it has proposed to do so without making any provisions whatsoever for matters such as workers compensation. We then see the government coming into the House and proposing to add a $7 medical co-payment for a range of medical services, again knowing full well that one of the groups that will be hit hardest by the proposition will be pensioners because, as people get older, it is just logical that they are likely to go to doctors more often and they will indeed have to fork out the $7 each time they go to a doctor or for one of the complementary services.


We also saw the government axing the $886 payment per year to some 300,000 Australian seniors by axing the senior supplement. Again, a measure brought in without any warning, without telling pensioners before the election that that was what it was going to do; it just went ahead and did it. And we also see the government wanting to freeze the eligibility thresholds for the pension and pension-related payments for three years from 2017. Again, this will affect older people, as will permanently freezing the energy supplement.


I make those comments because they fit in with the narrative of this government—that is, it has no empathy for those people doing it the toughest and it has no empathy for those people struggling the most. It is prepared to make its cuts on the back of those people who can least afford them. The government will argue that under this bill the funding is not being cut, but rather that it is being 'freed up'; instead of being tied to staff pay and conditions, it argues that operators of aged-care facilities are in the best position to determine how any money provided to them by the government should be spent.


That may sound reasonable, but in reality if the funding is untied very little of additional Commonwealth money provided to aged-care centres will result in better care for residents. It is the personal care provided to residents by the staff who work within those centres that matters most to the aged-care residents and to their families. It is the personal care that they can rely on that means the most because without that care, in fact, it is simply just a room and a bed for them to be within. It is the care that they are seeking, and that care comes from the provision of adequate staffing levels within those centres and that is what Labor tried to address when it tied this funding to the provision of additional staff or to better staff wages and conditions.


I regularly visit aged-care facilities within my electorate. I speak to the staff within them, I speak to the residents within them, I speak to family members who are there at the time, and I also speak to the owners and the managers of those centres. What has become absolutely clear to me is that while some centres operate better than others, the truth of the matter is most of them are struggling to make ends meet. And because they are struggling to make ends meet, they obviously cut costs wherever they can. In fact, so much so that the staffing levels of most centres, I think it would be fair to say, could be improved by having more staff on board. Indeed, most of the centres I have visited heavily rely on volunteers to provide the daily services of those centres. I doubt very much that some of those centres would be able to continue were it not for the support that volunteers provide to them. I commend the volunteers for doing that. I think it is a great thing that they do. I think they do it because they genuinely care and it comes from the heart when they do go in there to volunteer. But the reality is that we simply cannot rely entirely on the volunteers either, because the volunteers are generally there during the day but not overnight. 


This is an industry where, again, it has been made abundantly clear as a result of several inquiries and reports over the years that the people that work within this industry are considered to be on relatively low wages, have a very responsible and demanding workload and, not surprisingly, have very high staff turnovers. High staff turnovers add to worsening care levels as new staff are constantly having to familiarise themselves with the individual personalities and the needs of residents. The residents themselves quite often, after a while, become comfortable with particular staff that are there. If they see new faces they in turn become unsettled and sometimes stressed as a result of that. So it is important, if we can, to try and maintain staff within the sector.


So tying the additional funding to staff wages and conditions was the best way to ensure that the residents were direct beneficiaries of additional Commonwealth funding. Indeed, the workforce supplement was deliberately intended to address the retention, remuneration, education, training and career development of aged-care workers. Of course, tying the funding to the workforce does not suit all aged-care operators, nor does it suit the Abbott government.


We know Australians are living longer, as indeed are people across the world, and we need to plan for the needs of an ageing population. The number of people requiring aged care is expected to increase by 250 per cent over the next 40 years. By 2050, around 3.5 million Australians are expected to be using aged-care services. Logically, if people are living longer there will be additional health care costs, more people will be admitted to aged-care facilities and more people will be affected by dementia and Alzheimer's disease.


My understanding is that around 80 per cent of the services that we will need to provide, and that we are currently providing, still occur in the family home. That does not mean that we can continue to absorb all of those services within the home. There is no doubt in my mind that there will be a need for more aged-care places in the future as well. I also accept that right now there are about 2½ million carers throughout Australia providing unpaid care. Again, they do that because they care about the family member, neighbour, or whoever it is that they are caring for. But that also comes at an extraordinary financial and health cost to the carers themselves. Burnout, mental strain and chronic disease are prevalent amongst carers themselves, which in turn then adds to the health costs of the nation. In fact, we have services in my own region that deliberately provide respite to carers in acknowledgement of the stress and strain that they themselves are under.


But the simplistic attitude of the Abbott government in response to ensuring that the aged-care sector is sustainable into the future is to cut government expenditure and cut government assistance to the elderly when in fact it should be adopting strategies that minimise or reduce expenditure in years to come by being proactive now. For example, increasing superannuation contributions now instead of freezing them as the Abbott government is doing would reduce the burden of pension payments into the future. Providing incentives to set aside money for their future instead of penalising people with higher deeming rates as the Abbott government is doing would mean there would be more savings made by people to enable them to be self-sufficient in the future as well.


In contrast, what we see is a series of measures by this government that do the exact opposite. First is the abolishment of the $1.1 billion aged-care workforce supplement, which this bill specifically targets. Second is the dumping of the dimensions of behaviour supplement of $16.15 a day. Third is the slashing of the aged-care payroll tax supplement from 1 January 2015, worth $653 million over four years. They did that without any consultation or warning.


We know that, according to the Aged Care Financing Authority, the residential aged-care sector will need to build approximately 74,000 additional aged-care places over the next decade. That requires an investment of some $25 billion over the next decade. How can you secure that kind of investment when the government is making it tougher for aged-care operators and aged-care investors to get a return on their money? You cannot. Again, this is being negative rather than proactive in order to save a few dollars today. It means that whatever dollars we do save today will be paid for many times over in years to come.


I want to quickly talk about the dementia supplement worth $16.15 per day. This was a supplement introduced by Labor in August 2013 in recognition of the additional costs incurred by facilities that have to care for people with dementia or Alzheimer's disease. The payment was terminated on 31 July this year, again without any consultation and no warning to the centre operators or to the patients themselves. I have been approached on this issue on several occasions by families that have been directly affected by the cut of this payment of $16.15 per day—over $100 per week. The net effect of this is that the providers are left with either having to cut the services or increase the cost to the residents, neither of which is acceptable to them. Either way, the resident—the person who needs the care—is left worse off. Regrettably, we have in Australia today some 300,000 Australians living with dementia. My understanding is that about 30 per cent of them are in residential care facilities and it is expected that those figures will treble over the next 40 or so years unless, of course, there is a medical breakthrough. So, rather than walking away from this issue, we should be trying to be proactive in our management of it.


I support the amendment moved by Labor's shadow minister for ageing. I believe it is sensible and fair. The shadow minister attended a forum that I hosted in my electorate several weeks ago at the Para Hills community centre. The venue was full. The people at the forum made it absolutely clear that these are the very issues that they are concerned about and want our side of parliament to stand up for them on. They are the very issues they are so critical of the government on for bringing in in the 2014 budget. I believe the amendment is sensible. Whilst I understand we will be supporting this legislation, I urge the Minister for Health, who is sitting at the table, to take note of the amendment.

These two bills introduce several minor amendments to aged-care and health related legislation. One measure is consequential amendments to reflect the 2014 budget measure to repurpose the aged-care workforce supplement. A second measure in the bill will support the implementation of stage 2 of the aged-care gateway and online information portal and contact centre. The two bills will also make amendments to allow the recovery of past home care costs where the care recipient receives a compensation payment, as is currently possible in relation to residential care costs. Lastly, there are some minor clarifying and technical amendments to aged-care legislation to remove redundant provisions and ensure the legislation operates as intended.


The government will not be supporting the opposition's second reading amendment. I commend the bills to the House.

I also accept that right now there are about 2½ million carers throughout Australia providing unpaid care. Again, they do that because they care about the family member, neighbour, or whoever it is that they are caring for. But that also comes at an extraordinary financial and health cost to the carers themselves. Burnout, mental strain and chronic disease are prevalent amongst carers themselves, which in turn then adds to the health costs of the nation. In fact, we have services in my own region that deliberately provide respite to carers in acknowledgement of the stress and strain that they themselves are under.


But the simplistic attitude of the Abbott government in response to ensuring that the aged-care sector is sustainable into the future is to cut government expenditure and cut government assistance to the elderly when in fact it should be adopting strategies that minimise or reduce expenditure in years to come by being proactive now. For example, increasing superannuation contributions now instead of freezing them as the Abbott government is doing would reduce the burden of pension payments into the future. Providing incentives to set aside money for their future instead of penalising people with higher deeming rates as the Abbott government is doing would mean there would be more savings made by people to enable them to be self-sufficient in the future as well.


In contrast, what we see is a series of measures by this government that do the exact opposite. First is the abolishment of the $1.1 billion aged-care workforce supplement, which this bill specifically targets. Second is the dumping of the dimensions of behaviour supplement of $16.15 a day. Third is the slashing of the aged-care payroll tax supplement from 1 January 2015, worth $653 million over four years. They did that without any consultation or warning.


We know that, according to the Aged Care Financing Authority, the residential aged-care sector will need to build approximately 74,000 additional aged-care places over the next decade. That requires an investment of some $25 billion over the next decade. How can you secure that kind of investment when the government is making it tougher for aged-care operators and aged-care investors to get a return on their money? You cannot. Again, this is being negative rather than proactive in order to save a few dollars today. It means that whatever dollars we do save today will be paid for many times over in years to come.


I want to quickly talk about the dementia supplement worth $16.15 per day. This was a supplement introduced by Labor in August 2013 in recognition of the additional costs incurred by facilities that have to care for people with dementia or Alzheimer's disease. The payment was terminated on 31 July this year, again without any consultation and no warning to the centre operators or to the patients themselves. I have been approached on this issue on several occasions by families that have been directly affected by the cut of this payment of $16.15 per day—over $100 per week. The net effect of this is that the providers are left with either having to cut the services or increase the cost to the residents, neither of which is acceptable to them. Either way, the resident—the person who needs the care—is left worse off. Regrettably, we have in Australia today some 300,000 Australians living with dementia. My understanding is that about 30 per cent of them are in residential care facilities and it is expected that those figures will treble over the next 40 or so years unless, of course, there is a medical breakthrough. So, rather than walking away from this issue, we should be trying to be proactive in our management of it.


I support the amendment moved by Labor's shadow minister for ageing. I believe it is sensible and fair. The shadow minister attended a forum that I hosted in my electorate several weeks ago at the Para Hills community centre. The venue was full. The people at the forum made it absolutely clear that these are the very issues that they are concerned about and want our side of parliament to stand up for them on. They are the very issues they are so critical of the government on for bringing in in the 2014 budget. I believe the amendment is sensible. Whilst I understand we will be supporting this legislation, I urge the Minister for Health, who is sitting at the table, to take note of the amendment.

Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson—Minister for Health and Minister for Sport) (12:15):  I thank those who have contributed to the debate on the Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 and the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Care Charges (Amendment) Bill 2014. These two bills introduce several minor amendments to aged-care and health related legislation. One measure is consequential amendments to reflect the 2014 budget measure to repurpose the aged-care workforce supplement. A second measure in the bill will support the implementation of stage 2 of the aged-care gateway and online information portal and contact centre. The two bills will also make amendments to allow the recovery of past home care costs where the care recipient receives a compensation payment, as is currently possible in relation to residential care costs. Lastly, there are some minor clarifying and technical amendments to aged-care legislation to remove redundant provisions and ensure the legislation operates as intended.


The government will not be supporting the opposition's second reading amendment. I commend the bills to the House.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Craig Kelly
):  The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Blair has moved as an amendment that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The immediate question is that the amendment be agreed to.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2014-10-27,"



Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (12:19):  I begin by expressing how bewildered I am by this Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. I would never suggest that $7 million is not a lot of money—it certainly is. Anyone listening to this broadcast or watching from the galleries would agree that $7 million is quite a lot of money. In the context of a Commonwealth budget of around $400 billion, it is a modest amount of money but to the research and development corporations being adversely affected by this initiative it certainly is a lot of money. 


Our agriculture sector operates in a very competitive environment, particularly those who are focused on export markets. Having said that, our agricultural community has remained strong because we have a number of competitive advantages. Amongst them of course is our geographical location. We are close to the very large and growing markets of Asia. The skills, knowledge and productivity of our farmers certainly contribute to our competitive advantage in our region. So too does our clean, green and safe image. This is potentially our greatest competitive advantage as the growing middle classes of Asia, who have had food scares, are looking for Australian food that is environmentally clean and safe for their consumption.


Another advantage is the strength of our research and development system, which is the envy of the rest of the world. The current model is another product of the Hawke government and one of the greatest legacies of the Hawke government's agriculture minister the Hon. John Kerin, who I am very proud to say is today the patron of Labor's all-important country caucus. The co-funding model for research and development that John Kerin put in place is, as I said, the envy of the rest of the world. Under the model, our research and development corporations receive government funds on a dollar-for-dollar basis up to a cap based on the value of the sector's output. It is a system which empowers the people who really matter and who understand their commodity sector best, and they are, of course, those who come from the land, more often than not, to represent the interests of those who put them there.


There are 15 research and development corporations, and these are made up of nine industry-owned companies that provide R&D services and marketing for the benefit of their industries, and six research and development corporations that provide leadership and investment. The industry-owned companies are: the Australian Egg Corporation Ltd, the Australian Livestock Export Corporation Ltd, the Australian Meat Processor Corporation Ltd, Australian Pork Ltd, Australian Wool Innovation Ltd, Dairy Australia Ltd, Forest and Wood Products Australia Ltd, Horticulture Australia Ltd and Meat and Livestock Australia Ltd. In addition to those there are other industry bodies, including: Cotton Research and Development Corporation, Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, Grains Research and Development Corporation, Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation, Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation and the Sugar Research and Development Corporation. These organisations are critical to our ongoing success in agriculture and, of course, critical to our international competitiveness.


What this bill does is begin the process of chipping away at that model. Some might say, at $7 million over the forward estimates, it is in a modest way, but that is not the case for those who are trying to administer the funds and do good things in this sector. What this bill does is force those research and development corporations to pay their own subscriptions to a range of international commodity organisations and regional fisheries management corporations. These payments are currently allocated by the Department of Agriculture. To put that slightly more in layman's terms: some of our RDCs are members of international organisations with whom they work on research and development. Fisheries is an obvious example to those listening, because obviously fish stocks do not recognise international borders, and international work on some of these issues can be very important. We also do so not just to benefit ourselves but to benefit other nation-states, particularly developing nations, who obviously benefit from the work we do in partnership with them. It is a very obvious statement to say that the best thing we can do for developing nations which face very significant challenges that we do not need to deal with in this lucky country is to empower them economically, and working with them in these areas of research and development is of course very, very important.


The other reason I am bewildered by this bill that is before the House today is that it represents another clear breach of what was said pre the election by this government. Prior to the election, this government rightly talked about the importance of research and development, and that was a matter in which there was absolute bipartisan support. In this increasingly complex world, a world that is driven by technology and innovation, Australia will have to stay ahead of the game in the area of research, development, innovation and/or, importantly, extension, to make sure innovation gets down to the farm, where it has the effect.


Since the election, things have changed. I acknowledge that the government has fulfilled, in part at least, its commitment in the budget to allocate an additional $100 million over the forward estimates as an additional contribution to the R&D effort of our farm sector, not only farming in the agricultural sense but also in fisheries and forestry. There was a lot of speculation prior to the election about how that money would be spent. I think it suited the government, at the time, to suggest that, rather than be provided money on a dollar-for-dollar basis, research and development corporations could expect to maybe get $1.05 or $1.10 or $1.20 for each dollar they contribute. It seems that is not to be the case but rather the government will be putting that money out on a competitive tender basis, inviting RDCs to compete for those additional funds. That, of course, will mean that some RDCs will enjoy more funding as a result of the additional allocations and other RDCs will not.


There has also been a suggestion that the bids that are most likely to be successful are those which are cross-sectoral—in other words, those for research which benefits more than one commodity sector. To again simplify that for any listener: it might be research into grass, which is, of course, important as a feedstock across a range of commodities. I think that is a pretty good example. I do not necessarily have any difficulty with that. In pure public policy terms, that might be the best way to spend the money. We shall wait and see what the proposition is when it is put forward, but it certainly is not consistent with the impression that the government gave or provided to the various commodity sectors prior to the election. That is just a minor point compared to what is the main point in demonstrating that this is another addition to the pre-election promises. This is not so much about RDC funding. The government said it would enhance the research and development effort but of course, since the election, while it has included in the budget some $100 million in the forward estimates, on the other side of the ledger it has dramatically cut research and development funding in the agricultural sector. Some $80 million has come out of the cooperative research centres; some $146 million has been cut from the CSIRO's work—something that will also cost significant jobs in the area; and some $11 million has been reduced from the annual appropriation for the RIRDC. What the government is effectively doing is giving out money with one hand and taking it back with the other. That is a clear breach of its election promises and, indeed, it is not in the spirit of what they told the sector prior to the election.


I will go back to the idea, in this bill, of forcing the RDCs to pay their own subscriptions to international organisations. It is a bit worse than that because, given the way the government has constructed this bill, the RDCs do not have an option to opt out of the investment organisations; they cannot make the decision that spending money on local research and development is more important than their contribution to international organisations because the government is not allowing them to. What the government is doing is paying the international organisations without any reference to, or consultation with, the RDCs. It is taking the subscription amount out of the allocation it makes to the research and development corporations. If that is not a breach of a pre-election promise, I do not know what is. It could not be any clearer than that: paying the money directly and then taking the money out of the RDCs' annual funding allocation. In other words, they are leaving the RDCs with no choice but to remain part of the international organisations. That is the decision of government, really, and if it is the government's conclusion that it is appropriate for the RDCs to be forced to be part of these organisations, then the government should be paying. It is no more complex than that.


That is why I began my contribution by expressing bewilderment that this bill is coming before the House. It is coming before the House just so the government can do this—so the government can say there was $7 million over the forward estimates and force the RDCs to remain in these organisations, while at the same time forcing them to pay for the membership of the organisations.


This is going to have a very real effect on these RDCs. It comes on top of the government's decision to force them to do something else as well—not all of them, but some of them. The government's other great idea is to force these RDCs to move to rural and regional areas. That all sounds fine on the face of it. We all love the idea of decentralisation—the idea of pushing government departments out into the regions in order to create economic activity and jobs there. But we also need to ask ourselves how often that has been successful. We have all been speaking fondly of Gough Whitlam this week. He made a big push for decentralisation. But, reluctant as I am to say it, that met with limited success. It can be successful, and Gough had some successes; but it is more likely to be successful when it is accompanied by a well-thought-out strategic plan. We do not have any well-thought-out strategic plan with respect to the decentralisation of our research and development corporations; rather, we have a thought bubble. I put it to the House that Minister Joyce just woke up one morning and decided he was going to force these RDCs out to certain parts of the country—not just the RDCs, I should point out, but also the APVMA, an agency critical to chemical regulation in this country. Minister Joyce, of course, intends to move them to Armidale in the minister's electorate. That is very handy indeed. But there is no strategic plan, or support, or transition plan for these research and development corporations. To make it worse, the minister has issued a decree that they shall meet all the costs of these moves themselves from within their own budget. I ask other members of the House: does that sound like another breach of an election promise? That sounds very much to me like another breach of an election promise. That is taking money out of the hands of our research and development corporations. It is a very clear breach of a pre-election commitment.


But it gets worse. Knowing the limited success of these moves in the past, it is inevitable that these organisations will lose people—experienced people, good people and people with expertise; people who are critical to the success of these organisations. That is really serious. And it gets yet worse again, because when you lose people from the public service you also face redundancy payments. Redundancy payments can run into millions of dollars in aggregate. It is clear, as a result of the minister's edict, that cost will be borne by the research and development corporations—another clear breach of an election commitment. There is another question, too, around the $100 million allocated in the budget—which we might never see. The money allocated in the current fiscal year—that is, the first $40 million, maybe less—is unlikely to be spent in this fiscal year. We shall see. But, given the time it will take to put the final construct into place for the delivery of this $100 million—the time it will take to go through a competitive tender process, assess those applications and finally allocate those funds—I think is unlikely to occur before June 30 next year. I will be very happy to be proven wrong. We shall wait and see. But, as we all know in this place, money not spent in any financial year is not likely to be rolled over to the next financial year. It will not be $100 million anymore; it will be somewhat less. 


When you net it all out—with what has been taken out of the RRDC, the CRCs and the CSIRO and the money it is going to cost the RDCs to decentralise, for want of a better word; I am reluctant to use that word in this case but I will go with it. Of course the money coming out of the RDCs as a result of this bill—$100 million is looking pretty poor. Some of the costs are unknown but it could be that the net result is one of deficit for our research and development corporations. We shall wait and see. But it certainly will not be the $100 million that they were promised prior to the election.


This brings back the old 'mean and tricky' phrase that we heard so much about some years ago. The research development corporations and all those who rely upon them will not be appreciating it today and in fact I know they are not appreciating today the fact that they have been tricked into believing they were going to do much better under this government.


This is not justabout the RDCs and their staff and those who might be affected by these changes. This is about the future of Australian agriculture—and what a future Australian agriculture has with those emerging middle classes of the Asian region and a significant increase across the globe generally with a population growing to some nine billion people. 


But it is an opportunity that will not just come to us. To fully capitalise on this opportunity, we will have to go to it. We will have to be better, stronger and more innovative. We will have to work harder than ever before, if we are to fully capitalise on it. The opportunity is there, and the extent of our success will largely be driven by the private sector—its investment decisions, its decisions in innovation and its strategic planning. But there will be a very important role for government in branding and marketing; in policies which make the most of our limited natural resources; in policies to open market opportunities in those countries I have been talking about; and of course in research and development. 


The countries that will do best are not just those with geographical advantages, and some of those other competitive advantages I have been talking about. Those who will do best are those who are serious about being ahead of the game in research and development. That is something I thought we all understood and agreed on in this place. But this bill and the decision to decentralise RDCs—and the decisions to cut funding from CSIRO, from our CRCs and from our rural industries RDC—show that the government is not serious about it. They were not telling the truth prior to the election and they have let the agriculture sector down. I appeal to them very genuinely to rethink this one. They will get absolute bipartisan support. The savings involved in the budget are not worth the cost or the adverse impact this will have on our RDCs in the immediate future. It is certainly not worth the impact it will have further down the track for research, development and extension in this country.

"Hendy, Peter, MP",LP,2014-10-27,"



Dr HENDY
 (Eden-Monaro) (12:42):  I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on this bill and support its second reading. This bill implements decisions taken in the budget that confront the realities of the budget task facing the Australian nation. It represents some hard decisions that have had to be taken.


So, while remaining utterly committed to research and development in the rural sector, we recognise that all sectors of the economy have to share in the budget repair task. In my view as an economist, the No. 1 priority for the Australian economy is to get the budget into a sustainable surplus over the medium to long run. Australia cannot go on borrowing $1 billion every single month just to pay the interest on the previous government's borrowings. This is wasted money that could otherwise be spent building roads, schools and hospitals; funding additional research and development; or paying for tax cuts for long-suffering taxpayers.


Australia has just run six straight years of record budget deficits. A further $123 billion in projected deficits and gross debt forecast to hit $667 billion was left for the new government to manage. This year's budget papers show that, even with the government's efforts to repair the budget, there will be four more deficits over the period 2014-15 to 2017-18. That would make 10 deficits in a row and would be unprecedented in our post-war history.


Over the whole 45 years of budget data published in budget paper No. 1, going back to 1970-71, the longest the budget has previously stayed in deficit is seven years in a row, through the extremely severe early-1990s recession. Extraordinarily, the last six budgets saw a faster increase in net debt than during that episode, both in dollar terms and as a percentage of GDP. This debt disaster problem occurred despite the benefit of a once-in-a-century mining boom and commodity prices that reached record high levels.


As the minister stated in his second reading speech:


Australia's rural industries are among the most innovative and productive in the world. 


He noted:


The Australian government supports rural industries in a variety of ways.


For example:


To help primary producers increase their output and improve their profit margins, we support rural research and development. Much of this support is channeled through the 15 rural research and development corporations.


Part of the government's role is to be:


… a member of international commodity organisations and regional fisheries management organisations.


The minister further noted:


This bill implements a 2014 budget measure to change the way that the government pays for its membership to these organisations. The bill also reduces the red-tape burden currently imposed on some of the rural research and development corporations.


As the minister noted in his speech:


Australian research and development operates within a global system and must take into account international issues. The change to the legislation reflects this and also acknowledges that the ultimate beneficiaries of the activities of these international organisations are farmers, fishing industries and rural communities. 


The bill amends three acts to allow the government to recover the cost of the memberships from the Commonwealth funding provided to relevant rural research and development corporations.


The government is of the view that:


This will provide a funding mechanism for memberships to these organisations that is sustainable in a time of increasing budget pressures.


The amendments will result in a saving to government of about $7 million over the next four years. This saving will be redirected by the government to help repair the budget.


And, as noted previously:


The bill also reduces red tape for some of the research and development corporations.


So, what do these RDCs do? As the Department of Agriculture's website states:


The RDCs invest in R&D and innovation to improve the productivity and delivery of high quality products in order to underpin the competitiveness and profitability of Australia's agricultural, fish and forestry industries.


…   …   …


The government-industry partnership model that supports the RDCs has been operating successfully for over 20 years and now provides more than $470 million in annual R&D expenditure, including around $247 million from industry and $218 million from government in matching contributions … 


Based on legislated or industry funding agreements, the Australian Government agrees to collect industry levies for the purpose of R&D and/or marketing.


It then matches expenditure on R&D generally. The website continues:


The RDCs are a mix of statutory bodies and industry-owned companies (IOCs) … All undertake R&D activities and the IOCs also undertake marketing activities.


Currently, there are six statutory RDCs. They are in the areas of cotton, grains, fisheries, rural industries more generally, sugar and grape and wine research. Then the industry owned companies are the Australian Egg Corporation Limited, the Australian Livestock Export Corporation Limited, the Australian Meat Processor Corporation, Australian Pork Limited, Australian Wool Innovation Limited, Dairy Australia Limited, Forest and Wood Products Australia Limited, Horticulture Australia Limited and Meat and Livestock Australia.


It is worth mentioning that in 2011 the Productivity Commission did a review of rural R&D. It made a number of recommendations, particularly on future funding arrangements, many of which the then government rejected. However, I do want to note that the commission made an overall finding that:


This co-investment model has important strengths, including: helping to ensure that public money is not spent on research of little practical value; and facilitating greater and faster uptake of research outputs.


However, as currently configured, the model has some significant shortcomings. – It does not cater well for broader rural R&D needs.


It further stated:


While the broad model should be retained, significant changes to the way in which the Government contributes its funding are therefore called for. Specifically:


– The current cap on dollar for dollar matching of industry contributions by the Government should be halved over a ten-year period.


This recommendation was not accepted, but the findings of the PC do give some analytical backing to the government's decision here to make the changes in the current bill.


The Department of Agriculture currently pays fees for Australian government membership to international commodity organisations and regional fisheries management organisations. These organisations work to improve the trading environment for agricultural products by funding and coordinating R&D, providing information and statistics, setting international standards and ensuring ongoing access to fisheries. As the bill's explanatory memorandum notes:


Australia's membership of these organisations benefits the industries concerned. The international commodity organisations deliver industry good-outcomes, such as trading standards, research on global issues, and market statistics. The regional fisheries management organisations facilitate the management of migratory stock and high seas stocks that are fished by various nations. They inform international fisheries management and stock assessments.


So, we are rationalising this area of spending. But let us not lose sight of the bigger picture on research and development. I am here referring to the significant microeconomic reform in the form of higher education reform contained in the May budget.


I believe that it is both necessary and vital for the Australian economy. As I have said before, we all know that a first-class higher education system is a necessary condition to maintain a first-world economy. It is the difference between having a wealthy and an also-ran country. Australia is a first-rank economy and one of the most developed in the world. That is not a matter of luck. Many countries have abundant natural resources but have poor and weak economies because they do not possess the intellectual firepower to utilise those natural blessings. As John Howard often said, 'Economic reform is like participating in a running race with an ever-receding finish line.'


The reform task can never end if Australia is to stay in the front rank of nations. Specifically in terms of R&D, the higher education reforms include much to be proud of. We will secure Australia's place at the forefront of research, with $150 million in 2015-16 for the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy. This will ensure that we secure the benefits of the $2.5 billion investment in the state-of-the-art research infrastructure since the strategy was created by the Howard government in 2004. There will also be $139.5 million to deliver 100 new four-year research positions per year under the Future Fellowships scheme. This will be delivered through the Australian Research Council.


A few weeks ago, the Minister for Education announced 150 fellowships awarded to outstanding researchers. As he noted, these researchers are working on a broad range of research that will deliver benefits to our nation and our region. This includes improving Australian agriculture and food security and preventing future water scarcity. In addition, there is $26 million to accelerate research in dementia, $42 million to support new research in tropical disease and $24 million to support the Antarctic Gateway Partnership. This is a fantastic boost to research and will complement the $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund that the government is also setting up. Further, the Prime Minister recently launched the Industry Innovation and Competitiveness Agenda. It included $188.5 million to fund industry growth centres in five key sectors, one of which is food and agribusiness. This adds to the current $9.2 billion annual Commonwealth investment in research.


Finally, may I conclude my speech by acknowledging the recent win by a New South Wales grazier, Pip Job, of the 2014 Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation Rural Women's Award. I also congratulate runner-up, Jackie Jarvis, of Western Australia. The RIRDC Rural Women's Award is a leading awards program that recognises women in rural communities. As the Minister for Agriculture's media release informs us:


Ms Job has instigated significant changes to Landcare policy and recognises the impact rural life can have on farming families. This has resulted in the 'Women in the Landscape' program which is being rolled out nationally.


So congratulations to this year's winner, Pip. I wish her and her colleagues all the best in their future endeavours. In conclusion, I note that the government remains strongly committed to rural research and development. I commend the bill to the House.

"Gray, Gary, MP",ALP,2014-10-27,"



Mr GRAY
 (Brand) (12:54):  I join the previous speaker in congratulating the women who won the rural leadership awards just last month—in particular, Jackie Jarvis, from Western Australia, who was runner-up to a very worthy winner in Pip Job. Jackie's work centred around building good jobs and good support structures for refugees, bringing people into our regional and rural communities to work, to have good lives and to enjoy the great environment and the strong communities of regional and provincial Australia, in this case rural and provincial Western Australia. Jackie's efforts were acknowledged by her peers and acknowledged by RIRDC through that wonderful evening.


My sister-in-law, Shelley Birch, who farms at Coorow in the northern wheat belt in Western Australia, was a past Western Australian winner from the early 2000s, demonstrating the importance of a vibrant rural sector, a broad understanding of what research actually means and an engaging culture of those things that we can do to lift the productivity of our rural sector in a meaningful and measurable way. The Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation is a great organisation, and it is a great evening that we all have here once a year to acknowledge the women from our regional, farming and primary industries communities for their simply outstanding effort.


The Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 is not an outstanding effort. This bill is a sneaky attempt to make a saving where no saving should exist. It is an attempt to take, as a saving, the fees paid by RDCs to international organisations as part of their international affiliations. I mentioned my family connections to the Western Australian grain belt. The Western Australian grain belt is an economic pillar not only of Western Australia but also of our nation. We produce, in Western Australia, our nation's export grain crop. That export grain crop frequently runs in the order of 12 million to 18 million tonnes or maybe even more per year. It earns us export income and generates good jobs. The Western Australian grain crop is mostly exported through the Kwinana terminal in my electorate, through CBH. But, importantly, our export grain crop is generated through, largely, family businesses run through the grain belt of Western Australia.


The Western Australian grain belt is a unique proposition. One hundred and twenty years ago, farmers attempting to grow crops in the grain belt of Western Australia found themselves unable to produce sustainable crops in the weak and ancient soils of Western Australia. They found themselves north of Geraldton, at Champion Bay, producing crops that were so weak and so feeble that communities faced malnutrition and starvation. The fix for the Western Australian grain belt was the discovery of the reason for the feeble soil, which was a lack of trace elements. That was done through science and the application of good research to understand the reasons why our soils of Western Australia were not capable of producing bountiful crops. It seemed, from the weather pattern and from the nature of the vegetation, that the grain belt of Western Australia should have been productive land. But the reality for our farmers trying to open up the hinterland around Geraldton was that it was simply impossible to grow a sustainable crop.


The science that understood the role that copper and other trace elements play in renovating those large tracts of land in Western Australia was simply second to none. The work that was done to apply superphosphate to the weak soils of Western Australia was simply second none. And, of course, the ability to apply those trace elements and the ability to apply superphosphate occurred in Western Australia at almost the same time as the application of the internal combustion engine to provide motive force and tractor capacity in Western Australia to allow the development not just of a science based grain belt but also a capital based grain belt. It was investment in substantial tractor capacity motive force that allowed the grain belt to be opened in Western Australia from the 1920s.


My wife's family moved to Doodlakine in the 1930s to open land in those circumstances. As my father-in-law, former Senator Peter Walsh, is fond of saying, the land which they opened at Doodlakine in the 1920s and 1930s has always been productive and returned the cost of that crop. Therein you have the great synergy between science, research and a productive rural sector.


As we speak here today, in the grain belt of Western Australia from Esperance through to Geraldton, crops are being taken off. My family at Coorow began the harvesting process three weeks ago, and the harvest is going pretty well. It is not going so well at Esperance, where very bad weather conditions struck a number of property owners just north of Esperance, and the season does not look as if it is going to be good for them. All we can do from this place is offer our best wishes and acknowledge the importance of our rural industries and communities not just to Western Australia but to the nation. 


That brings me to the importance of RDCs. RDCs are about establishing communities of knowledge in some areas where international funding is paid to international sister organisations. It is also about good science and being practically capable of implementing measures that we want to have in place, for instance, in managing a fishery. Fish tend not to respect national borders. Fish tend to swim wherever they choose and so therefore having RDCs which link with international organisations tends to be good public policy but also good policy in fisheries management. Good policy in fisheries management is about sustainability, it is very much about productivity and it is absolutely about ensuring a sustainable future. 


When we look at the decision of the government to save a paltry $7 million, we would have to conclude that this is not simply unnecessary policy; it is not properly balanced policy. We are still in search of the new $100 million that the government said it would invest in RDCs. We are still in search of what that means, because we are confronted by the surprise that all we have to debate and consider here today are the cuts to RDCs, those very organisations that work in a collaborative and cooperative way with our regional communities; our scientists who help manage good public policy in agriculture industries; families; people like Pip and Jackie Jarvis—people whose family concern and interest in developing their good businesses and their strong regional communities had always until now been partnered with a deeply bipartisan approach to RDCs. 


RDCs have always been a realistic and valuable part of our public policy infrastructure in primary industries for over a quarter of a century. They have grown in their influence from being specifically sectoral to on many occasions international, and are accountable to their membership organisations, transparent to government, supported by communities and celebrated by this parliament. 


When we saw a $7 million saving over four years, many of us thought: 'I can't believe that that can be true. I can't believe that you would attempt to extract a saving from such lean organisations'—organisations that are not simply run on the smell of an oily rag but on the rumour of the smell of on oily rag. The families and the communities that support our RDCs are genuinely frugal. They do not sign up to international organisations to have fun; they do it in the name of good research, good partnership, good science and good outcomes. Because good science is about regional solutions, and that is never more obvious than in the context of fisheries research and management. 


We found ourselves genuinely struggling to understand: why this saving? We find ourselves incapable of understanding why—when RDCs bring together industry and researchers to establish research and development strategic directions and fund projects that provide industry with innovation and productivity tools—you would want to wind that back, especially in global marketplaces; especially when the farming family to which I belong is in competition every day of every week with potential grain suppliers out of the old Soviet Union, North America and South America. They need to be kept up to the game in whichever way they possibly can. They need not just the dollar support they receive from the Australian federal government but the emotional support. 


I find it distasteful, unfortunate and unnecessary that, in the weeks following that terrific event in Parliament House where we acknowledged the winners of our RDC programs and I was simply overjoyed to see how well Jackie Jarvis had done—and the great project that Pip had brought and which was the national winner—we would not acknowledge that we see an efficient spend of public money in these organisations. We see an effective spend of public money. We see networks that support Australian farming families. We see international networks that support the productivity agenda that is critically important to key primary industries, in particular fisheries and fisheries management. We also find ourselves stepping back inside Australia and not embracing the world in which our agricultural and horticultural projects and produce need to compete. That is important, because the future of farming is the future of our regional communities. In Western Australia, Merredin, Geraldton, Mukinbudin, Esperance and Albany are all communities that live and go from strength to strength on the strength of our agricultural opportunities and fortunes. They need to know that governments will stand by them.


Not one of the people who I have spoken to about this bill was aware that the government had cuts in mind. Not one of them had in mind that the cuts would be to such an infinitesimal area of the operations of RDCs; yet it is such a very important area of the operation of RDCs. I find myself in opposition to this bill not simply because it makes no sense but also because I find myself surprisingly emotionally in opposition to this bill. That is because I know the great value that comes to our farming and our agricultural communities from good dollars that are spent effectively in the interests of our farming and regional communities. That is something that is so important and had never been questioned before through successive budgets in 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1997 and 1998—all the way through to today. We had never seen this sort of initiative from a federal government. I ask members of the government to please reassess why you are doing it and change your views. (Time expired)

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,9,1
"Coulton, Mark, MP",Nats,2014-10-27,"



Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—The Nationals Chief Whip) (13:09):  I rise to speak on the Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. I cannot commence without commenting on the previous speaker and, indeed, the speech before from the shadow minister. While I found the first part of member for Brand's speech quite interesting, as I always do, it did really run off the reservation in the last few minutes. For the first six years that I had this place in parliament, as a member of a rural seat, I was knocking on the door of successive ministers for agriculture in the Labor government. The frustration that I felt from the disengagement of the previous Labor government of the agriculture sector was palatable.


I saw the frustration of my constituents who are involved in agriculture as they watched the previous government disband drought policy and destroy the live cattle trade. They saw that the only way of obtaining funds from the federal Labor government was if it was something through their ideology. That is, if it was anything to do with climate change. That might have got a look in from the Minister for Agriculture. But other than that, they were not interested. Indeed, we speak about the last government possibly being the worst government in Australia's history. Certainly, the last couple of agricultural ministers have been very, very ordinary and invisible in many cases. While the shadow minister now is making a valiant effort to make a lot of noise about agriculture, I fear that he is making up for six years of lost ground and really would not have any support within his party.


Australian farmers are amongst the most competitive and innovative in the world. The competitiveness is drawn from a number of factors, but a key contributor to this competitiveness is the annual continual innovation in the sector brought by research and development. Research and development is important, as it allows primary producers to produce more with less to improve the operational efficiency. This contributes to greater profits and a better return for farm-gate producers. As I stand here today, in the northern part of New South Wales and in the electorate of Parkes, farmers harvesting crops on one of the lowest rainfall years on record. They are growing crops that their fathers or grandfathers would not have been able to grow; that is because of innovation in research and because of the advent of zero till, spraying crop weeds out, conserving moisture, innovation in machinery with disc planters and the like has meant that farmers are harvesting viable crops, whereas in previous years they would not have.


Agricultural research and development has always provided to dividends for Australian farmers in the broader economy. One only has to look back on examples such as William Farrer's rust-proof wheat, which allowed the development and expansion of the Australian wheat industry, or the continual development of quality merino wool, which has allowed for the development of a high-quality, high-premium industry. It has been developments such as these that have put Australian agriculture in such a competitive place. Continual investment is needed in order to remain in this place.


Investment in agricultural research and development is also important due to its value for money. On average, farmers generate a $12 return for every dollar invested over a 10 year period. This means that for any money that is spent on research and development the government and public is guaranteed a return on this investment almost immediately. It is for this reason that the government investment provides resources for this critical sector. The Australian government invests extensively in research and development. This financial year alone, $700 million will be spent on this sector.


There has been a lot of talk today about the $7 million of cuts that have had to be made. Keep that in context. There is $700 million that will be spent in this sector. The reason that those cuts have had to be made is because they have had to be made across the board in every sector. Certainly, no minister wants to have to find savings in their portfolio, but the Minister for Agriculture has done his duty—as have other ministers—to make these savings while having the most minimal effect as possible. I have got to say, the farming sector over the last six or seven years has watched billions of dollars squandered down at their local schools for classrooms or halls that were not needed and has watched pink batts put in houses in an inefficient manner. One of the great frustrations for the people in my electorate has been watching the Labor Party squander taxpayers' funds. The Australian people know that without a balanced budget it is not possible to continue to provide the necessary support to industry.


The rural research and development corporations provide mechanisms for farmers and fishers to invest collectively in services that will contribute positively back to their industry and their operations. Through the collection of statutory levies, which are matched in funding by the federal government, primary producers are encouraged to invest in their own industry. This industry self-investment shows the positive culture of innovation in Australian farming. It is this culture that has contributed to Australian agriculture's international success and it is through continuing government investment in this sector that this culture can be maintained and expanded.


The government has also committed an extra $100 million in funding, starting next year, for these rural research and development corporations. This is delivering on the coalition's 2013 election commitment to improve the level of funding for this important sector. This funding boost will be directed by the rural research and development corporations towards projects that increase the profitability and productivity of primary industries, increase the value of primary products, strengthen the ability of primary producers to adapt to opportunities and threats, strengthen on-farm adoption and improve information flows. These projects are needed to further contribute to farm productivity and profitability. This funding could be used to address, for example, wild animal control or better mechanisms to control wild blackberries and other pests. Such projects are crucial in an increasingly competitive export environment where innovation is needed to diversify Australian agricultural products from those of their foreign competitors. It is through innovation that markets are created, it is through innovation that profits are created and it is through innovation that returns at the farm gate are increased.


This bill also reduces the level of red tape imposed on the research and development sector. It standardises the reporting requirements for the research and development corporations. For instance, the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act is amended to remove the tabling requirement for the funding agreement, and variations to the funding agreement, between the Commonwealth and the Australian Livestock Export Corporation, as well as for the annual report and the compliance report of the Australian Livestock Export Corporation. This reduces the costs associated with compliance. The affected research and development corporations will be able to invest these savings back into research. It will allow the affected rural research and development corporations to shift their organisational focus away from overbearing government compliance and back towards research. In order to meet the future needs and wants of Australian agricultural markets, the time of these research organisations must be efficiently and effectively focused on research. This can be done while preserving the quality of oversight and the accountability of the research and development sector to primary producers and to the public in general.


This bill eliminates the requirement for the rural research and development corporations to hold an annual meeting. There are already a number of other channels through which coordination can be and is performed, so an annual meeting is not needed. The meeting only involves five of the 15 rural research and development corporations and its removal will not affect coordination outcomes. This change will also reduce the organisational time directed towards the meeting, allowing research organisations to refocus their energy on research. It is important to the future effectiveness of these organisations and the future competitiveness of Australian agriculture that as much organisational energy as possible is focused on research and innovation.


There has been a lot of negativity from the opposition about the cuts in the bill. But we now have a government that is focused on agriculture. We now have a government that recognises agriculture as one of the pillars of our economy. The Minister for Agriculture is developing a white paper which will give us, for the first time in years, a clear direction for Australian agriculture. Over 700 people have contributed to the process so far, and that consultation is ongoing. We now have a government that understands that the future of this country, in the long term, is reliant on the viability of the agriculture sector. It will not do our agriculture sector or any other sector any good if we ignore our financial responsibilities—our responsibility, as a government, to get the budget back in order. 


The great frustration, not only with the debate on this bill but with many debates in this place over the last 12 months, is the great disconnect on that side of the House. They do not seem to believe there is any need to show any financial responsibility. There seems to be no understanding—I suppose it comes from their lack of experience in the real world of business—that things have to be paid for. This bill goes a small way towards addressing that problem and I support it. Research is vitally important.


I will just touch on the fact that the shadow minister had a go at the government about decentralisation, saying what a bad thing it was to remove public servants from the cities and put them in regional areas. The shadow minister lives at Maitland. That is the outer Barcoo as far as the Labor Party is concerned. The idea that anything of any significance could go on outside the capital cities is foreign to the Labor Party. Decentralisation is a very valid idea and the minister is certainly on the right track. I am horrified at the hypocrisy of the Labor Party trying to rewrite the last six years of Labor mismanagement. This bill has my full support.

"McGowan, Cathy, MP",Ind.,2014-10-27,"



Ms McGOWAN
 (Indi) (13:22):  I acknowledge my colleagues who have already spoken in this debate and I give them my total support for decentralisation. I look forward to policies that support Albury-Wodonga in particular. It gives me great pleasure to speak to the Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill. I would like to cover off three points. The first is the recommendations made by the National Farmers Federation, the second is the importance of consultation, and the third is my congratulations to the Minister for Agriculture on his green paper. I will discuss some of the topics he has raised in that, in particular the importance of education. In summary, the principal of government setting a major precedent of change for the RDC model without consulting with industry is very concerning, particularly given that the RDC model rests on cooperation and partnership with industry. Why change a major system like this that has operated so well for so long just for $7 million, and why provoke the wrath of an industry by not consulting properly? I hope that when we move through to discussion and debate about the white paper we can take seriously the comments that industry has made.


The National Farmers Federation made a number of recommendations in their submission to the inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Regional and Rural Affairs and Transport. They made two recommendations on the bill that I would like to bring to the attention of the House. One was about the paying of international subscriptions on behalf of some of the RDCs. The NFF recommends that the committee consider whether the funding of membership to international intergovernment commodity organisations requires legislative change. It is their belief that it does not. The NFF also recommends that the committee consider whether the government is making long-term structural changes to the RDC model without adequate consideration of the consequences or adequate industry consultation. They are two very valid points that I hope the government representative on the front bench, the member for Riverina, will answer when he replies to the debate.


The second recommendation that the NFF makes—I think it has an enormous amount of value—is that even if we agree with these changes and we put them in place, they do not have to be there forever. The NFF recommends that the bill be amended with a sunset clause of five years, when the obligation of funding of international intergovernment commodity organisations shifts back to the Australian government. Again I think there is a lot of merit in that and I ask the parliamentary secretary to comment on it. They are two things that the NFF are saying need to be done and I will be keen to hear support from my colleagues opposite on that.


The next issue I would like to address is consultation with industry, and how important it is to me, as a member representing a rural electorate, that the government have deep and extensive consultation with industry—and not only consults but also takes on board what industry has to say. I congratulate the minister for the agricultural competitiveness green paper and the opportunity to consult with industry over the next couple of months on some of the major themes in the paper. The minister has done a fantastic job—giving it time, giving it resources and putting in place skilled public servants who can pull such a really good paper together. That is exactly the way we should be consulting with industry. It builds trust but, much more importantly, it gets us really good results in the long-term. 


There are a couple of topics in this paper that I bring to the attention of the House. One is education and training. We have heard right across the country that we can do all we like at one level with R&D, but if we do not have a solid base of education and training the whole system will shift in ways that we do not want to see. Education and training is fundamentally important to the long-term sustainability of a rural research and development cooperation program. University education is particularly important. As members of this House know, the Minister for Education has plans to change the way education is funded in Australia. While that might work for our city cousins, I have great doubts that it is going to work for our agricultural sector. 


Jim Pratley, from Charles Sturt University, has done studies which show that we already have market failure in rural and regional Australia, particularly in regard to training agricultural economists and all the specialist people that we need with a university education. In 2012, he indicated there was a need for 4,000 professionally qualified agricultural research people in Australia, and we were able to produce only 800. So, we absolutely need to change the situation. But we need to change it so we can meet the real need in rural and regional Australia for qualified scientists and other research people, and we have to hold them in rural and regional Australia so they can contribute to the whole process of building a competitive agricultural sector. We need those qualified, skilled, tertiary educated people to do the work that has to be done. I am a great supporter of what I read in this paper about building pathways between schools, TAFEs and universities so that we have a system in which people can move up to do their PhDs and then hopefully live and work in rural Australia when they have finished their PhD. I bring to the attention of the House how important that consultation is and I emphasise the words that our community have been saying and urge that we hold onto these thoughts at the next stage of this paper when it becomes a white paper—we need to put funds, personnel and resources into particularly tertiary education, particularly in rural and regional Australia, and particularly into agriculture. It is probably the most important thing we can do.


Another part of this paper that has great merit concerns the need to establish a new body, or task existing research bodies, to coordinate cross-sector research. One of the important things that need to happen in rural and regional Australia is that we need to talk to each other across RDCs. A worrying part of this legislation before the House is that the RDCs do not have to report to parliament and they do not have to meet on an annual basis.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(

):  Order! It being 1.30 pm the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. 

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,9,1
"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2014-10-27,"



Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (12:19):  I begin by expressing how bewildered I am by this Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. I would never suggest that $7 million is not a lot of money—it certainly is. Anyone listening to this broadcast or watching from the galleries would agree that $7 million is quite a lot of money. In the context of a Commonwealth budget of around $400 billion, it is a modest amount of money but to the research and development corporations being adversely affected by this initiative it certainly is a lot of money. 


Our agriculture sector operates in a very competitive environment, particularly those who are focused on export markets. Having said that, our agricultural community has remained strong because we have a number of competitive advantages. Amongst them of course is our geographical location. We are close to the very large and growing markets of Asia. The skills, knowledge and productivity of our farmers certainly contribute to our competitive advantage in our region. So too does our clean, green and safe image. This is potentially our greatest competitive advantage as the growing middle classes of Asia, who have had food scares, are looking for Australian food that is environmentally clean and safe for their consumption.


Another advantage is the strength of our research and development system, which is the envy of the rest of the world. The current model is another product of the Hawke government and one of the greatest legacies of the Hawke government's agriculture minister the Hon. John Kerin, who I am very proud to say is today the patron of Labor's all-important country caucus. The co-funding model for research and development that John Kerin put in place is, as I said, the envy of the rest of the world. Under the model, our research and development corporations receive government funds on a dollar-for-dollar basis up to a cap based on the value of the sector's output. It is a system which empowers the people who really matter and who understand their commodity sector best, and they are, of course, those who come from the land, more often than not, to represent the interests of those who put them there.


There are 15 research and development corporations, and these are made up of nine industry-owned companies that provide R&D services and marketing for the benefit of their industries, and six research and development corporations that provide leadership and investment. The industry-owned companies are: the Australian Egg Corporation Ltd, the Australian Livestock Export Corporation Ltd, the Australian Meat Processor Corporation Ltd, Australian Pork Ltd, Australian Wool Innovation Ltd, Dairy Australia Ltd, Forest and Wood Products Australia Ltd, Horticulture Australia Ltd and Meat and Livestock Australia Ltd. In addition to those there are other industry bodies, including: Cotton Research and Development Corporation, Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, Grains Research and Development Corporation, Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation, Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation and the Sugar Research and Development Corporation. These organisations are critical to our ongoing success in agriculture and, of course, critical to our international competitiveness.


What this bill does is begin the process of chipping away at that model. Some might say, at $7 million over the forward estimates, it is in a modest way, but that is not the case for those who are trying to administer the funds and do good things in this sector. What this bill does is force those research and development corporations to pay their own subscriptions to a range of international commodity organisations and regional fisheries management corporations. These payments are currently allocated by the Department of Agriculture. To put that slightly more in layman's terms: some of our RDCs are members of international organisations with whom they work on research and development. Fisheries is an obvious example to those listening, because obviously fish stocks do not recognise international borders, and international work on some of these issues can be very important. We also do so not just to benefit ourselves but to benefit other nation-states, particularly developing nations, who obviously benefit from the work we do in partnership with them. It is a very obvious statement to say that the best thing we can do for developing nations which face very significant challenges that we do not need to deal with in this lucky country is to empower them economically, and working with them in these areas of research and development is of course very, very important.


The other reason I am bewildered by this bill that is before the House today is that it represents another clear breach of what was said pre the election by this government. Prior to the election, this government rightly talked about the importance of research and development, and that was a matter in which there was absolute bipartisan support. In this increasingly complex world, a world that is driven by technology and innovation, Australia will have to stay ahead of the game in the area of research, development, innovation and/or, importantly, extension, to make sure innovation gets down to the farm, where it has the effect.


Since the election, things have changed. I acknowledge that the government has fulfilled, in part at least, its commitment in the budget to allocate an additional $100 million over the forward estimates as an additional contribution to the R&D effort of our farm sector, not only farming in the agricultural sense but also in fisheries and forestry. There was a lot of speculation prior to the election about how that money would be spent. I think it suited the government, at the time, to suggest that, rather than be provided money on a dollar-for-dollar basis, research and development corporations could expect to maybe get $1.05 or $1.10 or $1.20 for each dollar they contribute. It seems that is not to be the case but rather the government will be putting that money out on a competitive tender basis, inviting RDCs to compete for those additional funds. That, of course, will mean that some RDCs will enjoy more funding as a result of the additional allocations and other RDCs will not.


There has also been a suggestion that the bids that are most likely to be successful are those which are cross-sectoral—in other words, those for research which benefits more than one commodity sector. To again simplify that for any listener: it might be research into grass, which is, of course, important as a feedstock across a range of commodities. I think that is a pretty good example. I do not necessarily have any difficulty with that. In pure public policy terms, that might be the best way to spend the money. We shall wait and see what the proposition is when it is put forward, but it certainly is not consistent with the impression that the government gave or provided to the various commodity sectors prior to the election. That is just a minor point compared to what is the main point in demonstrating that this is another addition to the pre-election promises. This is not so much about RDC funding. The government said it would enhance the research and development effort but of course, since the election, while it has included in the budget some $100 million in the forward estimates, on the other side of the ledger it has dramatically cut research and development funding in the agricultural sector. Some $80 million has come out of the cooperative research centres; some $146 million has been cut from the CSIRO's work—something that will also cost significant jobs in the area; and some $11 million has been reduced from the annual appropriation for the RIRDC. What the government is effectively doing is giving out money with one hand and taking it back with the other. That is a clear breach of its election promises and, indeed, it is not in the spirit of what they told the sector prior to the election.


I will go back to the idea, in this bill, of forcing the RDCs to pay their own subscriptions to international organisations. It is a bit worse than that because, given the way the government has constructed this bill, the RDCs do not have an option to opt out of the investment organisations; they cannot make the decision that spending money on local research and development is more important than their contribution to international organisations because the government is not allowing them to. What the government is doing is paying the international organisations without any reference to, or consultation with, the RDCs. It is taking the subscription amount out of the allocation it makes to the research and development corporations. If that is not a breach of a pre-election promise, I do not know what is. It could not be any clearer than that: paying the money directly and then taking the money out of the RDCs' annual funding allocation. In other words, they are leaving the RDCs with no choice but to remain part of the international organisations. That is the decision of government, really, and if it is the government's conclusion that it is appropriate for the RDCs to be forced to be part of these organisations, then the government should be paying. It is no more complex than that.


That is why I began my contribution by expressing bewilderment that this bill is coming before the House. It is coming before the House just so the government can do this—so the government can say there was $7 million over the forward estimates and force the RDCs to remain in these organisations, while at the same time forcing them to pay for the membership of the organisations.


This is going to have a very real effect on these RDCs. It comes on top of the government's decision to force them to do something else as well—not all of them, but some of them. The government's other great idea is to force these RDCs to move to rural and regional areas. That all sounds fine on the face of it. We all love the idea of decentralisation—the idea of pushing government departments out into the regions in order to create economic activity and jobs there. But we also need to ask ourselves how often that has been successful. We have all been speaking fondly of Gough Whitlam this week. He made a big push for decentralisation. But, reluctant as I am to say it, that met with limited success. It can be successful, and Gough had some successes; but it is more likely to be successful when it is accompanied by a well-thought-out strategic plan. We do not have any well-thought-out strategic plan with respect to the decentralisation of our research and development corporations; rather, we have a thought bubble. I put it to the House that Minister Joyce just woke up one morning and decided he was going to force these RDCs out to certain parts of the country—not just the RDCs, I should point out, but also the APVMA, an agency critical to chemical regulation in this country. Minister Joyce, of course, intends to move them to Armidale in the minister's electorate. That is very handy indeed. But there is no strategic plan, or support, or transition plan for these research and development corporations. To make it worse, the minister has issued a decree that they shall meet all the costs of these moves themselves from within their own budget. I ask other members of the House: does that sound like another breach of an election promise? That sounds very much to me like another breach of an election promise. That is taking money out of the hands of our research and development corporations. It is a very clear breach of a pre-election commitment.


But it gets worse. Knowing the limited success of these moves in the past, it is inevitable that these organisations will lose people—experienced people, good people and people with expertise; people who are critical to the success of these organisations. That is really serious. And it gets yet worse again, because when you lose people from the public service you also face redundancy payments. Redundancy payments can run into millions of dollars in aggregate. It is clear, as a result of the minister's edict, that cost will be borne by the research and development corporations—another clear breach of an election commitment. There is another question, too, around the $100 million allocated in the budget—which we might never see. The money allocated in the current fiscal year—that is, the first $40 million, maybe less—is unlikely to be spent in this fiscal year. We shall see. But, given the time it will take to put the final construct into place for the delivery of this $100 million—the time it will take to go through a competitive tender process, assess those applications and finally allocate those funds—I think is unlikely to occur before June 30 next year. I will be very happy to be proven wrong. We shall wait and see. But, as we all know in this place, money not spent in any financial year is not likely to be rolled over to the next financial year. It will not be $100 million anymore; it will be somewhat less. 


When you net it all out—with what has been taken out of the RRDC, the CRCs and the CSIRO and the money it is going to cost the RDCs to decentralise, for want of a better word; I am reluctant to use that word in this case but I will go with it. Of course the money coming out of the RDCs as a result of this bill—$100 million is looking pretty poor. Some of the costs are unknown but it could be that the net result is one of deficit for our research and development corporations. We shall wait and see. But it certainly will not be the $100 million that they were promised prior to the election.


This brings back the old 'mean and tricky' phrase that we heard so much about some years ago. The research development corporations and all those who rely upon them will not be appreciating it today and in fact I know they are not appreciating today the fact that they have been tricked into believing they were going to do much better under this government.


This is not justabout the RDCs and their staff and those who might be affected by these changes. This is about the future of Australian agriculture—and what a future Australian agriculture has with those emerging middle classes of the Asian region and a significant increase across the globe generally with a population growing to some nine billion people. 


But it is an opportunity that will not just come to us. To fully capitalise on this opportunity, we will have to go to it. We will have to be better, stronger and more innovative. We will have to work harder than ever before, if we are to fully capitalise on it. The opportunity is there, and the extent of our success will largely be driven by the private sector—its investment decisions, its decisions in innovation and its strategic planning. But there will be a very important role for government in branding and marketing; in policies which make the most of our limited natural resources; in policies to open market opportunities in those countries I have been talking about; and of course in research and development. 


The countries that will do best are not just those with geographical advantages, and some of those other competitive advantages I have been talking about. Those who will do best are those who are serious about being ahead of the game in research and development. That is something I thought we all understood and agreed on in this place. But this bill and the decision to decentralise RDCs—and the decisions to cut funding from CSIRO, from our CRCs and from our rural industries RDC—show that the government is not serious about it. They were not telling the truth prior to the election and they have let the agriculture sector down. I appeal to them very genuinely to rethink this one. They will get absolute bipartisan support. The savings involved in the budget are not worth the cost or the adverse impact this will have on our RDCs in the immediate future. It is certainly not worth the impact it will have further down the track for research, development and extension in this country.

"Hendy, Peter, MP",LP,2014-10-27,"



Dr HENDY
 (Eden-Monaro) (12:42):  I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on this bill and support its second reading. This bill implements decisions taken in the budget that confront the realities of the budget task facing the Australian nation. It represents some hard decisions that have had to be taken.


So, while remaining utterly committed to research and development in the rural sector, we recognise that all sectors of the economy have to share in the budget repair task. In my view as an economist, the No. 1 priority for the Australian economy is to get the budget into a sustainable surplus over the medium to long run. Australia cannot go on borrowing $1 billion every single month just to pay the interest on the previous government's borrowings. This is wasted money that could otherwise be spent building roads, schools and hospitals; funding additional research and development; or paying for tax cuts for long-suffering taxpayers.


Australia has just run six straight years of record budget deficits. A further $123 billion in projected deficits and gross debt forecast to hit $667 billion was left for the new government to manage. This year's budget papers show that, even with the government's efforts to repair the budget, there will be four more deficits over the period 2014-15 to 2017-18. That would make 10 deficits in a row and would be unprecedented in our post-war history.


Over the whole 45 years of budget data published in budget paper No. 1, going back to 1970-71, the longest the budget has previously stayed in deficit is seven years in a row, through the extremely severe early-1990s recession. Extraordinarily, the last six budgets saw a faster increase in net debt than during that episode, both in dollar terms and as a percentage of GDP. This debt disaster problem occurred despite the benefit of a once-in-a-century mining boom and commodity prices that reached record high levels.


As the minister stated in his second reading speech:


Australia's rural industries are among the most innovative and productive in the world. 


He noted:


The Australian government supports rural industries in a variety of ways.


For example:


To help primary producers increase their output and improve their profit margins, we support rural research and development. Much of this support is channeled through the 15 rural research and development corporations.


Part of the government's role is to be:


… a member of international commodity organisations and regional fisheries management organisations.


The minister further noted:


This bill implements a 2014 budget measure to change the way that the government pays for its membership to these organisations. The bill also reduces the red-tape burden currently imposed on some of the rural research and development corporations.


As the minister noted in his speech:


Australian research and development operates within a global system and must take into account international issues. The change to the legislation reflects this and also acknowledges that the ultimate beneficiaries of the activities of these international organisations are farmers, fishing industries and rural communities. 


The bill amends three acts to allow the government to recover the cost of the memberships from the Commonwealth funding provided to relevant rural research and development corporations.


The government is of the view that:


This will provide a funding mechanism for memberships to these organisations that is sustainable in a time of increasing budget pressures.


The amendments will result in a saving to government of about $7 million over the next four years. This saving will be redirected by the government to help repair the budget.


And, as noted previously:


The bill also reduces red tape for some of the research and development corporations.


So, what do these RDCs do? As the Department of Agriculture's website states:


The RDCs invest in R&D and innovation to improve the productivity and delivery of high quality products in order to underpin the competitiveness and profitability of Australia's agricultural, fish and forestry industries.


…   …   …


The government-industry partnership model that supports the RDCs has been operating successfully for over 20 years and now provides more than $470 million in annual R&D expenditure, including around $247 million from industry and $218 million from government in matching contributions … 


Based on legislated or industry funding agreements, the Australian Government agrees to collect industry levies for the purpose of R&D and/or marketing.


It then matches expenditure on R&D generally. The website continues:


The RDCs are a mix of statutory bodies and industry-owned companies (IOCs) … All undertake R&D activities and the IOCs also undertake marketing activities.


Currently, there are six statutory RDCs. They are in the areas of cotton, grains, fisheries, rural industries more generally, sugar and grape and wine research. Then the industry owned companies are the Australian Egg Corporation Limited, the Australian Livestock Export Corporation Limited, the Australian Meat Processor Corporation, Australian Pork Limited, Australian Wool Innovation Limited, Dairy Australia Limited, Forest and Wood Products Australia Limited, Horticulture Australia Limited and Meat and Livestock Australia.


It is worth mentioning that in 2011 the Productivity Commission did a review of rural R&D. It made a number of recommendations, particularly on future funding arrangements, many of which the then government rejected. However, I do want to note that the commission made an overall finding that:


This co-investment model has important strengths, including: helping to ensure that public money is not spent on research of little practical value; and facilitating greater and faster uptake of research outputs.


However, as currently configured, the model has some significant shortcomings. – It does not cater well for broader rural R&D needs.


It further stated:


While the broad model should be retained, significant changes to the way in which the Government contributes its funding are therefore called for. Specifically:


– The current cap on dollar for dollar matching of industry contributions by the Government should be halved over a ten-year period.


This recommendation was not accepted, but the findings of the PC do give some analytical backing to the government's decision here to make the changes in the current bill.


The Department of Agriculture currently pays fees for Australian government membership to international commodity organisations and regional fisheries management organisations. These organisations work to improve the trading environment for agricultural products by funding and coordinating R&D, providing information and statistics, setting international standards and ensuring ongoing access to fisheries. As the bill's explanatory memorandum notes:


Australia's membership of these organisations benefits the industries concerned. The international commodity organisations deliver industry good-outcomes, such as trading standards, research on global issues, and market statistics. The regional fisheries management organisations facilitate the management of migratory stock and high seas stocks that are fished by various nations. They inform international fisheries management and stock assessments.


So, we are rationalising this area of spending. But let us not lose sight of the bigger picture on research and development. I am here referring to the significant microeconomic reform in the form of higher education reform contained in the May budget.


I believe that it is both necessary and vital for the Australian economy. As I have said before, we all know that a first-class higher education system is a necessary condition to maintain a first-world economy. It is the difference between having a wealthy and an also-ran country. Australia is a first-rank economy and one of the most developed in the world. That is not a matter of luck. Many countries have abundant natural resources but have poor and weak economies because they do not possess the intellectual firepower to utilise those natural blessings. As John Howard often said, 'Economic reform is like participating in a running race with an ever-receding finish line.'


The reform task can never end if Australia is to stay in the front rank of nations. Specifically in terms of R&D, the higher education reforms include much to be proud of. We will secure Australia's place at the forefront of research, with $150 million in 2015-16 for the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy. This will ensure that we secure the benefits of the $2.5 billion investment in the state-of-the-art research infrastructure since the strategy was created by the Howard government in 2004. There will also be $139.5 million to deliver 100 new four-year research positions per year under the Future Fellowships scheme. This will be delivered through the Australian Research Council.


A few weeks ago, the Minister for Education announced 150 fellowships awarded to outstanding researchers. As he noted, these researchers are working on a broad range of research that will deliver benefits to our nation and our region. This includes improving Australian agriculture and food security and preventing future water scarcity. In addition, there is $26 million to accelerate research in dementia, $42 million to support new research in tropical disease and $24 million to support the Antarctic Gateway Partnership. This is a fantastic boost to research and will complement the $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund that the government is also setting up. Further, the Prime Minister recently launched the Industry Innovation and Competitiveness Agenda. It included $188.5 million to fund industry growth centres in five key sectors, one of which is food and agribusiness. This adds to the current $9.2 billion annual Commonwealth investment in research.


Finally, may I conclude my speech by acknowledging the recent win by a New South Wales grazier, Pip Job, of the 2014 Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation Rural Women's Award. I also congratulate runner-up, Jackie Jarvis, of Western Australia. The RIRDC Rural Women's Award is a leading awards program that recognises women in rural communities. As the Minister for Agriculture's media release informs us:


Ms Job has instigated significant changes to Landcare policy and recognises the impact rural life can have on farming families. This has resulted in the 'Women in the Landscape' program which is being rolled out nationally.


So congratulations to this year's winner, Pip. I wish her and her colleagues all the best in their future endeavours. In conclusion, I note that the government remains strongly committed to rural research and development. I commend the bill to the House.

"Gray, Gary, MP",ALP,2014-10-27,"



Mr GRAY
 (Brand) (12:54):  I join the previous speaker in congratulating the women who won the rural leadership awards just last month—in particular, Jackie Jarvis, from Western Australia, who was runner-up to a very worthy winner in Pip Job. Jackie's work centred around building good jobs and good support structures for refugees, bringing people into our regional and rural communities to work, to have good lives and to enjoy the great environment and the strong communities of regional and provincial Australia, in this case rural and provincial Western Australia. Jackie's efforts were acknowledged by her peers and acknowledged by RIRDC through that wonderful evening.


My sister-in-law, Shelley Birch, who farms at Coorow in the northern wheat belt in Western Australia, was a past Western Australian winner from the early 2000s, demonstrating the importance of a vibrant rural sector, a broad understanding of what research actually means and an engaging culture of those things that we can do to lift the productivity of our rural sector in a meaningful and measurable way. The Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation is a great organisation, and it is a great evening that we all have here once a year to acknowledge the women from our regional, farming and primary industries communities for their simply outstanding effort.


The Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 is not an outstanding effort. This bill is a sneaky attempt to make a saving where no saving should exist. It is an attempt to take, as a saving, the fees paid by RDCs to international organisations as part of their international affiliations. I mentioned my family connections to the Western Australian grain belt. The Western Australian grain belt is an economic pillar not only of Western Australia but also of our nation. We produce, in Western Australia, our nation's export grain crop. That export grain crop frequently runs in the order of 12 million to 18 million tonnes or maybe even more per year. It earns us export income and generates good jobs. The Western Australian grain crop is mostly exported through the Kwinana terminal in my electorate, through CBH. But, importantly, our export grain crop is generated through, largely, family businesses run through the grain belt of Western Australia.


The Western Australian grain belt is a unique proposition. One hundred and twenty years ago, farmers attempting to grow crops in the grain belt of Western Australia found themselves unable to produce sustainable crops in the weak and ancient soils of Western Australia. They found themselves north of Geraldton, at Champion Bay, producing crops that were so weak and so feeble that communities faced malnutrition and starvation. The fix for the Western Australian grain belt was the discovery of the reason for the feeble soil, which was a lack of trace elements. That was done through science and the application of good research to understand the reasons why our soils of Western Australia were not capable of producing bountiful crops. It seemed, from the weather pattern and from the nature of the vegetation, that the grain belt of Western Australia should have been productive land. But the reality for our farmers trying to open up the hinterland around Geraldton was that it was simply impossible to grow a sustainable crop.


The science that understood the role that copper and other trace elements play in renovating those large tracts of land in Western Australia was simply second to none. The work that was done to apply superphosphate to the weak soils of Western Australia was simply second none. And, of course, the ability to apply those trace elements and the ability to apply superphosphate occurred in Western Australia at almost the same time as the application of the internal combustion engine to provide motive force and tractor capacity in Western Australia to allow the development not just of a science based grain belt but also a capital based grain belt. It was investment in substantial tractor capacity motive force that allowed the grain belt to be opened in Western Australia from the 1920s.


My wife's family moved to Doodlakine in the 1930s to open land in those circumstances. As my father-in-law, former Senator Peter Walsh, is fond of saying, the land which they opened at Doodlakine in the 1920s and 1930s has always been productive and returned the cost of that crop. Therein you have the great synergy between science, research and a productive rural sector.


As we speak here today, in the grain belt of Western Australia from Esperance through to Geraldton, crops are being taken off. My family at Coorow began the harvesting process three weeks ago, and the harvest is going pretty well. It is not going so well at Esperance, where very bad weather conditions struck a number of property owners just north of Esperance, and the season does not look as if it is going to be good for them. All we can do from this place is offer our best wishes and acknowledge the importance of our rural industries and communities not just to Western Australia but to the nation. 


That brings me to the importance of RDCs. RDCs are about establishing communities of knowledge in some areas where international funding is paid to international sister organisations. It is also about good science and being practically capable of implementing measures that we want to have in place, for instance, in managing a fishery. Fish tend not to respect national borders. Fish tend to swim wherever they choose and so therefore having RDCs which link with international organisations tends to be good public policy but also good policy in fisheries management. Good policy in fisheries management is about sustainability, it is very much about productivity and it is absolutely about ensuring a sustainable future. 


When we look at the decision of the government to save a paltry $7 million, we would have to conclude that this is not simply unnecessary policy; it is not properly balanced policy. We are still in search of the new $100 million that the government said it would invest in RDCs. We are still in search of what that means, because we are confronted by the surprise that all we have to debate and consider here today are the cuts to RDCs, those very organisations that work in a collaborative and cooperative way with our regional communities; our scientists who help manage good public policy in agriculture industries; families; people like Pip and Jackie Jarvis—people whose family concern and interest in developing their good businesses and their strong regional communities had always until now been partnered with a deeply bipartisan approach to RDCs. 


RDCs have always been a realistic and valuable part of our public policy infrastructure in primary industries for over a quarter of a century. They have grown in their influence from being specifically sectoral to on many occasions international, and are accountable to their membership organisations, transparent to government, supported by communities and celebrated by this parliament. 


When we saw a $7 million saving over four years, many of us thought: 'I can't believe that that can be true. I can't believe that you would attempt to extract a saving from such lean organisations'—organisations that are not simply run on the smell of an oily rag but on the rumour of the smell of on oily rag. The families and the communities that support our RDCs are genuinely frugal. They do not sign up to international organisations to have fun; they do it in the name of good research, good partnership, good science and good outcomes. Because good science is about regional solutions, and that is never more obvious than in the context of fisheries research and management. 


We found ourselves genuinely struggling to understand: why this saving? We find ourselves incapable of understanding why—when RDCs bring together industry and researchers to establish research and development strategic directions and fund projects that provide industry with innovation and productivity tools—you would want to wind that back, especially in global marketplaces; especially when the farming family to which I belong is in competition every day of every week with potential grain suppliers out of the old Soviet Union, North America and South America. They need to be kept up to the game in whichever way they possibly can. They need not just the dollar support they receive from the Australian federal government but the emotional support. 


I find it distasteful, unfortunate and unnecessary that, in the weeks following that terrific event in Parliament House where we acknowledged the winners of our RDC programs and I was simply overjoyed to see how well Jackie Jarvis had done—and the great project that Pip had brought and which was the national winner—we would not acknowledge that we see an efficient spend of public money in these organisations. We see an effective spend of public money. We see networks that support Australian farming families. We see international networks that support the productivity agenda that is critically important to key primary industries, in particular fisheries and fisheries management. We also find ourselves stepping back inside Australia and not embracing the world in which our agricultural and horticultural projects and produce need to compete. That is important, because the future of farming is the future of our regional communities. In Western Australia, Merredin, Geraldton, Mukinbudin, Esperance and Albany are all communities that live and go from strength to strength on the strength of our agricultural opportunities and fortunes. They need to know that governments will stand by them.


Not one of the people who I have spoken to about this bill was aware that the government had cuts in mind. Not one of them had in mind that the cuts would be to such an infinitesimal area of the operations of RDCs; yet it is such a very important area of the operation of RDCs. I find myself in opposition to this bill not simply because it makes no sense but also because I find myself surprisingly emotionally in opposition to this bill. That is because I know the great value that comes to our farming and our agricultural communities from good dollars that are spent effectively in the interests of our farming and regional communities. That is something that is so important and had never been questioned before through successive budgets in 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1997 and 1998—all the way through to today. We had never seen this sort of initiative from a federal government. I ask members of the government to please reassess why you are doing it and change your views. (Time expired)

"Coulton, Mark, MP",Nats,2014-10-27,"



Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—The Nationals Chief Whip) (13:09):  I rise to speak on the Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. I cannot commence without commenting on the previous speaker and, indeed, the speech before from the shadow minister. While I found the first part of member for Brand's speech quite interesting, as I always do, it did really run off the reservation in the last few minutes. For the first six years that I had this place in parliament, as a member of a rural seat, I was knocking on the door of successive ministers for agriculture in the Labor government. The frustration that I felt from the disengagement of the previous Labor government of the agriculture sector was palatable.


I saw the frustration of my constituents who are involved in agriculture as they watched the previous government disband drought policy and destroy the live cattle trade. They saw that the only way of obtaining funds from the federal Labor government was if it was something through their ideology. That is, if it was anything to do with climate change. That might have got a look in from the Minister for Agriculture. But other than that, they were not interested. Indeed, we speak about the last government possibly being the worst government in Australia's history. Certainly, the last couple of agricultural ministers have been very, very ordinary and invisible in many cases. While the shadow minister now is making a valiant effort to make a lot of noise about agriculture, I fear that he is making up for six years of lost ground and really would not have any support within his party.


Australian farmers are amongst the most competitive and innovative in the world. The competitiveness is drawn from a number of factors, but a key contributor to this competitiveness is the annual continual innovation in the sector brought by research and development. Research and development is important, as it allows primary producers to produce more with less to improve the operational efficiency. This contributes to greater profits and a better return for farm-gate producers. As I stand here today, in the northern part of New South Wales and in the electorate of Parkes, farmers harvesting crops on one of the lowest rainfall years on record. They are growing crops that their fathers or grandfathers would not have been able to grow; that is because of innovation in research and because of the advent of zero till, spraying crop weeds out, conserving moisture, innovation in machinery with disc planters and the like has meant that farmers are harvesting viable crops, whereas in previous years they would not have.


Agricultural research and development has always provided to dividends for Australian farmers in the broader economy. One only has to look back on examples such as William Farrer's rust-proof wheat, which allowed the development and expansion of the Australian wheat industry, or the continual development of quality merino wool, which has allowed for the development of a high-quality, high-premium industry. It has been developments such as these that have put Australian agriculture in such a competitive place. Continual investment is needed in order to remain in this place.


Investment in agricultural research and development is also important due to its value for money. On average, farmers generate a $12 return for every dollar invested over a 10 year period. This means that for any money that is spent on research and development the government and public is guaranteed a return on this investment almost immediately. It is for this reason that the government investment provides resources for this critical sector. The Australian government invests extensively in research and development. This financial year alone, $700 million will be spent on this sector.


There has been a lot of talk today about the $7 million of cuts that have had to be made. Keep that in context. There is $700 million that will be spent in this sector. The reason that those cuts have had to be made is because they have had to be made across the board in every sector. Certainly, no minister wants to have to find savings in their portfolio, but the Minister for Agriculture has done his duty—as have other ministers—to make these savings while having the most minimal effect as possible. I have got to say, the farming sector over the last six or seven years has watched billions of dollars squandered down at their local schools for classrooms or halls that were not needed and has watched pink batts put in houses in an inefficient manner. One of the great frustrations for the people in my electorate has been watching the Labor Party squander taxpayers' funds. The Australian people know that without a balanced budget it is not possible to continue to provide the necessary support to industry.


The rural research and development corporations provide mechanisms for farmers and fishers to invest collectively in services that will contribute positively back to their industry and their operations. Through the collection of statutory levies, which are matched in funding by the federal government, primary producers are encouraged to invest in their own industry. This industry self-investment shows the positive culture of innovation in Australian farming. It is this culture that has contributed to Australian agriculture's international success and it is through continuing government investment in this sector that this culture can be maintained and expanded.


The government has also committed an extra $100 million in funding, starting next year, for these rural research and development corporations. This is delivering on the coalition's 2013 election commitment to improve the level of funding for this important sector. This funding boost will be directed by the rural research and development corporations towards projects that increase the profitability and productivity of primary industries, increase the value of primary products, strengthen the ability of primary producers to adapt to opportunities and threats, strengthen on-farm adoption and improve information flows. These projects are needed to further contribute to farm productivity and profitability. This funding could be used to address, for example, wild animal control or better mechanisms to control wild blackberries and other pests. Such projects are crucial in an increasingly competitive export environment where innovation is needed to diversify Australian agricultural products from those of their foreign competitors. It is through innovation that markets are created, it is through innovation that profits are created and it is through innovation that returns at the farm gate are increased.


This bill also reduces the level of red tape imposed on the research and development sector. It standardises the reporting requirements for the research and development corporations. For instance, the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act is amended to remove the tabling requirement for the funding agreement, and variations to the funding agreement, between the Commonwealth and the Australian Livestock Export Corporation, as well as for the annual report and the compliance report of the Australian Livestock Export Corporation. This reduces the costs associated with compliance. The affected research and development corporations will be able to invest these savings back into research. It will allow the affected rural research and development corporations to shift their organisational focus away from overbearing government compliance and back towards research. In order to meet the future needs and wants of Australian agricultural markets, the time of these research organisations must be efficiently and effectively focused on research. This can be done while preserving the quality of oversight and the accountability of the research and development sector to primary producers and to the public in general.


This bill eliminates the requirement for the rural research and development corporations to hold an annual meeting. There are already a number of other channels through which coordination can be and is performed, so an annual meeting is not needed. The meeting only involves five of the 15 rural research and development corporations and its removal will not affect coordination outcomes. This change will also reduce the organisational time directed towards the meeting, allowing research organisations to refocus their energy on research. It is important to the future effectiveness of these organisations and the future competitiveness of Australian agriculture that as much organisational energy as possible is focused on research and innovation.


There has been a lot of negativity from the opposition about the cuts in the bill. But we now have a government that is focused on agriculture. We now have a government that recognises agriculture as one of the pillars of our economy. The Minister for Agriculture is developing a white paper which will give us, for the first time in years, a clear direction for Australian agriculture. Over 700 people have contributed to the process so far, and that consultation is ongoing. We now have a government that understands that the future of this country, in the long term, is reliant on the viability of the agriculture sector. It will not do our agriculture sector or any other sector any good if we ignore our financial responsibilities—our responsibility, as a government, to get the budget back in order. 


The great frustration, not only with the debate on this bill but with many debates in this place over the last 12 months, is the great disconnect on that side of the House. They do not seem to believe there is any need to show any financial responsibility. There seems to be no understanding—I suppose it comes from their lack of experience in the real world of business—that things have to be paid for. This bill goes a small way towards addressing that problem and I support it. Research is vitally important.


I will just touch on the fact that the shadow minister had a go at the government about decentralisation, saying what a bad thing it was to remove public servants from the cities and put them in regional areas. The shadow minister lives at Maitland. That is the outer Barcoo as far as the Labor Party is concerned. The idea that anything of any significance could go on outside the capital cities is foreign to the Labor Party. Decentralisation is a very valid idea and the minister is certainly on the right track. I am horrified at the hypocrisy of the Labor Party trying to rewrite the last six years of Labor mismanagement. This bill has my full support.

"McGowan, Cathy, MP",Ind.,2014-10-27,"



Ms McGOWAN
 (Indi) (13:22):  I acknowledge my colleagues who have already spoken in this debate and I give them my total support for decentralisation. I look forward to policies that support Albury-Wodonga in particular. It gives me great pleasure to speak to the Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill. I would like to cover off three points. The first is the recommendations made by the National Farmers Federation, the second is the importance of consultation, and the third is my congratulations to the Minister for Agriculture on his green paper. I will discuss some of the topics he has raised in that, in particular the importance of education. In summary, the principal of government setting a major precedent of change for the RDC model without consulting with industry is very concerning, particularly given that the RDC model rests on cooperation and partnership with industry. Why change a major system like this that has operated so well for so long just for $7 million, and why provoke the wrath of an industry by not consulting properly? I hope that when we move through to discussion and debate about the white paper we can take seriously the comments that industry has made.


The National Farmers Federation made a number of recommendations in their submission to the inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Regional and Rural Affairs and Transport. They made two recommendations on the bill that I would like to bring to the attention of the House. One was about the paying of international subscriptions on behalf of some of the RDCs. The NFF recommends that the committee consider whether the funding of membership to international intergovernment commodity organisations requires legislative change. It is their belief that it does not. The NFF also recommends that the committee consider whether the government is making long-term structural changes to the RDC model without adequate consideration of the consequences or adequate industry consultation. They are two very valid points that I hope the government representative on the front bench, the member for Riverina, will answer when he replies to the debate.


The second recommendation that the NFF makes—I think it has an enormous amount of value—is that even if we agree with these changes and we put them in place, they do not have to be there forever. The NFF recommends that the bill be amended with a sunset clause of five years, when the obligation of funding of international intergovernment commodity organisations shifts back to the Australian government. Again I think there is a lot of merit in that and I ask the parliamentary secretary to comment on it. They are two things that the NFF are saying need to be done and I will be keen to hear support from my colleagues opposite on that.


The next issue I would like to address is consultation with industry, and how important it is to me, as a member representing a rural electorate, that the government have deep and extensive consultation with industry—and not only consults but also takes on board what industry has to say. I congratulate the minister for the agricultural competitiveness green paper and the opportunity to consult with industry over the next couple of months on some of the major themes in the paper. The minister has done a fantastic job—giving it time, giving it resources and putting in place skilled public servants who can pull such a really good paper together. That is exactly the way we should be consulting with industry. It builds trust but, much more importantly, it gets us really good results in the long-term. 


There are a couple of topics in this paper that I bring to the attention of the House. One is education and training. We have heard right across the country that we can do all we like at one level with R&D, but if we do not have a solid base of education and training the whole system will shift in ways that we do not want to see. Education and training is fundamentally important to the long-term sustainability of a rural research and development cooperation program. University education is particularly important. As members of this House know, the Minister for Education has plans to change the way education is funded in Australia. While that might work for our city cousins, I have great doubts that it is going to work for our agricultural sector. 


Jim Pratley, from Charles Sturt University, has done studies which show that we already have market failure in rural and regional Australia, particularly in regard to training agricultural economists and all the specialist people that we need with a university education. In 2012, he indicated there was a need for 4,000 professionally qualified agricultural research people in Australia, and we were able to produce only 800. So, we absolutely need to change the situation. But we need to change it so we can meet the real need in rural and regional Australia for qualified scientists and other research people, and we have to hold them in rural and regional Australia so they can contribute to the whole process of building a competitive agricultural sector. We need those qualified, skilled, tertiary educated people to do the work that has to be done. I am a great supporter of what I read in this paper about building pathways between schools, TAFEs and universities so that we have a system in which people can move up to do their PhDs and then hopefully live and work in rural Australia when they have finished their PhD. I bring to the attention of the House how important that consultation is and I emphasise the words that our community have been saying and urge that we hold onto these thoughts at the next stage of this paper when it becomes a white paper—we need to put funds, personnel and resources into particularly tertiary education, particularly in rural and regional Australia, and particularly into agriculture. It is probably the most important thing we can do.


Another part of this paper that has great merit concerns the need to establish a new body, or task existing research bodies, to coordinate cross-sector research. One of the important things that need to happen in rural and regional Australia is that we need to talk to each other across RDCs. A worrying part of this legislation before the House is that the RDCs do not have to report to parliament and they do not have to meet on an annual basis.

Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (13:30):  The Abbott government's backpedalling from its pre-election commitment to build the replacement submarines in South Australia continues. Prior to the election, the Minister for Defence, Mr David Johnston, said:


We will deliver those submarines from right here at ASC in South Australia. 


The Coalition today is committed to building 12 new submarines here in Adelaide …


Last Thursday the member for Eden-Monaro claimed in this House that the Abbott government had never promised to build the subs in South Australia but that any work relating to the subs would be 'centred on Adelaide'.


Defence Minister Johnston's pre-election commitment to South Australia about the replacement submarines was crystal clear—they would be built in Adelaide. The claim that the work would be centred on Adelaide is political spin by a government that is trying to extricate itself from another pre-election promise and that appears to be paving the way for a deal with Japan.


Not only is this issue critical for South Australia; it also matters to Australians right across the country. Australians will not be fooled by spin. Unlike the auto industry, which the Abbott government turned its back on, with the replacement submarine program the buck stops fairly and squarely with the Abbott government. Where are the South Australian Liberals on this issue? I note the member for Hindmarsh is in the chamber. It seems that they too have gone to water.

That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would allow the member for Watson to move the following resolution forthwith:


That this House censures the Minister for Agriculture for:


(1) the misleading the House on Monday 20 October; and


(2) attempting to improperly alter the official Hansard record in order to cover up this misleading of the House.


Madam Speaker, leave should have been granted for this resolution. Of all the issues where leave is ordinarily granted, it is on a censure. And of all the reasons for censure, there is nothing that carries greater gravity than the misleading of this House. Be in no doubt, Madam Speaker, we need to be able to suspend standing orders when we have a minister who, on the Monday, misleads the House and that afternoon—or whenever he did it—tries to cover up the official Hansard record. This never would have come to light and this would never have happened were it not for the fact that the shadow minister for agriculture, the member for Hunter, drew to the attention of the parliament on Wednesday that the Minister for Agriculture still had not turned up to give accurate information to this House.


There is nothing that the parliament deals with that is more serious than ministerial accountability. And there will be times when members of the frontbench make an error. They will come in here and they will swallow their pride—and it is not a lot of fun for them; we have done it and I have had to do it.

"McGowan, Cathy, MP",Ind.,2014-10-27,"



Ms McGOWAN
 (Indi) (13:52):  In continuing my speech there are just two more points I would like to make before I finish up. They are the importance of coordinating cross-sector research and the impact that this legislation will have on the ability of RDCs to work together.


It seems to be a minor point, but it is one that has really come up through the agricultural competitiveness green paper. That is that the community, and particularly the agricultural industry sector, is very keen that there be more cooperation between the RDCs. At page 91, there is the call for establishing a new body, or particularly tasking existing research bodies to coordinate cross-sector research. They talk of a new or existing body that could be tasked with promoting agricultural research; ensuring research was focused on RD&E priorities; encouraging R&D activities across disciplines; and identifying the next big potential transformational research areas to encourage investment, collaboration and uptake. I note that in the legislation mechanisms to bring people together are being done away with. I think this is such a pity because it is a time when we actually need to come together more often and share the intellectual capital we have if we are actually going to make the transformations we need in agriculture.


A few years ago I was on a committee tasked with establishing a national strategic investment plan for rural research and development in Australia. One of the really important things that came out of that national rural investment plan was the need for high-level collaborative brains coming together to look at how we could actually bring our scarce resources and deliver for the country on what we knew needed to be done. I have to say that there was one important part of the election campaign—the allocation of $100 million to agricultural research and development—that did bring the RDCs together, but a whole lot more needs to be done. It is such an opportunity where we can bring people together.


If I could just give you one example of how it happens in a very practical way. As you might know, I am a farmer and I grow sheep. In my learning days, I benefited from the ability of Australian Wool Innovation and MLA—Meat & Livestock Australia—to come together. On the ground they had community based learning activities, otherwise known as extension, for farmers to learn how to work together. In my community that particular program was called BESTWOOL/BESTLAMB and it brought sheep producers, pasture growers and meat producers together. We were able to actively collaborate in our communities about the best way of taking research, implementing it on our farms and then producing the result, which was much higher returns on our investment. This came about because Meat & Livestock Australia and Australian Wool Innovation worked together. Previous to that, they worked with the other very important research group called Land and Water Australia that brought everybody together.


What I am saying in terms of this legislation is that there is an opportunity in the years ahead of us, particularly if we can pick up the recommendations in this report, to bring the RDCs together and to actually look for efficiencies where our research, our development and our extension can deliver much better results for farmers. Because the reality is most of us farmers actually work at that cooperative level. I think the legislation is taking us away from that opportunity to work together.


If I could just bring my comments to a close, what I would like to do in summarising is say that it is great that we have ways and we have people working on how we can save money; $7 million is $7 million, and it is really important to save $7 million when we can see it. But not at the cost of losing the trust of the industry; not at the cost of losing the trust of the National Farmers' Federation. How often is it that the NFF comes into this House and says to my colleagues opposite, 'This is not good legislation; this needs changes'?


So I am really happy to be able to stand in this parliament as a friend of the NFF and speak on their behalf and encourage them to work with my colleagues in the Senate to get the amendments that we need to make this ability to collaborate stronger, to make the ability for us to work internationally stronger, but most importantly to not put things in concrete forever—to put a sunset clause into this legislation so after five years, when, hopefully, the economy is a much better position, we can revert to how things used to be.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,16,1
"Hutchinson, Eric, MP",LP,2014-10-27,"



Mr HUTCHINSON
 (Lyons) (15:26):  It is a real pleasure to speak on the Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. I note the member for Indi's comments, but in working towards my contribution today I spoke to Australian Wool Innovation. They are over the moon about the $100 million—$100 million that needs to be used collaboratively. They welcome the fact that there is money on the table there that the federal government has invested in research and development that will need to be leveraged with the private sector and industry and that will need to be leveraged also with the universities and higher education institutions. The essence of this bill is the provision of an extra $100 million over four years to the rural and research development corporations with the clear intention to boost agricultural productivity growth—indeed, in collaboration that will benefit most of all those people at the farm gate.


The bill implements a 2014 budget commitment by this government to change the way that government pays for its membership to international commodity organisations and the regional fisheries management organisations. We understand that that is a fact of life, when we have inherited a budget mess like we have. It also reduces the red tape burden currently imposed on some of the rural research and development corporations. These organisations in turn improve the trading environment for agricultural products by funding activities of benefit to our rural industries and the community in general, including research and development on issues of global significance, not least food security. 


Most importantly, this bill paves the way for $100 million in additional funding over the next four years for Australia's rural research and development corporations that will be leveraged with universities and the private sector. Investment in rural research and development is an important part of the Australian government's policy for a competitive agricultural sector. There is a strong link between research and development and agricultural productivity growth, with the research and development investment delivering productivity returns that far exceed indeed the cost of that investment. 


However, in recent years the productivity growth of Australian agriculture has slowed somewhat. This additional funding will deliver practical research to help farmers to be more productive and ultimately more profitable. This is funding for on-the-ground research and cutting-edge technologies that support our agriculture, fisheries and forestry industries. It is vital that our Australian farmers and producers remain competitive in international markets where two-thirds of their product goes. We should never forget that, that we are an exporting nation and that two-thirds of the food and fibre, and more so in the case of fibre, ends up overseas. 


We expect research and development corporations to form alliances with institutions like the University of Tasmania, to develop exciting projects to keep our farmers and rural producers at the forefront of agricultural research. That leads me to what I want to focus on today—that is, the National Irrigation RD&E Program for Tasmania. Investment in this space is critical for productivity growth. The Tasmanian Institute of Agriculture, TIA, is a collaboration, owned jointly and managed jointly by the University of Tasmania and the Tasmanian state government. 


The governance of the irrigation and extension work within TIA is done by an outstanding group of industry representatives, including Marcus McShane from the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association; Allan Barr from the third largest agribusiness in Australia, Roberts Ruralco, and my former boss; Scott Schilg from NRM North, a bike-riding colleague; Richard Gardner, one of my oldest friends who represents the Midlands Water Group; Chris Thompson from Macquarie Franklin who has a wealth of knowledge in regard to the design and implementation of the irrigation schemes that we are already seeing around Tasmania; David Kay from Rabobank, who brings a commercial focus to the governance arrangement; and Caroline Brown from DPIPWE. It is a most formidable and competent governance organisation to support the work of TIA. TIA's director Holger Meinke and Associate Professor Rohan Nelson are responsible for the National Irrigation RD&E Program for Tasmania. 


In trying to summarise exactly what maximising productivity out of irrigation investment in Tasmania really means, it is maximising productivity using the least amount of water and the least amount of energy. Essentially, that is what R&D in irrigation is all about. We know that this has a national significance and indeed an international significance, because by 2050 we will have a population of nine million. We have to feed and clothe those people, and that is indeed a challenge. That challenge is not going to be wholly the responsibility of Australia and it is certainly not going to be the responsibility of Tasmania—it simply does not have the capacity.


Already, we have seen in my state $310 million invested by the federal government, the Tasmanian government and private investors in irrigation infrastructure. In addition to that, another $265 million has been made in investments on farm, be that through dams or piping or water application systems—pivot irrigation or, in the case of more intensive horticulture, drip irrigation systems. One hundred and fifty gigalitres of additional irrigation water will be available for irrigators when all the planned schemes are brought into operation. To put that in context, the irrigation capacity within my home state of Tasmania and the irrigable land is comparable to the Ord River and the Gilbert and Flinders schemes, and one of the most significant investments that this nation has seen in irrigation infrastructure since the mighty Murray-Darling rivers development. 


The critical difference is that Tasmania's expansion of irrigation builds on existing high-value, temperate agriculture, which is close to the population centres in my state and close to a ready workforce. Multiple small catchments are managed individually to make sure that they are sustainably governed and managed appropriately on an economic basis but also a sustainable and environmental basis. There will be over $500 million invested in agriculture irrigation schemes within my home state once the tranche 2 irrigation schemes are delivered which includes the southern highlands scheme in my electorate, the Scottsdale scheme in the electorate of Bass, the Circular Head scheme in the electorate of Braddon, the Swan Valley scheme and the north Esk scheme also in the electorate of Lyons. 


The contribution of R&D is significant. I note the Tasmanian government's ambitious target to increase the value of the output of agriculture at the farm gate in my state between now and 2050 from about $1.2 billion currently annually to more than $10 billion. It is a very ambitious target. But as the West report in 2009 suggested, increases of this magnitude were indeed technically feasible, if we focus on the things where Tasmania particularly has a competitive advantage. That is around high-value horticulture; dairy, where we have a natural competitive advantage in terms of the cost of production, being able to produce milk with less grain than is normally required; viticulture; and intensive livestock operations. If 80 per cent of the $10 billion target is to be achieved by irrigated agriculture, the value generated from irrigation water needs to be increased from $3½ thousand per megalitre to nearly $16,000 per megalitre. They are enormous challenges; therefore, every bit of R&D is required to make sure that we can deliver on that potential and that opportunity.


The basis for some of the projects that we will see and the way we will achieve that significant increase in the value of the agriculture and horticulture sectors at the farm gate involve a few major projects: soils and drainage; agronomy and the different varieties appropriate for my state—grains and the different horticultural crops; precision agriculture, which will be increasingly important; whole-farm system modelling; value chains and food processing; and extension and education. 


Probably no better example of the importance of education is my own experience and the work that I did before I came to this place, particularly around price risk management and encouraging the use of forward selling, encouraging the use of futures—contracts for wool growers to control one of the variables that they have within their businesses. They cannot often, as you would well understand, Deputy Speaker, control whether it rains or it does not rain. One of the ways they can have an impact—it is a bit like fixing a fence with a set of wire strainers; there are certain jobs you can do with certain tools—is understanding what is a good price, an average price or a poor price helps farmers make better decisions, and that comes with education. So there are many opportunities and the benefits will be enormous and wide ranging. 


Indeed, the dairy industry will expand to meet growing world demand, through increased pasture production and better utilisation of feed grain, particularly around the expansion of the grains industry. A very large proportion of the grain use within the dairy sector is imported into our state and we are looking at ways of using irrigated grain crops to take some of those yields from about four tonnes a hectare, which traditionally is the case in non-irrigated grain varieties, to up to 12 tonnes per hectare, which is a significant increase. That is what we need. The benefits that will flow to the dairy industry as a result of being able to grow more grain in Tasmania will be significant.


Expansion of intensive horticulture and viticulture, cool climate fruits, vegetables and wine and the government's investment in infrastructure—such as $38 million to extend the Hobart airport—will give increase our exports of horticultural products into parts of Asia which at the moment are difficult to access. Tasmania has always had a reputation and a capacity to produce and be involved in very high-value specialist plant crops like, for example, opium poppies, a very important industry in my state where real knowledge has been built up by producers and processors alike. Then there are pyrethrum, essential oils, specialty grains and the production of pasture and vegetable seeds as well.


It is an enormous task. I look forward to seeing the application which no doubt the university and TIA will make through a collaborative approach to, I suspect, the Grains Research and Development Corporation and some of the other and research development bodies. As I said before, R&D, when it comes to irrigation, essentially means maximising our productivity, using the least amount of water, being smart and efficient with it, and using the least amount of energy. This is indeed what irrigation R&D is all about.


It would be remiss of me in the small time I have left not to mention the industry of which I was apart from nearly 25 years—that is, the wool industry. There are some great examples where there has been collaborative investment through AWI. As the member for Indi said, there are some excellent examples. In the case of Tasmania, it used to be the eight by five program. It is now Sheep Connect Tasmania, the leading sheep program, which works with both MLA and also Australian Wool Innovation to do some really great work. Indeed, with some of the projects we are seeing at the moment in Tasmania on the extension network, a staggering 97 per cent of farmers said they would make changes to their business and that these changes would result in more than $5,000 worth of benefits directly to their business. There is indeed value in collaboration. I cannot speak highly enough about what has been invested by the Minister for Agriculture and the federal government through this $100 million. It will be used smartly. 


We must make the most of our scarce resources. There is no more important issue than productivity and research and development if Australia is going to be competitive in future in a space where we have always been very strong, but we cannot rest on our laurels. Thank you for the opportunity.

"Elliot, Justine, MP",ALP,2014-10-27,"



Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond) (15:41):  Today I rise to speak on the Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. It is rather timely, given the very remarkable behaviour of the Minister for Agriculture in question time today. It certainly reflects on his lack of commitment and skill when it comes to making sure that we are providing good policies and plans for those in regional and rural Australia. I think they would have concerns about the lack of ability of the relevant minister.


This bill makes amendments to the rural research and development legislation and gives effect to yet another unfair budget measure. What we see is a very definite pattern with this government of broken promises and unfair budget measures. In regional areas like mine, locals know that when it comes to unfair budget measures and broken promises it is the National Party who are to blame and they are very vocal in their criticisms. We can add this bill to the long list of promises broken by the National Party which includes the doctor tax, the petrol tax, cuts to education and cuts to the pensions.


 The bill is designed to allow the government to recover the cost of membership fees to international commodity organisations and regional fisheries management organisations from the matching amounts paid to rural research and development corporations. Other measures included in the bill will remove the requirement for the minister to organise an annual coordination meeting for the chairs of the statutory RDCs and removes some parliamentary tabling requirements. As I have said, this is another unfair budget measure which will impact greatly on the research and development work undertaken by the rural research and development corporations.


The government's proposed changes to the current RDC matching funding model are fundamentally changing the focus of the RDC system. The fact is the RDCs should not have to pay the membership fees for the Australian government, which is the reality. If the government believes that there is value for it to be a member of these international organisations then it should pay the membership fees. Matching funding by the government to the RDCs is an investment in the future of our agriculture, fisheries and forestry. It is generally estimated that for each genuine R&D dollar there is a $10 return and our RDCs should be allowed to invest in projects that will benefit their industry and not bear the brunt of the government's lack of strategic planning for our RDCs. As it states of the Department of Agriculture website:


The RDCs invest in R&D and innovation to improve the productivity and delivery of high quality products in order to underpin the competitiveness and profitability of Australia's agricultural, fish and forestry industries. RDC R&D and innovation also supports the sustainability of primary production and the natural resource base.


That is what the website says, and that is what the government should be properly investing in, it is what they should be properly focusing on, but of course that is not the case.


Also, we do hear the government talking about agriculture being one of the five pillars of the economy, yet its actions are completely opposed to that. By cutting funding to research and development, that is what we see. That is what we see from this Minister for Agriculture, who I see is now back in the chamber; that is indeed what he has been responsible for. Look at some of those cuts: an $80 million reduction in cooperative research centre programs; more than $100 million in funding cuts to the CSIRO, which will cost around 500 jobs. What a major impact that will be with around 500 jobs going. As we have said, we on this side of the House oppose this bill and its unfair measures.


As we know, there are up to 15 rural research and development corporations covering our agricultural industries. These 15 research and development corporations are made up of nine industry-owned companies that provide R&D services and marketing for the benefit of their industries, and six research and development corporations that provide leadership and investment. Those industry owned companies are—I will run through that list; it is important to have that list on the record—the Australian Egg Corporation Ltd, Australian Livestock Export Corporation Ltd, Australian Meat Processor Corporation Ltd, Australian Pork Ltd, Australian Wool Innovation Ltd, Dairy Australia Ltd, Forest and Wood Products Australia Ltd, Horticulture Australia Ltd, Meat and Livestock Australia Ltd.


The research and development corporations are: Cotton Research and Development Corporation, Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, Grains Research and Development Corporation, Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation, Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation and Sugar Research and Development Corporation. The RDCs bring together industry and researchers to investigate and implement strategic directions and to fund projects that provide industry with the innovation and productivity tools to compete in those very, very important global markets. And it is the demand of these global markets that is really effectively driving our agricultural industries and the government should be supporting that, not undermining it.


The RDC model of joint industry and government funding has been absolutely vital in the success of Australia's R&D effort, having helped Australian agriculture double its productivity over the past 25 years—what a great achievement. In fact, this co-funding model is the envy of the world, and that is why we in Labor are here fighting to protect that. We know how good it is. Labor's R&D model is what working with industry is all about: not telling industry what to do, but facilitating and helping it; to be in partnership with industry. That is what is important.


The government-industry partnership model works well. It has successfully functioned for more than 20 years, which is absolutely fantastic. It is about government matching industry contributions; that is the key. But this bill, like so much else this Liberal-National government has introduced into the House since 2013, really has been an unfair attack on those ordinary, hardworking regional and rural Australians who have really been severely impacted by many of the plans of this government. And this bill is just another example of its dismantling of the matching contributions component of this particular scheme.


The fact is Labor understand how important research and development corporations are. We created them in 1989, so we understand how important they are. We established them for the purpose of undertaking scientific research for the benefit of Australian rural industries and with benefits then flowing onto the community. As we have said: the government would put in half the amount—match dollar for dollar—into R&D if industry was prepared to levy itself and make its own contributions to improve the innovation within particular sectors. These industry specific plans for R&D have transformed agriculture in this country. As I have said, we have seen that increase in productivity.


The government is now seeking to achieve a $7 million saving over four years, but this will be at the expense of tens of thousands of genuine R&D investment dollars. Essentially the government is seeking to achieve this saving over that time by changing arrangements for the payments of membership to international commodity organisations. From 2014-15 membership fees for four international commodity organisations—relating specifically to the cotton, wine, sugar and grain industries—and six international fisheries organisations will be made from the government's funding envelope for its matching contributions to the relevant RDCs instead of direct appropriation funding and, in so doing, will reduce actual R&D funding. This means that the government will make payments to the international commodity bodies from the same pool of money it says is for matching industry contributions. This is just not logical and it is certainly not an appropriate way to be looking at funding these very important matters. Much like the other policies of this government, this bill actually constitutes a cut in funding in real terms.


Worse still, this government did not even give the Australian people prior warning about any of these cuts. And we have seen that across so many other measures in so many other areas, whether it is health or education or pensions. They did not tell anyone in regional or rural Australia they intended this to be their plan. In fact, they have been telling untruths by not telling people about their plans—a real deception by omission—which a lot of people are now aware of and are pretty angry about as well. In fact, prior to the last election the then opposition made no reference to any of these particular cuts. What I think is even more insulting is the government, and many of its members, have actually acknowledged that research and development investment returns far outweigh the costs. They are aware of the reality of it, but are still allowing this to occur. With these changes, RDCs have not even been given the option to withdraw their membership to international commodity organisations.


This bill will really be quite devastating for farmers in rural and regional Australia. In abandoning matching funding for regional development and innovation, it will make it much harder for many agricultural industries in my electorate—for example, when it comes to the sugar industry—to do their business. And I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, you are very much aware how important the sugar cane industry is to people of the North Coast of New South Wales; I would certainly hope the member for Page, who is here in the chamber, would understand how important it is as a major employer and as a major driver of our local economy. We should be out there supporting industries like our sugar industry, not placing impediments on them instead—particularly not impediments on their future research and development.


Hidden in this legislation is the repeal of subsections 6 and 7 of the Sugar Research and Development Services Act 2013. This act provides for a company to receive, under a contract, Commonwealth funding for research and development for the Australian sugar industry and to be declared as the industry services body for the Australian sugar industry. The subsections allow the minister to make R&D payments, or matching payments, to the Australian sugar industry representative. These will now be repealed, and I think it is absolutely appalling that that in particular is happening.


This government's decision to essentially withdraw funding is going to create a situation where you are leaving those struggling in regional and rural areas—those farmers—to foot the additional costs. I would assume those are subsequently passed on to consumers. It also puts them at a greater disadvantage when it comes to their overseas competitiveness and competing in those global markets. I believe this bill is another example of how the National Party in particular has abandoned rural and regional Australia. 


Labor, on the other hand, have a very proud record of standing up for rural and regional Australia over a very long period of time. We created the regional development fund which, of course, is now being totally changed and watered down by those opposite. That delivered so many great projects around Australia, especially in my electorate of Richmond. I will not run through all of those again, but there were millions of dollars in projects that really transformed so much of the North Coast of New South Wales. In fact, Labor in government really took the national leadership to build competitive and sustainable agriculture industries to support farming families that contribute more than 1.6 million jobs. We understand how important it is. That is why we invested so much. 


We also developed Australia's first-ever National Food Plan to boost Australia's $30.5 billion food export market by 45 per cent. We had that in place and understood how important it was. We established the Office of Northern Australia to realise the north's potential. We developed real solutions to climate and market condition challenges, including the farm finance package, which provided $420 million in low-interest loans to help viable farmers ease debt pressures.


We also invested a record amount in rural R&D, providing R&D corporations with $1.4 billion in funding over the last six years, increasing from $189 million in 2008-09, to $251 million in 2013-14. We also addressed many of those skill shortages in the agricultural industries. We understood how important it was to be making sure there was adequate funding for training and addressing some of those skill shortages, particularly through many projects and trades training in schools and a whole range of different measures that we took to address those skill shortages right across the agricultural industry. Also, through Caring for our Country and continuing support for Landcare, which was, of course, a legacy of the Hawke government, we have supported farming communities to manage and protect our natural resources, protect and conserve our biodiversity and promote the adoption of sustainable farm practices. 


The Labor Party has a very proud record of standing with those in regional and rural Australia across a whole range of different areas. We continue to do that today on this side of the House. We continue to condemn this government across a whole range of areas where they did not tell the Australian people the truth going into the last election whether it was in relation to health, education or now, as we are seeing clearly, with particular aspects of rural and regional Australia as well.


I started off by saying we do have a Minister for Agriculture who does not have the skills and ability to represent these people and deliver adequately for them. They do not have any faith in him, his ability or his government. The fact is he has failed those in rural and regional Australia. He has failed those people, and they are severely disappointed by that. They are hurt by the cuts this government has brought in, particularly these cuts to R&D. It is devastating. We need to be encouraging growth. We need to be investing more. We need to be providing more for those in regional and rural areas, not cutting as we are constantly seeing from this government and this minister, who is incapable of delivering for regional and rural areas. That is why we are opposed to this bill.

"McGowan, Cathy, MP",Ind.,2014-10-27,"



Ms McGOWAN
 (Indi) (13:52):  In continuing my speech there are just two more points I would like to make before I finish up. They are the importance of coordinating cross-sector research and the impact that this legislation will have on the ability of RDCs to work together.


It seems to be a minor point, but it is one that has really come up through the agricultural competitiveness green paper. That is that the community, and particularly the agricultural industry sector, is very keen that there be more cooperation between the RDCs. At page 91, there is the call for establishing a new body, or particularly tasking existing research bodies to coordinate cross-sector research. They talk of a new or existing body that could be tasked with promoting agricultural research; ensuring research was focused on RD&E priorities; encouraging R&D activities across disciplines; and identifying the next big potential transformational research areas to encourage investment, collaboration and uptake. I note that in the legislation mechanisms to bring people together are being done away with. I think this is such a pity because it is a time when we actually need to come together more often and share the intellectual capital we have if we are actually going to make the transformations we need in agriculture.


A few years ago I was on a committee tasked with establishing a national strategic investment plan for rural research and development in Australia. One of the really important things that came out of that national rural investment plan was the need for high-level collaborative brains coming together to look at how we could actually bring our scarce resources and deliver for the country on what we knew needed to be done. I have to say that there was one important part of the election campaign—the allocation of $100 million to agricultural research and development—that did bring the RDCs together, but a whole lot more needs to be done. It is such an opportunity where we can bring people together.


If I could just give you one example of how it happens in a very practical way. As you might know, I am a farmer and I grow sheep. In my learning days, I benefited from the ability of Australian Wool Innovation and MLA—Meat & Livestock Australia—to come together. On the ground they had community based learning activities, otherwise known as extension, for farmers to learn how to work together. In my community that particular program was called BESTWOOL/BESTLAMB and it brought sheep producers, pasture growers and meat producers together. We were able to actively collaborate in our communities about the best way of taking research, implementing it on our farms and then producing the result, which was much higher returns on our investment. This came about because Meat & Livestock Australia and Australian Wool Innovation worked together. Previous to that, they worked with the other very important research group called Land and Water Australia that brought everybody together.


What I am saying in terms of this legislation is that there is an opportunity in the years ahead of us, particularly if we can pick up the recommendations in this report, to bring the RDCs together and to actually look for efficiencies where our research, our development and our extension can deliver much better results for farmers. Because the reality is most of us farmers actually work at that cooperative level. I think the legislation is taking us away from that opportunity to work together.


If I could just bring my comments to a close, what I would like to do in summarising is say that it is great that we have ways and we have people working on how we can save money; $7 million is $7 million, and it is really important to save $7 million when we can see it. But not at the cost of losing the trust of the industry; not at the cost of losing the trust of the National Farmers' Federation. How often is it that the NFF comes into this House and says to my colleagues opposite, 'This is not good legislation; this needs changes'?


So I am really happy to be able to stand in this parliament as a friend of the NFF and speak on their behalf and encourage them to work with my colleagues in the Senate to get the amendments that we need to make this ability to collaborate stronger, to make the ability for us to work internationally stronger, but most importantly to not put things in concrete forever—to put a sunset clause into this legislation so after five years, when, hopefully, the economy is a much better position, we can revert to how things used to be.

"Hutchinson, Eric, MP",LP,2014-10-27,"



Mr HUTCHINSON
 (Lyons) (15:26):  It is a real pleasure to speak on the Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. I note the member for Indi's comments, but in working towards my contribution today I spoke to Australian Wool Innovation. They are over the moon about the $100 million—$100 million that needs to be used collaboratively. They welcome the fact that there is money on the table there that the federal government has invested in research and development that will need to be leveraged with the private sector and industry and that will need to be leveraged also with the universities and higher education institutions. The essence of this bill is the provision of an extra $100 million over four years to the rural and research development corporations with the clear intention to boost agricultural productivity growth—indeed, in collaboration that will benefit most of all those people at the farm gate.


The bill implements a 2014 budget commitment by this government to change the way that government pays for its membership to international commodity organisations and the regional fisheries management organisations. We understand that that is a fact of life, when we have inherited a budget mess like we have. It also reduces the red tape burden currently imposed on some of the rural research and development corporations. These organisations in turn improve the trading environment for agricultural products by funding activities of benefit to our rural industries and the community in general, including research and development on issues of global significance, not least food security. 


Most importantly, this bill paves the way for $100 million in additional funding over the next four years for Australia's rural research and development corporations that will be leveraged with universities and the private sector. Investment in rural research and development is an important part of the Australian government's policy for a competitive agricultural sector. There is a strong link between research and development and agricultural productivity growth, with the research and development investment delivering productivity returns that far exceed indeed the cost of that investment. 


However, in recent years the productivity growth of Australian agriculture has slowed somewhat. This additional funding will deliver practical research to help farmers to be more productive and ultimately more profitable. This is funding for on-the-ground research and cutting-edge technologies that support our agriculture, fisheries and forestry industries. It is vital that our Australian farmers and producers remain competitive in international markets where two-thirds of their product goes. We should never forget that, that we are an exporting nation and that two-thirds of the food and fibre, and more so in the case of fibre, ends up overseas. 


We expect research and development corporations to form alliances with institutions like the University of Tasmania, to develop exciting projects to keep our farmers and rural producers at the forefront of agricultural research. That leads me to what I want to focus on today—that is, the National Irrigation RD&E Program for Tasmania. Investment in this space is critical for productivity growth. The Tasmanian Institute of Agriculture, TIA, is a collaboration, owned jointly and managed jointly by the University of Tasmania and the Tasmanian state government. 


The governance of the irrigation and extension work within TIA is done by an outstanding group of industry representatives, including Marcus McShane from the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association; Allan Barr from the third largest agribusiness in Australia, Roberts Ruralco, and my former boss; Scott Schilg from NRM North, a bike-riding colleague; Richard Gardner, one of my oldest friends who represents the Midlands Water Group; Chris Thompson from Macquarie Franklin who has a wealth of knowledge in regard to the design and implementation of the irrigation schemes that we are already seeing around Tasmania; David Kay from Rabobank, who brings a commercial focus to the governance arrangement; and Caroline Brown from DPIPWE. It is a most formidable and competent governance organisation to support the work of TIA. TIA's director Holger Meinke and Associate Professor Rohan Nelson are responsible for the National Irrigation RD&E Program for Tasmania. 


In trying to summarise exactly what maximising productivity out of irrigation investment in Tasmania really means, it is maximising productivity using the least amount of water and the least amount of energy. Essentially, that is what R&D in irrigation is all about. We know that this has a national significance and indeed an international significance, because by 2050 we will have a population of nine million. We have to feed and clothe those people, and that is indeed a challenge. That challenge is not going to be wholly the responsibility of Australia and it is certainly not going to be the responsibility of Tasmania—it simply does not have the capacity.


Already, we have seen in my state $310 million invested by the federal government, the Tasmanian government and private investors in irrigation infrastructure. In addition to that, another $265 million has been made in investments on farm, be that through dams or piping or water application systems—pivot irrigation or, in the case of more intensive horticulture, drip irrigation systems. One hundred and fifty gigalitres of additional irrigation water will be available for irrigators when all the planned schemes are brought into operation. To put that in context, the irrigation capacity within my home state of Tasmania and the irrigable land is comparable to the Ord River and the Gilbert and Flinders schemes, and one of the most significant investments that this nation has seen in irrigation infrastructure since the mighty Murray-Darling rivers development. 


The critical difference is that Tasmania's expansion of irrigation builds on existing high-value, temperate agriculture, which is close to the population centres in my state and close to a ready workforce. Multiple small catchments are managed individually to make sure that they are sustainably governed and managed appropriately on an economic basis but also a sustainable and environmental basis. There will be over $500 million invested in agriculture irrigation schemes within my home state once the tranche 2 irrigation schemes are delivered which includes the southern highlands scheme in my electorate, the Scottsdale scheme in the electorate of Bass, the Circular Head scheme in the electorate of Braddon, the Swan Valley scheme and the north Esk scheme also in the electorate of Lyons. 


The contribution of R&D is significant. I note the Tasmanian government's ambitious target to increase the value of the output of agriculture at the farm gate in my state between now and 2050 from about $1.2 billion currently annually to more than $10 billion. It is a very ambitious target. But as the West report in 2009 suggested, increases of this magnitude were indeed technically feasible, if we focus on the things where Tasmania particularly has a competitive advantage. That is around high-value horticulture; dairy, where we have a natural competitive advantage in terms of the cost of production, being able to produce milk with less grain than is normally required; viticulture; and intensive livestock operations. If 80 per cent of the $10 billion target is to be achieved by irrigated agriculture, the value generated from irrigation water needs to be increased from $3½ thousand per megalitre to nearly $16,000 per megalitre. They are enormous challenges; therefore, every bit of R&D is required to make sure that we can deliver on that potential and that opportunity.


The basis for some of the projects that we will see and the way we will achieve that significant increase in the value of the agriculture and horticulture sectors at the farm gate involve a few major projects: soils and drainage; agronomy and the different varieties appropriate for my state—grains and the different horticultural crops; precision agriculture, which will be increasingly important; whole-farm system modelling; value chains and food processing; and extension and education. 


Probably no better example of the importance of education is my own experience and the work that I did before I came to this place, particularly around price risk management and encouraging the use of forward selling, encouraging the use of futures—contracts for wool growers to control one of the variables that they have within their businesses. They cannot often, as you would well understand, Deputy Speaker, control whether it rains or it does not rain. One of the ways they can have an impact—it is a bit like fixing a fence with a set of wire strainers; there are certain jobs you can do with certain tools—is understanding what is a good price, an average price or a poor price helps farmers make better decisions, and that comes with education. So there are many opportunities and the benefits will be enormous and wide ranging. 


Indeed, the dairy industry will expand to meet growing world demand, through increased pasture production and better utilisation of feed grain, particularly around the expansion of the grains industry. A very large proportion of the grain use within the dairy sector is imported into our state and we are looking at ways of using irrigated grain crops to take some of those yields from about four tonnes a hectare, which traditionally is the case in non-irrigated grain varieties, to up to 12 tonnes per hectare, which is a significant increase. That is what we need. The benefits that will flow to the dairy industry as a result of being able to grow more grain in Tasmania will be significant.


Expansion of intensive horticulture and viticulture, cool climate fruits, vegetables and wine and the government's investment in infrastructure—such as $38 million to extend the Hobart airport—will give increase our exports of horticultural products into parts of Asia which at the moment are difficult to access. Tasmania has always had a reputation and a capacity to produce and be involved in very high-value specialist plant crops like, for example, opium poppies, a very important industry in my state where real knowledge has been built up by producers and processors alike. Then there are pyrethrum, essential oils, specialty grains and the production of pasture and vegetable seeds as well.


It is an enormous task. I look forward to seeing the application which no doubt the university and TIA will make through a collaborative approach to, I suspect, the Grains Research and Development Corporation and some of the other and research development bodies. As I said before, R&D, when it comes to irrigation, essentially means maximising our productivity, using the least amount of water, being smart and efficient with it, and using the least amount of energy. This is indeed what irrigation R&D is all about.


It would be remiss of me in the small time I have left not to mention the industry of which I was apart from nearly 25 years—that is, the wool industry. There are some great examples where there has been collaborative investment through AWI. As the member for Indi said, there are some excellent examples. In the case of Tasmania, it used to be the eight by five program. It is now Sheep Connect Tasmania, the leading sheep program, which works with both MLA and also Australian Wool Innovation to do some really great work. Indeed, with some of the projects we are seeing at the moment in Tasmania on the extension network, a staggering 97 per cent of farmers said they would make changes to their business and that these changes would result in more than $5,000 worth of benefits directly to their business. There is indeed value in collaboration. I cannot speak highly enough about what has been invested by the Minister for Agriculture and the federal government through this $100 million. It will be used smartly. 


We must make the most of our scarce resources. There is no more important issue than productivity and research and development if Australia is going to be competitive in future in a space where we have always been very strong, but we cannot rest on our laurels. Thank you for the opportunity.

"Elliot, Justine, MP",ALP,2014-10-27,"



Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond) (15:41):  Today I rise to speak on the Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. It is rather timely, given the very remarkable behaviour of the Minister for Agriculture in question time today. It certainly reflects on his lack of commitment and skill when it comes to making sure that we are providing good policies and plans for those in regional and rural Australia. I think they would have concerns about the lack of ability of the relevant minister.


This bill makes amendments to the rural research and development legislation and gives effect to yet another unfair budget measure. What we see is a very definite pattern with this government of broken promises and unfair budget measures. In regional areas like mine, locals know that when it comes to unfair budget measures and broken promises it is the National Party who are to blame and they are very vocal in their criticisms. We can add this bill to the long list of promises broken by the National Party which includes the doctor tax, the petrol tax, cuts to education and cuts to the pensions.


 The bill is designed to allow the government to recover the cost of membership fees to international commodity organisations and regional fisheries management organisations from the matching amounts paid to rural research and development corporations. Other measures included in the bill will remove the requirement for the minister to organise an annual coordination meeting for the chairs of the statutory RDCs and removes some parliamentary tabling requirements. As I have said, this is another unfair budget measure which will impact greatly on the research and development work undertaken by the rural research and development corporations.


The government's proposed changes to the current RDC matching funding model are fundamentally changing the focus of the RDC system. The fact is the RDCs should not have to pay the membership fees for the Australian government, which is the reality. If the government believes that there is value for it to be a member of these international organisations then it should pay the membership fees. Matching funding by the government to the RDCs is an investment in the future of our agriculture, fisheries and forestry. It is generally estimated that for each genuine R&D dollar there is a $10 return and our RDCs should be allowed to invest in projects that will benefit their industry and not bear the brunt of the government's lack of strategic planning for our RDCs. As it states of the Department of Agriculture website:


The RDCs invest in R&D and innovation to improve the productivity and delivery of high quality products in order to underpin the competitiveness and profitability of Australia's agricultural, fish and forestry industries. RDC R&D and innovation also supports the sustainability of primary production and the natural resource base.


That is what the website says, and that is what the government should be properly investing in, it is what they should be properly focusing on, but of course that is not the case.


Also, we do hear the government talking about agriculture being one of the five pillars of the economy, yet its actions are completely opposed to that. By cutting funding to research and development, that is what we see. That is what we see from this Minister for Agriculture, who I see is now back in the chamber; that is indeed what he has been responsible for. Look at some of those cuts: an $80 million reduction in cooperative research centre programs; more than $100 million in funding cuts to the CSIRO, which will cost around 500 jobs. What a major impact that will be with around 500 jobs going. As we have said, we on this side of the House oppose this bill and its unfair measures.


As we know, there are up to 15 rural research and development corporations covering our agricultural industries. These 15 research and development corporations are made up of nine industry-owned companies that provide R&D services and marketing for the benefit of their industries, and six research and development corporations that provide leadership and investment. Those industry owned companies are—I will run through that list; it is important to have that list on the record—the Australian Egg Corporation Ltd, Australian Livestock Export Corporation Ltd, Australian Meat Processor Corporation Ltd, Australian Pork Ltd, Australian Wool Innovation Ltd, Dairy Australia Ltd, Forest and Wood Products Australia Ltd, Horticulture Australia Ltd, Meat and Livestock Australia Ltd.


The research and development corporations are: Cotton Research and Development Corporation, Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, Grains Research and Development Corporation, Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation, Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation and Sugar Research and Development Corporation. The RDCs bring together industry and researchers to investigate and implement strategic directions and to fund projects that provide industry with the innovation and productivity tools to compete in those very, very important global markets. And it is the demand of these global markets that is really effectively driving our agricultural industries and the government should be supporting that, not undermining it.


The RDC model of joint industry and government funding has been absolutely vital in the success of Australia's R&D effort, having helped Australian agriculture double its productivity over the past 25 years—what a great achievement. In fact, this co-funding model is the envy of the world, and that is why we in Labor are here fighting to protect that. We know how good it is. Labor's R&D model is what working with industry is all about: not telling industry what to do, but facilitating and helping it; to be in partnership with industry. That is what is important.

And this bill is just another example of its dismantling of the matching contributions component of this particular scheme.

These industry specific plans for R&D have transformed agriculture in this country. As I have said, we have seen that increase in productivity.


The government is now seeking to achieve a $7 million saving over four years, but this will be at the expense of tens of thousands of genuine R&D investment dollars. Essentially the government is seeking to achieve this saving over that time by changing arrangements for the payments of membership to international commodity organisations. From 2014-15 membership fees for four international commodity organisations—relating specifically to the cotton, wine, sugar and grain industries—and six international fisheries organisations will be made from the government's funding envelope for its matching contributions to the relevant RDCs instead of direct appropriation funding and, in so doing, will reduce actual R&D funding. This means that the government will make payments to the international commodity bodies from the same pool of money it says is for matching industry contributions. This is just not logical and it is certainly not an appropriate way to be looking at funding these very important matters. Much like the other policies of this government, this bill actually constitutes a cut in funding in real terms.


Worse still, this government did not even give the Australian people prior warning about any of these cuts. And we have seen that across so many other measures in so many other areas, whether it is health or education or pensions.

They are aware of the reality of it, but are still allowing this to occur. With these changes, RDCs have not even been given the option to withdraw their membership to international commodity organisations.


This bill will really be quite devastating for farmers in rural and regional Australia. In abandoning matching funding for regional development and innovation, it will make it much harder for many agricultural industries in my electorate—for example, when it comes to the sugar industry—to do their business. And I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, you are very much aware how important the sugar cane industry is to people of the North Coast of New South Wales; I would certainly hope the member for Page, who is here in the chamber, would understand how important it is as a major employer and as a major driver of our local economy. We should be out there supporting industries like our sugar industry, not placing impediments on them instead—particularly not impediments on their future research and development.


Hidden in this legislation is the repeal of subsections 6 and 7 of the Sugar Research and Development Services Act 2013. This act provides for a company to receive, under a contract, Commonwealth funding for research and development for the Australian sugar industry and to be declared as the industry services body for the Australian sugar industry. The subsections allow the minister to make R&D payments, or matching payments, to the Australian sugar industry representative. These will now be repealed, and I think it is absolutely appalling that that in particular is happening.


This government's decision to essentially withdraw funding is going to create a situation where you are leaving those struggling in regional and rural areas—those farmers—to foot the additional costs. I would assume those are subsequently passed on to consumers. It also puts them at a greater disadvantage when it comes to their overseas competitiveness and competing in those global markets. I believe this bill is another example of how the National Party in particular has abandoned rural and regional Australia. 


Labor, on the other hand, have a very proud record of standing up for rural and regional Australia over a very long period of time. We created the regional development fund which, of course, is now being totally changed and watered down by those opposite. That delivered so many great projects around Australia, especially in my electorate of Richmond. I will not run through all of those again, but there were millions of dollars in projects that really transformed so much of the North Coast of New South Wales. In fact, Labor in government really took the national leadership to build competitive and sustainable agriculture industries to support farming families that contribute more than 1.6 million jobs. We understand how important it is. That is why we invested so much. 


We also developed Australia's first-ever National Food Plan to boost Australia's $30.5 billion food export market by 45 per cent. We had that in place and understood how important it was. We established the Office of Northern Australia to realise the north's potential. We developed real solutions to climate and market condition challenges, including the farm finance package, which provided $420 million in low-interest loans to help viable farmers ease debt pressures.


We also invested a record amount in rural R&D, providing R&D corporations with $1.4 billion in funding over the last six years, increasing from $189 million in 2008-09, to $251 million in 2013-14. We also addressed many of those skill shortages in the agricultural industries. We understood how important it was to be making sure there was adequate funding for training and addressing some of those skill shortages, particularly through many projects and trades training in schools and a whole range of different measures that we took to address those skill shortages right across the agricultural industry. Also, through Caring for our Country and continuing support for Landcare, which was, of course, a legacy of the Hawke government, we have supported farming communities to manage and protect our natural resources, protect and conserve our biodiversity and promote the adoption of sustainable farm practices. 


The Labor Party has a very proud record of standing with those in regional and rural Australia across a whole range of different areas. We continue to do that today on this side of the House. We continue to condemn this government across a whole range of areas where they did not tell the Australian people the truth going into the last election whether it was in relation to health, education or now, as we are seeing clearly, with particular aspects of rural and regional Australia as well.


I started off by saying we do have a Minister for Agriculture who does not have the skills and ability to represent these people and deliver adequately for them. They do not have any faith in him, his ability or his government. The fact is he has failed those in rural and regional Australia. He has failed those people, and they are severely disappointed by that. They are hurt by the cuts this government has brought in, particularly these cuts to R&D. It is devastating. We need to be encouraging growth. We need to be investing more. We need to be providing more for those in regional and rural areas, not cutting as we are constantly seeing from this government and this minister, who is incapable of delivering for regional and rural areas. That is why we are opposed to this bill.

"Hogan, Kevin, MP",Nats,2014-10-27,"



Mr HOGAN
 (Page) (15:56):  I acknowledge my neighbour, the member for Richmond, the previous speaker on this bill. The member for Richmond is a very pleasant person. We run into each other around the place quite often in the far North Coast of New South Wales. But I must take account to a couple of the things that the member for Richmond has just said about Labor having a proud record in relation to rural industries or agriculture. She said, 'I know many rural industries, if not all rural industries, had an issue in the previous Labor government.' The cattle industry in our area was aghast when the previous Labor government overnight stopped the live cattle export. That destroyed the beef industry in our area. It obviously meant that cattle that were bred for export suddenly were not. Far northern Australia was brought to its knees, and over the proceeding weeks and months, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, because I know you would know, these cattle found their way south and prices were exceptionally depressed. We had cattle everywhere. We have starving cattle in the end because they were not able to be exported and we had a very depressed sector there. 


The other one I would remind the member for Richmond of with regard to our rural industries was, with all due respect, the carbon tax. She made reference to the sugar industry as well as others. I can remind the member for Richmond that very few, if any, rural industries in my region, be they sugar, be they dairy, be they beef, be they anyone who used power, was happy with the previous government and their solution to climate change being a carbon tax, which did not change the temperature but—and this is the big issue here—made it very hard for them to compete. And we know that our agricultural industries are very much built around export. I think there is a bit of selective memory there.


However, let's get to the bill in hand. This bill, as we know, will amend the rural research and development legislation, and one of the big aspects of this bill, Mr Deputy Speaker—and I know you would be very appreciative of these changes—is to reduce regulatory burden on the rural research and development corporations. It amends legislation to remove requirements for RDCs to table certain corporate documents. This is to reduce regulatory burden and promote consistency between RDCs. In the interest of good governance, the RDCs will still need to produce these documents and make them publicly available.


This is in line with a big theme of this government. We on this side of the parliament know that we have to remain competitive. If we want to maintain our standard of life and to provide the social services that many people in our country require, we need to get the money from somewhere. To get the money we need the private sector in all sectors not just agriculture to be competitive, and this bill moves in that area as well. I know there is going to be legislation and legislation has already been introduced into parliament. We will have reduced $2 billion, which is not a small figure, of red tape in our first 12 months—double what we said we would do—because we understand and are very clear that this is very important to maintaining our competitiveness in many industries.


Dairy Australia, Forest & Wood Products Australia, the Australian Livestock Export Corporation and Sugar Research Australia will no longer need to table funding agreements or variations to funding agreements. Dairy Australia and the Australian Livestock Export Corporation will no longer need to table the annual report and other compliance reports. Again this all saves in red tape costs. 


The Primary Industries Research and Development Act 1989 is amended to remove the requirements for the minister to organise annual coordination meetings for the chairs of the statutory RDCs. This is an unnecessary requirement. Again this bill removes a regulatory cost to them and indeed to government.


It is also important to remember that in 2014-15 the Commonwealth will provide funding of approximately these figures to the different areas: $11.6 million to the Grape and Wine R&D Corporation, $68.9 million to the Grains R&D Corporation, $5.1 million to Sugar Research Australia, $8.5 million to the Cotton R&D Corporation and $17.4 million to the Fisheries R&D Corporation. Again this is not money to be sniffed at.


The government in this bill very much recognises the importance of R&D in the agriculture, fisheries and the forestry sectors. The results of R&D help primary producers to produce more with less, giving them greater profit at the farm gate. Around $700 million per year is spent by the Australian government on rural R&D and extension activities. Within 10 years farmers generate a $12 return for each dollar the government invests in agricultural R&D. Australian farmers have an innovative culture. They know that R&D is essential if Australian industries are to keep pace and compete successfully in the international arena.


The 15 rural research and development corporations provide a mechanism for farmers and fishers to invest collectively in services that will benefit their industry, such as research and development and in some cases marketing. The government encourages investment by establishing and collecting a statutory levy if an industry so requests and by returning the funds to the relevant RDC, less the cost of collection. In addition, the government matches the RDC's eligible R&D spending up to the legislated limits. In the current financial year the government will provide an estimated $250 million to the RDCs. In recognition of the good work they do, the government has committed to an additional $100 million in funding for rural RDCs, starting in the next financial year. This funding boost will enable the RDCs to further contribute to farm productivity and profitability and better deliver cutting-edge technology.


Delivering on the coalition's 2013 election commitment, the first round of funding opened for applications on 15 October 2014. The guidelines include the research priorities for the first round of funding. The application period will close on 15 December 2014. Proposed research projects will need to address one or more of the research priorities that fall into these four areas: one, increase the profitability and productivity of primary industries; two, increase the value of primary products; three, strengthen primary producers' ability to adapt to opportunities and threats; and, four, strengthen on-farm adoption and improve information flows. There are a range of issues in Australian agriculture that can be managed through this process, such as improvements to wild dog control, better techniques to control Parthenium, and blackberry control using pathogens.


I want to make it very clear that this government has always been very in tune with the needs and desires of the agricultural sector. In our first 12 months of government, besides abolishing things like the carbon tax that were very damaging to the agricultural sector and agribusinesses, we have reinstated with full vigour the live export trade with our neighbours to again increase farm gate prices for that part of the agricultural sector. We also have free trade agreements with Korea and Japan. I know that most of the agricultural sector in my region would export around 70 per cent of what they produce, whether it be beef, dairy or macadamia nuts—and I could give you many other examples. Most of these products—well over 50 per cent—are sold offshore, so these markets are very important to us. 


We did free trade agreements with Korea and Japan and are now also working on a free trade agreement with China. In fact, the Minister for Agriculture recently took a delegation to China. I was very pleased to organise for three or four industry sector representatives from my area to travel with the minister. They represented diverse agricultural produce. They have all come back and are very appreciative of the work the government are doing—the fact that we are trying to lower the red tape burden, have lowered their cost of production with the abolition of the carbon tax and are trying to actively work with them to give them access to new markets. 


If the next generation of farmers in our communities are going to see a future on the farm, the one thing we have to do is improve the farm gate price, because that is the bottom line literally. If they are going to have a financial future and if the younger people are going to have a financial future in carrying on with the family farm or indeed entering the industry, that is what is necessary. So this, along with many other things we have done in the first 12 months, is focused on the agricultural sector. We want the agricultural sector to survive and prosper. I commend this bill to the House.

"O'Neil, Clare, MP",ALP,2014-10-27,"



Ms O'NEIL
 (Hotham) (16:07):  Labor are opposing the Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 and in doing so we will be calling it what it is: a cut to agriculture R&D spending. This bill is taking a knife to R&D investment in agriculture and it is part of a much broader and much more serious set of cuts to research and development in Australia. But the focus today, and what I want to spend my time talking about, is agriculture: rural people, rural employment and the productivity of our rural industries. We know that the government, in speaking to this bill, are going to talk big on rural Australia, because that is what these guys are good at. We heard it from the member for Page, the member for Lyons, the member for Parkes, the member for Eden-Monaro— 




Mr Pasin interjecting— 




Ms O'NEIL:
  and, no doubt, soon enough we will hear it from the member for Barker. In fact, the member for Parkes talked about 'being in tune with the needs of country people'. Then, later, when this goes to a vote, he is going to cast a vote that will see a reduction in funding for R&D for agriculture. It is all talk and no action. They say all the right things at election time, but, when it comes time to make a vote, to make a decision, to cast a priority in favour of agriculture and rural people, that is not what these guys are going to do.


Labor is opposed to this bill not just because of the rank hypocrisy of it being put forward by the government but because Labor has always seen and always valued R&D for our agriculture sector. Labor created the research and development corporations model in 1989. Since that time, this model of investment has become the envy of the world; it has been copied right around the world. One of the distinctive features of the model that Labor put forward in 1989 was the principle of co-funding. We created the corporations and then we asked the people in industry who led those corporations what their priorities were. So it was not the old-school model of government knowing best and government knowing everything and telling agriculture what they needed to be spending their money on. We asked farmers and people who were advocating for their interests to tell us what was important, and then we matched them dollar for dollar. It has been an enormously successful program, and that is illustrated by the vast reach of these research development corporations. They have grown year on year, from the Australian Egg Corporation Ltd to Forest and Wood Products Australia Ltd; from Meat and Livestock Australia to Australian Wool Innovation Ltd; and there are many, many more. 


What has the result been of that very clever policy design of R&D in agriculture? We know that, over the last 25 years, agriculture productivity has roughly doubled. This is one of the least supported industries by Australian government compared to other industries right around the world; it is one of the most efficient and least supported. We know, when we think about economic reform, that the agriculture and farming community have really done the heavy lifting. We have seen that in their returns in productivity. The research and development funding that has helped drive productivity has been an important part of the puzzle here. It is partly through investment, through research and development, that this has occurred.


Let us put the bill that we are discussing today into context. As quite a separate means of supporting and coordinating the activities of Australia's primary producers, the Australian government takes out membership of a range of international organisations. It does this because it is very much in Australia's interest to be part of international organisations that operate in the same sphere as our local producers. I make the point that, when we look overseas, when we look at our trading partners and when we look at our competitors, they are often countries where government has a much greater role in decisions that affect those different types of agricultural industries. A few examples of organisations of which the Australian government is a member: the International Sugar Organisation, the International Grains Council—and there are around six memberships in the international fishing area. You can imagine that that particular industry requires quite a deal of coordination. 


What this bill seeks to do and the reason why it essentially, in effect, is a cut to R&D funding, is it forces the cost of membership for these organisations onto the research and development corporations. It basically says to industry: 'We just don't want to provide this for you anymore. If you want to pay those memberships then you can cut your own R&D funding, and that is how you will pay to be members of these international organisations.' It seems pretty cut and dried to me that that is exactly what is happening here.


It is a very disappointing direction to be moving in, for many reasons, but one that I want to go into a little bit is to do with the broader context of research and development in Australia. Some of the contributions that I have heard from those opposite have talked in lavish terms about an extra $100 million in R&D spending. It is, frankly, laughable, because what the government is doing is giving with one hand and then taking away a lot more with the other. Roughly speaking, when we talk about R&D, we get about $10 back for every $1 that is invested, as long as it is invested wisely. The National Farmers' Federation uses an $11 figure when talking about agricultural R&D. But when we look at other parts of the research and development space in Australia, we can see that there have been massive cuts to the area of rural research such as the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. 


I want to start by talking about the CSIRO, because that is where the really big cut is biting from this last budget. We saw $147 million cut from the CSIRO and 500 jobs gone. These are incredibly savage cuts for an organisation that has served Australia so proudly in conducting basic research and more specific research over a long period of time. This is the organisation that invented polymer bank notes, advanced radio astronomy and wi-fi. Where would be without wi-fi today? That was $147 million. Then we have got the $80 million in cuts to cooperative research centres and the $11 million in reduced annual appropriation funding to the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. You can see why Australians right around the rural parts of the country are growing a little weary of these promises and the excitement with which Nationals and Liberals on the other side of the House talk about them. When we put them into context we can see that it is the Liberals doing what the Liberals do, and that is cutting these important programs that have supported us for a long time. It is particularly worrying that we are seeing this trend towards cutting back on R&D funding because the truth is that, in Australia at the moment, we do not spend enough money on research and development. Looking at our economy as a whole, when we take the last year of spending under this coalition government, we see that as a percentage of total GDP this government has spent less on research and development than in any other year on record. The records go back to 1978-1979, so we are looking quite a way back here. It goes to show the tremendous lack of vision of the people on the other side of the House that right at this time—this incredibly difficult time for our economy, as we are making the transition away from the mining investment boom—it is R&D that goes to the chopping block. It is just absolutely astounding.


I mentioned that our spending over this last year was the lowest on record. We are well below the OECD average. For a country like Australia, where all we have are the minds of the people of this nation and their inventiveness, it is no wonder that so many of our scientists and researchers are trying to make their way overseas—because the support just is not there.


The situation under this government is getting worse and worse. It is pretty much in concert with the overall approach to research and development that we see this savage cut that is part of the legislation before us. We see, again, this consistent theme of promising one thing, $100 million in additional R&D, and doing another—cutting hundreds of millions of dollars through a range of different cuts. We heard before the election that agriculture was going to be one of the big pillars of our economy but what we see instead is a lack of support on the other side leading to that pillar crumbling.


This is what we expect from the Liberals; but when you come into the chamber and talk about these issues—about rural people—what you do expect to see, at the very least, is the Nationals standing up for their communities and fighting for the rights of these people working in rural Australia, trying to make our agricultural sector more productive and continue the good work it is doing. It was a delight to be in the chamber when the member for Indi got up and made her contribution to this debate, because I do not think I have seen a country MP who is not on this Labor side of the House argue with such vigour and such passion for the things that are important to her community. I say to rural people: if you feel you are not getting good service out of your National MPs there are other independents out there, like the member for Indi, and I would urge you to look towards them, because she is giving very good representation to her constituents.


The Nationals, unfortunately, have gone missing on this important point of rural R&D. I say again, with much disappointment, that this is a recurring theme we have seen in this parliament in other areas of policy. We know, for example, things like university deregulation are going to hit rural and regional parts of the country much harder than they will hit our cities. We know that young people living in rural and regional Australia already face much more significant barriers to get to university. We know that once they get a job, if they decide to go back to their community—which I would assume that those on the other side of the House would be urging them to do—they will earn less than they probably would have if they had stayed in the city, where there are many more commercial opportunities. Yet what we see is those on the other side of the House paving a path for our universities to open up degrees that will cost $80,000 or $100,000. I know from the many friends I have in rural Australia—not people that I represent but people that I know—this will put in place insurmountable barriers to study. So where were the Nationals when this was being decided?


Drought funding is another terrific example of what a total failure these members of parliament have been in representing rural and regional Australia. Fourteen million dollars was allocated to drought funding in the previous financial year. Most of it went back into consolidated revenue and we have seen, on numerous occasions now, that the minister cannot even explain coherently how the funding was administered to people who needed that drought relief.


We see it in health. We heard 'no cuts to health' and I am sure rural Liberal and National MPs right around the country were going around their electorates excitedly telling people there would be no changes to health funding. But at the very first opportunity in the National and Liberal party rooms we had a $7 co-payment—a $7 tax on the sickest people in the country. We have had changes that mean people living in rural parts of the country will need to pay somewhere up to $1,000 or $2,000 for certain types of tests. We know that they will get some of that money refunded back; I absolutely acknowledge that. But you and I both know that there are many people in rural and regional Australia who are not going to be able to find a couple of thousand dollars to be able to take a test.


I had the great pleasure of talking to a doctor who serves a community in rural Victoria about this very issue. When I asked about what he thought would happen he just laughed and said, 'Well, of course, Clare, these people are just not going to take the test.' We came into the parliament and asked the minister: 'Have you factored in the additional costs of more people not having their cancer picked up early?' But of course they have not, because evidence and modelling are not of much interest to those ideologues who are making these big decisions, unfortunately, for the nation at the moment.


I will finish by coming back to this point about research. The most important thing we can do for agricultural communities is help them plan and build for the future. As I mentioned before, the NFF tells us that for every dollar we spend on agricultural R&D, we are going to get $11 back. It is a pretty good investment—it is a lot better than the stock market, especially when you look at recent years. But sometimes you come in here and you get the feeling that the Nationals and the Liberals who represent these communities have different vision of what it is to be a farmer in these modern times. It is science. It is innovation. It is productivity improvements, and these farmers are looking for support with those things. That is exactly why we like to advocate for spending on rural and regional R&D and spending on agriculture.


Modern farming needs scientists. It needs researchers. It needs inventiveness and creativity. We see that in farms right around the country and that is why Labor has put forward these models, which have been very innovative, to support research and development in agriculture. That is why we are opposing this savage cut to R&D today.

"Pasin, Tony, MP",LP,2014-10-27,"



Mr PASIN
 (Barker) (16:21):  The member for Hotham was right about one thing; I am passionate and will wax lyrical about the contribution that regional electorates like mine make to the national economy. Unfortunately, I am disappointed to indicate to the House I fear that she is wrong about almost everything else. She spoke about rank hypocrisy. This is from the party that gave us a ban on live exports to Indonesia, the party that was so reluctant to enter into free trade agreements that their activity in that space could only be described as glacial. Yet she comes in here, as a member representing a vast area of 75 square kilometres in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, and seeks to lecture those of us who represent many hundreds of thousands of square kilometres—as you do, Mr Deputy Speaker, and as I do—about what people want to see in the bush. 


I will tell you one thing about farmers—and I am not telling you anything you do not know, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I am certainly not telling my family anything they would not tell me—a farmer knows one thing for sure: a farmer knows you cannot live beyond your means. If you spend more this year than you earn in revenues in the highly commoditised market, you are one step closer to the bank or some other entity taking control of the farm over which you have had stewardship. I wonder how much we could allocate to research and development year on year if we were not as a nation spending a billion a month—in interest only—near on $800 million of which is being paid to entities overseas. 


We are here to talk about the Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. It makes amendments to the rural research and development legislation, which will give effect to the budget measures of 2014-15. It will also make some additional governance amendments. Why are we making these changes? We are making them because we arrived in September 2013 and, when we checked the cupboards, we found they were bare. Against that background, we have had to make some difficult decisions. 


Obviously I need to stress to the House the importance of rural research and development to the economy's security and how high a priority it is for this government. I wish to note the work in recent days of the Minister for Agriculture, who announced six new appointments to the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, and the reappointment of Dr Len Stephens from South Australia as Managing Director of the Seafood Cooperative Research Centre, which, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, is crucial to the aquaculture industry in my electorate. This gives me the opportunity to shout out to the crayfishermen of the southern coast.


I also note the release of the green paper into agricultural competitiveness which will in turn lead to the development of the commensurate white paper—the Minister for Agriculture has emphasised the importance of increasing farm gate returns. This process is inherently linked to Australia's economic security, research and development and the continued maintenance of our reputation as a quality producer. 


Agriculture was once the bedrock of the Australian community, and now as we head to the 21st century we must build on the lessons and practices of the past, both good and bad, to keep our farm sector competitive and to cement our global brand. The farm sector will drive economic growth in new ways going forward, not simply in the traditional fields of fruit, vegetables and livestock, but in other areas—such as education, water management, intellectual property, financial services, advanced manufacturing, science, human resources, management practices and biotechnology to name just a few.


Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that in this, our first budget, we proposed $100 billion of additional funding for research and development, specifically to support continued innovation in agriculture, fisheries and the forestry sector. Our government recognises the strong link between research and development and agricultural productivity growth, and recognises that it is a key driver for industry productivity and farm gate profitability. This research will focus on delivering cutting edge technologies with an emphasis on making research accessible to farmers on property. Research must be practical and support our farmers and producers. 


As you have heard—and no doubt will continue to hear throughout this debate—the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences estimates that, for every dollar a government invests in agriculture research and development, farmers can expect a $12 return within 10 years. In a tight fiscal environment, the fact the government has allocated substantial additional funding demonstrates how important research and development is to the future of rural industries. It demonstrates the link between innovation competitiveness, profitability and sustainability, as well as natural resource management.


The budget measure referred to in this legislation allows government to recover the costs of membership fees to international commodity organisations and regional fisheries management organisations from the matching amounts paid to rural research and development corporations, or what have come to be known as RDCs. The additional measures remove the requirement for the minister to organise an annual coordination meeting for the chairs of the statutory RDCs and removes some parliamentary tabling requirements to reduce regulation. This of course gives me an opportunity to mention that this Wednesday in this place will be the second of our repeal days which focus on repealing unnecessary and unwanted red tape in the interests of the nation's economy.


The RDCs were established in 1989 by the Primary Industries Research and Development Act to undertake scientific research for the benefit of Australian rural industries, with benefits flowing to rural communities and the nation more broadly. There are currently 15 RDCs; five of these are statutory RDCs governed by that act; and 10 are industry owned RDCs which were created from former statutory RDCs. Most RDCs are able to undertake marketing activities in addition to their research and development activities at the request, of course, of relevant industries. 


Most of the RDCs are primarily funded by statutory levies on primary production or products. The statutory levies for research and development are matched by Commonwealth funding up to a cap. The funds raised through the statutory levies are appropriated to the RDCs, less the cost of the levy's collection. The government provides matching funding to the RDCs based on their expenditure on eligible research and development activities. The RDCs are required to submit invoices to the Department for Agriculture to claim matching funding; matching funding provided to each RDC is subject to a cap based on the relevant industry's gross value of production. 


Funding for the fisheries RDC operates differently in some respects. The fisheries RDC receives funding from state and territory governments as well as from levies. The caps on Commonwealth funding are based on gross value of production but are calculated differently to those of other RDCs. The Department of Agriculture currently pays for Australian government membership to international commodity organisations and regional fisheries management organisations. These organisations work to improve the trading environment for agricultural products by funding and coordinating research and development, providing information and statistics, setting international standards and ensuring ongoing access to fisheries.


Australia's membership of these organisations benefits the industries concerned. The international commodity organisations deliver good industry outcomes, such as trading standards, research on global issues and market statistics. The regional fisheries management organisations facilitate the management of migration restock and high seas stock that are fished by various nations. They inform international fisheries management stock assessments. And what ought to be noted at this juncture is the recently-announced position for those fish under Commonwealth management in this country, that we no longer have any that are subject to overfishing. That is a great fillip for that industry and a great example of this R&D in practical application.


In 2014-15 the budget measure changed the way that the government will fund the membership costs. From 2014-15 the government will cover the costs of the memberships from the matching funding it contributes to relevant RDCs that coordinate research for the industry which benefits most from the membership. The membership costs will be recovered by either deducting an equivalent amount from the matching funding paid to RDCs or by requiring the relevant RDC to pay the Commonwealth an amount equal to the membership fee. The Department of Agriculture will continue to be responsible for Australia's membership of the relevant organisations and for the payment of membership fees.


The bill amends the act with respect to the Sugar Research and Development Services Act 2013, the Australian Grape and Wine Authority Act 2013 to allow the government to recover the costs of membership fees. Currently, the Australian government is a member of four international commodity organisations relating to the sugar, wine, grain and cotton industries and six regional fisheries management organisations. The organisations and RDCs from which membership fees will be recovered will be specified by a new legislative instrument.


The rural R&D legislation currently contains different requirements for the preparation and tabling of certain corporate documents. Some acts require RDCs to produce certain corporate documents and, in some cases, to table them in the parliament. For consistency across industry owned RDCs the government has decided that tabling requirements are an unnecessary administrative burden for the RDCs and for the government and therefore they will be removed.


The following legislation is amended to remove tabling requirements: the Dairy Produce Act 1986—I am sure the dairy producers of Barker will be pleased to hear that; the Forestry Marketing and Research and Development Services Act 2007—and with such a significant forest industry in my electorate, centred around the south-east, again, they will be pleased to hear that, and I should take this opportunity to mention the establishment for the first time in this place of the Parliamentary Friends of Forestry and Forest Products; the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997—again, highly relevant to the electors of Barker, given the amount of meat and livestock that we produce; and the Sugar Research and Development Services Act 2013. The RDCs will still be required to produce the relevant documents and, where required, make them publicly available.


The PIRD Act requires the minister to organise an annual coordination meeting for the chairs of the statutory RDCs. Only five of the 15 RDCs are statutory bodies and the government has decided, as I have said previously, other coordinated mechanisms to be more appropriate.


I indicated at the beginning of my contribution that Australia has relied upon the agricultural and farming sectors to provide for her prosperity. We know that this will continue to be the case for many decades. The changes brought about by this legislation will help to sustain our competitive edge in the agricultural sector into the future. I commend the bill to the House.

"Chesters, Lisa, MP",ALP,2014-10-27,"



Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (16:33):  This Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 is an interesting one. I say that because it comes at a time when this government is cutting so much money from research and development. It is cutting funding from the CSIRO of $146.8 million, which will cost about 500 jobs; it is cutting $11 million in appropriate funding for the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation; and there is an $80 million reduction to the Cooperative Research Centres Program. This is at the same time as there is a radical overhaul going on of our universities, where we will see funding cuts to our regional universities.


So it strikes me as odd that they would stand up here and say that the government is a champion of regional research and development when, in fact, it is a bit of a smokescreen: 'Here is a small amount of funding, whilst we cut over here to the left and over here to the right and radically restructure universities.'


The member for Indi raised this issue in her contribution to this debate around the effects of funding cuts to our regional universities. It is pretty hard to have the scientists that you need for regional and rural development and research if you do not have university students. I wanted to start my contribution on the effects that this government will have on higher education when it comes to science, industry and the regions.


We are concerned—regional MPs—particularly those on this side of the House, about the government's effects on science and on ag in our part of the world. We have already had the Melbourne university close its agricultural campus, Dookie, and it is now running agriculture from its campus in the inner city of Melbourne. It is pretty hard to be actively involved in the grassroots of your industry if you are in the city at an inner city based campus. Sure, you can jump on a train—if it runs on time—and get out to the ag areas. But one of the real strengths of having a strong, grassroots-driven, research, innovation and development sector is if the science, the study and the expertise are occurring in the very communities where the industry is based. And yet we are seeing the very opposite occur as this government pushes to deregulate the university sector—as they start to talk about deregulating fees, which will only see an increase in fees for the vast majority on campus and as they promote how good the scholarship fund will be for regional students so that they can go to a Melbourne or city based university.


What they are not talking about is the negative impact this reform will have on agricultural studies and on science studies. The member for Indi has already told us that there is a shortfall of at least 4,000 skilled professionals that we require in the regions. This is an issue that comes up over and over again in the roundtables and discussions that I have with the industries in my electorate. I come from quite a big regional producing area, central Victoria. Bendigo city itself has become a hub for our region, whether it is people in agriculture doing their finances and their banking in our area or whether it is the head offices of organisations such as the Victorian Farmers Federation, which now has an office in Bendigo. Bendigo is definitely a hub for the regional agricultural sector. Locally it is one of our biggest employers. There are more people involved in agriculture and food manufacturing now than there are in heavy manufacturing in my electorate. The big employers in my electorate are Hazeldene's, Tip Top Bakeries and KR Castlemaine. We also have a number of people who work in Hy-Line Australia and in B&B Basil.


I mention Hy-Line and B&B Basil because they are two agricultural businesses that could benefit from this particular fund. The story of B&B Basil is one of those great innovative regional success stories. They produce the microherbs or the garnishes that you have on your dinner plate. So successful has their business been that they are now exporting their microherbs overseas. They have talked to me about the need for greater assistance when it comes to Austrade, not so much in the way of R&D but the need for Austrade to support developing markets for their products. They have basically done it on their own, with the help of other local manufacturers. Where R&D has been important in their organisation is to develop the equipment that they need to grow their microherbs. As you can imagine, it is not your average planter that is required to grow microherbs; it is quite a small container that is required. So they have also needed quite a bit of innovation when it comes to the equipment on their property.


Hy-Line is an interesting business. Most may not realise what it actually does or that it is based in Bendigo. It is the largest specialist supplier of day-old chicks for the poultry industry. In fact, 70 per cent of our hens that lay eggs have come from this facility based in Bendigo. For more than 50 years, Hy-Line has provided the Australian poultry industry with the livestock that they need to lay eggs. They talk to me about the importance of biosecurity—which is another debate for another day—and they also talk to me about the need for R&D. More importantly, they talk to me about another area where this government has failed them, and that is having the infrastructure and the technology that they need to be able to continue to manage their business effectively. They talk to me about the need for a decent NBN and the need to be able to monitor the climate conditions of their facilities via a closed-circuit network. But, because they do not have a fast-speed broadband network, with the upload that they require, they struggle to do that. 


It is another area where this government is letting regional and agribusinesses down. When I talk to young farmers, they have the apps ready to go for how to monitor their livestock. They are innovating in science, yet they cannot connect properly because this government is dragging its feet when it comes to vital infrastructure. It is another example of how this bill is designed to be a great big smokescreen, to pretend that this government is doing something when it comes to research and development and innovation in agriculture. Yet there are so many other areas where this government is failing.


There are a number of niche businesses in the electorate of Bendigo: wineries, bakeries, coffee roasters, olive oil processors, honey producers and craft beer producers. These are all boutique niche industries that are developing product and getting it ready for market. All of these businesses struggle with their own issues when it comes to export. Their issues include not being able to get past the red tape at the other end when it comes to New York or China, say. They want to see this government investing more in Austrade being able to resolve some of those issues. One particular winery do not want to import wine into New York; they just want to send the wine to a taster, and those tasting notes will be how they then onsell their product into Hong Kong and other parts of Asia. So they do not actually want to sell the product; they just want to get it to the taster so that his tasting notes will then help them market their business. To date, they have struggled to have somebody help them resolve the receiving end in New York. These are some of the challenges that people in my electorate talk to me about that they face in the agricultural industry.


This bill talks about research and development corporations. These were created by Labor in the late eighties to undertake scientific research for the benefit of Australian rural industries that would flow on to the community and the nation more broadly. The government would put half the amount, matching dollar for dollar, into R&D if the industry levy was able to come up with the funds—a co-funding model. Labor will fight to protect the original model we had when it comes to R&D, and the reason is the acknowledgement on this side that government does have a role in creating industry. As other speakers have said, within this particular co-funding arrangement there needs to be, as the NFF have called for, some form of sunset clause so that we can continue to come back to assess whether this is the right model.


Labor's R&D model is working with industry. It is not telling industry what to do but facilitating and encouraging partnership. Labor's model brought together the universities, brought together the skills, brought together the industry and brought together the government, brought together the CSIRO and brought together other organisations to help create product, to help create the innovation.


There is another area that this government is failing when it comes to this particular sector. Constantly the government stands up and says: agriculture is the future industry for jobs, we will be the food bowl of Asia and we will help feed Asia, which, in turn, will create exports and that, in turn, will create jobs. But I ask the government: who will actually work these jobs? Because there is a growing problem in our agricultural sector. A lot of the work that it is being created, a lot of the jobs are going to people who are not just on 457 visas but to people who are international students working in ag businesses on 416 visas or 417 visas, which are holiday working visas. We are not just talking about one or two; we are talking about organised workforces being brought into Australia to do these food production jobs.


In my own electorate, there are what we call boners at Hazeldene's. Hazeldene's is a company that employs about 800 people directly. But what we often do not hear is that they also employ about 200 contractors. These workers are on Thai holiday work visas. They come over here specifically for these jobs. So before these jobs are being advertised locally, there are Thai people brought to Australia specifically for these jobs. They are employed as contractors and are paid per kilo for boning chicken. That is the kind of job that we are creating at the moment in the agricultural sector. We are not creating high skilled jobs. We are not creating jobs where Australians will get first go at them.


The jobs being created in the ag sector are actually jobs going to imported labour that undercuts local labour. There is no way you can be an Australia and be employed in Hazeldene's and paid to bone chickens by the kilo. To be employed as an Australian in Hazeldene's, you are not a contractor; you are on the union based EBA and you are paid by the hour. We are creating this competition in our agricultural workplaces. Again, it is quite easy for these companies like Hazeldene's to say it is because there is no skilled workforce locally.


We have heard, yes, it is true when it comes to the high-tech, high end jobs—because we are struggling—to get universities through the funding cuts to ensure that we have the skilled workforce. But at the lower end, when it comes to the unskilled jobs, there are people willing to work; they are just not be given the opportunity.


As I said, this bill cuts funding to research and development specifically in the rural research and development area. There are $80 million in reductions to the cooperative research centres; $164.8 million in cuts to the CSIRO, which will cost about 5,000 jobs. There are more are more examples about how this government is willing to hide behind the smokescreen of this legislation but not talk about the real challenges that are going on in agriculture. The current funding cuts, the challenges with the workforce and not hiring locals and the challenges when it comes to the NBN and making sure that these businesses have the infrastructure that they need are the issues that this government is not talking about.

"O'Dowd, Ken, MP",Nats,2014-10-27,"



Mr O'DOWD
 (Flynn) (16:49):  I am pleased to rise in the House today to speak on the Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. The bill implements the 2014 budget measure and reduces unnecessary regulation imposed on the rural, research and development corporations and on the Commonwealth combined. The bill directly affects only those relevant RDCs. The budget measure allows the government to deduct the cost of membership fees to the international amounts paid by the Commonwealth to the relevant RDCs. Australia will continue to be a member of the organisations for which it currently holds membership and the Commonwealth will continue to be responsible for membership and for the payment of the membership fees.


The bill only changes the way that the cost of membership fees are paid by the Commonwealth. Additional measures remove the requirement for the Minister for Agriculture to organise an annual coordination meeting for the chairs of the statutory RDCs and remove the requirement for some RDCs to table documents to parliament such as funding an agreement, the annual reports and other compliance reports. The RDCs will still be required to produce those documents where required but they will still have to make them publicly available. The essence of the bill is to cut down red tape and to pump more money into R&D for our rural people.


As in my and all other rural electorates, the farmers of our nation do deserve backup and it is our government that is prepared to give them that backup. They play important roles in the whole real economy. There is an old saying: if the rural guys are not doing any good, you can rest assured that the rural towns are not doing any good either. Our farmers are some of the most productive in the world. They have a very good image and the products they produce are clean and green. That is recognised by the Asian markets and it is a credit to what our farmers do. But they do need support, they do need to be profitable and they do need to be competitive. It is a changing world that we live in and there are changes in our agricultural world. I can see that with our government initiative here, pooled with private investment and farming investment, we can go forward at the right pace that will take us into the years ahead.


The retailers and distributors of some of our farm products do seem to skim some of the lion's share of the profit. For instance, if you buy a kilogram of rump steak in a butcher's shop on the Gold Coast, you might pay something between $20 and $25 a kilogram. I know, and you know, that the beef producer may get $1.25 or $2.25 at the most; it depends whether you are talking live or dead weight.


Government supports research and development. It is essential that the industry, the farmers and the universities work together on this. That is why the government maintains its membership of the international commodity and regional fisheries management organisations. We still have to keep our leg in the industry and have skin in the game as a partnership with our fishermen, forestry workers and agricultural people in general. Whether it is in relation to grain, sugar, cotton or macadamia nuts, we all need to be up-to-date with the modern technology. I believe this $100 million that we are pumping into the industry will go a long way in keeping us on top of the market.


The International Cotton Advisory Committee sponsors research into cotton production methods and directly benefits farmers in the Central Highlands and Dawson and Callide valleys in my electorate. This will not stop. This will continue, and we can only expect better crops in the future.


Some of the biggest drawbacks in rural and regional areas are the lack of NBN services, as the previous member mentioned, and the lack of phone services. Marketing one's product in rural and regional areas is getting harder and harder. I recall the 2PH farms in Emerald telling me that they use daylight hours to pick their product and prepare their product for market and they use the night-time hours to market their products all over the world. You need a very good NBN system to do that, to keep up-to-date with the rest of the world and to keep communicating and promoting your products. It will be a godsend when the NBN gets to our rural and regional areas; for them, 2018 will not come quick enough. That is the date when our minister has said that we will have good service to most of Australia—and we are talking in the high 90 per cents. That should be encouraging, but 2018 is a fair way away. It is good to see the minister is concentrating on the rural areas first—the sooner the better—to get people up-to-date with their communications.


Through our membership of these organisations we will ensure that our local fishing industry is fairly represented when decisions are made regarding management of their own fishing grounds. In Australia—and especially in Queensland, which I can speak about—the wild catch per square kilometre is nine kilograms. Why do we want to lock up more of the Coral Sea reef? I see it as foolish. There is no fish in Queensland waters that is endangered, but we keep on putting hurdles in front of our fishermen. The fact is that we import something like 80 per cent of our fish products and I think that is a shame. It is the same with our pig products—we import something like 80 per cent of our pig products.


A farmer said to me: 'Ken, you are talking about dams. I really applaud you for that. I think it is a great move. But don't forget there's a lot of farmers out there who could build their own dams, on their own properties, with their own money—and put them in the right place, so that they could benefit themselves on their own agricultural farms—but we are just burdened with regulations and red tape. Hopefully one day you can get rid of that so we can then go ahead and build our own dams without one cent of government money.'


There are some farmers out there who have done very well. Some have got into organic farming. These guys who have done that—and I know there is a cost to them to do it—benefit by about $400 to $500 a beast when they send the organic cows to market. These are the type of innovative people we have out there, and I think we should be using their skills as best we can. Hopefully, pumping this $100 million into the industry and cutting back on red tape will only benefit the real people who we need to develop our nation further and further into the future.


We have a population of nine billion planned for about 2050. These people will all have to be fed. I would like to see farm margins increased so we can get to a point where farmers and agricultural people can afford to employ people again. At the moment there is no outside help, no outside labour, because they cannot afford to pay the wages. The commodity prices are not good enough for these farmers to develop and improve their businesses. There is a lot of work to be done on the properties. They just need labour that they can afford. I do not believe in child labour or slave labour, but farmers need the right commodity prices without mark-ups in the retail industry. The price you pay for a kilogram of rump steak compared with what the farmer gets: there is the margin that you could use to afford to pay wages. That is not happening. That is something I hope to promote as long as I am in parliament. With that, I commend the bill to the House.

"Katter, Bob, MP",AUS,2014-10-27,"



Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (17:00):  I rise to speak many times in this place, but I must send the last speaker an application form for our party because he is obviously in the wrong party, given all the things he has just said. He will get into terrible trouble when the bosses hear about what he said today. For his information, the closure of the fishing industry occurred under the Liberal Party not the Labor Party. On the budget cutbacks—I am a great admirer of frugality and I like to think that my years in the state cabinet in Queensland were marked by very strong, frugal eyes. There was no profligacy in spending. It was very cost-effective where we put the money. So I applaud the government for striving to cutback government expenditure, but it can become quite ridiculous when we go chasing $7 million over three years. We are wasting the time of the parliament on $7 million over three years on a budget of $450,000 million. Just how petty has this become? 


I think it needs to be said and resaid and resaid. I am holding here a wonderful article from Professor Denniss on Bob Menzies and budgets. According to the current government, Swan's deficit of 3.3 per cent of GDP in his final year in office was a 'disaster', a 'budget crisis'. That is how the current government described Mr Swan's deficit. It turns out that Mr Menzies in his last year had a budget deficit much higher than that recorded by the ALP. So by the current government's yardstick, Mr Menzies was a shocker, worse than the Labor Party. 


When we talk about budgets, the world record for deficits was held by the government that I was part of, the old Country Party Bjelke-Petersen government. I would say we must have had the biggest budget deficit in human history because on an income of about $3,000 million, we borrowed $3½ thousand million over two years just to build a railway line, a port and a power station. The point of this very brilliant article by Professor Denniss is if you spend $5,000 million—and this is not what he says but what I say—like the Queensland government is doing, building another tunnel in Brisbane, then what you do is burden the people of Brisbane with, according to their Treasury, one-seventh for maintenance and upkeep. So of $5,000 million, you would burden the people of Brisbane with a $700 million weight upon their back—not my figures, Queensland Treasury figures. It says when you build an asset, you must allow one-seventh for amortisation, maintenance et cetera. I think that is not a bad figure, actually. 


What happens when we do this—to quote my son, the state member for Mount Isa—what do we get for $5,000 million? A few thousand people get home a few minutes earlier to watch the television. That is what we get for the $5,000 million. If on the other hand that money was spent, as we spent it in the old Country/National Party government, on a railway line into the Galilee Basin and the coalfields then, I estimate, within five years you would generate $1,000 million a year in, if not profit, most certainly operating surplus. That is what we did in Queensland. We ran these massive deficits, but the money was not spent on self-indulgence. The money was not spent on a more agreeable lifestyle and cutting the time to get to and from work. The money was spent on creating real wealth continuously.


Let me go back to the tunnel example because it is very relevant to this Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. This bill says we should get the people to put the money into research; the government is not going to put the money into this area any more. Rather than the state government in Queensland committing $5,000 million of resources to build another tunnel, it could spend $3½ thousand million building a railway line into the Galilee Basin, where half of this nation's coal assets lie, and create 20,000 jobs for the next 100 years at least. You tell me what is the best use of that money, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is not a matter of budget deficits or budget surpluses; it is a matter of what you spend the money on. The Queensland government is spending $5,000 million on another tunnel. It would appear to me that per capita Brisbane already has twice as many tunnels as anywhere other city in the world. If that money was spent on a railway line, we would create 20,000 jobs in a state where jobs are vanishing at the speed of the sun going down in the afternoon—universal collapse of the economy Queensland.


Let me turn to bill specifically. Geraldine Maguire is president of the Malanda Chamber of Commerce, a once great milk producing area which was slaughtered by government deregulation by the LNP and ALP. Geraldine is being very positive. They are putting forward an Australian agricultural precinct concept where there will be a great emphasis on innovation—they will create an innovation hub. She is drawing upon the strengths we have in this area because in the lower tablelands per capita we have more PhDs than anywhere else in Australia. Unfortunate and sadly the reason for that is governments have progressively, in the time that I have been in parliament, cut back on all scientific research. I think there were 20-odd people working in the CSIRO arboreal research centre in Atherton. I doubt whether there would be six working there now. Keera research station was the biggest research station in northern Australia and employed about 32 people under Mick Nasser. There is no Keera research station now. When I became member for Kennedy we had about 126 scientists working full time, mostly in the area of agriculture and agricultural processing. I doubt whether we would have 30 now. I think the figure is about 26. All of that accumulated handed-down knowledge is gone. 


I will give you one example of what this means. There are over six million hectares of heavy infestation of the mid-western Gulf Country by prickly acacia tree. Written across the map—it is 25 years old now—it says, 'The best natural grasslands in Australia.' Sadly, they are not grasslands at all; they have this terrible weed, pest, whatever you want to call it, the acacia nilotica tree. All of the accumulated research over 20 years is in the pest and weed research station in Charters Towers, which has virtually been cut in half by the current Queensland government. All of that accumulated knowledge and wisdom has simply vanished. So instead of moving forward we are moving backwards. 


One of the saddest things in Australia is that CSIRO say you have to be more related to the marketplace—the free market philosophy and ideology. I do not know that we would have any science much on earth if past governments throughout the world for the last 2,000 years went on that policy. Galileo was on the payroll of the Medici family. Unless money is coming in from powerful people and government and they have banking resources available to them, then science simply cannot move forward. 


Let me go back to the CSIRO example. Our little party believes that we need an extra $2,000 million a year put into science and some of that needs to be earmarked for CSIRO. It is one of the great institutions on earth. CSIRO came up with the mix amitosis virus which wiped out the rabbit plague in Australia. I could quote 100 other examples of brilliant internationally renowned work done by CSIRO but the sad thing now is that the Murray-Darling commission wanted these people to come up with a report that would say, 'Oh, terrible, terrible, what's going on in the Murray-Darling. We've got to do something about it.' So CSIRO came up with figures that were 300 per cent different than the Murray-Darling Basin. I do not know; the Murray-Darling Basin may have been wrong and CSIRO right, but there was a 300 per cent difference. 


In ethanol they were paid effectively by the greenhouse gas emissions office of the federal government to do a number on ethanol and they remain responsible for the only report on earth that I know of which says that carbon dioxide increases if you use ethanol instead of petrol. Every country on earth now has ethanol except for African countries and Australia. China, India, half of Indonesia, Thailand, all have moved to biofuels, ethanol. All the north Americas, Canada, Mexico, the United States, all of the South American countries with the exception of Venezuela of course—an oil producing country—and all of Europe have signed up to 15 per cent. Everyone one of them has done it on the basis of a report saying that it dramatically reduces CO2 and other volatile and dangerous emissions. Basically, ethanol is introduced to stop people from dying from motor vehicles but all harmful emissions are reduced dramatically by ethanol, which is pure alcohol and gives a magnificent burn, which overcomes most of the problems with gas emissions. But to see CSIRO, this great and renowned institution, prostituted to the extent where it will produce an article which says the exact opposite of the truth is unfortunate. Their argument was that they were given parameters by the greenhouse gas emissions office and they had to work within those parameters. Well actually they had to come up with a report saying that they had increases CO2 emissions. The point I am trying to make here is that we do need research. Sometimes it is wasted. Academics get a little bit carried away and go into peculiar areas but they have to be given some latitude and they must be given independence.


On the same issue, one of the major bodies involved is the Sugar Research and Development Corporation. It has been rejigged in such a way that the millers have effective control now instead of the farmers. You say, 'What does that mean?' It means that they are going to breed new varieties. We have to breed ever-newer varieties of sugar cane and a variety that will suit the mill will be one that goes for a longer period yielding sugar content, whereas the cane farmer would like a greater sugar content in a shorter period when he would like to see the milling take place, but it is very much to their detriment that this is taking place.

"Pitt, Keith, MP",Nats,2014-10-27,"



Mr PITT
 (Hinkler) (17:15):  I rise to speak on the Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. Agriculture is vital to my electorate and the Wide Bay region more broadly, so let me read, for the benefit of the House, some of the data contained in the 2014 ABARES report for Wide Bay. About 15 per cent of all people employed in the Queensland agriculture, forestry and fishing sector are based in Wide Bay; the sector employs about 8,500 people locally, representing about eight per cent of the region's total workforce. In addition, about 2,700 people are employed locally in food product manufacturing. In 2011-12 the gross value of agricultural production in Wide Bay was $949 million, or nine per cent of total agricultural production in Queensland. Of that $949 million, fruit contributed 22 per cent, or $207 million, and vegetables contributed 17 per cent, or $166 million. Sugar cane accounted for 14 per cent, or $128 million. The region is home to about 4,620 farms, or 16 per cent of all farm businesses in Queensland. I am a former cane farmer. My father and brothers continue to operate a substantial cane harvesting business. Agriculture and family farming are a part of me, and always will be.


The Australian government supports rural industries in a variety of ways, including grants programs. Since coming to government, the coalition has signed free trade agreements with Japan and South Korea—two of our largest trading partners. My region has endured two major floods in three years and is now in the midst of a drought. Would you believe it? Two floods and now a drought! With exorbitant electricity prices and ongoing price pressure from the supermarket duopoly, growers are locked in an uphill battle. That is why I am pleased to be part of a government that consults and not one that makes ad hoc decisions, like Labor's overnight suspension of live export trade. We are committed to restoring some stability to the sector, to improve productivity and farm gate returns.


Last week Minister for Agriculture, Barnaby Joyce, released the government's green paper as another step forward to developing an agriculture competitiveness white paper. The green paper draws on feedback from real people, people on the ground, people who have shared their experience and opinion on a wide variety of agricultural issues. The taskforce held hearings in Bundaberg earlier this year, and I would encourage Hinkler constituents to comment again on the green paper, to share their ideas for opportunities and solutions. The green paper represents a range of possible policy options that now need further consideration and prioritisation.


Support is also currently being provided to the sector through 15 rural research and development corporations. During the 2013 election campaign the then coalition opposition committed to provide an additional $100 million to these rural research and development corporations when in government. This is aimed at improving Australia's capacity to deliver cutting edge technology, continuing applied research focussed on collaborative innovation and increasing the appeal of Australian commodities to potential markets. The boost is on top of the $250 million already provided each year as matching funding and more than $450 million in levies collected from industry. To keep our rural industries engaged on the world stage, the government is a member of international commodity and regional fisheries management organisations. This bill changes the way the government pays its membership of these organisations. Membership fees will now come directly from the budgets of our 15 rural research and development corporations. This will save the government about $7 million over the next four years.


Agricultural research and development operates in a global system and, as such, must take international issues into account. The same can be said for trade. If we expect to be able to sell our produce overseas, we must also be willing to accept their exports when it is safe to do so. Australia is a member of the World Trade Organisation and, as such, import risk analysis must be based on science and free of political interference. The Department of Agriculture recently announced it will lift a ban to allow imports of fresh ginger from Fiji to Australia. Fiji has exported fresh ginger to New Zealand and to the United States for years, but Australian growers were understandably concerned about the threat posed by pests and diseases—things like burrowing nematode and yam scale.


There are 49 ginger growers in Australia who produce around 8,000 tonnes a year, worth about $35 million. Having met with Australian Ginger Growers Association chairman, Anthony Rehbein, on numerous occasions, I publicly urged the federal Department of Agriculture to adhere to the strictest possible import standards when inspecting fresh ginger from Fiji. The department assured growers and the public that it had very stringent measures in place to ensure biosecurity risks are reduced to the lowest level possible. The department said it could review import conditions in light of new scientific information.


The association intercepted five boxes of ginger at Sydney Markets in one of the first consignments from Fiji and asked the Queensland Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to inspect them. DAFF said the ginger was generally very clean but of poor condition. They found scale, traces of soil and foreign vegetable matter such as nut grass. There were also sunken lesions present, which could be indicative of burrowing nematode or fungal invasion. There were also a considerable number of rhizomes affected by root-knot nematode. There is now a dispute between ginger growers, the association, state and federal biosecurity officers, scientists and departmental bureaucrats as to whether similar pests already exist in Australia; how deep each of these bug varieties burrow; which variety is more invasive; and whether methyl bromide fumigation can disinfect ginger rhizome of both external and internal feeding parasites.


But the point that growers and the association are now making—and it seems to me to be a valid one—is that on page 2 of the import risk assessment it states:


… consignments must be free of live insects, disease symptoms, trash, contaminant seeds, soil and other debris on arrival in Australia.


Should it matter whether some of the parasites already exist in Australia? Should the testing carried out by DAFF and the research gathered by the association be considered new scientific information? The risk is this: we may find ourselves in the future in the same situation as the Northern Territory, which, from recent reports, now has an outbreak of cucumber green mottle mosaic virus. This will absolutely decimate the melon industry in the Northern Territory. This virus in other countries produces 50 per cent losses in the field—50 per cent!


This is an industry in the Northern Territory that is worth $50 million to their economy and it is something that is transmitted by sea. I note the contribution of the member for Capricornia about the pineapple industry, which is worth $80 million a year to Australia. There are 80 growers and they have year-on-year growth, but they have real issues with the potential for a disease which makes pineapples in the field explode. Can you imagine walking through a field of exploding pineapples?


As I said earlier, the import risk assessments must be free of political interference. It is incumbent upon the federal Department of Agriculture and Australia's biosecurity officers to ensure our crops and farmers are protected, because I sure as hell hope we do not see a repeat of what is happening in the Top End. Agriculture is vital to our national economy, our regional economy, and of course the people in my community in my electorate. Their livelihoods depend on the vigilance of these officers. It is absolutely vital that it be protected.


I encourage Australians to support their local farmers by buying Australian produce as the first choice and, of course, especially ginger.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2014-10-27,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (17:23):  We have heard a lot in this chamber today about changing the meaning of things when it comes to agriculture. Yes, we have changed the meaning. We have elevated agriculture to one of the main pillars of the Australian economy. We have made it something which is supported by sound policy, valued for what it does for people and nurtured so it receives the investment to make it not just survive but thrive into the future. The Minister for Agriculture and member for New England has changed the meaning of agriculture from a forlorn, forgotten portfolio under Labor, to being a meaningful, vibrant and, hopefully, highly profitable sector under the Liberal-National government. That is the meaning the agriculture minister has changed.


For Labor to come in here and try to score cheap political points this afternoon with anything, absolutely anything to do with agriculture after its six years—six years—of woeful neglect for this vital portfolio area shows contempt, sheer contempt, for those who work the land.


We have given agriculture real meaning and real purpose. We did not put it on the skids as Labor did by stopping live exports; by abandoning irrigators; and by imposing a carbon tax which had such a disastrous effect on farms and farmers and which Labor, if ever re-elected, will introduce quicker than you can utter the words 'there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead' or quicker than the shadow agricultural minister, the member for Hunter, could say 'Barnaby Joyce'. The opposition agricultural spokesman is fixated by the minister. He really is. He talks about him more than he talks about anything else. 


The Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 will reduce the regulatory burden and reporting requirements for research and development corporations, enabling them to be more productive—more productive—and focus directly on agricultural innovation, ensuring Australian agriculture remains a global leader.


The government through this year's budget put forward responsible measures necessary to repair Labor's budget mess and ensure the Commonwealth lives within its means. We are getting on with the important work across the board, addressing budgetary challenges which we face today and preparing for the future. Unlike Labor, this government has an extensive agenda for regional Australia and our focus is on supporting Australian agriculture to remain profitable, productive and competitive, and on building for the future. As has been previously mentioned, this is a modest budget measure which will provide savings of about $7 million over four years.


The coalition has a plan to build a strong, prosperous economy and a safe, secure Australia. Only the Abbott-Truss coalition government has an economic action strategy which will grow the economy and fix Labor's debt and deficit disaster. Labor's legacy to Australia is 200,000 more unemployed, many of those in rural and regional areas. Gross debt is projected to rise to $667 billion if we sit here and do nothing about it and $123 billion in cumulative deficits. 


Agriculture is at the heart of the Riverina in my electorate. It is one of the most productive and diverse agricultural regions in the country, giving rise to our claim as one of the significant food bowls of Australia. We grow just about everything in the Riverina. There are large-scale producers of wheat, canola, citrus, apples, beef, dairy, oil seeds, wool, barley, vegetables, sheep, lamb, wine grapes, cotton, hay, poultry and cherries. You name it, we grow it. These are the many fine products which generate income and stimulate our local economies. Food production is serious business in the Murrumbidgee and Coleambally irrigation areas. The MIA contributes more $2½ billion annually to the Australian economy and, for argument's sake, Riverina rice producers grow 52 per cent of the total value of the New South Wales rice harvest, which has a farm gate value of around $300 million a year according to the June 2013 ABARES report.


In grains research, I was pleased to see the announcement of the Minister for Agriculture and the New South Wales Minister for Primary Industries, Katrina Hodgkinson, just last month which provides $10.8 million—serious money—for grains research and development in New South Wales. This will transpose to the creation of 18 new research offices—there is that word 'research', so important in all of this—in key cropping locations across the state, including in Wagga Wagga and Yanco in my electorate. Given agriculture's importance to the region, there is much research and development which is undertaken in our region to ensure our product remains efficient and competitive in changing local, national and international markets.


In my electorate, Charles Sturt University is a leader in agriculture research and development. The EH Graham Centre for Agricultural Innovation, which is named after a long serving member for Wagga Wagga, Eddie Graham—you might be interested, Deputy Speaker Mitchell; he was actually from your side of politics and a good man, too, who was also the New South Wales Minister for Primary Industries for a long time—excels in agriculture research and innovation. Currently, its multidisciplinary and integrated research covers climate change and the need to make sure that we use minimum water and get maximum production; water availability; adapting to increasing input costs; biosecurity threats; capacity crisis and succession planning; and risk management and adaption to change. The Graham centre undertakes extensive undergraduate and postgraduate research, with several students currently undertaking PhD research at the state of the art facilities.


In this year's budget, the Minister for Agriculture confirmed the government is honouring its commitment to provide $100 million in new funding for rural research and development, specifically to support continued innovation in agriculture, and that is extremely good. That is extremely needed. 


This government understands that, while we need to target our spending wisely and not waste a cent, we also need to continue to invest in the productivity and profitability of Australian agriculture. There is a strong link between research and development and agricultural productivity growth as a key driver of industry and farm gate profitability. We hear all the time how farmers need to increase their farm gate profitability.


The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resources Economics and Sciences estimates that, for each dollar the government invests in agricultural research and development, farmers generate $12 within 10 years. So they turn a dollar to $12 within a decade—that is tremendous; that is putting food and fibre on the plates and the backs of Australians and others.


By allocating substantial additional funding to agricultural research and development, we, the coalition, are demonstrating the important role rural and regional industries will play into the future in a tight fiscal and budgetary environment. We understand on this side that there are challenges ahead. We understand that climate variability is going to play an important part in the future for farmers but we also understand their worth and that we need to help them as much as is humanly possible by this parliament.


We continue to see evidence that this government holds our agricultural sector in high regard by delivering on our 2013 election commitment by developing a white paper on Australia's agricultural competitiveness—I know I am using a prop, but it is important that people see this great little booklet, because it is going to, hopefully, help transform our agricultural industries.


Through the initial green paper process, almost 700 submissions were received, demonstrating that Australians recognise the potential development and opportunities in agriculture and primary production. I went to the forum held in Griffith in the MIA and I listened to the passion of the people who made verbal submissions—and many of them written submissions—to that particular inquiry. Through this process, further ideas about deregulation and reducing regulatory burden on farmers is also being considered to ensure we increase our competiveness, increase our farm gate profitability and ensure we lift the shackles from small business and primary producers.


Australian agriculture has a great future and huge potential, if we can continue to build on our current foundations and ensure that we get the policy setting right for the future. Through investment in research and development, the dams taskforce and the agricultural competitiveness white paper, we are ensuring that we are taking the opportunities before us. We recognise that agricultural and primary production has a critical role to play in ensuring we grow productivity and get our economy back on track.


The member for Watson continues to demonise and disparage farmers. He should know better; he was after all the 28th Minister for Agriculture, the 10th from Labor, of this great farming nation. Last Monday, after question time, the member asked the Speaker a series of questions, during which he spoke of disruptive conduct in the public galleries of the House of Representatives. 


He talked of anticlimate change groups and farmers. Maybe it is just an inconvenient truth for the member, but he ignored mentioning the noisy mob who cheered on 12 October 2011 when the carbon tax was brought into law —remember that awkward embrace between Julia Gillard and the man whose prime ministership she took, Kevin Rudd. And whilst they did not make it into the gallery—they all but did—who could forget the Canberra riot of 19 August 1996 when out-of-control trade unionists, the ones who bankroll Labor, kicked down the doors of Parliament House, ransacked the gift shop, damaged property and attacked police officers? Around 90 people were injured that day, and it was lucky someone wasn't killed. Why didn't the member for Watson pick on those thugs instead of criticising farmers, which he does at every opportunity?


The member for Watson was Minister for Agriculture from 2007 to 2010, during which time—on 23 June 2008—the single wheat desk was dismantled. Riverina farmers are still cursing him for that. He was the water minister, amongst other things, when the greenies threatened to impose a permanent man-made drought on irrigators. Thank goodness the Abbott Government, since coming to office, has capped water buyback.


What has the member for Watson got against farmers? Farmers—the ones who sustain this nation; let's never forget: irrigation feeds the nation. Farmers—who work damn hard, a lot harder than the member for Watson, me and everyone else elected to this place, let me tell you, in order to eke out a tough life in trying conditions. Farmers—who deserve to be praised over and over, again and again for the job they do growing food for Australians and other hungry nations besides. Farmers—who do not get a say as to what someone will pay for their produce, because they are price takers not price makers. Farmers—who, if and when they do have a problem with Canberra, voice their protest in a meaningful yet peaceful way, not with some violent smash and grab. Farmers—those true environmentalists, carers of the land, custodians of our proud heritage, and protectors of our productive rivers for the future. 



Farmers—the ones not understood by those opposite such as the member for Grayndler who just last month, 24 September to be precise, wrote in The Guardian:


But don't hold your breath waiting for urban policy leadership from the current Commonwealth government. Tony Abbott has no interest in policies affecting productivity in cities, even though they produce 80% of our nation's gross domestic product—


80 per cent of our GDP. 


I would question that figure. It might be 80 per cent, if you take all the mining wealth, the agricultural wealth, value add to it, export it out of the metropolitan ports and then claim that it is some sort of urban product, urban generated wealth creator. I would argue that it should be the other way round: it is the regions such as those in the member for Lyne's electorate, the member for Hasluck's electorate and the Riverina, which are producing the food and fibre which is boosting our GDP; helping our balance of payments; helping drive our exports; and helping generate wealth for this nation.


Farmers are the backbone of Australia and it is high time that those opposite just sometimes recognised that. As the son of a farmer, I can proudly declare they always were the backbone of the nation and always will be. They are the group overlooked by those opposite and to whom the member for Watson, I believe, owes an apology.


I commend this bill. I commend the work that the coalition government is doing on R&D. Only today the coalition-led committee produced their report on food labelling, which is something that our side talked about in opposition. Now in government we are getting on and doing something about it. It is absolutely critical that we have correct food labels so that people can make a discerning choice when they go to the supermarkets and be sure that the product they are buying is accurate and, if they want to buy Australian made, actually made in Australia. 


The R&D being done by our side of politics, by the government, is getting on with the job of helping to boost farmers and helping to boost that great group of individuals: men and women, those who left school at an early age and those who have really high tertiary qualifications. They come in all spectrums. But they are the ones who we should be admiring. They are the ones who we should be applauding at every single opportunity. They are the ones that this parliament owes a debt of gratitude to. They are the ones who do not deserve to be—as they continually are—criticised, rebuffed and rejected by those opposite.


We are getting on with the job of making sure that the farmers of this nation know that they cared for, know that we have concern for them and know that we—as Liberals and Nationals—understand that the job that they do for the nation is helping to grow the food and the fibre that is going to help continue make this nation even greater than it already is.

"Gillespie, David, MP",Nats,2014-10-27,"



Dr GILLESPIE
 (Lyne) (17:38):  The Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 is a very important piece of legislation for a very important sector of our economy. The extent of research and the impact of the rural development corporations is profound. There are five statutory bodies run by the government and 10 industry led bodies, whether it be the Cotton Research and Development Corporation, the Grains Research and Development Corporation, the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, the Grape and Wine Authority or the industry-led bodies, such as Sugar Research, Forest and Wood Products Australia, Dairy Australia, Australian Wool Innovation, Meat and Livestock Australia and the Australian Egg Corporation. All of these bodies are doing an essential task for the good functioning and the growth and development of Australia's primary industries.


As the member for Riverina just alluded to, a lot of people focus on gross domestic product being centred around the metropolitan centres; but I remind this House that it is wealth creation that builds the capital that is then circulating in the GDP. A lot of our gross national product is all onshore. Some of the essentials of wealth creation are missed when you look at GDP figures. It is more of a reflection of turnover. An economy is great if you have got a bigger GDP. But somewhere along the line the nation has to produce wealth. It starts with our primary industries, whether it is agriculture in this instance or in the mining industry, where it starts with bit of dirt and mine it for a mineral. It is the same with agriculture. It is making wealth and support for the nation out of the land.


I have the utmost respect for people in the rural industries because basically we have the best and the most efficient farmers, graziers and croppers in the world. The amount of production that we put out this country is enough to feed 60 or 80 million people. That is way in excess of what we need in this country and it is in one of the harshest climates in the world. There have been two studies showing the benefit of investing in research and development in the rural space. The first one was in 2008 and the second one was in 2010. They confirmed that for every one dollar put into research, you get a five-year return of $2.36. The 10-year return is $5.56 for every one dollar you put in. For the 25-year return—depending on which study, although they were both very similar—one was $11 for every one dollar invested and the other came out as $10.52 for every dollar invested. It is a fairly robust analysis.


That is why there is such good value in us investing in research, particularly in this space where we have a competitive advantage over the rest the world. Doing the research and the development in the agricultural space will help us maintain that; because for every commodity in the world that we sell, there is someone elsewhere in the world trying to sell it. All our commodities are subject to world commodity prices so we if can be more efficient and get 10 per cent more protein out of an animal or get crop yields are 10 or 15 per cent, that is a bottom-line improvement for our farmers and graziers. It means the farm-gate price that they are likely to get is so much better if we have got good product.


This extensive network of rural research capacity was set up in 1989. They are funded by statutory levies, which are matched by Commonwealth funds up to a capped amount for appropriate research activities. The cap is based on the relevant industries' gross value of production. The Fisheries Research and Development Corporation receives contributions from the Northern Territory and the states. No doubt, you all appreciate that some of the fishing goes on within the states' sphere of influence, way out to our national fishing borders. This act will modify some of the workings of this complex set of research and development processes. It will affect the Primary Industries Research and Development Act, the Sugar Research and Development Services Act and Australian Grape and Wine Authority Act—just to name a few—so that the government which pays the fees for all the international bodies and similar peak bodies and advisory bodies around the world are paid for by the Commonwealth government. This legislation will allow the government to recoup those fees from the relevant development corporations.


That seems harsh, but all these changes in finances are predicated on us because we are committed to getting the budget back under control. We inherited such fiscal mess that we have had to make these hard decisions. The fees that are payable are considerable and every portfolio has to do its part. There are changes across all levels of government, whether it is social security, health or rural research and development. Some of these fees—in the Fisheries RDC, for instance—are almost a million dollars a year. Sugar research is $160,000; the Grape and Wine Authority is $110,000; the Grains RDC, $150,000; cotton, $95,000. 


Because we are an island nation and our fisheries surround us, we have to keep track of what is going on with other fishery bodies—for information about fish stocks and so on. Most of the fish we catch migrate around the great oceans of the world. If our responsible authorities are not in tune with the Pacific Island nations and what they are doing with their fisheries—and with what is going on in the Indian Ocean and in the Great Southern Ocean—our fisheries will suffer. We have to be hooked into them. Whilst we are doing a good job of minimising our harvest rate so that we have sustainable fish stocks, if our neighbour nations and states do not apply similar restraint, our fisheries will eventually suffer. That is why it is so important that there are so many fisheries organisations.


Unfortunately, we in the government have to fund all this research and we have been put in the red by the previous government. That is why we are taking responsible, measured steps to help, at least with this portfolio, bring things back into the black. Not only are we funding these statutory bodies, as I have outlined, those amounts are matched dollar for dollar by the industries—or, rather, the government matches the money the industry bodies raise. All up, along with our research-for-profit initiative, which includes another hundred million dollars, there is $250 million a year being spent on rural research and development. Twelve days ago the minister announced the R&D-for-profit program, which is putting $100 million out there for all 15 of these research and development corporations. Whether they are industry owned and run or statutory organisations, they will be competing for these funds. It is a competitive process. The people with the best hypothesis or business case will be the beneficiaries of it. Again, all this research over time leads to better product and better returns for the growers and producers—and better take-home pay for the individual.


What we need is a secure, long-term funding set-up. This is a minor change, making the rural research and development organisations pay for their memberships in their associated international bodies. In addition, we are trying to reduce some of the cost burdens and the regulations that these organisations face. Regulations always have a financial impact, no matter what industry you are in. We have modified the requirements for these statutory bodies to table reports every year—saving them that cost. They still have to keep their papers in order, but there is a financial cost to preparing these reports. Some of them cost up to hundreds of thousands of dollars to produce, publish and table. In a way, we are saving them, on a recurrent basis, quite a lot of money—in a cumulative sense.


Another thing mandated by the existing legislation—which this legislation will amend—is the requirement for coordination meetings. What do we want? Do we want to have meetings for meetings' sake or do we want these R&D corporations to go out there and do research and development? I would much rather have the RDCs spending all their energies organising research and marketing for their industries than having endless meetings—coming here to Canberra and getting on the merry-go-round of meetings. I am sure there are better ways to coordinate research than to have yet another meeting in Canberra. These are well-staffed and well-credentialled bodies and I am sure they know how to coordinate their research.


My electorate produces up to a quarter of the state's milk. Whether you are a dairy farmer on the Comboyne Plateau, down in the Manning Valley or in the Lorne Valley, you would be reassured to know that Dairy Australia, in this instance, is doing research and developing marketing that will help you on your farm. A quarter of the state's milk from one reasonably small geographic area—that is incredibly productive. But it is incredibly productive because 10, 20 and 30 years ago there was extensive research that helped generate the productivity our farmers now demonstrate. There is a herd of 750 on one farm up on the Comboyne Plateau. That is a huge undertaking. There are 350 on another farm up there. There are similar herds down in the Manning Valley—all highly productive undertakings with cutting-edge technology. 


If you were to walk onto one of those farms, it would be easy, with a superficial look, to say, 'That's easy—you just get them out there and milk them.' But vast amounts of research have gone into generating the productivity increases that have been achieved over the last two or three generations. There have been improvements in genetics, cross-breeding, fodder development, fertilisation regimes and irrigation—all of these together having an overall cumulative impact on productivity, whether in the abattoir at Wingham, the processing plant at Wauchope or on one of the many beef properties in my electorate. The research that has led to the genetic improvements has taken place over generations. It has been undertaken by the CSIRO, by Meat and Livestock Australia and by other bodies before them—decades of research into making our production of meat and livestock more efficient. In the Wingham area for instance, the abattoir is the single biggest employer. It is those efficiency improvements that give them good product to export to Korea, to Japan and to Hong Kong. That is why they are able to employ that many people. My colleague the member for Cowper relies on the same industry—he has a branch of that processing plant up in his electorate. 


The ramifications of supporting R&D in the rural research space are extensive. It increases profitability, and not just for those businesses—Wauchope township relies on a lot of the small scale and larger scale producers coming into town and shopping at the co-op. There are several agricultural suppliers there. In the Manning, the biggest industry outside the health industry is the dairy industry. It is the shining light of productivity. They have had to be so efficient because they have had to deal with low commodity prices in the daily fresh milk market which, as we all know, has been subject to some very difficult trading conditions.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,18,1
"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2014-10-27,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Government Whip) (17:53):  I think I am the only member of this place who is a dairy farmer and so I bring a particularly direct focus to this debate on the Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill. I was disappointed to hear some of the comments from those opposite earlier in this debate, particularly given that for six years I sat in this place and, as a farmer, felt like I was a poor relation in the debate on policies and issues. Unfortunately, the comments we hear now demonstrate great hypocrisy. In bringing my contribution to the table today, as a farmer and as a levy payer, I want to talk about some of the reasons behind this—because, unfortunately, what we see is selective memory by those opposite.


All of us on this side would dearly love to have those conditions that Labor inherited when they came into government. As we all know, we left $20 billion in surpluses and $50 billion in savings—what an opportunity for the government of the day. Is that what we inherited? Clearly, the answer is no. I remind people, because sometimes we forget—we get so used to hearing the numbers—why it is that we need tough decisions. We had $191 billion in deficits left by Labor. If we did not make any changes, there would be a further $667 billion in gross debt, another $123 billion in further cumulative deficits ahead, and $1 billion in interest every single month. That equates to $30 million a day. That is $1.4 million an hour. Each speaker here has spoken for about 15 minutes, and in that time, thanks to Labor, we are borrowing another $340,000 to service the interest on the debt. That $12 billion a year in interest that is currently flowing out the doors could be going to any one of a number of very much needed programs and portfolio areas, not least the agricultural sector. Some of those opposite have suggested that $12 billion is not an issue—but $12 billion is more than the aged care budget. It is more than we spend on universities. If we do not make any changes and continue just to spend, as Labor would do, it would end up at being $2.8 billion a month in interest. In my view, that is obscene. As the IMF said, our spending under Labor was on the highest trajectory in the OECD. That is what we came into government facing—not $20 billion in surpluses and $50 billion in savings. Tough decisions are necessary.


The other issue that I wanted to talk about is the absolute lack of respect that I saw on the opposite side for our primary production sector. We saw that manifest itself in practical terms, as if this industry was an expendable one. That is exactly what, unfortunately, I have heard in the debate today—it is lip-service and is still seen, clearly, as an expendable industry. The Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill will make amendments to the Primary Industries Research and Development Act, which controls the research and development. It gives effect to some of the 2014-15 budget measures, and I have explained why they are necessary. It will allow the government to recover the cost of membership fees of international commodity organisations and regional fisheries management organisations from the matching amounts paid to rural research and develop and corporations. The bill also makes a number of additional amendments to the governance of R&D corporations. 


I want to talk about some of what is happening in my electorate and why R&D is so important. In my part of the world we have the dairy industry, the beef industry, horticulture, viticulture, vegetables—everything down to olive oils, and even the forestry sector and the fisheries sector. We have a very good irrigation scheme run as a cooperative by farmers—one that those at the time at a state government level thought was bound to fail. There is a wonderful saying—where water flows, food grows. It certainly does, and that cooperative of farmers has done an amazing job. It is a multi-award-winning organisation. In my part of the world there is much said about the efficiency of farmers. I am of the very strong belief that, in the environment that has existed since 2000, in the south-west of Western Australia if you were not among the most efficient farmers in not only in Australia but the world you simply would not have been in business.


They are the efficiencies required in Australia to compete with countries when we export, when there are tariffs, when there are subsidies, when there are non-tariff barriers and all of the above. Our farmers have to compete in that environment—and compete they do. They produce some of the best food and fibre anywhere in the world. In my sector, the dairy industry, Western Australia produces some of the highest quality milk not only in Australia but in the world. As we have heard previously, our farmers operate in one of the harshest climates that you will find anywhere in the world. Australia is, I think next to Antarctica, the driest continent in the world. This is the environment in which our farmers operate, and they are very, very efficient at it. 


The bill also makes some additional amendments to the governance of R&D. It removes the requirement for the minister to organise an annual coordination meeting for the chairs and it also removes some parliamentary tabling requirements. These are just further efficiencies. There are currently 15 R&D corporations, five statutory Rural Research and Development Corporations governed by the Primary Industries Research and Development Act. Ten of these are industry owned rural research and development corporations created from former statutory rural research and development corporations and, at the request of the relevant industry, most of them are able to undertake marketing activities in addition to their R&D. Also, most of them are primarily funded by statutory levies on primary production or products. These are the producers—us; the people just like me in the south-west of Western Australia. We are funding ourselves and directly investing in research and development and, by extension, investing in not just our own future and the future of the communities that rely on us but also Australia's future. 


I note that the productivity growth—and, again, this is an area where we have seen and continue to see a lack of respect—in the farm sector has outpaced the rest of the economy. I wonder how many people not just in this place but in the rest of Australia actually grasp that fact, actually understand just how well our people on the land right are doing their job. Productivity growth in the farm sector has outpaced the rest of the economy. Right now, in my part of the world, it is hay season. There are a whole lot of farmers out there on tractors, mowing, tethering, raking and baling hay. They just get on with their job—like a lot of small businesses in this country. They work in their business, they have got their heart and soul in their business and they do what they do very, very well. 


As I said, we had the Brunswick Show this last weekend—one of the biggest regional shows in Australia—and we saw a wonderful display of beef cattle, dairy produce, trade displays and machinery dealers. We cannot underestimate how important these shows are not only in bringing everybody together but also for the small businesses that keep our rural and regional communities operating and vibrant. These are the people who actually contribute to fundraising events in local communities, to football clubs and to other local community service organisations. Often it is the farmer's gear that is used for the local fire brigade or to help out to level a particular piece of ground. It is often the farmers who are called on for their common sense and expertise. Frequently, it is their tractor or truck or some other of their gear that is needed to be used. It is farmers and primary producers who provide this. 


In Western Australian, Western Dairy uses some of the R&D funds for practical on-farm work. This is the sort of R&D that makes a difference on the ground. This is what we want to see and this is what our farmers need. To stay ahead in the environment in which they find themselves, they need research, innovation and practical outcomes. This is basically the edge that Australia has got, along with our biosecurity. We really need to protect our biosecurity and our clean and green image. With R&D—by constantly innovating and by constantly being efficient—we can stay ahead of the rest of the world in this sector. You do not outpace the rest of the economy, as the farming sector has done, without very effective R&D. In recent times some of that has eased slightly, but this is an industry that is constantly looking to innovate. 


The other side of it is that most farmers in Australia are part of Landcare groups or Natural Resource Management groups. This is not just because they want to be efficient environmentally; they also want to manage their properties well. They know that there will be another group of farmers who will need to produce food and fibre on it, and so they are looking to manage their properties in a way that allows that capacity to stay with the land. This is another thing that is often overlooked in the debate about what farmers bring to the table. It is not just the economic multipliers but also the environmental management that they are very, very good at. As a member of the environment committee, I remember another member of parliament saying to me, 'I'm surprised to see you here.' I said, 'Why is that?' She said, 'Well, you're a farmer.' I said, 'Yes.' And she said, 'Well, you're an environmental vandal.' I said, 'Well, that's really an interesting comment. Are you aware that the majority of farmers are part of Landcare and Natural Resource Management groups?' 


We live on rain water on my property. I do not know how many other people do that. If we are talking about managing resources and making the most of recycling and others measures, then we do that. We live on rain water. We grow a lot of our own vegetables and fruit. Of course, we have our own milk and, at times, eat our own beef. So when we talk about who is having an impact and how—and that is besides how well we manage or pastures or how well we manage our irrigation—there is a lot of misinformation out there about the contribution that farmers make across a range of areas of our economy. R&D is important to such management. We on this side have committed an extra $100 million to R&D, on top of the $250 million already committed, which will start next year. This is a critical to our primary producing sector being able to not only stay competitive but also continue to innovate and change 


The number of farmers, who are constantly looking for information the best way they can, want to receive it on their farm while they are doing the job—while they are in the tractor. They want to get on with their job; they want the information they need; and they want to be the best at what they do. That is why I support the measures contained in this bill. Equally, we need some understanding of the reasons the government keeps having to make tough decisions, and those tough decisions are brought about by the lack of financial management by the previous Labor government. It is unfortunately a habit that we see repeated frequently in this place.

"Cobb, John, MP",Nats,2014-10-27,"



Mr JOHN COBB
 (Calare) (18:07):  It gives me pleasure to rise to speak on the Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. R&D has been huge for agriculture over the years and it is something we are committed to. We stand by that commitment with an extra $100 million, despite the state of the budget and what we inherited. It shows how important we all believe rural R&D is.


It is not so long ago that the previous government not only did not want to increase R&D, but actually wanted to cut it by some 50 per cent of government contribution. I always recall the words of the recently deceased Prime Minister of Great Britain, Margaret Thatcher: 'Socialism's quite a good thing until you run out of other people's money to spend.' When the previous government did realise they spent a little too much and were having to borrow so much, one of their first targets was agricultural R&D. Their way of doing that was to hold a Productivity Commission inquiry into the R&D that was run by the various corporations and contributed to on a dollar-for-dollar basis by Australian agriculture. The Productivity Commission, being an arm of Treasury and an arm of government in that particular case, was happy to suggest that they were spending too much. It was only because we warned them of what was going on that agriculture and the various industry bodies got up and embarrassed the government from cutting their matching funding of 50 per cent. I was rather proud of our industry and ourselves in that instance in achieving that. The current Manager of Opposition Business was the minister at the time; he and his successors backed off on that one, but they certainly had no intention of supporting or increasing the R&D budget, even though their own Productivity Commission acknowledged just how good agricultural R&D was and the benefit the taxpayer got from it.


Australian farmers are very innovative and very adaptable. I have always thought of agriculture as being in groups. There is corporate agriculture, which I am a fan of and I will come back to say why. There is what I call family corporate, which is a family big enough to have economies of scale, with a family farm where the family is totally focused on running that farm. Then there are those who have off-farm income and who go along quite happily because they are getting enough money off-farm and so they do not need to get every dollar out of that farm. The ones under most pressure are the ordinary family farmers who are not big enough to achieve economies of scale—both partners are full-time farmers.


I add the word 'innovation' to R&D. All four levels of R&D are extraordinarily important. Unfortunately since about 2000 the gains that R&D have historically made for Australian agriculture have levelled out, particularly in the decade since then. Having said that, R&D is not just about increased productivity; it has to be about profitability. There is absolutely no point in producing more if you are not making any more. I have always said: 'Everything we have to do for agriculture revolves around profitability. Agriculture is not a charity; it is here to ensure that Australia has the best quality food in the world, and by and large that is true, but if you can't make a quid you're not in the game.' The No. 1 job of R&D is to increase profitability. It goes without saying that that will also include productivity and quality production. As the member for Forrest said, our image around the world of how we produce and what we produce is probably the biggest selling point of trade for us that exists.


I also want to say that there is another side to this that R&D can help with too—and that is the health aspect of food. R&D needs to look very hard at things like grains without gluten. The health thing is very big these days, but I am not talking organic here. I am afraid that, if the whole world went organic, the whole world's population would shrink considerably. If people want to work in the niche market of organics, good luck to them. I am talking about the health aspects that R&D can look at to increase the profile of agriculture but, more than this, to increase the profitability and the reliability of Australian agriculture.


There is one thing that is so important here with R&D. The extra money demands cooperation amongst the various bodies. I mean cooperation in not just how this money is spent between an R&D corporation and manufacturers or processors, as indeed it must—and that is why I mentioned the word 'innovation' as well—between them and industry bodies, as indeed it must, or between them and other private R&D bodies, as indeed it must; I mean cooperation between the different R&D corporations themselves. I think that is incredibly important.


The Productivity Commission report that the member for Watson, as the minister, called for stated that our bodies do not cooperate enough. For example, the various plant R&D corporations and the various animal R&D corporations should be working much more closely whether they want to or not. It is a fact that the industry bodies and the growers are all for total cooperation between the various bodies. In fact, they can see nothing but gain with it, and common-sense says that there is nothing but gain with it. It is not always true to say that those corporations—




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  We want to have a division before—




Mr JOHN COBB:
  Come on, I have still got six minutes. Stop panicking. The various corporations must learn to cooperate better. I believe it is the government's job to make sure that they do.


I have been involved with this for a long time. I think it is quite obvious—and I am no scientist and never intended nor wanted to be—that common-sense says that the genetics that are inherit within plants and animals means that if you do not cooperate you are going to miss out. I understand why some scientists want their name up there. If you do the work, you deserve to have it that way.


While the shadow minister is talking down there, I will say that I am sure that if he had been the minister he would not have wanted to knock $100 million out of the government's contribution of matching funds, but his predecessor certainly did want to do that. I am not going to go on any longer except to say that this $100 million means an awful lot. It better be used wisely and cooperatively. Historically broadacre has done enormous things. As I said, it has levelled out a lot in increasing productivity and the like. Horticulture today can probably make greater advances quicker with genetic work than broadacre can because it is so much more controllable and it lends itself naturally to laboratory work. Whether it is horticulture or broadacre, we need this R&D and we need the cooperation. The government must make sure it happens.

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",Nats,2014-10-27,"



Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper—Deputy Leader of the House and Assistant Minister for Employment) (18:18):  I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. As with many National Party members, I have a strong agricultural constituency that contributes to the productive capacity of Australia and the national wealth of Australia. In my electorate the blueberry industry is making a great contribution to wealth and employment. We have seen this industry go from strength to strength. This industry is employing many Australians and many visitors from overseas, who come to this country on a working holiday and find the blueberry industry an excellent source of employment. They are not only contributing to the productive capacity of the country but providing tourism dollars that will be spent in our local economy.


We have seen some great efforts in relation to blueberry production in my electorate. We have seen many hundreds of people employed in production. We have seen the great local cooperative by the name of Oz Berries going from strength to strength. It has achieved blueberry production growth in the order of 20 per cent per year. Not that long ago—I recall it was in the Howard era—Oz Berries secured a grant to assist them with constructing a packing facility. I am pleased to be able to inform the House that before that facility was completed it was already too small to meet the needs of the cooperative. So strong was the growth in production in blueberries that their packing facility had to be extended by the time it was officially opened. The facility has been progressively extended. 


What started off as a private company has been transformed into a cooperative. That cooperative now provides a range of facilities to its members. It provides centralised buying as well as getting goods to market and a whole range of other services. Oz Berries is a credit to our local area. It does great work. It employs many locals and is producing great wealth for our region.


We also have a very large blueberry facility run by the CostaGroup at Corindi. Again they are employing many Australians. They produce high-quality fruit that has an Australia wide and worldwide reputation. They produce not only blueberries; in our local area there has been a move into the production of raspberries, which is also very welcome. It is also a high-value crop. We are seeing very labour-intensive agriculture on those properties enhancing our local wealth.


The Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 amends rural research and development legislation to give effect to a 2014 budget measure and to reduce red tape. The bill implements a 2014 budget measure to change the way that the government pays for its membership of international commodity organisations, including those for wine, grains, sugar and cotton. These organisations provide significant benefits to our producers. The amendments to payment arrangements will also encompass Australia's membership of six regional fisheries management organisations that manage migratory fish species. Our membership ensures regional arrangements are in line with domestic arrangements and secures access for Australian industry. 


The bill amends the Primary Industries Research and Development Act 1989, the Australian Grape and Wine Authority Act 2013 and the Sugar Research and Development Services Act 2013 to allow the government to recover the cost of the memberships from the Commonwealth funding provided to relevant rural research and development corporations. The amendments will result in a saving to government of around $7 million over the next four years. Red tape will be reduced for a number of research and development corporations. This is in line with the government's commitment to reduce red tape. As a government, we think it is vitally important to reduce red tape so that businesses can act and operate more efficiently. The bill removes the requirement to table certain documents in the parliament. This provides consistency across the corporations, with funding contracts and variations no longer needing to be tabled. In the interest of good governance, the corporations will still produce these reports and make them available to the public or to members as required. Also repealed is the need for an annual coordination meeting for the chairs of statutory research and development corporations. Only five of the 15 corporations remain as statutory bodies. As there are other means to coordinate activities, the bill removes the need for a legislated coordination meeting. These are sensible changes in relation to red tape. 


The government is obviously cognisant of the importance of reduced red tape in making business more efficient and more effective. A more efficient business sector can create more jobs. A more efficient business sector can create greater wealth for all Australians. I know that all sectors of Australian business, not only in the field of agriculture, welcome our commitment to the reduction of red tape. We have had oppositions in the past promising time after time to reduce red tape, but when they move from opposition into government they fail to make good on that commitment to reduce red tape. This government has a real commitment to red-tape reduction. This government is reducing red tape in a range of sectors right around the country, and this legislation is just part of that process. They are small changes, admittedly, that are making a difference to business by reducing that burden of red tape and reducing the costs of operating. That is a very important thing: if we can reduce business costs, we will have a more profitable and efficient business sector. The government's red-tape reduction agenda is very much a part of that. As I get around the country and talk to people in business, they are very pleased to see the government's solid commitment to red-tape reduction. They welcome the fact that there is finally progress being made by a government in stripping away those levels of red tape. Red tape creates inefficiency. Red tape creates increased operating costs for businesses, and this government is absolutely committed to reducing that red tape.


Australia's rural industries are innovative and productive, and the government is committed to ensuring their profitability and competitiveness now and into the future. This legislation is part of that commitment, as is our commitment to reducing red tape. We believe that we should be lifting the burden from business. We believe that we should be removing red tape as quickly as possible. We have seen hundreds of millions of dollars saved by business as a result of the government's commitment to red-tape reduction to date. We are having discussions in this session of parliament about the changes to red-tape requirements that are easing the burden on business. It is vitally important that we reduce red tape so that we allow businesses to function more efficiently and more effectively.


In my portfolio area of employment, we have made significant inroads in the reduction of red tape. We have lifted the burden of red tape off employment service providers, allowing them to do what they do best, and that is getting people into a job. When we came to government we inherited an employment services system that was mired in red tape and being prevented from doing what it should be doing. Employment service providers were spending their time filling out forms and complying with government requirements—




Mr Tudge:
  Up to 50 per cent of their time. 




Mr HARTSUYKER:
  Up to 50 per cent of their time. The member for Aston is correct. Some providers were telling me that they were spending up to 50 per cent of their time filling out forms, absolutely mired in red tape. So as we move toward the employment services contract, starting on 1 July 2015, we will have a significant increase in red-tape reductions over and above those red-tape reductions that we have achieved to date. It is a big commitment to red-tape reduction, and we are keeping our promise to the businesses of Australia that we would reduce red tape. That is reflected in reduced operating costs for businesses and increased profitability for businesses and it is also reflected in more jobs. That is what this government is all about. We are all about creating jobs, whether it be in agriculture or whether it be in the services sector, we are about creating jobs.


I will draw my contribution in relation to the Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment bill to a conclusion. This bill, and the changes it makes, fit in well with the government's commitment to reduce red tape and our commitment to agriculture. We are committed to a strong and vibrant agricultural sector, and I commend the bill to the House.

"Hogan, Kevin, MP",Nats,2014-10-27,"



Mr HOGAN
 (Page) (15:56):  I acknowledge my neighbour, the member for Richmond, the previous speaker on this bill. The member for Richmond is a very pleasant person. We run into each other around the place quite often in the far North Coast of New South Wales. But I must take account to a couple of the things that the member for Richmond has just said about Labor having a proud record in relation to rural industries or agriculture. She said, 'I know many rural industries, if not all rural industries, had an issue in the previous Labor government.' The cattle industry in our area was aghast when the previous Labor government overnight stopped the live cattle export. That destroyed the beef industry in our area. It obviously meant that cattle that were bred for export suddenly were not. Far northern Australia was brought to its knees, and over the proceeding weeks and months, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, because I know you would know, these cattle found their way south and prices were exceptionally depressed. We had cattle everywhere. We have starving cattle in the end because they were not able to be exported and we had a very depressed sector there. 


The other one I would remind the member for Richmond of with regard to our rural industries was, with all due respect, the carbon tax. She made reference to the sugar industry as well as others. I can remind the member for Richmond that very few, if any, rural industries in my region, be they sugar, be they dairy, be they beef, be they anyone who used power, was happy with the previous government and their solution to climate change being a carbon tax, which did not change the temperature but—and this is the big issue here—made it very hard for them to compete. And we know that our agricultural industries are very much built around export. I think there is a bit of selective memory there.


However, let's get to the bill in hand. This bill, as we know, will amend the rural research and development legislation, and one of the big aspects of this bill, Mr Deputy Speaker—and I know you would be very appreciative of these changes—is to reduce regulatory burden on the rural research and development corporations. It amends legislation to remove requirements for RDCs to table certain corporate documents. This is to reduce regulatory burden and promote consistency between RDCs. In the interest of good governance, the RDCs will still need to produce these documents and make them publicly available.


This is in line with a big theme of this government. We on this side of the parliament know that we have to remain competitive. If we want to maintain our standard of life and to provide the social services that many people in our country require, we need to get the money from somewhere. To get the money we need the private sector in all sectors not just agriculture to be competitive, and this bill moves in that area as well. I know there is going to be legislation and legislation has already been introduced into parliament. We will have reduced $2 billion, which is not a small figure, of red tape in our first 12 months—double what we said we would do—because we understand and are very clear that this is very important to maintaining our competitiveness in many industries.


Dairy Australia, Forest & Wood Products Australia, the Australian Livestock Export Corporation and Sugar Research Australia will no longer need to table funding agreements or variations to funding agreements. Dairy Australia and the Australian Livestock Export Corporation will no longer need to table the annual report and other compliance reports. Again this all saves in red tape costs. 


The Primary Industries Research and Development Act 1989 is amended to remove the requirements for the minister to organise annual coordination meetings for the chairs of the statutory RDCs. This is an unnecessary requirement. Again this bill removes a regulatory cost to them and indeed to government.


It is also important to remember that in 2014-15 the Commonwealth will provide funding of approximately these figures to the different areas: $11.6 million to the Grape and Wine R&D Corporation, $68.9 million to the Grains R&D Corporation, $5.1 million to Sugar Research Australia, $8.5 million to the Cotton R&D Corporation and $17.4 million to the Fisheries R&D Corporation. Again this is not money to be sniffed at.


The government in this bill very much recognises the importance of R&D in the agriculture, fisheries and the forestry sectors. The results of R&D help primary producers to produce more with less, giving them greater profit at the farm gate. Around $700 million per year is spent by the Australian government on rural R&D and extension activities. Within 10 years farmers generate a $12 return for each dollar the government invests in agricultural R&D. Australian farmers have an innovative culture. They know that R&D is essential if Australian industries are to keep pace and compete successfully in the international arena.


The 15 rural research and development corporations provide a mechanism for farmers and fishers to invest collectively in services that will benefit their industry, such as research and development and in some cases marketing. The government encourages investment by establishing and collecting a statutory levy if an industry so requests and by returning the funds to the relevant RDC, less the cost of collection. In addition, the government matches the RDC's eligible R&D spending up to the legislated limits. In the current financial year the government will provide an estimated $250 million to the RDCs. In recognition of the good work they do, the government has committed to an additional $100 million in funding for rural RDCs, starting in the next financial year. This funding boost will enable the RDCs to further contribute to farm productivity and profitability and better deliver cutting-edge technology.


Delivering on the coalition's 2013 election commitment, the first round of funding opened for applications on 15 October 2014. The guidelines include the research priorities for the first round of funding. The application period will close on 15 December 2014. Proposed research projects will need to address one or more of the research priorities that fall into these four areas: one, increase the profitability and productivity of primary industries; two, increase the value of primary products; three, strengthen primary producers' ability to adapt to opportunities and threats; and, four, strengthen on-farm adoption and improve information flows. There are a range of issues in Australian agriculture that can be managed through this process, such as improvements to wild dog control, better techniques to control Parthenium, and blackberry control using pathogens.


I want to make it very clear that this government has always been very in tune with the needs and desires of the agricultural sector. In our first 12 months of government, besides abolishing things like the carbon tax that were very damaging to the agricultural sector and agribusinesses, we have reinstated with full vigour the live export trade with our neighbours to again increase farm gate prices for that part of the agricultural sector. We also have free trade agreements with Korea and Japan. I know that most of the agricultural sector in my region would export around 70 per cent of what they produce, whether it be beef, dairy or macadamia nuts—and I could give you many other examples. Most of these products—well over 50 per cent—are sold offshore, so these markets are very important to us. 


We did free trade agreements with Korea and Japan and are now also working on a free trade agreement with China. In fact, the Minister for Agriculture recently took a delegation to China. I was very pleased to organise for three or four industry sector representatives from my area to travel with the minister. They represented diverse agricultural produce. They have all come back and are very appreciative of the work the government are doing—the fact that we are trying to lower the red tape burden, have lowered their cost of production with the abolition of the carbon tax and are trying to actively work with them to give them access to new markets. 


If the next generation of farmers in our communities are going to see a future on the farm, the one thing we have to do is improve the farm gate price, because that is the bottom line literally. If they are going to have a financial future and if the younger people are going to have a financial future in carrying on with the family farm or indeed entering the industry, that is what is necessary. So this, along with many other things we have done in the first 12 months, is focused on the agricultural sector. We want the agricultural sector to survive and prosper. I commend this bill to the House.

"O'Neil, Clare, MP",ALP,2014-10-27,"



Ms O'NEIL
 (Hotham) (16:07):  Labor are opposing the Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 and in doing so we will be calling it what it is: a cut to agriculture R&D spending. This bill is taking a knife to R&D investment in agriculture and it is part of a much broader and much more serious set of cuts to research and development in Australia. But the focus today, and what I want to spend my time talking about, is agriculture: rural people, rural employment and the productivity of our rural industries. We know that the government, in speaking to this bill, are going to talk big on rural Australia, because that is what these guys are good at. We heard it from the member for Page, the member for Lyons, the member for Parkes, the member for Eden-Monaro— 




Mr Pasin interjecting— 




Ms O'NEIL:
  and, no doubt, soon enough we will hear it from the member for Barker. In fact, the member for Parkes talked about 'being in tune with the needs of country people'. Then, later, when this goes to a vote, he is going to cast a vote that will see a reduction in funding for R&D for agriculture. It is all talk and no action. They say all the right things at election time, but, when it comes time to make a vote, to make a decision, to cast a priority in favour of agriculture and rural people, that is not what these guys are going to do.


Labor is opposed to this bill not just because of the rank hypocrisy of it being put forward by the government but because Labor has always seen and always valued R&D for our agriculture sector. Labor created the research and development corporations model in 1989. Since that time, this model of investment has become the envy of the world; it has been copied right around the world. One of the distinctive features of the model that Labor put forward in 1989 was the principle of co-funding. We created the corporations and then we asked the people in industry who led those corporations what their priorities were. So it was not the old-school model of government knowing best and government knowing everything and telling agriculture what they needed to be spending their money on. We asked farmers and people who were advocating for their interests to tell us what was important, and then we matched them dollar for dollar. It has been an enormously successful program, and that is illustrated by the vast reach of these research development corporations. They have grown year on year, from the Australian Egg Corporation Ltd to Forest and Wood Products Australia Ltd; from Meat and Livestock Australia to Australian Wool Innovation Ltd; and there are many, many more. 


What has the result been of that very clever policy design of R&D in agriculture? We know that, over the last 25 years, agriculture productivity has roughly doubled. This is one of the least supported industries by Australian government compared to other industries right around the world; it is one of the most efficient and least supported. We know, when we think about economic reform, that the agriculture and farming community have really done the heavy lifting. We have seen that in their returns in productivity. The research and development funding that has helped drive productivity has been an important part of the puzzle here. It is partly through investment, through research and development, that this has occurred.


Let us put the bill that we are discussing today into context. As quite a separate means of supporting and coordinating the activities of Australia's primary producers, the Australian government takes out membership of a range of international organisations. It does this because it is very much in Australia's interest to be part of international organisations that operate in the same sphere as our local producers. I make the point that, when we look overseas, when we look at our trading partners and when we look at our competitors, they are often countries where government has a much greater role in decisions that affect those different types of agricultural industries. A few examples of organisations of which the Australian government is a member: the International Sugar Organisation, the International Grains Council—and there are around six memberships in the international fishing area. You can imagine that that particular industry requires quite a deal of coordination. 


What this bill seeks to do and the reason why it essentially, in effect, is a cut to R&D funding, is it forces the cost of membership for these organisations onto the research and development corporations. It basically says to industry: 'We just don't want to provide this for you anymore. If you want to pay those memberships then you can cut your own R&D funding, and that is how you will pay to be members of these international organisations.' It seems pretty cut and dried to me that that is exactly what is happening here.


It is a very disappointing direction to be moving in, for many reasons, but one that I want to go into a little bit is to do with the broader context of research and development in Australia. Some of the contributions that I have heard from those opposite have talked in lavish terms about an extra $100 million in R&D spending. It is, frankly, laughable, because what the government is doing is giving with one hand and then taking away a lot more with the other. Roughly speaking, when we talk about R&D, we get about $10 back for every $1 that is invested, as long as it is invested wisely. The National Farmers' Federation uses an $11 figure when talking about agricultural R&D. But when we look at other parts of the research and development space in Australia, we can see that there have been massive cuts to the area of rural research such as the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. 


I want to start by talking about the CSIRO, because that is where the really big cut is biting from this last budget. We saw $147 million cut from the CSIRO and 500 jobs gone. These are incredibly savage cuts for an organisation that has served Australia so proudly in conducting basic research and more specific research over a long period of time. This is the organisation that invented polymer bank notes, advanced radio astronomy and wi-fi. Where would be without wi-fi today? That was $147 million. Then we have got the $80 million in cuts to cooperative research centres and the $11 million in reduced annual appropriation funding to the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. You can see why Australians right around the rural parts of the country are growing a little weary of these promises and the excitement with which Nationals and Liberals on the other side of the House talk about them. When we put them into context we can see that it is the Liberals doing what the Liberals do, and that is cutting these important programs that have supported us for a long time. It is particularly worrying that we are seeing this trend towards cutting back on R&D funding because the truth is that, in Australia at the moment, we do not spend enough money on research and development. Looking at our economy as a whole, when we take the last year of spending under this coalition government, we see that as a percentage of total GDP this government has spent less on research and development than in any other year on record. The records go back to 1978-1979, so we are looking quite a way back here. It goes to show the tremendous lack of vision of the people on the other side of the House that right at this time—this incredibly difficult time for our economy, as we are making the transition away from the mining investment boom—it is R&D that goes to the chopping block. It is just absolutely astounding.


I mentioned that our spending over this last year was the lowest on record. We are well below the OECD average. For a country like Australia, where all we have are the minds of the people of this nation and their inventiveness, it is no wonder that so many of our scientists and researchers are trying to make their way overseas—because the support just is not there.


The situation under this government is getting worse and worse. It is pretty much in concert with the overall approach to research and development that we see this savage cut that is part of the legislation before us. We see, again, this consistent theme of promising one thing, $100 million in additional R&D, and doing another—cutting hundreds of millions of dollars through a range of different cuts. We heard before the election that agriculture was going to be one of the big pillars of our economy but what we see instead is a lack of support on the other side leading to that pillar crumbling.


This is what we expect from the Liberals; but when you come into the chamber and talk about these issues—about rural people—what you do expect to see, at the very least, is the Nationals standing up for their communities and fighting for the rights of these people working in rural Australia, trying to make our agricultural sector more productive and continue the good work it is doing. It was a delight to be in the chamber when the member for Indi got up and made her contribution to this debate, because I do not think I have seen a country MP who is not on this Labor side of the House argue with such vigour and such passion for the things that are important to her community. I say to rural people: if you feel you are not getting good service out of your National MPs there are other independents out there, like the member for Indi, and I would urge you to look towards them, because she is giving very good representation to her constituents.


The Nationals, unfortunately, have gone missing on this important point of rural R&D. I say again, with much disappointment, that this is a recurring theme we have seen in this parliament in other areas of policy. We know, for example, things like university deregulation are going to hit rural and regional parts of the country much harder than they will hit our cities. We know that young people living in rural and regional Australia already face much more significant barriers to get to university. We know that once they get a job, if they decide to go back to their community—which I would assume that those on the other side of the House would be urging them to do—they will earn less than they probably would have if they had stayed in the city, where there are many more commercial opportunities. Yet what we see is those on the other side of the House paving a path for our universities to open up degrees that will cost $80,000 or $100,000. I know from the many friends I have in rural Australia—not people that I represent but people that I know—this will put in place insurmountable barriers to study. So where were the Nationals when this was being decided?


Drought funding is another terrific example of what a total failure these members of parliament have been in representing rural and regional Australia. Fourteen million dollars was allocated to drought funding in the previous financial year. Most of it went back into consolidated revenue and we have seen, on numerous occasions now, that the minister cannot even explain coherently how the funding was administered to people who needed that drought relief.


We see it in health. We heard 'no cuts to health' and I am sure rural Liberal and National MPs right around the country were going around their electorates excitedly telling people there would be no changes to health funding. But at the very first opportunity in the National and Liberal party rooms we had a $7 co-payment—a $7 tax on the sickest people in the country. We have had changes that mean people living in rural parts of the country will need to pay somewhere up to $1,000 or $2,000 for certain types of tests. We know that they will get some of that money refunded back; I absolutely acknowledge that. But you and I both know that there are many people in rural and regional Australia who are not going to be able to find a couple of thousand dollars to be able to take a test.


I had the great pleasure of talking to a doctor who serves a community in rural Victoria about this very issue. When I asked about what he thought would happen he just laughed and said, 'Well, of course, Clare, these people are just not going to take the test.' We came into the parliament and asked the minister: 'Have you factored in the additional costs of more people not having their cancer picked up early?' But of course they have not, because evidence and modelling are not of much interest to those ideologues who are making these big decisions, unfortunately, for the nation at the moment.


I will finish by coming back to this point about research. The most important thing we can do for agricultural communities is help them plan and build for the future. As I mentioned before, the NFF tells us that for every dollar we spend on agricultural R&D, we are going to get $11 back. It is a pretty good investment—it is a lot better than the stock market, especially when you look at recent years. But sometimes you come in here and you get the feeling that the Nationals and the Liberals who represent these communities have different vision of what it is to be a farmer in these modern times. It is science. It is innovation. It is productivity improvements, and these farmers are looking for support with those things. That is exactly why we like to advocate for spending on rural and regional R&D and spending on agriculture.


Modern farming needs scientists. It needs researchers. It needs inventiveness and creativity. We see that in farms right around the country and that is why Labor has put forward these models, which have been very innovative, to support research and development in agriculture. That is why we are opposing this savage cut to R&D today.

"Pasin, Tony, MP",LP,2014-10-27,"



Mr PASIN
 (Barker) (16:21):  The member for Hotham was right about one thing; I am passionate and will wax lyrical about the contribution that regional electorates like mine make to the national economy. Unfortunately, I am disappointed to indicate to the House I fear that she is wrong about almost everything else. She spoke about rank hypocrisy. This is from the party that gave us a ban on live exports to Indonesia, the party that was so reluctant to enter into free trade agreements that their activity in that space could only be described as glacial. Yet she comes in here, as a member representing a vast area of 75 square kilometres in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, and seeks to lecture those of us who represent many hundreds of thousands of square kilometres—as you do, Mr Deputy Speaker, and as I do—about what people want to see in the bush. 


I will tell you one thing about farmers—and I am not telling you anything you do not know, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I am certainly not telling my family anything they would not tell me—a farmer knows one thing for sure: a farmer knows you cannot live beyond your means. If you spend more this year than you earn in revenues in the highly commoditised market, you are one step closer to the bank or some other entity taking control of the farm over which you have had stewardship. I wonder how much we could allocate to research and development year on year if we were not as a nation spending a billion a month—in interest only—near on $800 million of which is being paid to entities overseas. 


We are here to talk about the Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. It makes amendments to the rural research and development legislation, which will give effect to the budget measures of 2014-15. It will also make some additional governance amendments. Why are we making these changes? We are making them because we arrived in September 2013 and, when we checked the cupboards, we found they were bare. Against that background, we have had to make some difficult decisions. 


Obviously I need to stress to the House the importance of rural research and development to the economy's security and how high a priority it is for this government. I wish to note the work in recent days of the Minister for Agriculture, who announced six new appointments to the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, and the reappointment of Dr Len Stephens from South Australia as Managing Director of the Seafood Cooperative Research Centre, which, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, is crucial to the aquaculture industry in my electorate. This gives me the opportunity to shout out to the crayfishermen of the southern coast.


I also note the release of the green paper into agricultural competitiveness which will in turn lead to the development of the commensurate white paper—the Minister for Agriculture has emphasised the importance of increasing farm gate returns. This process is inherently linked to Australia's economic security, research and development and the continued maintenance of our reputation as a quality producer. 


Agriculture was once the bedrock of the Australian community, and now as we head to the 21st century we must build on the lessons and practices of the past, both good and bad, to keep our farm sector competitive and to cement our global brand. The farm sector will drive economic growth in new ways going forward, not simply in the traditional fields of fruit, vegetables and livestock, but in other areas—such as education, water management, intellectual property, financial services, advanced manufacturing, science, human resources, management practices and biotechnology to name just a few.


Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that in this, our first budget, we proposed $100 billion of additional funding for research and development, specifically to support continued innovation in agriculture, fisheries and the forestry sector. Our government recognises the strong link between research and development and agricultural productivity growth, and recognises that it is a key driver for industry productivity and farm gate profitability. This research will focus on delivering cutting edge technologies with an emphasis on making research accessible to farmers on property. Research must be practical and support our farmers and producers. 


As you have heard—and no doubt will continue to hear throughout this debate—the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences estimates that, for every dollar a government invests in agriculture research and development, farmers can expect a $12 return within 10 years. In a tight fiscal environment, the fact the government has allocated substantial additional funding demonstrates how important research and development is to the future of rural industries. It demonstrates the link between innovation competitiveness, profitability and sustainability, as well as natural resource management.


The budget measure referred to in this legislation allows government to recover the costs of membership fees to international commodity organisations and regional fisheries management organisations from the matching amounts paid to rural research and development corporations, or what have come to be known as RDCs. The additional measures remove the requirement for the minister to organise an annual coordination meeting for the chairs of the statutory RDCs and removes some parliamentary tabling requirements to reduce regulation. This of course gives me an opportunity to mention that this Wednesday in this place will be the second of our repeal days which focus on repealing unnecessary and unwanted red tape in the interests of the nation's economy.


The RDCs were established in 1989 by the Primary Industries Research and Development Act to undertake scientific research for the benefit of Australian rural industries, with benefits flowing to rural communities and the nation more broadly. There are currently 15 RDCs; five of these are statutory RDCs governed by that act; and 10 are industry owned RDCs which were created from former statutory RDCs. Most RDCs are able to undertake marketing activities in addition to their research and development activities at the request, of course, of relevant industries. 


Most of the RDCs are primarily funded by statutory levies on primary production or products. The statutory levies for research and development are matched by Commonwealth funding up to a cap. The funds raised through the statutory levies are appropriated to the RDCs, less the cost of the levy's collection. The government provides matching funding to the RDCs based on their expenditure on eligible research and development activities. The RDCs are required to submit invoices to the Department for Agriculture to claim matching funding; matching funding provided to each RDC is subject to a cap based on the relevant industry's gross value of production. 


Funding for the fisheries RDC operates differently in some respects. The fisheries RDC receives funding from state and territory governments as well as from levies. The caps on Commonwealth funding are based on gross value of production but are calculated differently to those of other RDCs. The Department of Agriculture currently pays for Australian government membership to international commodity organisations and regional fisheries management organisations. These organisations work to improve the trading environment for agricultural products by funding and coordinating research and development, providing information and statistics, setting international standards and ensuring ongoing access to fisheries.


Australia's membership of these organisations benefits the industries concerned. The international commodity organisations deliver good industry outcomes, such as trading standards, research on global issues and market statistics. The regional fisheries management organisations facilitate the management of migration restock and high seas stock that are fished by various nations. They inform international fisheries management stock assessments. And what ought to be noted at this juncture is the recently-announced position for those fish under Commonwealth management in this country, that we no longer have any that are subject to overfishing. That is a great fillip for that industry and a great example of this R&D in practical application.


In 2014-15 the budget measure changed the way that the government will fund the membership costs. From 2014-15 the government will cover the costs of the memberships from the matching funding it contributes to relevant RDCs that coordinate research for the industry which benefits most from the membership. The membership costs will be recovered by either deducting an equivalent amount from the matching funding paid to RDCs or by requiring the relevant RDC to pay the Commonwealth an amount equal to the membership fee. The Department of Agriculture will continue to be responsible for Australia's membership of the relevant organisations and for the payment of membership fees.


The bill amends the act with respect to the Sugar Research and Development Services Act 2013, the Australian Grape and Wine Authority Act 2013 to allow the government to recover the costs of membership fees. Currently, the Australian government is a member of four international commodity organisations relating to the sugar, wine, grain and cotton industries and six regional fisheries management organisations. The organisations and RDCs from which membership fees will be recovered will be specified by a new legislative instrument.


The rural R&D legislation currently contains different requirements for the preparation and tabling of certain corporate documents. Some acts require RDCs to produce certain corporate documents and, in some cases, to table them in the parliament. For consistency across industry owned RDCs the government has decided that tabling requirements are an unnecessary administrative burden for the RDCs and for the government and therefore they will be removed.


The following legislation is amended to remove tabling requirements: the Dairy Produce Act 1986—I am sure the dairy producers of Barker will be pleased to hear that; the Forestry Marketing and Research and Development Services Act 2007—and with such a significant forest industry in my electorate, centred around the south-east, again, they will be pleased to hear that, and I should take this opportunity to mention the establishment for the first time in this place of the Parliamentary Friends of Forestry and Forest Products; the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997—again, highly relevant to the electors of Barker, given the amount of meat and livestock that we produce; and the Sugar Research and Development Services Act 2013. The RDCs will still be required to produce the relevant documents and, where required, make them publicly available.


The PIRD Act requires the minister to organise an annual coordination meeting for the chairs of the statutory RDCs. Only five of the 15 RDCs are statutory bodies and the government has decided, as I have said previously, other coordinated mechanisms to be more appropriate.


I indicated at the beginning of my contribution that Australia has relied upon the agricultural and farming sectors to provide for her prosperity. We know that this will continue to be the case for many decades. The changes brought about by this legislation will help to sustain our competitive edge in the agricultural sector into the future. I commend the bill to the House.

"Chesters, Lisa, MP",ALP,2014-10-27,"



Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (16:33):  This Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 is an interesting one. I say that because it comes at a time when this government is cutting so much money from research and development. It is cutting funding from the CSIRO of $146.8 million, which will cost about 500 jobs; it is cutting $11 million in appropriate funding for the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation; and there is an $80 million reduction to the Cooperative Research Centres Program. This is at the same time as there is a radical overhaul going on of our universities, where we will see funding cuts to our regional universities.


So it strikes me as odd that they would stand up here and say that the government is a champion of regional research and development when, in fact, it is a bit of a smokescreen: 'Here is a small amount of funding, whilst we cut over here to the left and over here to the right and radically restructure universities.'


The member for Indi raised this issue in her contribution to this debate around the effects of funding cuts to our regional universities. It is pretty hard to have the scientists that you need for regional and rural development and research if you do not have university students. I wanted to start my contribution on the effects that this government will have on higher education when it comes to science, industry and the regions.


We are concerned—regional MPs—particularly those on this side of the House, about the government's effects on science and on ag in our part of the world. We have already had the Melbourne university close its agricultural campus, Dookie, and it is now running agriculture from its campus in the inner city of Melbourne. It is pretty hard to be actively involved in the grassroots of your industry if you are in the city at an inner city based campus. Sure, you can jump on a train—if it runs on time—and get out to the ag areas. But one of the real strengths of having a strong, grassroots-driven, research, innovation and development sector is if the science, the study and the expertise are occurring in the very communities where the industry is based. And yet we are seeing the very opposite occur as this government pushes to deregulate the university sector—as they start to talk about deregulating fees, which will only see an increase in fees for the vast majority on campus and as they promote how good the scholarship fund will be for regional students so that they can go to a Melbourne or city based university.


What they are not talking about is the negative impact this reform will have on agricultural studies and on science studies. The member for Indi has already told us that there is a shortfall of at least 4,000 skilled professionals that we require in the regions. This is an issue that comes up over and over again in the roundtables and discussions that I have with the industries in my electorate. I come from quite a big regional producing area, central Victoria. Bendigo city itself has become a hub for our region, whether it is people in agriculture doing their finances and their banking in our area or whether it is the head offices of organisations such as the Victorian Farmers Federation, which now has an office in Bendigo. Bendigo is definitely a hub for the regional agricultural sector. Locally it is one of our biggest employers. There are more people involved in agriculture and food manufacturing now than there are in heavy manufacturing in my electorate. The big employers in my electorate are Hazeldene's, Tip Top Bakeries and KR Castlemaine. We also have a number of people who work in Hy-Line Australia and in B&B Basil.


I mention Hy-Line and B&B Basil because they are two agricultural businesses that could benefit from this particular fund. The story of B&B Basil is one of those great innovative regional success stories. They produce the microherbs or the garnishes that you have on your dinner plate. So successful has their business been that they are now exporting their microherbs overseas. They have talked to me about the need for greater assistance when it comes to Austrade, not so much in the way of R&D but the need for Austrade to support developing markets for their products. They have basically done it on their own, with the help of other local manufacturers. Where R&D has been important in their organisation is to develop the equipment that they need to grow their microherbs. As you can imagine, it is not your average planter that is required to grow microherbs; it is quite a small container that is required. So they have also needed quite a bit of innovation when it comes to the equipment on their property.


Hy-Line is an interesting business. Most may not realise what it actually does or that it is based in Bendigo. It is the largest specialist supplier of day-old chicks for the poultry industry. In fact, 70 per cent of our hens that lay eggs have come from this facility based in Bendigo. For more than 50 years, Hy-Line has provided the Australian poultry industry with the livestock that they need to lay eggs. They talk to me about the importance of biosecurity—which is another debate for another day—and they also talk to me about the need for R&D. More importantly, they talk to me about another area where this government has failed them, and that is having the infrastructure and the technology that they need to be able to continue to manage their business effectively. They talk to me about the need for a decent NBN and the need to be able to monitor the climate conditions of their facilities via a closed-circuit network. But, because they do not have a fast-speed broadband network, with the upload that they require, they struggle to do that. 


It is another area where this government is letting regional and agribusinesses down. When I talk to young farmers, they have the apps ready to go for how to monitor their livestock. They are innovating in science, yet they cannot connect properly because this government is dragging its feet when it comes to vital infrastructure. It is another example of how this bill is designed to be a great big smokescreen, to pretend that this government is doing something when it comes to research and development and innovation in agriculture. Yet there are so many other areas where this government is failing.


There are a number of niche businesses in the electorate of Bendigo: wineries, bakeries, coffee roasters, olive oil processors, honey producers and craft beer producers. These are all boutique niche industries that are developing product and getting it ready for market. All of these businesses struggle with their own issues when it comes to export. Their issues include not being able to get past the red tape at the other end when it comes to New York or China, say. They want to see this government investing more in Austrade being able to resolve some of those issues. One particular winery do not want to import wine into New York; they just want to send the wine to a taster, and those tasting notes will be how they then onsell their product into Hong Kong and other parts of Asia. So they do not actually want to sell the product; they just want to get it to the taster so that his tasting notes will then help them market their business. To date, they have struggled to have somebody help them resolve the receiving end in New York. These are some of the challenges that people in my electorate talk to me about that they face in the agricultural industry.


This bill talks about research and development corporations. These were created by Labor in the late eighties to undertake scientific research for the benefit of Australian rural industries that would flow on to the community and the nation more broadly. The government would put half the amount, matching dollar for dollar, into R&D if the industry levy was able to come up with the funds—a co-funding model. Labor will fight to protect the original model we had when it comes to R&D, and the reason is the acknowledgement on this side that government does have a role in creating industry. As other speakers have said, within this particular co-funding arrangement there needs to be, as the NFF have called for, some form of sunset clause so that we can continue to come back to assess whether this is the right model.


Labor's R&D model is working with industry. It is not telling industry what to do but facilitating and encouraging partnership. Labor's model brought together the universities, brought together the skills, brought together the industry and brought together the government, brought together the CSIRO and brought together other organisations to help create product, to help create the innovation.


There is another area that this government is failing when it comes to this particular sector. Constantly the government stands up and says: agriculture is the future industry for jobs, we will be the food bowl of Asia and we will help feed Asia, which, in turn, will create exports and that, in turn, will create jobs. But I ask the government: who will actually work these jobs? Because there is a growing problem in our agricultural sector. A lot of the work that it is being created, a lot of the jobs are going to people who are not just on 457 visas but to people who are international students working in ag businesses on 416 visas or 417 visas, which are holiday working visas. We are not just talking about one or two; we are talking about organised workforces being brought into Australia to do these food production jobs.


In my own electorate, there are what we call boners at Hazeldene's. Hazeldene's is a company that employs about 800 people directly. But what we often do not hear is that they also employ about 200 contractors. These workers are on Thai holiday work visas. They come over here specifically for these jobs. So before these jobs are being advertised locally, there are Thai people brought to Australia specifically for these jobs. They are employed as contractors and are paid per kilo for boning chicken. That is the kind of job that we are creating at the moment in the agricultural sector. We are not creating high skilled jobs. We are not creating jobs where Australians will get first go at them.


The jobs being created in the ag sector are actually jobs going to imported labour that undercuts local labour. There is no way you can be an Australia and be employed in Hazeldene's and paid to bone chickens by the kilo. To be employed as an Australian in Hazeldene's, you are not a contractor; you are on the union based EBA and you are paid by the hour. We are creating this competition in our agricultural workplaces. Again, it is quite easy for these companies like Hazeldene's to say it is because there is no skilled workforce locally.


We have heard, yes, it is true when it comes to the high-tech, high end jobs—because we are struggling—to get universities through the funding cuts to ensure that we have the skilled workforce. But at the lower end, when it comes to the unskilled jobs, there are people willing to work; they are just not be given the opportunity.


As I said, this bill cuts funding to research and development specifically in the rural research and development area. There are $80 million in reductions to the cooperative research centres; $164.8 million in cuts to the CSIRO, which will cost about 5,000 jobs. There are more are more examples about how this government is willing to hide behind the smokescreen of this legislation but not talk about the real challenges that are going on in agriculture. The current funding cuts, the challenges with the workforce and not hiring locals and the challenges when it comes to the NBN and making sure that these businesses have the infrastructure that they need are the issues that this government is not talking about.

"O'Dowd, Ken, MP",Nats,2014-10-27,"



Mr O'DOWD
 (Flynn) (16:49):  I am pleased to rise in the House today to speak on the Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. The bill implements the 2014 budget measure and reduces unnecessary regulation imposed on the rural, research and development corporations and on the Commonwealth combined. The bill directly affects only those relevant RDCs. The budget measure allows the government to deduct the cost of membership fees to the international amounts paid by the Commonwealth to the relevant RDCs. Australia will continue to be a member of the organisations for which it currently holds membership and the Commonwealth will continue to be responsible for membership and for the payment of the membership fees.


The bill only changes the way that the cost of membership fees are paid by the Commonwealth. Additional measures remove the requirement for the Minister for Agriculture to organise an annual coordination meeting for the chairs of the statutory RDCs and remove the requirement for some RDCs to table documents to parliament such as funding an agreement, the annual reports and other compliance reports. The RDCs will still be required to produce those documents where required but they will still have to make them publicly available. The essence of the bill is to cut down red tape and to pump more money into R&D for our rural people.


As in my and all other rural electorates, the farmers of our nation do deserve backup and it is our government that is prepared to give them that backup. They play important roles in the whole real economy. There is an old saying: if the rural guys are not doing any good, you can rest assured that the rural towns are not doing any good either. Our farmers are some of the most productive in the world. They have a very good image and the products they produce are clean and green. That is recognised by the Asian markets and it is a credit to what our farmers do. But they do need support, they do need to be profitable and they do need to be competitive. It is a changing world that we live in and there are changes in our agricultural world. I can see that with our government initiative here, pooled with private investment and farming investment, we can go forward at the right pace that will take us into the years ahead.


The retailers and distributors of some of our farm products do seem to skim some of the lion's share of the profit. For instance, if you buy a kilogram of rump steak in a butcher's shop on the Gold Coast, you might pay something between $20 and $25 a kilogram. I know, and you know, that the beef producer may get $1.25 or $2.25 at the most; it depends whether you are talking live or dead weight.


Government supports research and development. It is essential that the industry, the farmers and the universities work together on this. That is why the government maintains its membership of the international commodity and regional fisheries management organisations. We still have to keep our leg in the industry and have skin in the game as a partnership with our fishermen, forestry workers and agricultural people in general. Whether it is in relation to grain, sugar, cotton or macadamia nuts, we all need to be up-to-date with the modern technology. I believe this $100 million that we are pumping into the industry will go a long way in keeping us on top of the market.


The International Cotton Advisory Committee sponsors research into cotton production methods and directly benefits farmers in the Central Highlands and Dawson and Callide valleys in my electorate. This will not stop. This will continue, and we can only expect better crops in the future.


Some of the biggest drawbacks in rural and regional areas are the lack of NBN services, as the previous member mentioned, and the lack of phone services. Marketing one's product in rural and regional areas is getting harder and harder. I recall the 2PH farms in Emerald telling me that they use daylight hours to pick their product and prepare their product for market and they use the night-time hours to market their products all over the world. You need a very good NBN system to do that, to keep up-to-date with the rest of the world and to keep communicating and promoting your products. It will be a godsend when the NBN gets to our rural and regional areas; for them, 2018 will not come quick enough. That is the date when our minister has said that we will have good service to most of Australia—and we are talking in the high 90 per cents. That should be encouraging, but 2018 is a fair way away. It is good to see the minister is concentrating on the rural areas first—the sooner the better—to get people up-to-date with their communications.


Through our membership of these organisations we will ensure that our local fishing industry is fairly represented when decisions are made regarding management of their own fishing grounds. In Australia—and especially in Queensland, which I can speak about—the wild catch per square kilometre is nine kilograms. Why do we want to lock up more of the Coral Sea reef? I see it as foolish. There is no fish in Queensland waters that is endangered, but we keep on putting hurdles in front of our fishermen. The fact is that we import something like 80 per cent of our fish products and I think that is a shame. It is the same with our pig products—we import something like 80 per cent of our pig products.


A farmer said to me: 'Ken, you are talking about dams. I really applaud you for that. I think it is a great move. But don't forget there's a lot of farmers out there who could build their own dams, on their own properties, with their own money—and put them in the right place, so that they could benefit themselves on their own agricultural farms—but we are just burdened with regulations and red tape. Hopefully one day you can get rid of that so we can then go ahead and build our own dams without one cent of government money.'


There are some farmers out there who have done very well. Some have got into organic farming. These guys who have done that—and I know there is a cost to them to do it—benefit by about $400 to $500 a beast when they send the organic cows to market. These are the type of innovative people we have out there, and I think we should be using their skills as best we can. Hopefully, pumping this $100 million into the industry and cutting back on red tape will only benefit the real people who we need to develop our nation further and further into the future.


We have a population of nine billion planned for about 2050. These people will all have to be fed. I would like to see farm margins increased so we can get to a point where farmers and agricultural people can afford to employ people again. At the moment there is no outside help, no outside labour, because they cannot afford to pay the wages. The commodity prices are not good enough for these farmers to develop and improve their businesses. There is a lot of work to be done on the properties. They just need labour that they can afford. I do not believe in child labour or slave labour, but farmers need the right commodity prices without mark-ups in the retail industry. The price you pay for a kilogram of rump steak compared with what the farmer gets: there is the margin that you could use to afford to pay wages. That is not happening. That is something I hope to promote as long as I am in parliament. With that, I commend the bill to the House.

Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (17:00):  I rise to speak many times in this place, but I must send the last speaker an application form for our party because he is obviously in the wrong party, given all the things he has just said. He will get into terrible trouble when the bosses hear about what he said today. For his information, the closure of the fishing industry occurred under the Liberal Party not the Labor Party. On the budget cutbacks—I am a great admirer of frugality and I like to think that my years in the state cabinet in Queensland were marked by very strong, frugal eyes. There was no profligacy in spending. It was very cost-effective where we put the money. So I applaud the government for striving to cutback government expenditure, but it can become quite ridiculous when we go chasing $7 million over three years. We are wasting the time of the parliament on $7 million over three years on a budget of $450,000 million. Just how petty has this become? 


I think it needs to be said and resaid and resaid. I am holding here a wonderful article from Professor Denniss on Bob Menzies and budgets. According to the current government, Swan's deficit of 3.3 per cent of GDP in his final year in office was a 'disaster', a 'budget crisis'. That is how the current government described Mr Swan's deficit. It turns out that Mr Menzies in his last year had a budget deficit much higher than that recorded by the ALP. So by the current government's yardstick, Mr Menzies was a shocker, worse than the Labor Party. 


When we talk about budgets, the world record for deficits was held by the government that I was part of, the old Country Party Bjelke-Petersen government. I would say we must have had the biggest budget deficit in human history because on an income of about $3,000 million, we borrowed $3½ thousand million over two years just to build a railway line, a port and a power station. The point of this very brilliant article by Professor Denniss is if you spend $5,000 million—and this is not what he says but what I say—like the Queensland government is doing, building another tunnel in Brisbane, then what you do is burden the people of Brisbane with, according to their Treasury, one-seventh for maintenance and upkeep. So of $5,000 million, you would burden the people of Brisbane with a $700 million weight upon their back—not my figures, Queensland Treasury figures. It says when you build an asset, you must allow one-seventh for amortisation, maintenance et cetera. I think that is not a bad figure, actually. 


What happens when we do this—to quote my son, the state member for Mount Isa—what do we get for $5,000 million? A few thousand people get home a few minutes earlier to watch the television. That is what we get for the $5,000 million. If on the other hand that money was spent, as we spent it in the old Country/National Party government, on a railway line into the Galilee Basin and the coalfields then, I estimate, within five years you would generate $1,000 million a year in, if not profit, most certainly operating surplus. That is what we did in Queensland. We ran these massive deficits, but the money was not spent on self-indulgence. The money was not spent on a more agreeable lifestyle and cutting the time to get to and from work. The money was spent on creating real wealth continuously.


Let me go back to the tunnel example because it is very relevant to this Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. This bill says we should get the people to put the money into research; the government is not going to put the money into this area any more. Rather than the state government in Queensland committing $5,000 million of resources to build another tunnel, it could spend $3½ thousand million building a railway line into the Galilee Basin, where half of this nation's coal assets lie, and create 20,000 jobs for the next 100 years at least. You tell me what is the best use of that money, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is not a matter of budget deficits or budget surpluses; it is a matter of what you spend the money on. The Queensland government is spending $5,000 million on another tunnel. It would appear to me that per capita Brisbane already has twice as many tunnels as anywhere other city in the world. If that money was spent on a railway line, we would create 20,000 jobs in a state where jobs are vanishing at the speed of the sun going down in the afternoon—universal collapse of the economy Queensland.


Let me turn to bill specifically. Geraldine Maguire is president of the Malanda Chamber of Commerce, a once great milk producing area which was slaughtered by government deregulation by the LNP and ALP. Geraldine is being very positive. They are putting forward an Australian agricultural precinct concept where there will be a great emphasis on innovation—they will create an innovation hub. She is drawing upon the strengths we have in this area because in the lower tablelands per capita we have more PhDs than anywhere else in Australia. Unfortunate and sadly the reason for that is governments have progressively, in the time that I have been in parliament, cut back on all scientific research. I think there were 20-odd people working in the CSIRO arboreal research centre in Atherton. I doubt whether there would be six working there now. Keera research station was the biggest research station in northern Australia and employed about 32 people under Mick Nasser. There is no Keera research station now. When I became member for Kennedy we had about 126 scientists working full time, mostly in the area of agriculture and agricultural processing. I doubt whether we would have 30 now. I think the figure is about 26. All of that accumulated handed-down knowledge is gone. 


I will give you one example of what this means. There are over six million hectares of heavy infestation of the mid-western Gulf Country by prickly acacia tree. Written across the map—it is 25 years old now—it says, 'The best natural grasslands in Australia.' Sadly, they are not grasslands at all; they have this terrible weed, pest, whatever you want to call it, the acacia nilotica tree. All of the accumulated research over 20 years is in the pest and weed research station in Charters Towers, which has virtually been cut in half by the current Queensland government. All of that accumulated knowledge and wisdom has simply vanished. So instead of moving forward we are moving backwards. 


One of the saddest things in Australia is that CSIRO say you have to be more related to the marketplace—the free market philosophy and ideology. I do not know that we would have any science much on earth if past governments throughout the world for the last 2,000 years went on that policy. Galileo was on the payroll of the Medici family. Unless money is coming in from powerful people and government and they have banking resources available to them, then science simply cannot move forward. 


Let me go back to the CSIRO example. Our little party believes that we need an extra $2,000 million a year put into science and some of that needs to be earmarked for CSIRO. It is one of the great institutions on earth. CSIRO came up with the mix amitosis virus which wiped out the rabbit plague in Australia. I could quote 100 other examples of brilliant internationally renowned work done by CSIRO but the sad thing now is that the Murray-Darling commission wanted these people to come up with a report that would say, 'Oh, terrible, terrible, what's going on in the Murray-Darling. We've got to do something about it.' So CSIRO came up with figures that were 300 per cent different than the Murray-Darling Basin. I do not know; the Murray-Darling Basin may have been wrong and CSIRO right, but there was a 300 per cent difference. 


In ethanol they were paid effectively by the greenhouse gas emissions office of the federal government to do a number on ethanol and they remain responsible for the only report on earth that I know of which says that carbon dioxide increases if you use ethanol instead of petrol. Every country on earth now has ethanol except for African countries and Australia. China, India, half of Indonesia, Thailand, all have moved to biofuels, ethanol. All the north Americas, Canada, Mexico, the United States, all of the South American countries with the exception of Venezuela of course—an oil producing country—and all of Europe have signed up to 15 per cent. Everyone one of them has done it on the basis of a report saying that it dramatically reduces CO2 and other volatile and dangerous emissions. Basically, ethanol is introduced to stop people from dying from motor vehicles but all harmful emissions are reduced dramatically by ethanol, which is pure alcohol and gives a magnificent burn, which overcomes most of the problems with gas emissions. But to see CSIRO, this great and renowned institution, prostituted to the extent where it will produce an article which says the exact opposite of the truth is unfortunate. Their argument was that they were given parameters by the greenhouse gas emissions office and they had to work within those parameters. Well actually they had to come up with a report saying that they had increases CO2 emissions. The point I am trying to make here is that we do need research. Sometimes it is wasted. Academics get a little bit carried away and go into peculiar areas but they have to be given some latitude and they must be given independence.


On the same issue, one of the major bodies involved is the Sugar Research and Development Corporation. It has been rejigged in such a way that the millers have effective control now instead of the farmers. You say, 'What does that mean?' It means that they are going to breed new varieties. We have to breed ever-newer varieties of sugar cane and a variety that will suit the mill will be one that goes for a longer period yielding sugar content, whereas the cane farmer would like a greater sugar content in a shorter period when he would like to see the milling take place, but it is very much to their detriment that this is taking place.

"Pitt, Keith, MP",Nats,2014-10-27,"



Mr PITT
 (Hinkler) (17:15):  I rise to speak on the Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. Agriculture is vital to my electorate and the Wide Bay region more broadly, so let me read, for the benefit of the House, some of the data contained in the 2014 ABARES report for Wide Bay. About 15 per cent of all people employed in the Queensland agriculture, forestry and fishing sector are based in Wide Bay; the sector employs about 8,500 people locally, representing about eight per cent of the region's total workforce. In addition, about 2,700 people are employed locally in food product manufacturing. In 2011-12 the gross value of agricultural production in Wide Bay was $949 million, or nine per cent of total agricultural production in Queensland. Of that $949 million, fruit contributed 22 per cent, or $207 million, and vegetables contributed 17 per cent, or $166 million. Sugar cane accounted for 14 per cent, or $128 million. The region is home to about 4,620 farms, or 16 per cent of all farm businesses in Queensland. I am a former cane farmer. My father and brothers continue to operate a substantial cane harvesting business. Agriculture and family farming are a part of me, and always will be.


The Australian government supports rural industries in a variety of ways, including grants programs. Since coming to government, the coalition has signed free trade agreements with Japan and South Korea—two of our largest trading partners. My region has endured two major floods in three years and is now in the midst of a drought. Would you believe it? Two floods and now a drought! With exorbitant electricity prices and ongoing price pressure from the supermarket duopoly, growers are locked in an uphill battle. That is why I am pleased to be part of a government that consults and not one that makes ad hoc decisions, like Labor's overnight suspension of live export trade. We are committed to restoring some stability to the sector, to improve productivity and farm gate returns.


Last week Minister for Agriculture, Barnaby Joyce, released the government's green paper as another step forward to developing an agriculture competitiveness white paper. The green paper draws on feedback from real people, people on the ground, people who have shared their experience and opinion on a wide variety of agricultural issues. The taskforce held hearings in Bundaberg earlier this year, and I would encourage Hinkler constituents to comment again on the green paper, to share their ideas for opportunities and solutions. The green paper represents a range of possible policy options that now need further consideration and prioritisation.


Support is also currently being provided to the sector through 15 rural research and development corporations. During the 2013 election campaign the then coalition opposition committed to provide an additional $100 million to these rural research and development corporations when in government. This is aimed at improving Australia's capacity to deliver cutting edge technology, continuing applied research focussed on collaborative innovation and increasing the appeal of Australian commodities to potential markets. The boost is on top of the $250 million already provided each year as matching funding and more than $450 million in levies collected from industry. To keep our rural industries engaged on the world stage, the government is a member of international commodity and regional fisheries management organisations. This bill changes the way the government pays its membership of these organisations. Membership fees will now come directly from the budgets of our 15 rural research and development corporations. This will save the government about $7 million over the next four years.


Agricultural research and development operates in a global system and, as such, must take international issues into account. The same can be said for trade. If we expect to be able to sell our produce overseas, we must also be willing to accept their exports when it is safe to do so. Australia is a member of the World Trade Organisation and, as such, import risk analysis must be based on science and free of political interference. The Department of Agriculture recently announced it will lift a ban to allow imports of fresh ginger from Fiji to Australia. Fiji has exported fresh ginger to New Zealand and to the United States for years, but Australian growers were understandably concerned about the threat posed by pests and diseases—things like burrowing nematode and yam scale.


There are 49 ginger growers in Australia who produce around 8,000 tonnes a year, worth about $35 million. Having met with Australian Ginger Growers Association chairman, Anthony Rehbein, on numerous occasions, I publicly urged the federal Department of Agriculture to adhere to the strictest possible import standards when inspecting fresh ginger from Fiji. The department assured growers and the public that it had very stringent measures in place to ensure biosecurity risks are reduced to the lowest level possible. The department said it could review import conditions in light of new scientific information.


The association intercepted five boxes of ginger at Sydney Markets in one of the first consignments from Fiji and asked the Queensland Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to inspect them. DAFF said the ginger was generally very clean but of poor condition. They found scale, traces of soil and foreign vegetable matter such as nut grass. There were also sunken lesions present, which could be indicative of burrowing nematode or fungal invasion. There were also a considerable number of rhizomes affected by root-knot nematode. There is now a dispute between ginger growers, the association, state and federal biosecurity officers, scientists and departmental bureaucrats as to whether similar pests already exist in Australia; how deep each of these bug varieties burrow; which variety is more invasive; and whether methyl bromide fumigation can disinfect ginger rhizome of both external and internal feeding parasites.


But the point that growers and the association are now making—and it seems to me to be a valid one—is that on page 2 of the import risk assessment it states:


… consignments must be free of live insects, disease symptoms, trash, contaminant seeds, soil and other debris on arrival in Australia.


Should it matter whether some of the parasites already exist in Australia? Should the testing carried out by DAFF and the research gathered by the association be considered new scientific information? The risk is this: we may find ourselves in the future in the same situation as the Northern Territory, which, from recent reports, now has an outbreak of cucumber green mottle mosaic virus. This will absolutely decimate the melon industry in the Northern Territory. This virus in other countries produces 50 per cent losses in the field—50 per cent!


This is an industry in the Northern Territory that is worth $50 million to their economy and it is something that is transmitted by sea. I note the contribution of the member for Capricornia about the pineapple industry, which is worth $80 million a year to Australia. There are 80 growers and they have year-on-year growth, but they have real issues with the potential for a disease which makes pineapples in the field explode. Can you imagine walking through a field of exploding pineapples?


As I said earlier, the import risk assessments must be free of political interference. It is incumbent upon the federal Department of Agriculture and Australia's biosecurity officers to ensure our crops and farmers are protected, because I sure as hell hope we do not see a repeat of what is happening in the Top End. Agriculture is vital to our national economy, our regional economy, and of course the people in my community in my electorate. Their livelihoods depend on the vigilance of these officers. It is absolutely vital that it be protected.


I encourage Australians to support their local farmers by buying Australian produce as the first choice and, of course, especially ginger.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2014-10-27,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (17:23):  We have heard a lot in this chamber today about changing the meaning of things when it comes to agriculture. Yes, we have changed the meaning. We have elevated agriculture to one of the main pillars of the Australian economy. We have made it something which is supported by sound policy, valued for what it does for people and nurtured so it receives the investment to make it not just survive but thrive into the future. The Minister for Agriculture and member for New England has changed the meaning of agriculture from a forlorn, forgotten portfolio under Labor, to being a meaningful, vibrant and, hopefully, highly profitable sector under the Liberal-National government. That is the meaning the agriculture minister has changed.


For Labor to come in here and try to score cheap political points this afternoon with anything, absolutely anything to do with agriculture after its six years—six years—of woeful neglect for this vital portfolio area shows contempt, sheer contempt, for those who work the land.


We have given agriculture real meaning and real purpose. We did not put it on the skids as Labor did by stopping live exports; by abandoning irrigators; and by imposing a carbon tax which had such a disastrous effect on farms and farmers and which Labor, if ever re-elected, will introduce quicker than you can utter the words 'there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead' or quicker than the shadow agricultural minister, the member for Hunter, could say 'Barnaby Joyce'. The opposition agricultural spokesman is fixated by the minister. He really is. He talks about him more than he talks about anything else. 


The Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 will reduce the regulatory burden and reporting requirements for research and development corporations, enabling them to be more productive—more productive—and focus directly on agricultural innovation, ensuring Australian agriculture remains a global leader.


The government through this year's budget put forward responsible measures necessary to repair Labor's budget mess and ensure the Commonwealth lives within its means. We are getting on with the important work across the board, addressing budgetary challenges which we face today and preparing for the future. Unlike Labor, this government has an extensive agenda for regional Australia and our focus is on supporting Australian agriculture to remain profitable, productive and competitive, and on building for the future. As has been previously mentioned, this is a modest budget measure which will provide savings of about $7 million over four years.


The coalition has a plan to build a strong, prosperous economy and a safe, secure Australia. Only the Abbott-Truss coalition government has an economic action strategy which will grow the economy and fix Labor's debt and deficit disaster. Labor's legacy to Australia is 200,000 more unemployed, many of those in rural and regional areas. Gross debt is projected to rise to $667 billion if we sit here and do nothing about it and $123 billion in cumulative deficits. 


Agriculture is at the heart of the Riverina in my electorate. It is one of the most productive and diverse agricultural regions in the country, giving rise to our claim as one of the significant food bowls of Australia. We grow just about everything in the Riverina. There are large-scale producers of wheat, canola, citrus, apples, beef, dairy, oil seeds, wool, barley, vegetables, sheep, lamb, wine grapes, cotton, hay, poultry and cherries. You name it, we grow it. These are the many fine products which generate income and stimulate our local economies. Food production is serious business in the Murrumbidgee and Coleambally irrigation areas. The MIA contributes more $2½ billion annually to the Australian economy and, for argument's sake, Riverina rice producers grow 52 per cent of the total value of the New South Wales rice harvest, which has a farm gate value of around $300 million a year according to the June 2013 ABARES report.


In grains research, I was pleased to see the announcement of the Minister for Agriculture and the New South Wales Minister for Primary Industries, Katrina Hodgkinson, just last month which provides $10.8 million—serious money—for grains research and development in New South Wales. This will transpose to the creation of 18 new research offices—there is that word 'research', so important in all of this—in key cropping locations across the state, including in Wagga Wagga and Yanco in my electorate. Given agriculture's importance to the region, there is much research and development which is undertaken in our region to ensure our product remains efficient and competitive in changing local, national and international markets.


In my electorate, Charles Sturt University is a leader in agriculture research and development. The EH Graham Centre for Agricultural Innovation, which is named after a long serving member for Wagga Wagga, Eddie Graham—you might be interested, Deputy Speaker Mitchell; he was actually from your side of politics and a good man, too, who was also the New South Wales Minister for Primary Industries for a long time—excels in agriculture research and innovation. Currently, its multidisciplinary and integrated research covers climate change and the need to make sure that we use minimum water and get maximum production; water availability; adapting to increasing input costs; biosecurity threats; capacity crisis and succession planning; and risk management and adaption to change. The Graham centre undertakes extensive undergraduate and postgraduate research, with several students currently undertaking PhD research at the state of the art facilities.


In this year's budget, the Minister for Agriculture confirmed the government is honouring its commitment to provide $100 million in new funding for rural research and development, specifically to support continued innovation in agriculture, and that is extremely good. That is extremely needed. 


This government understands that, while we need to target our spending wisely and not waste a cent, we also need to continue to invest in the productivity and profitability of Australian agriculture. There is a strong link between research and development and agricultural productivity growth as a key driver of industry and farm gate profitability. We hear all the time how farmers need to increase their farm gate profitability.


The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resources Economics and Sciences estimates that, for each dollar the government invests in agricultural research and development, farmers generate $12 within 10 years. So they turn a dollar to $12 within a decade—that is tremendous; that is putting food and fibre on the plates and the backs of Australians and others.


By allocating substantial additional funding to agricultural research and development, we, the coalition, are demonstrating the important role rural and regional industries will play into the future in a tight fiscal and budgetary environment. We understand on this side that there are challenges ahead. We understand that climate variability is going to play an important part in the future for farmers but we also understand their worth and that we need to help them as much as is humanly possible by this parliament.


We continue to see evidence that this government holds our agricultural sector in high regard by delivering on our 2013 election commitment by developing a white paper on Australia's agricultural competitiveness—I know I am using a prop, but it is important that people see this great little booklet, because it is going to, hopefully, help transform our agricultural industries.


Through the initial green paper process, almost 700 submissions were received, demonstrating that Australians recognise the potential development and opportunities in agriculture and primary production. I went to the forum held in Griffith in the MIA and I listened to the passion of the people who made verbal submissions—and many of them written submissions—to that particular inquiry. Through this process, further ideas about deregulation and reducing regulatory burden on farmers is also being considered to ensure we increase our competiveness, increase our farm gate profitability and ensure we lift the shackles from small business and primary producers.


Australian agriculture has a great future and huge potential, if we can continue to build on our current foundations and ensure that we get the policy setting right for the future. Through investment in research and development, the dams taskforce and the agricultural competitiveness white paper, we are ensuring that we are taking the opportunities before us. We recognise that agricultural and primary production has a critical role to play in ensuring we grow productivity and get our economy back on track.


The member for Watson continues to demonise and disparage farmers. He should know better; he was after all the 28th Minister for Agriculture, the 10th from Labor, of this great farming nation. Last Monday, after question time, the member asked the Speaker a series of questions, during which he spoke of disruptive conduct in the public galleries of the House of Representatives. 


He talked of anticlimate change groups and farmers. Maybe it is just an inconvenient truth for the member, but he ignored mentioning the noisy mob who cheered on 12 October 2011 when the carbon tax was brought into law —remember that awkward embrace between Julia Gillard and the man whose prime ministership she took, Kevin Rudd. And whilst they did not make it into the gallery—they all but did—who could forget the Canberra riot of 19 August 1996 when out-of-control trade unionists, the ones who bankroll Labor, kicked down the doors of Parliament House, ransacked the gift shop, damaged property and attacked police officers? Around 90 people were injured that day, and it was lucky someone wasn't killed. Why didn't the member for Watson pick on those thugs instead of criticising farmers, which he does at every opportunity?


The member for Watson was Minister for Agriculture from 2007 to 2010, during which time—on 23 June 2008—the single wheat desk was dismantled. Riverina farmers are still cursing him for that. He was the water minister, amongst other things, when the greenies threatened to impose a permanent man-made drought on irrigators. Thank goodness the Abbott Government, since coming to office, has capped water buyback.


What has the member for Watson got against farmers? Farmers—the ones who sustain this nation; let's never forget: irrigation feeds the nation. Farmers—who work damn hard, a lot harder than the member for Watson, me and everyone else elected to this place, let me tell you, in order to eke out a tough life in trying conditions. Farmers—who deserve to be praised over and over, again and again for the job they do growing food for Australians and other hungry nations besides. Farmers—who do not get a say as to what someone will pay for their produce, because they are price takers not price makers. Farmers—who, if and when they do have a problem with Canberra, voice their protest in a meaningful yet peaceful way, not with some violent smash and grab. Farmers—those true environmentalists, carers of the land, custodians of our proud heritage, and protectors of our productive rivers for the future. 



Farmers—the ones not understood by those opposite such as the member for Grayndler who just last month, 24 September to be precise, wrote in The Guardian:


But don't hold your breath waiting for urban policy leadership from the current Commonwealth government. Tony Abbott has no interest in policies affecting productivity in cities, even though they produce 80% of our nation's gross domestic product—


80 per cent of our GDP. 


I would question that figure. It might be 80 per cent, if you take all the mining wealth, the agricultural wealth, value add to it, export it out of the metropolitan ports and then claim that it is some sort of urban product, urban generated wealth creator. I would argue that it should be the other way round: it is the regions such as those in the member for Lyne's electorate, the member for Hasluck's electorate and the Riverina, which are producing the food and fibre which is boosting our GDP; helping our balance of payments; helping drive our exports; and helping generate wealth for this nation.


Farmers are the backbone of Australia and it is high time that those opposite just sometimes recognised that. As the son of a farmer, I can proudly declare they always were the backbone of the nation and always will be. They are the group overlooked by those opposite and to whom the member for Watson, I believe, owes an apology.


I commend this bill. I commend the work that the coalition government is doing on R&D. Only today the coalition-led committee produced their report on food labelling, which is something that our side talked about in opposition. Now in government we are getting on and doing something about it. It is absolutely critical that we have correct food labels so that people can make a discerning choice when they go to the supermarkets and be sure that the product they are buying is accurate and, if they want to buy Australian made, actually made in Australia. 


The R&D being done by our side of politics, by the government, is getting on with the job of helping to boost farmers and helping to boost that great group of individuals: men and women, those who left school at an early age and those who have really high tertiary qualifications. They come in all spectrums. But they are the ones who we should be admiring. They are the ones who we should be applauding at every single opportunity. They are the ones that this parliament owes a debt of gratitude to. They are the ones who do not deserve to be—as they continually are—criticised, rebuffed and rejected by those opposite.


We are getting on with the job of making sure that the farmers of this nation know that they cared for, know that we have concern for them and know that we—as Liberals and Nationals—understand that the job that they do for the nation is helping to grow the food and the fibre that is going to help continue make this nation even greater than it already is.

"Gillespie, David, MP",Nats,2014-10-27,"



Dr GILLESPIE
 (Lyne) (17:38):  The Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 is a very important piece of legislation for a very important sector of our economy. The extent of research and the impact of the rural development corporations is profound. There are five statutory bodies run by the government and 10 industry led bodies, whether it be the Cotton Research and Development Corporation, the Grains Research and Development Corporation, the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, the Grape and Wine Authority or the industry-led bodies, such as Sugar Research, Forest and Wood Products Australia, Dairy Australia, Australian Wool Innovation, Meat and Livestock Australia and the Australian Egg Corporation. All of these bodies are doing an essential task for the good functioning and the growth and development of Australia's primary industries.


As the member for Riverina just alluded to, a lot of people focus on gross domestic product being centred around the metropolitan centres; but I remind this House that it is wealth creation that builds the capital that is then circulating in the GDP. A lot of our gross national product is all onshore. Some of the essentials of wealth creation are missed when you look at GDP figures. It is more of a reflection of turnover. An economy is great if you have got a bigger GDP. But somewhere along the line the nation has to produce wealth. It starts with our primary industries, whether it is agriculture in this instance or in the mining industry, where it starts with bit of dirt and mine it for a mineral. It is the same with agriculture. It is making wealth and support for the nation out of the land.


I have the utmost respect for people in the rural industries because basically we have the best and the most efficient farmers, graziers and croppers in the world. The amount of production that we put out this country is enough to feed 60 or 80 million people. That is way in excess of what we need in this country and it is in one of the harshest climates in the world. There have been two studies showing the benefit of investing in research and development in the rural space. The first one was in 2008 and the second one was in 2010. They confirmed that for every one dollar put into research, you get a five-year return of $2.36. The 10-year return is $5.56 for every one dollar you put in. For the 25-year return—depending on which study, although they were both very similar—one was $11 for every one dollar invested and the other came out as $10.52 for every dollar invested. It is a fairly robust analysis.


That is why there is such good value in us investing in research, particularly in this space where we have a competitive advantage over the rest the world. Doing the research and the development in the agricultural space will help us maintain that; because for every commodity in the world that we sell, there is someone elsewhere in the world trying to sell it. All our commodities are subject to world commodity prices so we if can be more efficient and get 10 per cent more protein out of an animal or get crop yields are 10 or 15 per cent, that is a bottom-line improvement for our farmers and graziers. It means the farm-gate price that they are likely to get is so much better if we have got good product.


This extensive network of rural research capacity was set up in 1989. They are funded by statutory levies, which are matched by Commonwealth funds up to a capped amount for appropriate research activities. The cap is based on the relevant industries' gross value of production. The Fisheries Research and Development Corporation receives contributions from the Northern Territory and the states. No doubt, you all appreciate that some of the fishing goes on within the states' sphere of influence, way out to our national fishing borders. This act will modify some of the workings of this complex set of research and development processes. It will affect the Primary Industries Research and Development Act, the Sugar Research and Development Services Act and Australian Grape and Wine Authority Act—just to name a few—so that the government which pays the fees for all the international bodies and similar peak bodies and advisory bodies around the world are paid for by the Commonwealth government. This legislation will allow the government to recoup those fees from the relevant development corporations.


That seems harsh, but all these changes in finances are predicated on us because we are committed to getting the budget back under control. We inherited such fiscal mess that we have had to make these hard decisions. The fees that are payable are considerable and every portfolio has to do its part. There are changes across all levels of government, whether it is social security, health or rural research and development. Some of these fees—in the Fisheries RDC, for instance—are almost a million dollars a year. Sugar research is $160,000; the Grape and Wine Authority is $110,000; the Grains RDC, $150,000; cotton, $95,000. 


Because we are an island nation and our fisheries surround us, we have to keep track of what is going on with other fishery bodies—for information about fish stocks and so on. Most of the fish we catch migrate around the great oceans of the world. If our responsible authorities are not in tune with the Pacific Island nations and what they are doing with their fisheries—and with what is going on in the Indian Ocean and in the Great Southern Ocean—our fisheries will suffer. We have to be hooked into them. Whilst we are doing a good job of minimising our harvest rate so that we have sustainable fish stocks, if our neighbour nations and states do not apply similar restraint, our fisheries will eventually suffer. That is why it is so important that there are so many fisheries organisations.


Unfortunately, we in the government have to fund all this research and we have been put in the red by the previous government. That is why we are taking responsible, measured steps to help, at least with this portfolio, bring things back into the black. Not only are we funding these statutory bodies, as I have outlined, those amounts are matched dollar for dollar by the industries—or, rather, the government matches the money the industry bodies raise. All up, along with our research-for-profit initiative, which includes another hundred million dollars, there is $250 million a year being spent on rural research and development. Twelve days ago the minister announced the R&D-for-profit program, which is putting $100 million out there for all 15 of these research and development corporations. Whether they are industry owned and run or statutory organisations, they will be competing for these funds. It is a competitive process. The people with the best hypothesis or business case will be the beneficiaries of it. Again, all this research over time leads to better product and better returns for the growers and producers—and better take-home pay for the individual.


What we need is a secure, long-term funding set-up. This is a minor change, making the rural research and development organisations pay for their memberships in their associated international bodies. In addition, we are trying to reduce some of the cost burdens and the regulations that these organisations face. Regulations always have a financial impact, no matter what industry you are in. We have modified the requirements for these statutory bodies to table reports every year—saving them that cost. They still have to keep their papers in order, but there is a financial cost to preparing these reports. Some of them cost up to hundreds of thousands of dollars to produce, publish and table. In a way, we are saving them, on a recurrent basis, quite a lot of money—in a cumulative sense.


Another thing mandated by the existing legislation—which this legislation will amend—is the requirement for coordination meetings. What do we want? Do we want to have meetings for meetings' sake or do we want these R&D corporations to go out there and do research and development? I would much rather have the RDCs spending all their energies organising research and marketing for their industries than having endless meetings—coming here to Canberra and getting on the merry-go-round of meetings. I am sure there are better ways to coordinate research than to have yet another meeting in Canberra. These are well-staffed and well-credentialled bodies and I am sure they know how to coordinate their research.


My electorate produces up to a quarter of the state's milk. Whether you are a dairy farmer on the Comboyne Plateau, down in the Manning Valley or in the Lorne Valley, you would be reassured to know that Dairy Australia, in this instance, is doing research and developing marketing that will help you on your farm. A quarter of the state's milk from one reasonably small geographic area—that is incredibly productive. But it is incredibly productive because 10, 20 and 30 years ago there was extensive research that helped generate the productivity our farmers now demonstrate. There is a herd of 750 on one farm up on the Comboyne Plateau. That is a huge undertaking. There are 350 on another farm up there. There are similar herds down in the Manning Valley—all highly productive undertakings with cutting-edge technology. 


If you were to walk onto one of those farms, it would be easy, with a superficial look, to say, 'That's easy—you just get them out there and milk them.' But vast amounts of research have gone into generating the productivity increases that have been achieved over the last two or three generations. There have been improvements in genetics, cross-breeding, fodder development, fertilisation regimes and irrigation—all of these together having an overall cumulative impact on productivity, whether in the abattoir at Wingham, the processing plant at Wauchope or on one of the many beef properties in my electorate. The research that has led to the genetic improvements has taken place over generations. It has been undertaken by the CSIRO, by Meat and Livestock Australia and by other bodies before them—decades of research into making our production of meat and livestock more efficient. In the Wingham area for instance, the abattoir is the single biggest employer. It is those efficiency improvements that give them good product to export to Korea, to Japan and to Hong Kong. That is why they are able to employ that many people. My colleague the member for Cowper relies on the same industry—he has a branch of that processing plant up in his electorate. 


The ramifications of supporting R&D in the rural research space are extensive. It increases profitability, and not just for those businesses—Wauchope township relies on a lot of the small scale and larger scale producers coming into town and shopping at the co-op. There are several agricultural suppliers there. In the Manning, the biggest industry outside the health industry is the dairy industry. It is the shining light of productivity. They have had to be so efficient because they have had to deal with low commodity prices in the daily fresh milk market which, as we all know, has been subject to some very difficult trading conditions.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2014-10-27,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Government Whip) (17:53):  I think I am the only member of this place who is a dairy farmer and so I bring a particularly direct focus to this debate on the Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill. I was disappointed to hear some of the comments from those opposite earlier in this debate, particularly given that for six years I sat in this place and, as a farmer, felt like I was a poor relation in the debate on policies and issues. Unfortunately, the comments we hear now demonstrate great hypocrisy. In bringing my contribution to the table today, as a farmer and as a levy payer, I want to talk about some of the reasons behind this—because, unfortunately, what we see is selective memory by those opposite.


All of us on this side would dearly love to have those conditions that Labor inherited when they came into government. As we all know, we left $20 billion in surpluses and $50 billion in savings—what an opportunity for the government of the day. Is that what we inherited? Clearly, the answer is no. I remind people, because sometimes we forget—we get so used to hearing the numbers—why it is that we need tough decisions. We had $191 billion in deficits left by Labor. If we did not make any changes, there would be a further $667 billion in gross debt, another $123 billion in further cumulative deficits ahead, and $1 billion in interest every single month. That equates to $30 million a day. That is $1.4 million an hour. Each speaker here has spoken for about 15 minutes, and in that time, thanks to Labor, we are borrowing another $340,000 to service the interest on the debt. That $12 billion a year in interest that is currently flowing out the doors could be going to any one of a number of very much needed programs and portfolio areas, not least the agricultural sector. Some of those opposite have suggested that $12 billion is not an issue—but $12 billion is more than the aged care budget. It is more than we spend on universities. If we do not make any changes and continue just to spend, as Labor would do, it would end up at being $2.8 billion a month in interest. In my view, that is obscene. As the IMF said, our spending under Labor was on the highest trajectory in the OECD. That is what we came into government facing—not $20 billion in surpluses and $50 billion in savings. Tough decisions are necessary.


The other issue that I wanted to talk about is the absolute lack of respect that I saw on the opposite side for our primary production sector. We saw that manifest itself in practical terms, as if this industry was an expendable one. That is exactly what, unfortunately, I have heard in the debate today—it is lip-service and is still seen, clearly, as an expendable industry. The Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill will make amendments to the Primary Industries Research and Development Act, which controls the research and development. It gives effect to some of the 2014-15 budget measures, and I have explained why they are necessary. It will allow the government to recover the cost of membership fees of international commodity organisations and regional fisheries management organisations from the matching amounts paid to rural research and develop and corporations. The bill also makes a number of additional amendments to the governance of R&D corporations. 


I want to talk about some of what is happening in my electorate and why R&D is so important. In my part of the world we have the dairy industry, the beef industry, horticulture, viticulture, vegetables—everything down to olive oils, and even the forestry sector and the fisheries sector. We have a very good irrigation scheme run as a cooperative by farmers—one that those at the time at a state government level thought was bound to fail. There is a wonderful saying—where water flows, food grows. It certainly does, and that cooperative of farmers has done an amazing job. It is a multi-award-winning organisation. In my part of the world there is much said about the efficiency of farmers. I am of the very strong belief that, in the environment that has existed since 2000, in the south-west of Western Australia if you were not among the most efficient farmers in not only in Australia but the world you simply would not have been in business.


They are the efficiencies required in Australia to compete with countries when we export, when there are tariffs, when there are subsidies, when there are non-tariff barriers and all of the above. Our farmers have to compete in that environment—and compete they do. They produce some of the best food and fibre anywhere in the world. In my sector, the dairy industry, Western Australia produces some of the highest quality milk not only in Australia but in the world. As we have heard previously, our farmers operate in one of the harshest climates that you will find anywhere in the world. Australia is, I think next to Antarctica, the driest continent in the world. This is the environment in which our farmers operate, and they are very, very efficient at it. 


The bill also makes some additional amendments to the governance of R&D. It removes the requirement for the minister to organise an annual coordination meeting for the chairs and it also removes some parliamentary tabling requirements. These are just further efficiencies. There are currently 15 R&D corporations, five statutory Rural Research and Development Corporations governed by the Primary Industries Research and Development Act. Ten of these are industry owned rural research and development corporations created from former statutory rural research and development corporations and, at the request of the relevant industry, most of them are able to undertake marketing activities in addition to their R&D. Also, most of them are primarily funded by statutory levies on primary production or products. These are the producers—us; the people just like me in the south-west of Western Australia. We are funding ourselves and directly investing in research and development and, by extension, investing in not just our own future and the future of the communities that rely on us but also Australia's future. 


I note that the productivity growth—and, again, this is an area where we have seen and continue to see a lack of respect—in the farm sector has outpaced the rest of the economy. I wonder how many people not just in this place but in the rest of Australia actually grasp that fact, actually understand just how well our people on the land right are doing their job. Productivity growth in the farm sector has outpaced the rest of the economy. Right now, in my part of the world, it is hay season. There are a whole lot of farmers out there on tractors, mowing, tethering, raking and baling hay. They just get on with their job—like a lot of small businesses in this country. They work in their business, they have got their heart and soul in their business and they do what they do very, very well. 


As I said, we had the Brunswick Show this last weekend—one of the biggest regional shows in Australia—and we saw a wonderful display of beef cattle, dairy produce, trade displays and machinery dealers. We cannot underestimate how important these shows are not only in bringing everybody together but also for the small businesses that keep our rural and regional communities operating and vibrant. These are the people who actually contribute to fundraising events in local communities, to football clubs and to other local community service organisations. Often it is the farmer's gear that is used for the local fire brigade or to help out to level a particular piece of ground. It is often the farmers who are called on for their common sense and expertise. Frequently, it is their tractor or truck or some other of their gear that is needed to be used. It is farmers and primary producers who provide this. 


In Western Australian, Western Dairy uses some of the R&D funds for practical on-farm work. This is the sort of R&D that makes a difference on the ground. This is what we want to see and this is what our farmers need. To stay ahead in the environment in which they find themselves, they need research, innovation and practical outcomes. This is basically the edge that Australia has got, along with our biosecurity. We really need to protect our biosecurity and our clean and green image. With R&D—by constantly innovating and by constantly being efficient—we can stay ahead of the rest of the world in this sector. You do not outpace the rest of the economy, as the farming sector has done, without very effective R&D. In recent times some of that has eased slightly, but this is an industry that is constantly looking to innovate. 


The other side of it is that most farmers in Australia are part of Landcare groups or Natural Resource Management groups. This is not just because they want to be efficient environmentally; they also want to manage their properties well. They know that there will be another group of farmers who will need to produce food and fibre on it, and so they are looking to manage their properties in a way that allows that capacity to stay with the land. This is another thing that is often overlooked in the debate about what farmers bring to the table. It is not just the economic multipliers but also the environmental management that they are very, very good at. As a member of the environment committee, I remember another member of parliament saying to me, 'I'm surprised to see you here.' I said, 'Why is that?' She said, 'Well, you're a farmer.' I said, 'Yes.' And she said, 'Well, you're an environmental vandal.' I said, 'Well, that's really an interesting comment. Are you aware that the majority of farmers are part of Landcare and Natural Resource Management groups?' 


We live on rain water on my property. I do not know how many other people do that. If we are talking about managing resources and making the most of recycling and others measures, then we do that. We live on rain water. We grow a lot of our own vegetables and fruit. Of course, we have our own milk and, at times, eat our own beef. So when we talk about who is having an impact and how—and that is besides how well we manage or pastures or how well we manage our irrigation—there is a lot of misinformation out there about the contribution that farmers make across a range of areas of our economy. R&D is important to such management. We on this side have committed an extra $100 million to R&D, on top of the $250 million already committed, which will start next year. This is a critical to our primary producing sector being able to not only stay competitive but also continue to innovate and change 


The number of farmers, who are constantly looking for information the best way they can, want to receive it on their farm while they are doing the job—while they are in the tractor. They want to get on with their job; they want the information they need; and they want to be the best at what they do. That is why I support the measures contained in this bill. Equally, we need some understanding of the reasons the government keeps having to make tough decisions, and those tough decisions are brought about by the lack of financial management by the previous Labor government. It is unfortunately a habit that we see repeated frequently in this place.

"Cobb, John, MP",Nats,2014-10-27,"



Mr JOHN COBB
 (Calare) (18:07):  It gives me pleasure to rise to speak on the Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. R&D has been huge for agriculture over the years and it is something we are committed to. We stand by that commitment with an extra $100 million, despite the state of the budget and what we inherited. It shows how important we all believe rural R&D is.


It is not so long ago that the previous government not only did not want to increase R&D, but actually wanted to cut it by some 50 per cent of government contribution. I always recall the words of the recently deceased Prime Minister of Great Britain, Margaret Thatcher: 'Socialism's quite a good thing until you run out of other people's money to spend.' When the previous government did realise they spent a little too much and were having to borrow so much, one of their first targets was agricultural R&D. Their way of doing that was to hold a Productivity Commission inquiry into the R&D that was run by the various corporations and contributed to on a dollar-for-dollar basis by Australian agriculture. The Productivity Commission, being an arm of Treasury and an arm of government in that particular case, was happy to suggest that they were spending too much. It was only because we warned them of what was going on that agriculture and the various industry bodies got up and embarrassed the government from cutting their matching funding of 50 per cent. I was rather proud of our industry and ourselves in that instance in achieving that. The current Manager of Opposition Business was the minister at the time; he and his successors backed off on that one, but they certainly had no intention of supporting or increasing the R&D budget, even though their own Productivity Commission acknowledged just how good agricultural R&D was and the benefit the taxpayer got from it.


Australian farmers are very innovative and very adaptable. I have always thought of agriculture as being in groups. There is corporate agriculture, which I am a fan of and I will come back to say why. There is what I call family corporate, which is a family big enough to have economies of scale, with a family farm where the family is totally focused on running that farm. Then there are those who have off-farm income and who go along quite happily because they are getting enough money off-farm and so they do not need to get every dollar out of that farm. The ones under most pressure are the ordinary family farmers who are not big enough to achieve economies of scale—both partners are full-time farmers.


I add the word 'innovation' to R&D. All four levels of R&D are extraordinarily important. Unfortunately since about 2000 the gains that R&D have historically made for Australian agriculture have levelled out, particularly in the decade since then. Having said that, R&D is not just about increased productivity; it has to be about profitability. There is absolutely no point in producing more if you are not making any more. I have always said: 'Everything we have to do for agriculture revolves around profitability. Agriculture is not a charity; it is here to ensure that Australia has the best quality food in the world, and by and large that is true, but if you can't make a quid you're not in the game.' The No. 1 job of R&D is to increase profitability. It goes without saying that that will also include productivity and quality production. As the member for Forrest said, our image around the world of how we produce and what we produce is probably the biggest selling point of trade for us that exists.


I also want to say that there is another side to this that R&D can help with too—and that is the health aspect of food. R&D needs to look very hard at things like grains without gluten. The health thing is very big these days, but I am not talking organic here. I am afraid that, if the whole world went organic, the whole world's population would shrink considerably. If people want to work in the niche market of organics, good luck to them. I am talking about the health aspects that R&D can look at to increase the profile of agriculture but, more than this, to increase the profitability and the reliability of Australian agriculture.


There is one thing that is so important here with R&D. The extra money demands cooperation amongst the various bodies. I mean cooperation in not just how this money is spent between an R&D corporation and manufacturers or processors, as indeed it must—and that is why I mentioned the word 'innovation' as well—between them and industry bodies, as indeed it must, or between them and other private R&D bodies, as indeed it must; I mean cooperation between the different R&D corporations themselves. I think that is incredibly important.


The Productivity Commission report that the member for Watson, as the minister, called for stated that our bodies do not cooperate enough. For example, the various plant R&D corporations and the various animal R&D corporations should be working much more closely whether they want to or not. It is a fact that the industry bodies and the growers are all for total cooperation between the various bodies. In fact, they can see nothing but gain with it, and common-sense says that there is nothing but gain with it. It is not always true to say that those corporations—




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  We want to have a division before—




Mr JOHN COBB:
  Come on, I have still got six minutes. Stop panicking. The various corporations must learn to cooperate better. I believe it is the government's job to make sure that they do.


I have been involved with this for a long time. I think it is quite obvious—and I am no scientist and never intended nor wanted to be—that common-sense says that the genetics that are inherit within plants and animals means that if you do not cooperate you are going to miss out. I understand why some scientists want their name up there. If you do the work, you deserve to have it that way.


While the shadow minister is talking down there, I will say that I am sure that if he had been the minister he would not have wanted to knock $100 million out of the government's contribution of matching funds, but his predecessor certainly did want to do that. I am not going to go on any longer except to say that this $100 million means an awful lot. It better be used wisely and cooperatively. Historically broadacre has done enormous things. As I said, it has levelled out a lot in increasing productivity and the like. Horticulture today can probably make greater advances quicker with genetic work than broadacre can because it is so much more controllable and it lends itself naturally to laboratory work. Whether it is horticulture or broadacre, we need this R&D and we need the cooperation. The government must make sure it happens.

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",Nats,2014-10-27,"



Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper—Deputy Leader of the House and Assistant Minister for Employment) (18:18):  I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. As with many National Party members, I have a strong agricultural constituency that contributes to the productive capacity of Australia and the national wealth of Australia. In my electorate the blueberry industry is making a great contribution to wealth and employment. We have seen this industry go from strength to strength. This industry is employing many Australians and many visitors from overseas, who come to this country on a working holiday and find the blueberry industry an excellent source of employment. They are not only contributing to the productive capacity of the country but providing tourism dollars that will be spent in our local economy.


We have seen some great efforts in relation to blueberry production in my electorate. We have seen many hundreds of people employed in production. We have seen the great local cooperative by the name of Oz Berries going from strength to strength. It has achieved blueberry production growth in the order of 20 per cent per year. Not that long ago—I recall it was in the Howard era—Oz Berries secured a grant to assist them with constructing a packing facility. I am pleased to be able to inform the House that before that facility was completed it was already too small to meet the needs of the cooperative. So strong was the growth in production in blueberries that their packing facility had to be extended by the time it was officially opened. The facility has been progressively extended. 


What started off as a private company has been transformed into a cooperative. That cooperative now provides a range of facilities to its members. It provides centralised buying as well as getting goods to market and a whole range of other services. Oz Berries is a credit to our local area. It does great work. It employs many locals and is producing great wealth for our region.


We also have a very large blueberry facility run by the CostaGroup at Corindi. Again they are employing many Australians. They produce high-quality fruit that has an Australia wide and worldwide reputation. They produce not only blueberries; in our local area there has been a move into the production of raspberries, which is also very welcome. It is also a high-value crop. We are seeing very labour-intensive agriculture on those properties enhancing our local wealth.


The Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 amends rural research and development legislation to give effect to a 2014 budget measure and to reduce red tape. The bill implements a 2014 budget measure to change the way that the government pays for its membership of international commodity organisations, including those for wine, grains, sugar and cotton. These organisations provide significant benefits to our producers. The amendments to payment arrangements will also encompass Australia's membership of six regional fisheries management organisations that manage migratory fish species. Our membership ensures regional arrangements are in line with domestic arrangements and secures access for Australian industry. 


The bill amends the Primary Industries Research and Development Act 1989, the Australian Grape and Wine Authority Act 2013 and the Sugar Research and Development Services Act 2013 to allow the government to recover the cost of the memberships from the Commonwealth funding provided to relevant rural research and development corporations. The amendments will result in a saving to government of around $7 million over the next four years. Red tape will be reduced for a number of research and development corporations. This is in line with the government's commitment to reduce red tape. As a government, we think it is vitally important to reduce red tape so that businesses can act and operate more efficiently. The bill removes the requirement to table certain documents in the parliament. This provides consistency across the corporations, with funding contracts and variations no longer needing to be tabled. In the interest of good governance, the corporations will still produce these reports and make them available to the public or to members as required. Also repealed is the need for an annual coordination meeting for the chairs of statutory research and development corporations. Only five of the 15 corporations remain as statutory bodies. As there are other means to coordinate activities, the bill removes the need for a legislated coordination meeting. These are sensible changes in relation to red tape. 


The government is obviously cognisant of the importance of reduced red tape in making business more efficient and more effective. A more efficient business sector can create more jobs. A more efficient business sector can create greater wealth for all Australians. I know that all sectors of Australian business, not only in the field of agriculture, welcome our commitment to the reduction of red tape. We have had oppositions in the past promising time after time to reduce red tape, but when they move from opposition into government they fail to make good on that commitment to reduce red tape. This government has a real commitment to red-tape reduction. This government is reducing red tape in a range of sectors right around the country, and this legislation is just part of that process. They are small changes, admittedly, that are making a difference to business by reducing that burden of red tape and reducing the costs of operating. That is a very important thing: if we can reduce business costs, we will have a more profitable and efficient business sector. The government's red-tape reduction agenda is very much a part of that. As I get around the country and talk to people in business, they are very pleased to see the government's solid commitment to red-tape reduction. They welcome the fact that there is finally progress being made by a government in stripping away those levels of red tape. Red tape creates inefficiency. Red tape creates increased operating costs for businesses, and this government is absolutely committed to reducing that red tape.


Australia's rural industries are innovative and productive, and the government is committed to ensuring their profitability and competitiveness now and into the future. This legislation is part of that commitment, as is our commitment to reducing red tape. We believe that we should be lifting the burden from business. We believe that we should be removing red tape as quickly as possible. We have seen hundreds of millions of dollars saved by business as a result of the government's commitment to red-tape reduction to date. We are having discussions in this session of parliament about the changes to red-tape requirements that are easing the burden on business. It is vitally important that we reduce red tape so that we allow businesses to function more efficiently and more effectively.


In my portfolio area of employment, we have made significant inroads in the reduction of red tape. We have lifted the burden of red tape off employment service providers, allowing them to do what they do best, and that is getting people into a job. When we came to government we inherited an employment services system that was mired in red tape and being prevented from doing what it should be doing. Employment service providers were spending their time filling out forms and complying with government requirements—




Mr Tudge:
  Up to 50 per cent of their time. 




Mr HARTSUYKER:
  Up to 50 per cent of their time. The member for Aston is correct. Some providers were telling me that they were spending up to 50 per cent of their time filling out forms, absolutely mired in red tape. So as we move toward the employment services contract, starting on 1 July 2015, we will have a significant increase in red-tape reductions over and above those red-tape reductions that we have achieved to date. It is a big commitment to red-tape reduction, and we are keeping our promise to the businesses of Australia that we would reduce red tape. That is reflected in reduced operating costs for businesses and increased profitability for businesses and it is also reflected in more jobs. That is what this government is all about. We are all about creating jobs, whether it be in agriculture or whether it be in the services sector, we are about creating jobs.


I will draw my contribution in relation to the Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment bill to a conclusion. This bill, and the changes it makes, fit in well with the government's commitment to reduce red tape and our commitment to agriculture. We are committed to a strong and vibrant agricultural sector, and I commend the bill to the House.

"Parke, Melissa, MP",ALP,2014-10-27,"



Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (21:00):  What I am to say today will likely not be popular in this place or indeed in the wider community. However, there comes a time when the injustices have so mounted up that plain speaking becomes a duty. This year is the UN International Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. However, despite overwhelming support within the international community for a Palestinian state and for an end to the Israeli occupation and settlement building, as well as the blockade of Gaza, there has not been any positive change for Palestinians on the ground. Rather, recent events have left more than 2,000 Palestinians in Gaza dead and thousands more injured, while more than a million Palestinians—who are a proud, educated and enterprising people—are dependent on food aid and there is a massive damage bill to be picked up again by the international community. Meanwhile settlement construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem continues apace, each build putting a further nail in the coffin of the two-state solution.


We know that violence is not the solution. We affirm that the rockets fired from Gaza into Israel are an illegal response to Israel's actions. But it does beg the question: what then is the alternative to the vicious cycle of bloodshed we have witnessed in recent months? What is a legal and justified response to actions by Israel that the international community agrees are illegal? In my view, non-violent means of protest are and must be seen as legitimate. It is notable that both Israel and the US approve of boycotts and sanctions against other states such as Iran and Brunei, so why is it objectionable to boycott a state that is, among other things, committing repeated, grave violations of the Fourth Geneva Convention as Israel does with its illegal settlements?


I now present a petition delivered to me by University of Wollongong academic and former Israel soldier, Dr Marcelo Svirsky, following his completion of a 10-day walk over 300 kilometres from Sydney to Canberra to draw the attention of the House to the plight of the Palestinian people and requesting the government to honour its obligations under international law.




The petition read as follows—



To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives


This petition of citizens and residents of Australia draws to the attention of the House the critical predicament of the Palestinian People in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza under Israeli occupation since 1967 and of the Palestinian citizens of Israel suffering racial discrimination since 1948.


Notwithstanding UN resolutions condemning Israel's policies as illegal, Israel continues violating international law and human rights, expanding its colonies in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, imposing a siege on Gaza, and persisting in apartheid and oppressive actions, policies and legislation towards the Palestinian people under its control.


As a response to the failure of all forms of diplomacy to change Israel's policies, in 2005 the Palestinian Civil Society called upon the world to impose on Israel initiatives of Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) until Israel meets its obligation to end all forms of occupation; dismantles the illegal 'Separation Wall' in the West Bank; ceases the siege on Gaza; implements full equality for its Palestinian citizens; and honours the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties.


WE THEREFORE ASK THE HOUSE to instruct the Australian Government to fully and consistently honour its obligations under international law by excluding relations, through boycott, divestment and sanctions, with states, institutions and companies - Australian, Israeli or other - that are involved in the perpetuation of apartheid and discriminatory Israeli policies including the occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza.


from 701 citizens


Petition received.




Ms PARKE:
  The petition asks the government to exclude relations through boycott, divestment and sanctions with states, institutions and companies that are involved in the perpetuation of discriminatory Israeli policies, including the occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza.


The BDS campaign has received an enormous amount of negative press in Australia, much of which is undeserved. I am not seeking to validate all of the actions that have occurred in the name of BDS, because it can mean different things to different people. However, I do wish to dispel some of the misunderstandings around the official BDS campaign, including that its supporters are anti-Semitic and intent on the destruction of Israel. That is not the case; it is not anti-Semitic to protest injustice. And as noted by Peter Slezak writing in New Matilda:


… BDS is directed against many non-Jewish, non-Israeli companies such as Veolia, 4GS and Caterpillar, which are profiting from the illegal occupation of Palestinian land.


The US organisation Jewish Voice for Peace has observed that 'BDS is a viable democratic and non-violent response to the horrific policies of the state of Israel against Palestinians'.


Richard Falk, Professor of International Law at Princeton and a former UN Special Rapporteur for the Occupied Territories, has said that the 'BDS movement provides a hopeful way of writing the future history of Palestine in the legal and moral language of rights, rather than the bloody deeds of warfare'. Nobel Peace Prize and Sydney Peace Prize recipient Archbishop Desmond Tutu has said:


If we had not struggled so hard in the anti apartheid movement, Nelson Mandela would have died in jail. The Boycott Divestment Sanctions Movement is as important as the anti apartheid struggle. I urge you all to support it.


In July this year 17 European Union countries warned their citizens against engagement in business deals or investing in the illegal Israeli settlements or with bodies connected to them in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. The European warnings described the settlements as 'illegal under international law', warning that 'individuals or companies who engage in any economic deals with them could face legal and financial risks and harm their image'.


As said by Philip Gordon, the White House coordinator for the Middle East, in early July:


How will [Israel] have peace if it is unwilling to delineate a border, end the occupations and allow for Palestinian sovereignty, security, and dignity?


… it cannot maintain military control of another people indefinitely. Doing so is not only wrong but a recipe for resentment and recurring instability.


As I have said on other occasions, the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestinians is a source of distress and frustration for millions of people around the world, especially people from Muslim and Arab countries, and it is a powerful recruitment tool for extremist groups. If we are genuinely concerned about national and global security as well as international justice, we, along with other nations, including the US, should be insisting that Israel do its part to lay the groundwork for peace by, among other things, ending its illegal occupation, settlement construction and the Gaza blockade. Until this happens, BDS is a perfectly acceptable form of protest and I congratulate Dr Marcelo Svirsky for his courageous walk and his brave stand.

Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (10:30):  This week I rise to recognise Bendigo Foodshare. Bendigo Foodshare is essentially our wholesaler for food relief in our region. It takes donations from a number of producers in the region as well as having food arrive on a daily basis from Foodbank Victoria. It provides at least 30 schools and 20 agencies with donated food for food relief. Unfortunately, they are becoming busier and busier. Recently was Anti-Poverty Week, and I took the time to go out and meet with Bendigo Foodshare to hear the stories from the volunteers and to meet with some of the agencies who rely on Bendigo Foodshare.


Anti-Poverty Week recognises that people within all of our communities need our help, and if we come together we can help make their lives a little bit better. It is the role of everybody to help play a role in reducing poverty. Bendigo Foodshare is an example of this in my electorate. Bendigo Foodshare is a community not-for-profit organisation with a local board and staffed by volunteers. They have only one, part-time paid staff member who ensures the organisation keeps going. The rest is up to the volunteers. They have created links with approximately 30 retailers and food producers in the region, including KR Castlemaine, who produce bacon, and Hazeldene's and PepperGreen Farm. These are some of the many producers who donate excess product to the organisation—individual organisations and businesses coming together to understand that poverty does exist locally and that we all need to play our part in ensuring that we meet this challenge.


Recently Bendigo Foodshare launched an appeal and on their first day raised $36,000. They, like many not-for-profit organisations, require funding to ensure that they continue to meet the needs of the most vulnerable in our community. Bendigo is rallying to ensure that Foodshare does continue to operate; however, they need to raise $100,000 by June next year or wind back operations. Many of the volunteers are concerned about what that would mean for our local agencies. Unfortunately, right now demand for their services continues to increase. But I am sure the board chair, Cathy Steele, and the board members will continue to do a fantastic job and meet this challenge.

Mrs McNAMARA
 (Dobell) (11:01):  I move:


That this House:


(1) notes that the Government is providing practical assistance to small business;


(2) recognises:


(a) the allocation of $8 million in the 2014-15 budget to establish the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman;


(b) that the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman will act as an advocate for small business, cut previous compliance burdens and reduce red-tape;


(c) that the Government has a sustainable strategy in place to cut $1 billion in red tape every year for small business workplaces; and


(d) that on Wednesday 19 March 2014, the Government introduced legislation and tabled documentation to repeal more than 10,000 pieces and over 50,000 pages of legislation and regulations, saving over $700 million in compliance costs across the economy; and


(3) commends the Government for providing real, practical assistance to small business, encouraging productivity in the Australian economy.


This government is providing practical help to assist small business. The coalition has always been a friend and supporter of small business. Our initiatives, including the allocation of $8 million in the 2014-15 federal budget to establish the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, is a positive step to assisting business. The Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman seeks to act as an advocate for small business to cut previous compliance burdens and reduce red tape. We have a positive, sustainable strategy in place to cut $1 billion in red tape every year for our small business workplaces.


I for one commend this government for providing real practical assistance to small business, encouraging productivity in the Australian economy. Australia now has a government that is making life for all small business operators easier, not harder. I firmly believe that small business is the engine room of our economy. It is business that creates job. Small business owners, who put their livelihood on the line to create jobs, deserve support from government. I resolutely believe in creating a stronger economy with more jobs and a stronger small business sector, especially for my electorate of Dobell.


This motion confirms the parliament's support for the measures introduced by this government, which strengthen and enhance prospects for small business owners Australia-wide. This government has provided solid evidence of supporting Australian small businesses, fortified by the allocation of $8 million to establish the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman in this year's budget. The ombudsman delivers on our commitment to create a single entry point for small businesses to obtain information about services and programs available to them.


Through the ombudsman's advocacy, we will see compliance burdens reduced and red tape cut. Many small businesses can get on with the job of attending to their customers, creating local employment opportunities and building a sustainable profession. As part of its key responsibilities, the ombudsman will also be a concierge for dispute resolution and a Commonwealth-wide advocate for small businesses and family enterprises, a contributor to the development of laws and regulations favourable to the needs and requirements of small businesses and a single point through which assistance and information regarding small business can be accessed.


We also have established the Fair Work Ombudsman small business helpline which, as of September, has received over 129,000 calls. With this helpline providing support to small business owners to assist in improving their knowledge and operation of relevant legislation, this essential service provides our small businesses the confidence to grow, invest and create jobs.


Everything this government is doing and has planned for small business is about making every day easier. No-one would argue that business regulation is essential for ensuring the rights of employers, employees and the general public are protected. But business regulation that is inefficient or unnecessary, unfortunately, imposes undue costs on business. When we held this parliament's first ever red-tape repeal day, over 10,000 pieces, and 50,000 pages, of legislation were scrapped and $700 million in compliance costs were reduced. It is worth highlighting that the broader economic benefit will be much greater than this. Such action was deemed necessary because the former Labor government, within six years, introduced more than 21,000 additional regulations. Labor's actions stifled investment and job creation, and burdened small-business operators with excessive compliance costs and requirements.


Without doubt, the most scandalous act of economic vandalism was the introduction of the carbon tax. Thankfully the carbon tax is now gone. The carbon tax was a handbrake on the Australian economy, with Australia's small-businesses bearing the brunt of the impact. We have done what we said we would do. We are providing real assistance to small business. This government remains steadfast in our commitment to reducing red tape in order to drive a stronger economy where small business can thrive.


Small business is the backbone of the Dobell economy. Collectively it is our largest employer. For the 8,939 businesses in Dobell and over 68,000 businesses Australia-wide we will deliver a strong and prosperous economy where business operators have confidence to grow, invest and create jobs. Small businesses in Dobell rely on me, as their federal representative, to ensure that I am doing all that I can to demonstrate my support to their continued and viable presence. By doing so, regions such as the Central Coast will prosper under a stronger economy where everyone can get ahead. This motion acknowledges the practical help provided by the government to small-business workplaces to enhance the productivity of the Australian economy. I commend this motion to the House.

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2014-10-27,"



Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley) (11:06):  In 2013, it was Labor that established the role of, and appointed the first, Australian Small Business Commissioner as a voice for Australian small business. Mr Mark Brennan commenced as the inaugural Australian Small Business Commissioner, bringing to the role a strong track record of achievement in small business, including serving for seven years as the inaugural Victorian Small Business Commissioner.


It was under Labor's small-business policies that for the first time there was a direct voice to the Australian government through the appointment of the Australian Small Business Commissioner. The commissioner's role was as an advocate within the Australian government to represent the interests of Australian small businesses and to work in consultation with key stakeholders, including industry organisations and small business operators, state small-business commissioners and other government agencies, to hear the concerns of small-business people.


Labor supports in principle the government's intention to transition Labor's role of Small Business Commissioner to ombudsman; however, we will consider carefully any draft legislation when we see it. Small business needs an independent advocate or voice to act on its behalf, and we would hope that the government will ensure the independence continues under any proposal brought to this parliament. 


I think it is timely to remind the Minister for Small Business that his discussion paper was released back in April and submissions closed in May. The minister issued a press release in August saying, 'Small businesses will shortly be invited to comment on the draft legislation.' It is now the end of October and we are still waiting to see the draft legislation. It is no secret that this minister has made many promises to small business since becoming minister. Let us see how long it takes for him to keep those promises. Meanwhile, small business is still waiting. 


The first act of the Liberal Minister for Small Business and the Liberal government was to cut billions in tax measures introduced by Labor that delivered real, tangible, practical benefits to small business. For example, the tax loss carry back, which was designed to offset the disproportionate burdens faced by small business, was cut by this minister. It is generally accepted by governments around the world that some features of tax systems are biased against small business. Labor recognised this and we did something about it. That is why we introduced preferential taxation for small business, which would allow it to carry back losses incurred in earlier years of their operation at a time when cash flow is critical to their business. 


The instant asset write-off was another tax assistance measure for small business that was expanded under Labor but was cut by the Liberals—cut by the Liberal Minister for Small Business. I say to the minister, who claims to be the best friend of small business, that there is some difference between what he says and what he does. Taking away help is not helping small business, and small business knows this because it is part of its day-to-day operation. The repeal day is another example of hype and bluster from this government and the small-business minister. If this government was serious about getting rid of red tape then why did it propose that job seekers, for example, were going to have to apply for 40 job applications per month, only to later abandon the bad policy when told by Labor and the business sector that it saddled businesses with more red tape? This Liberal government just does not understand small business. It is all talk, all ideology, but no substance. I did not hear the Minister for Small Business stand up for small business or tell the Prime Minister that this was a bad idea. But, luckily, someone did listen.


The facts are that Labor removed more than 16,000 regulations when we were in government. But the difference between Labor and the Liberals is we did not make a song and dance about it, because it is part of your job—it is part of everyday work—and it should not be a stunt, which is what we are now getting from the Liberals. They want to make a big deal about it but it is just a stunt. The Liberals have made a huge deal of this. It is akin to saying: 'Let's have a ""turn up to work day"". Aren't we great?—we've turned up to work today.' No, that is your job. Do it; do not keep going on about it.


The Liberals' repeal day is a joke and a bad policy. Some of the regulations that were removed under the repeal day as part of the government's work included removing consumer protections in FoFA laws and giving a fresh licence for contractors to cut the wages of cleaners. That is not good. It is not good for small business. It is not good for workers either. You cannot, in the guise of a repeal day to do anything and everything, at the same time remove good regulations that help small business or help workers. Surely removing regulations that are good cannot be good for the economy as well. 


This is a government that is driven by ideology over substance and that takes away practical support for small business. If the government were serious about helping small business it would reverse some of the bad decisions it has already made and would reintroduce some of Labor's very good policies. (Time expired)

"Nikolic, Andrew, MP",LP,2014-10-27,"



Mr NIKOLIC
 (Bass) (11:11):  It gives me much pleasure to second this important motion by the member for Dobell. This is particularly so because her electorate, in the Central Coast region of New South Wales, and mine, in north-east Tasmania, are both strong microcosms of wider small business activity throughout Australia. In both of our seats and across the nation, the reality is that small business and the employment that flows from it hold, in large part, the key to the economic fortunes and futures of those we represent. As the member for Dobell said, it is, quite simply, the engine room of the Australian economy. This reality is made even stronger and perhaps more poignant by the practical linking of family and small business through the establishment of the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman. The ombudsman will be a national advocate for small business and will assist in the development of small-business-friendly laws and regulations. 


It is clear that for too long small business has been relatively unacknowledged. It is the solid, tireless worker of the Australian economy, the quiet achiever always there but with a relatively low public profile. As such, it has been too easy for some in this parliament to take it for granted and to regulate it in ways which hurt or stifle its growth and smooth functioning, as through some of those 21,000 additional regulations that appeared during the Rudd and Gillard governments from 2008 to 2013. These regulations affect not only small business but most other Australians, either directly as small business employers or employees or indirectly as consumers or taxpayers. That is why we are so strongly committed to reducing the red-tape burden facing small business. 


As the Tasmanian representative on the coalition's deregulation committee, I was very pleased to hear the member for Kooyong last week announce that we will remove nearly 1,000 pieces and over 7,200 pages of legislation and regulation as part of our spring repeal day. That follows the more than 10,000 pieces and 50,000 pages of legislation and regulation we removed from the statute books during our autumn repeal day last March. In just over a year, the coalition government has announced more than $2.1 billion in red- and green-tape savings for the business and not-for-profit sectors. This more than doubles our commitment to remove $1 billion in red and green tape from our economy each and every year. In doing so, we are saving small business owners both time and money. 


We are reducing their tax compliance burden with administrative changes to GST and pay-as-you-go reporting. As the Minister for Small Business pointed out last Wednesday, this means that businesses with no GST payable will no longer be required to lodge a business activity statement, which would otherwise only record pay-as-you-go instalments. That saves more than $67 million each year in compliance costs. We want to free up that burden which has long afflicted small business and also to support the creation of a healthy and confident economy and general business sentiment. This is vitally important. In unison, both are conducive to encouraging and fostering the small business spark of sensible and prudent risk-taking, a spark that is all too easily extinguished by ham-fisted government intervention.


Finally, what we are discussing now has a wider and even darker strategic context. After 2008 Australia was indeed fortunate to escape the very worst of the GFC. At the time the current Labor government, perhaps understandably, floundered in their initial response to it but were later much quicker to opportunistically and shamelessly seize credit for saving Australia and to parade themselves as some sort of economic exemplar on the world stage.


More objective pundits were gracious enough to acknowledge that the true foundations of this survival stemmed not from increasing financial handouts to all and sundry but from the creation of a sound economy, the eradication of national debt and the building of a national surplus, which was then available to meet and ameliorate the challenge to Australia and for all Australians. It was a case of conservative foundation building by the Howard government towards a national and enduring strategic financial objective: a truly prosperous Australia. We, the coalition, remain absolutely committed to this goal, which includes this motion and supporting legislation as important milestones on this journey. It therefore gives me much pleasure to support and to second the member for Dobell's motion and to note in closing that its impacts will in no way be confined simply to small business but rather will flow naturally and constructively to the benefit of all Australians.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2014-10-27,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (11:16):  I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this motion because there is no underestimating that micro and small businesses are the engine room of our economy, and they deserve support and recognition from government and from parliament. We need to ensure that we develop the policy environment for them to thrive in. Micro and small businesses employ more than five million Australians, and they contribute almost 50 per cent of private sector employment. Labor is committed to engaging with small businesses and small business groups, and micro businesses and microbusiness groups, right across the country and taking feedback on potential new small business policy ideas.


Members will be aware of my passion for small and micro business, because before entering parliament I ran my own small business for 10 years. Since entering parliament I have established the Parliamentary Friends for Small Business and microbusiness with the member for Herbert—and I just want to do a plug for tomorrow night's Shop Small event. I have also established the Labor for small business group here in Canberra. Also since entering parliament I have spent a great deal of time talking to the small business operators in my electorate of Canberra and advocating for their needs and interests.


Since being elected, I have conducted what I call business walk-arounds, where I go out to the community—usually industrial enclaves in my community in Hume, in Fyshwick, in Phillip, in Woden, in Weston Creek—and I talk to the small and micro businesses about the issues that they are concerned about. Quite often they can be ACT government issues. They can be federal issues. One of the many challenges that small businesses have here is the notion of harmonisation, because Queanbeyan is not very far from the border here. Usually businesses do cross-border activity, so the issue of harmonisation is usually front and centre for a number of businesses in my community.


But the most frequently occurring concern I hear is the concern about Public Service jobs cuts and how the uncertainty this government's budget has placed on Canberra is leading to an economic downturn. According to the Canberra Business Council chief executive, Chris Faulks:


The big issue for the Canberra economy is the ongoing fragility of business and consumer confidence, which impacts on consumer spending and business investment.


While I welcome the allocation of $8 million in the budget to establish the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, which is essentially a transition of a concept we introduced, I would like to see the government take the concerns of micro and small businesses in my electorate seriously. Those opposite say they stand for micro and small businesses, but how does taking the axe to Public Service jobs help small businesses in Canberra? Many Canberra businesses are struggling, and that is a direct result of the government's cuts to the Public Service.


The budget outlined the biggest staff cuts to the public sector since the 1990s. Let me remind you of what happened to Canberra in 1996. The Howard government slashed 15,000 jobs here in Canberra. That meant 15,000 people no longer spending on Canberra's micro and small businesses, buying their products and using their services. Non-business bankruptcies jumped sharply in 1995-96 by 38 per cent and again in 1996-97 by 17 per cent, while business bankruptcies jumped in 1996-97 by 38 per cent.


I was affected too because I lost my job, so I know firsthand the devastation of mass job losses. I recall in 1996 going round to local shopping centres, and they resembled ghost towns. The newsagent had closed. The hairdresser had closed. The video store had closed. The milk bar had closed. They closed because incomes and wage earners simply disappeared. They left town. We had a mass exodus from Canberra as a result of the 15,000 job cuts here in Canberra in 1996.


Labor is serious about small business. It was us that introduced the instant asset write-off threshold. We also introduced the loss carry-back scheme. I know from speaking to micro and small businesses in my community that that was greatly appreciated. It was Labor that commissioned the first national Small Business Commissioner in this country because we knew that micro and small business needed a direct national voice to government.


I know that Canberra businesses are suffering as a result of the mass job cuts here. I know that they are very concerned about what is to come in the future, particularly with MYEFO. I ask those opposite to think about Canberra small businesses when they are introducing these cuts. (Time expired)

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2014-10-27,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Government Whip) (11:21):  I commend the member for Dobell for this private member's motion. She is entirely correct that small business is the engine room of the Australian economy and the heart and soul of employment. It is very easy to say that, but as a small business owner and operator I know it very, very personally. It was on the day that I married my husband that we bought our first dairy and beef property and business. Debt and hard work were synonymous with what we had to do as small business people. I see this right around Australia wherever I go—the amount of commitment that small business people make to be able to engage. They often follow a passion. They follow a dream sometimes, or they are just really commercially focused. There are over two million actively trading businesses in Australia, and almost 96 per cent are small businesses.


I was interested in the comments of the member opposite about decisions made by government. I remember back when the mining tax was announced and, three to four months later, the very first iteration. I remember, when I was out and about in my electorate, the range of businesses from services to suppliers to the mining sector, even right down to the retail sector, who were all directly impacted. Two of those businesses disappeared within six months of that announcement—right down to a fencing contractor, who said the mid-cap miners had put their hands back in their pockets. He said, 'I've got eight people employed, and I've only got two weeks work left.' So the decisions made at this level have a real impact on small business right across Australia and are felt very, very directly.


Of course, we know that small businesses with fewer than 20 employees account for 46 per cent of all Australia's workers in the private sector. Small business is a major employer, offering opportunity to young people in part-time or full-time work. It is often the mums and dads in small business who do this and give young people a go. That means that small business employs 38.5 per cent of all Australian workers. It is why small business is so important to us as a government, and it should be important to everybody in this House—not to just say it. If you live it, if you invest and if you commit, you know that small business is really tough. It involves all of your time, all of your energy, all of your passion—and that does not even guarantee that you are going to stay in business. The commercial focus is required, but often decisions are made that can affect you quite directly.


We have an economic strategy to remove the burdens from business, to make not only those small businesses but the whole nation, because of that, more competitive and to drive more jobs and higher living standards for all Australians, as the member for Dobell has said, especially those in small businesses. The protections that they will actually achieve will be the same as for consumers when it comes to unfair contracts imposed by big businesses: $1.4 million to extend unfair contract relief from consumers to small businesses. Currently only consumers are protected from unfair terms in standard-form contracts. But small businesses have told us that they have also been subject to unfair terms in standard-form contracts, often presented as take it or leave it. Small businesses often have insufficient ability to negotiate changes to contracts.


We also need to increase certainty, confidence and productivity, and that is what is underpinning the $8 million to establish the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman. This is part of our election commitment to establish a one-stop shop for small business. It is really important. If you are in small business, you are so busy working in your business that it is quite often difficult to work your way through all of the issues—all of the compliance—because it is tough to work on your business while you are full-on in your business. It is the small business people who are up at night doing the accounts and keeping up with all of the latest trends and issues—but also keeping up with their compliance. I think this is a very strong issue that we are offering small businesses: the reduction in the red tape burden.


As we heard, 21,000 new or changed regulations were having an impact. The number of businesses who literally said: 'Look. I am drowning under the weight of this. It is taking me away from my customers and from what I am actually here to do as a small business.' I think this is going to make a major difference to small business. We are committed to removing that burden. I commend the member for Dobell for this particular private member's motion.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2014-10-27,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (11:26):  Good on you, Member for Dobell! Good on you for bringing this resolution! Not only do I commend this resolution, because it gives effect to what Labor did, but I am going to make a recommendation for the very first order of business for this small business ombudsman: to investigate the deceptive and misleading conduct of the Abbott government.


You say all the time you are in favour of small business, but reality never matches the words. It is like watching an Oprah show. The coalition are ringing their handkerchiefs telling us how much they love small business. They are the best people. We are their best friends. They do fantastic things for the economy, and we are going to be there to help them. And what is the first thing they do when they get into office? They stop a whole range of measures—billions taken away from small business: instant asset tax write-off; accelerated deduction for motor vehicles, which gave small businesses a boost in their cash flow; and also the further cash flow measure we brought in that allows for carry back of tax losses. All these things are affected by those opposite—the ones who are telling us in their words how much they are a friend of small business, but in their deeds are hurting every small business in the country.


And how many did they rip off? In taking the axe to assistance for small business from the abolition of the asset write-off, that is $3 billion. Billions wiped off. But that is not the worst. That is not the worst of what they did. The worst is that they made it retrospective. They made it retrospective. If these people ever confronted us doing that when we were in government, we would have an uproar. They have done something that retrospectively takes and disables the ability of small business to claim those measures. They have not only ripped it out of the future, they have ripped it out now, when businesses have counted on that benefit. Gone—by them. Why does your small business ombudsman not investigate that deceptive and misleading conduct? There are a whole stack of things you are doing now that you never said you were going to do before the election. You never had the guts to tell these people—the people to whom you say, 'We are your best friend'—that you are going to rip these billions off them retrospectively.


I have 9,000 small businesses in my electorate and I am proud to represent them. They are all having a crack. A lot of them hardly employ people at all. There they are working the long hours and we are here telling them what they will have the ability to write off—for example, a small cafe's refrigerator display that busts, as I have seen and I have heard from businesses in my area. Instead of them having to rely on their premiums or taking a hit on their cash flow, we were able to help them. We provided them with that assistance; you took it away from them. All you give us are your Oprah moments, the moments when you put hands on hearts and tell us you are such great friends of small business—but you are not there backing them up at all.


Then you talk about the mining tax. We had the member for Forrest in here before talking about all the small businesses affected. Tell me: what happens, when you literally chase General Motors out of the country? The auto components industry, made up of all these small businesses, is gone, wiped out—50,000 employees, all these small businesses. I have never, ever heard a Liberal or National party member come in here and talk about what impact that decision had on small businesses—all gone, all affected by your decisions. In the other instance, for example, in the tech sector, you went around the country saying for ages that you would fix the employee share ownership program. We started the process of pushing the review to Treasury. You then went around the country claiming that you would fix it. You have been in office for more than a year, making all these suggestions about how you would fix it, and you have finally got to it now? 


What about crowdfunding? Again, we started the process—




Mr Williams:
  You stuffed it up years ago.




Mr HUSIC:
  We stuffed up crowdfunding? We stuffed up something that just came in? That is pretty impressive! Thanks for that, Member for Hindmarsh! You go back to sleep, and I will go back to telling the facts that people deserve in this debate. In the regulatory framework for crowdfunding, people want to get access to capital to help their start-ups. Again, in the report handed up in May, the Minister for Small Business said he is a big fan of it—and what do we see? Nothing. Nothing but delay. Nothing but words. Whenever it comes to deeds, there is a failure to actually follow through. This is the legacy of those opposite. They tell us hand-on-heart that they are in favour of small business, but they never, ever deliver.

Mr WILLIAMS
 (Hindmarsh) (11:31):  We do have a couple of things in common, Member for Chifley, including the good Arnott's workers in the Arnott's factories. But, in terms of the Trade Practices Act, I think he got a bit carried away on 'misleading and deceptive conduct'. I would rather hear him talk about the utility bill increases for his 9,000 small businesses, the red tape and all those things that really matter. He tended to gloss over that, if he even mentioned it.


We are doing what small businesses want; we are reducing taxes for small businesses. Company tax is going down, the compliance burden is being reduced and, importantly, the carbon tax is gone. If there was one thing that small businesses always mentioned when we talked to them in the electorate, it was the higher utility bills, the higher electricity prices. We are helping them on that important front.


But our agenda for small business is far broader than that. As we have heard from the member for Dobell and other speakers on the coalition side, it focuses on the effectiveness of government engagement with small business, including the ombudsman, but also on encouraging start-ups. Again, this is where the member for Chifley was a bit misleading, making out that Labor were all for start-ups and entrepreneurialism when they were the ones that actually changed the employee share ownership scheme. We are the ones that are putting it back on the agenda. We are encouraging entrepreneurial behaviour because we need more entrepreneurs and more successful businessmen creating growth, creating jobs and creating wealth for our economy so that we can fund the necessary services like health, education and other social services going forward.


For the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, as we have heard, there is $8 million over four years, which is a significant commitment to this advocate for small businesses and family enterprises—those family businesses that are so important to our society and to our economy. My wife runs an allied health practice with a number of others, and we know from speaking to other hardworking families that run their own businesses that they put their households on the line week in, week out to help their own family business and to help other employees associated with the companies. This ombudsman will contribute to laws and regulations that are friendly to small businesses and will help them—a concierge, if you like, for dispute resolution.


We have also talked about a number of other things, like small business access to contracts. So often, small businesses say it is hard to get access to government contracts. We are making it easier. That is why we are providing almost $3 million for small businesses to do business with government. They want access. They want the opportunity. They want a better playing field.


Whether it be export market development grants worth $15 million over four years, we need more exporters. We need people to look internationally, to go beyond our borders, to go into Asia, where there is the growing middle class, and also other areas around the world to do more with exporting the fine goods and services we produce in Australia.


Tourism is another good or service where there are a growing number of Chinese in particular who are coming out and looking for the great products that Australia has to offer. There is $43 million over four years for the tourism infrastructure grants program because these are some of the growth areas: tourism, food and wine. There are many great wines from my own state of South Australia as well as from others. There are not too many in Queensland, but you have great tourism there. I know the member for Ryan is a passionate advocate for tourism and, importantly, has a very significant background in tourism.


It was actually pleasing to hear the member for Canberra speak about her background in small business, because we do not often hear that from the opposition's side, whereas on our side small business runs through our blood and a better business environment is part of our DNA.


We have talked about red tape and compliance a bit and will hear more about that in the House this week. We know we have a lot of work to do, but we are making significant inroads. There are now over $2.1 billion in red tape reduction—a great achievement, some real runs on the board in this significant area to make it easier for small businesses to reduce their compliance costs, reduce the time they are filling out form and get on with doing what they do best: serving their customers those fine goods and services.


We have a range of endorsements from third parties, whether it be Gail Kelly of Westpac, the Brotherhood of St Laurence or Universities Australia. They all appreciate that this red tape reduction is so important for their members and a better functioning economy.

Ms O'NEIL
 (Hotham) (11:37):  I was very keen to participate in the debate today because I was hoping that it might actually shed some light on this much-announced policy of the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman. The reason I hoped to be enlightened was that, looking into this matter and reading up on it as I have done, it looked very suspiciously like the Australian Small Business Commissioner with a new name. I am somewhat disappointed to find through the debate today that there is actually not much more to it than that. There is some minor broadening of responsibilities beyond what the commissioner had. These will be positive moves, I have no doubt about that, but it is not exactly the coalition setting the world on fire. Fundamentally, what we are doing today is spending an hour of the House's time commending the coalition on changing the name from commissioner to ombudsman. If there is any symbol of the approach the coalition takes to small business, it is the idea of slogans without much substance. It is all talk and no real action.


The debate today does give me some opportunity to talk about an alternative approach, and that is the one that Labor took while we were in government. I think it is fair to say that when we talk about slogans or substance we fall very much on the side of substance and are not so concerned with all the rhetoric in the debate from the other side of the House. We are concerned about making real changes that will really impact on people who run small businesses in Australia.


I note at this point that we have had on all sides effusive statements of how important small businesses are to Australia, and there is no way that we can really overstate that. There are two million small businesses around the country. More than five million Australians are employed in these organisations. When we look at how much our economy has changed in the last generation or so in Australia, this enormous growth in the number of small businesses is such a good example It is one of the pillars of the changed economy. I say that because, when we look at two million small businesses in Australia, what I see is evidence of inventiveness, of creativity, of ordinary Australians who have a great idea and say, 'We're going to take a risk on this.' That is exactly what we want the economy in Australia to look like. That is exactly what will take us forward into this next century.



An honourable member:  Hear, Hear!




Ms O'NEIL:
  I am getting endorsements from the other side of the House and I am pleased about that, but I have to say that, so often, when the government talks about business what they are really talking about are the oligopolies that dominate so much of big business in Australia. It is actually Labor people who genuinely stand beside these ordinary working people who are taking capital into their ownership, having a great idea, banking on themselves, and going out there and starting small businesses. As evidence of this, you need look no further than the series of really significant reforms that was undertaken by the previous government.


Labor in government were able to give real priority to small business. We know that, for the first time since 2001, the small business minister was a cabinet minister. When we talked to people who work in small businesses, especially those peak bodies that are really close to the operations of government, we could see how much difference that made—having a small business minister at the table, helping to make decisions. We created the position of Small Business Commissioner, the name change of which takes up the attention of the House today. We included the council of Australian businesses in COAG discussions. We appointed a deputy chair to the ACCC who has significant and extensive experience in small business. Those things were about giving small business a seat at the table and a voice in the central discussions of government.


There were also critical changes to the tax system which were such an important boost to small business, especially during the period of the global financial crisis. I think the member for Chifley talked about $3 billion in assistance that instant asset write-offs gave to small businesses, just by allowing businesses to write off assets that were worth up to $6½ thousand. We introduced a loss carry-back so that, if in one year a small business made a loss, they were able to counter that with a profit from the year before and get a tax refund from that. These were really significant financial reforms.


The third thing were the practical measures introduced under Labor. For the first time, all government agencies were required to settle bills with small businesses within 90 days—a practical thing that only people who have that experience and that sort of commitment to small business would think of. 


Small businesses in Australia are and incredibly important part of our economy, but reform must be real and it must be genuine. I commend the previous government for the work that it did, and we will continue to fight for small businesses around the country.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2014-10-27,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (11:42):  I rise to speak in support of this motion and I commend the member for Dobell for bringing to the House's attention the importance of small business. I also join with my colleagues the member for Hindmarsh, the member for Forrest and the member for Bass; many of us have a background in small business, so the coalition genuinely understand the contribution that small businesses make to our economy. They are the driver of our economy. They are the engine room, as even the opposition acknowledged. These people are risk takers, innovators and, most significantly, employers of 43 per cent of the Australian workforce. We should try our best to reward their dedicated work by lowering their compliance load and giving them more time to spend creating wealth for themselves, their employees and, ultimately, Australia.


Already, with just two repeal days, the coalition have saved Australian business $2.1 billion, more than double our original target in dollar savings. The spring and autumn repeal days have seen 11,000 pieces of obsolete legislation struck from the books. The time saved just by having to no longer read those outdated rules and regulations—and indeed many are incredibly irrelevant—is extraordinary. Many of the businesses I speak to complain to me that they do not even know what they do not know, there are so many regulations tying them up in red tape. 


As well as these repeal days, our government is looking at other ways to relieve the burden of compliance for small business relating to existing laws. For example, businesses that have no GST payable will no longer be required to lodge a business activity statement. This will save $67 million a year in compliance. Just to get a handle on that, there are 32,000 small businesses that do not pay GST. So there is immediately a positive impact on 32,000 businesses, because they do not have to lodge a BAS. Tax will still be recorded under the pay-as-you-go system but, as this already has to be done, there is no sense in doing it twice for no good reason. If you sign up to the myGov site, you can enter your information once; and, when you have to fill in duplicate forms, the information is automatically fed into it. It saves hours and hours for those mum-and-dad business operators who go home tired at the end of the day and then have to turn around and fill in more forms for government.


Our government has made amendments to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation to make it easier for small and medium-sized businesses to capitalise on overseas opportunities. Giving our small and medium businesses access to overseas markets is vital for Australia to compete on a regional and global scale. As franchising offers an opportunity to people to enter into business with certain risk minimisation, this government is recognising the importance of this sector by reforming the outdated Franchising Code of Conduct. We are streamlining the code and making the obligations of both franchisor and franchisee easier to understand and more business-friendly. A new Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman is being established to assist in the development of small business-friendly laws and regulations.


Why is the government doing these things? It is because the coalition values and understands business. We understand the person working the longest hours is a small business owner. We understand the person who gets paid last in business is a small business owner. We understand that the person who puts their house on the line to support their business is the owner of that business. Unlike those opposite, who see business as the enemy that must be fought at all costs, the coalition sees business as a beacon of hope.


Business can lift people out of poverty. It creates a sense of achievement and accomplishment. It gives you a sense of pride in doing a job that is worth doing, and you carry others with you, whether it is your family or your employees. Small business lifts this nation to places it might not otherwise achieve. That is why I support the measures to cut red tape for small businesses. Indeed, as a small business operator for 20 years, I know just how that compliance and regulation strangled the time I had to put into the business. Small businesses are the builders of our nation and as such we, as a responsible government, must provide them with a solid foundation on which to build.


This government understands the needs of small businesses in a way those opposite will never do. Business is not a burden on Australia, as those opposite would have you believe, but the reason our country does not have the economic woes of so many others. The coalition government will continue to support small business in the best ways it can, by lessening compliance to free up time and money. I support the motion by the member for Dobell. I also look forward to state and local governments following the leadership of the federal government in lessening the burden for small business and reducing red tape.

Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (11:47):  There is a pattern of uncertainty for our small businesses that has been created by this government. Today's motion perpetuates more of the great myths of this government, particularly when one of the last comments in the motion states that they are the government delivering real and practical assistance. I go out and talk to local businesses in my area. I am the daughter of small business owners. I grew up spending a number of weekends and Christmas holidays working for small businesses.


The challenge for small businesses has not really changed that much. Where this government is hurting small businesses in my electorate is around issues like the NBN and being able to connect properly to not only the local market but also the global market. This is one of the practical problems in my electorate. What have we seen since this government got elected? They tore up the NBN plan for my electorate. It is completely halted. There is no plan right now to roll out fast speed broadband to the Bendigo electorate. That means for small businesses in Maldon, Heathcote and Kyneton—everywhere that is on the map—they have been taken off and they have no idea when they are going to connect. These communities are also struggling under the current infrastructure because of the lack of ADSL ports available. It is a practical problem which this government has no solution for.


Another problem that small businesses have in my electorate is around Australia Post. Again, we have seen this government scale back support for Australia Post. There is a big finance area in my electorate and a number of solicitors. They are saying it is taking a week for vital paperwork and forms to get from Bendigo to Melbourne because of cutbacks in Australia Post. Again, that is another practical problem that this government is not addressing.


We talk about government procurement. Bendigo is home to the Bushmaster. The Bushmaster is built at Thales in Bendigo. At the moment, over 120 small businesses are part of the supply chain. We are not sure whether Bendigo Thales will get the opportunity to build the Hawkei. It is another defence manufacturing contract. We do not know whether this government will do the right thing not only by those workers but also by the small businesses that could benefit from this work by ensuring that they get that contract.


There is no point coming in here and talking about how great you are in opening up and allowing small businesses to compete for contracts if there are no contracts for them to compete for. Time and time again, this government is making decisions based upon price and sending defence contracts overseas. This is another failure of this government to do something practical to help small businesses.


Another example of one of these contracts just recently made that is going to hurt small businesses in my electorate is ADA, Australian Defence Apparel. Part of the most recent contract that they won was all manufactured overseas. So it is great that ADA gets to be the importer—not the producer, not the builder and not the manufacturer but the importer!


When it comes to the RET, this government's indecision and its want and push to water down the RET are hurting small businesses in my electorate—not just the small manufacturers that we have but the installers. People are saying that, until this government comes clean and actually declares its intention around the RET, business will continue to stall.


Another area that other speakers have mentioned where this government has backed away from real and practical assistance to business is repealing the $5 billion worth of tax assistance allowing cash flow for small businesses. Cash flow is critical to small business. I remember that from when I used to work in my parents' small business. It is all about cash flow. Providing assistance which supports cash flow is the reform that this government has repealed. It has repealed the instant tax write-off, which helped cash flow. It has repealed the carry-back tax loss write-off. These are practical measures that this government has repealed. This government keeps talking about being the best friend of small business, but we have failed to see any real reform to suggest that. Instead, we have just seen further attacks in other areas that help small business.

 (Calwell) (16:01):  I want to congratulate the Turkish sub-branch of the Victorian RSL and its President, Ramazan Altintas, for initiating and making a reality the Turkish Friendship Memorial Sculpture. Its official public announcement ceremony took place today in Melbourne. 


Ramazan Altintas has pursued the idea of a memorial sculpture for many years and, despite earlier setbacks, his efforts and those of the community have now come to fruition. The sculpture will be built on Birdwood Avenue, Kings Domain, Melbourne, in the gardens of the Shrine of Remembrance. It will be an enduring symbol of the friendship between our two countries, Australia and Turkey. 


I want to thank my colleague the Hon. Warren Snowdon, who, as the Minister for Veterans' Affairs in the Gillard government, came to my electorate to meet with members of the Turkish community during a visit to Sirius College. Members of the school and the broader community, including Ramazan, took this opportunity to raise with Warren their long-held cherished plans to build the Turkish Friendship Memorial Sculpture. As a result, Minister Warren Snowden, on behalf of the federal Labor government, resolved to contribute to the community's efforts with a $100,000 grant, and I was thrilled to make that announcement last year. In addition, the project has received $10,000 from the Calwell electorate's Anzac Centenary Fund. 


The Australia- Gallipoli relationship is of tremendous importance and significance to us all. For Ramazan Altintas and the Turkish RSL sub-branch and for my local Turkish community, this friendship memorial is an important part of their migrant story to Australia.

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (16:46):  I rise to speak about the absurd addiction of our Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, to roads, which is about to wreck what is good about inner-city Melbourne. The Prime Minister and the Premier of Victoria, Denis Napthine, are planning to push the east-west tollway right through the inner city. It will do nothing to fix congestion and everything to wreck what is good about inner Melbourne.


On 2 October, the Prime Minister briefly landed in Melbourne and managed to fit in a joint press conference with the Premier to spruik their pet project. During this press conference the Prime Minister revealed that he has absolutely no understanding of Melbourne, its congestion problems, its traffic needs or the impact of this monstrous project on our city and on our community. The Prime Minister said:


… anyone currently sitting in a traffic jam on Hoddle Street, on Flemington Road, on Alexandra Parade knows that this—


the east-west tollway—


is a massive boost to their lives …


Just before last year's federal election, on 2 September, he said


I've spent enough time on Hoddle Street, I've spent enough time on Alexandra Parade and I've spent enough time on Flemington Road stuck in traffic jams to know how important this is. I want it to be done.


The Prime Minister may not have a great grasp of Melbourne's geography and its traffic network, but if you were on this wonderful new east-west tollway and wanted to get into the city there would be only two exits that you could get off at to come into the city. Do you know where those exits are? One is at Hoddle Street and the other is at Flemington Road. The Prime Minister is talking about the traffic jams on Hoddle Street and Flemington Road. They are the only two places where the thousands of cars that will be on the new east-west tollway can exit to get into the city. The east-west tollway is not going to provide you with a magical helicopter lift to get you in over the parks into the middle of the city. The people coming in from the east or from the worst who want to get into the city to go to work are still going to have to use roads to get there, and when they get on those roads they are going to add to the congestion. Everyone in Melbourne knows—which is perhaps why Denis Napthine did not chime in to back up the Prime Minister on this point—that if you want to get roads clearer and you want to get cars off the freeway in the morning the best thing to do is build a train line.


Before the last election the Prime Minister, when he was opposition leader, invited the then Prime Minister to come down and stand at Hoddle Street and look down the Eastern Freeway in the morning. He said anyone who did that would have to see that there is a problem. Yes, there is a problem. But I will tell you what you see. If you stand on the Hoddle Street overpass and looked down the Eastern Freeway in the morning, you see cars bumper to bumper because people are coming in and trying to get to work. As good as the west is , people coming in on the Eastern Freeway in the morning are not wanting to go out to Flemington, Footscray or Kensington; they want to get into the city and they are stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic. If you look you can see the bus lane is a bit freer and has a bit more space for buses to come down. But when you look in the middle what you see is a whacking great swathe of grass running almost the whole length of the Eastern Freeway.


Do you know why that is there? That is there for the rail line out to Doncaster. That rail line has been promised to us for decades. In fact, if you go back and look in the Melway for 1979-80, you can see the rail line marked out there, and they have marked out stops as well. That is how long this has been promised to us. If you want to get 800 of those cars off the road, one train coming down the Eastern Freeway from Doncaster will do that. If you have a proper service running, you will start to clear the Eastern Freeway. If you have the Melbourne Metro coming in from the other side, you will start to clear the congestion that you find on Flemington Road.


If the Prime Minister had any understanding of Melbourne traffic at all, he would know that his project is about to pour more cars onto Flemington Road and Hoddle Street—as if you could fit more cars on Hoddle Street. There is only one rule of traffic in Melbourne, and that is, 'Whatever time of day it is and wherever you're going, don't go on Punt Road or Hoddle Street.' But the Prime Minister is planning to put thousands more cars onto Punt Road and Hoddle Street.


Everyone knows the simple thing to do would be to make Melbourne a world-class public transport city. If you have been lucky enough to travel around the world, you know that in a good city you can get around without having to use a car. Melbourne could be one of those cities. It is not that difficult. All we would need to do is build that rail line coming in on the Eastern Freeway from Doncaster. You could have it skirting underneath Fitzroy and Collingwood and have a couple of stops there. You could build the Melbourne Metro coming in from the west so that you could have a train stop underneath North Melbourne and Parkville, where we have the university and world-leading medical research institutes but no train stops. It would not only take thousands of cars off the road; it would make everyone in Melbourne breathe easier.


People in Melbourne need to breathe easier. Perhaps the Prime Minister does not know or, as I suspect, does not care, but when this new east-west tollway is built it is going to be between 20 and 40 metres from people who live in the Housing Commission flats in Flemington. These are people who are already about 100 metres away from the CityLink overpass. Most people fly on over it and see those towers there on their right or left and do not give them a second thought. But people live there. Currently between the CityLink overpass and these towers is a playground. There is a community garden and a community centre. All of that is going to go. The people who live there are going to be opening their windows to be almost within touching distance of the new east-west tollway.


Because I have been inside these towers but, more importantly, have spoken to many people who live there, I can tell you that if they have a couple of days over 40 degrees those concrete boxes do not lose the heat. They retain the heat. There are families in there with kids. They have no option but to open the window at night because it will be about 30 degrees inside one of those flats. When they open their window at night, if they happen to be living on the fourth or fifth floor, they will be about be 20 or 30 metres away from the east-west tollway. If they live on the ground floor—in a surprise that no-one saw coming because the Premier did not have the dignity to put this out to people before he signed off on the project—they are now going to open their window to find themselves next to a four-lane surface road that is about to take over the park and community centre they currently have. All of that is in the name of getting more cars on our roads in inner city Melbourne. All of that is in the name of dividing what is good, separating parts of communities from others and forcing people to live within touching distance of a new road.


For this, people are going to lose their houses. Collingwood resident Keith Fitzgerald's house is one of those that is going to be forcibly acquired. He is 70 and he has lived in the house since 1944. He is devastated that he is about to lose his home of 70 years—a lifetime—and it will be destroyed. And where did this come from? This whole east-west tollway was hatched when the state Labor government was in power. After 11 years in power in Victoria, the best that the state Labor government could come up with for solving Melbourne's transport problems was to suggest the east-west tollway in the first place.


I remember how we had to go and fight to make sure that JJ Holland Park, in Kensington, was not going to be a staging ground for five or 10 years while they built this monstrosity. We fought Labor off then. Now it has come back under the Liberals. But the good news is that there is a chance of stopping it yet again. Victorians will be voting soon, and they have a chance in the state election to put the Greens into the balance of power. We will insist that the contracts be ripped up and that the rail line out to Doncaster be built instead.


We know in Melbourne that you cannot trust the old parties. They talk big on public transport when it comes to an election year and then fail to deliver. I am sick of hearing people talk about the airport rail link once every four years at election time, and then it disappears and never comes back again. Well, people are wising up. There is a reason that the Greens are doing well in the polls in Victoria at the moment. It is that people want to fix Melbourne's congestion by building better public transport. By voting Greens they can get that.
