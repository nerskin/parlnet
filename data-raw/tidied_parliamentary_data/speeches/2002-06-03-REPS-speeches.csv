"George, Jennie, MP",ALP,2002-06-03,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	condemns the decision of the Bush Administration to impose tariffs and quotas on Australian steel imports;
(2)	welcomes the recent backdown on the import of hot rolled coil;
(3)	recognises that the US decision makes a mockery of the Administration's free trade rhetoric; and
(4)	indicates deep concern about the impact of the decision on:
(a)	employment levels within the steel industry and in the coal and iron ore sectors; and
(b)	the dumping of increased volumes of surplus steel.
I take this opportunity to speak in support of the motion standing in my name on behalf of the many thousands of workers and their families in my electorate of Throsby whose wellbeing depends very much on the ongoing viability of our domestic steel making capacity. The Port Kembla steelworks is the largest employer in my electorate with an estimated 10,000 direct and indirect jobs relying on it. The steelworks inject about $1.4 billion into our own regional economy annually and much of the product that is produced at Port Kembla has been finding its way into international markets. 
Following a lot of heart wrenching, pain and agony in the 1980s and 1990s, and after a downturn of full-time employment opportunities and the loss of probably up to 20,000 jobs at the steelworks, I am pleased to say that we now have a committed work force, together with an enterprising management that saw the need to invest capital in the plant. We now have a steelworks in my electorate which is one of the most efficient and productive steelworks in the whole world. I think the families and the workers who I represent in that electorate are mightily proud of their achievement and their efforts. 
In that context, the families and work force in my electorate—having gone through a lot of pain in the 1980s and 1990s—were absolutely shocked when word first came out that the United States administration was considering the imposition of tariffs and quotas on steel that was exported from our steelworks and found entry into the US markets. They were shocked because they believed that the changes that had seen the transformation of the steel industry locally meant that we would be competing as efficient and productive producers on a level playing field. Little did they expect that the country that leads the rhetoric in terms of free trade was going to turn around and reinstitute trade barriers, making it so much more difficult for efficient and productive producers like our own steel industry to get a foothold in that market. 
The workers and their families believe that the United States decision is hypocritical, and it flies in the face of the constant appeals that we have heard from the United States about the benefits of free trade. It seems that they extol the virtues of free trade except when it impinges on their domestic industries, as we have seen over the years in terms of the agricultural subsidies and more recently in terms of what we consider to be a wrong decision in principle. This is a wrong decision because it impacts negatively on steelworks like the Port Kembla steelworks that have gone through a massive reorganisation and transformation to come out at the other end as efficient and productive steel producers. 
Naturally, the local people were very concerned about the decision which mooted that quotas and tariffs would be imposed on Australian steel imports. We were very worried locally because currently about 800,000 tonnes of steel is exported from Port Kembla, worth in the vicinity of $400 million to $450 million in exports to the United States, predominantly to west coast mills. So you can understand the concerns of the local community because the steelworks is so much the heart and soul of the economic viability of the Illawarra region and of my electorate in particular. 
The government did take some credit in that, following negotiations, exemptions were procured for our slab product but then later on—and after a bit more arm wrenching and arm twisting—the local people were relieved to learn that the hot rolled coil predominantly used by Steelscape, a former BHP subsidiary, was also to be exempt from the quota and tariff regime. So while we are pleased that 85 per cent of export volumes appear at this stage to be exempt, around $100 million in export sales in our judgment are still very much under threat. While not professing to be an expert in trade matters—Dr Martin will no doubt speak about those implications in seconding this motion—we are still not in a situation where all our product, produced efficiently, competitively and productively, is exempt from the trade restrictions being imposed by the United States administration.
The motion I am proposing condemns the United States decision, firstly, because it makes a mockery of their adherence to free trade; secondly, because it is punitive and punishes, in particular, efficient and productive producers of steel; and, thirdly, because, even though we might say that 85 per cent of our export volumes appear to be exempt, it will of necessity have a negative impact on the Australian domestic steel industry. It will have a negative impact in two ways. I do not think anyone is in a position as yet to quantify the direct negative impact on employment within the steel industry but, beyond that, it can well lead to a very marked negative impact on our iron ore and coal sectors. Because of the glut of steel in the world market, it may be that decisions to wind back production in certain countries will have a multiplier effect on employment levels domestically in our coal and iron ore sectors. Beyond that, I think we need to bear in mind that the Australian steel industry, in terms of employment levels, has been hit very hard. An estimated 30 per cent of steel industry jobs were lost in the 1990s and almost 90,000 manufacturing jobs have disappeared since 1997, so it is not the time for the government to sit back and merely react to the decisions made by the US administration.
We know that increased volumes of surplus steel are likely to be dumped in Australia and we know from previous arguments in this chamber—arguments led by my colleague the member for Lyons about the inadequacy of current dumping procedures— that it will not be too far down the track before efficient and productive domestic producers will be facing the impact of steel being dumped at dumped prices here in Australia. A summit was called by the government but, much to the shame of the government, they wanted to play petty politics and excluded from that summit the shadow ministers for trade and industry and the elected representatives of the steel making towns of Throsby, Newcastle and Wollongong.
In winding up my comments, my plea is for this government to be far more proactive in terms of our domestic steel industry, not to sit back and react when the US and other countries decide to do what they perceive is in their domestic interest but to actually have a proactive, supportive industry framework that understands the implications of this current decision and the likely negative consequences. In that regard, I draw to the attention of the chamber the fact that one of my local employers, Onesteel—which is currently wishing to tender for the SEA Gas project, producing pipes for the Victoria to South Australia gas pipeline—is very concerned that external bidders might be bidding on the basis of dumping cheap product here in Australia. The government needs to get its act together, needs to tighten up the monitoring of imported steel, needs to make sure that dumping processes can be accessed and prosecuted expeditiously and, lastly and most importantly, needs a framework of positive industry support for our vital and critical domestic steel industry.

"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2002-06-03,"—It gives me great pleasure to address the issues raised in the motion and to agree with the vast bulk of them and, in particular, with the terms of the motion. I represent the electorate of Flinders. The Westernport steelworks, which is soon to be spun off as part of the creation of BHP Steel, is in this electorate. Westernport generates over 1,400 jobs; it employs steelworkers from throughout the electorate; it contributes over $30 million in wages alone to people on the Mornington Peninsula; and it contributes over $20 million in expenditure on the Mornington Peninsula. It is the largest employer, it is a key contributor to the community and it is an important element in the life and times of the Mornington Peninsula.
In that context, I wish to make three points about the United States decision and about this motion in particular. The first is that the US decision was clearly wrong. It was a betrayal of the US obligations under its World Trade Organisation responsibilities and it was a betrayal of its obligations to Australia as a genuine and committed free trader. Second, I wish to make the point that, despite this decision, the Australian government achieved a remarkably strong outcome— stronger than almost any other country in the world and one which protected and enhanced the position of Australian steelworkers—but there is still more to be done. Third, I wish to add to the points made by the member for Throsby: arguably the greatest threat to Australian steelworkers, who have already achieved through themselves and through management an almost unparalleled level of efficiency in global steel markets, is the actions of certain members of union leadership. I will set out some of the evidence for that.
The first point is that the US decision of 6 March to restrict steel imports through quotas and tariffs of up to 30 per cent flies squarely in the face of the US World Trade Organisation obligations. The implications are threefold. Firstly, the tariffs and quotas are unfairly restrictive and impact on the unsubsidised Australian product. It attacks the very people whom the US is trying to encourage—and that is an industry of over $A450 million in annual steel exports to the United States. The second problem with the US decision is that it destabilises the world market for steel, potentially causing large volumes of low-priced steel to circulate on international markets. That is why—and I will come back to this—anyone who would potentially support this US decision is in fact threatening Australian jobs. We will ask ourselves: who supported the US decision? The third problem is with the US decision is that it sends a signal that the United States is less than fully committed to advancing more open international trade, and that is accompanied by the US decision on the farm bill, which also has an implication for Australian farmers and agricultural producers. For all those reasons, it was simply a bad decision and a wrong decision.
More importantly, what has the Australian government done to both anticipate and respond to the decision? Firstly, the coalition government worked very hard prior to any US decision because it was understood that under section 201 the US government was looking at actions on steel. The government worked with Australian exporters to achieve a 50 per cent exclusion of Australia's total steel exports—Australian slab steel exports—which were not affected by the initial import restrictions. That was a good outcome, but there was still a lot more to be done, and that was prior to the US decision. Subsequent to the US decision, after President Bush's 6 March announcement, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Trade, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources and Australia's Ambassador to the United States, Michael Thawley, along with others, worked extraordinarily hard to achieve a second wave of concessions for Australian steel. A further 35 per cent of our exports to the United States, being hot rolled coil, as mentioned in the motion moved by the member for Throsby, was excluded from the 30 per cent tariff ceiling. The result was that 85 per cent of Australian steel was excluded. That was a good outcome, but there is more to be done. Until 100 per cent is excluded we are not going to rest.
The interesting thing is that there is also the risk, as was set out by the previous speaker, that there might be the problem of dumping on the Australian steel market. That is a real problem. What is the government doing on that front? The Minister for Trade, the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources and the Minister for Justice and Customs have established a task force and working group on dumping. They have representatives of not only Australian steel exporters but also the Australian Industry Group and the Australian Workers Union. The whole industry—workers and management—are involved in working to protect Australia from dumping as a flow-on. But here is where the real twist comes in: you would imagine that if there were a threat to jobs, the union leadership would have been opposed to it. I bring to the attention of the House an article in the Hastings Independent—a good local newspaper, if I may say so—of 12 March 2002. The headline was `Steelworkers back US tariffs'. The article begins:
The Western Port Steel workers are getting the word not to blame the United States for its steel tariffs. `Good on you, Yanks' is more like it according to Australian Workers Union State President Mick Eagles.
That is the message from the Australian Workers Union State President, Mick Eagles. Will the member for Throsby and the member for Cunningham support or denounce that position? The article goes on to quote Mr Eagles as saying:
We congratulate them on these tariffs.
It gets worse: the union not only welcomed the US decision but also actively worked towards it. The article continues:
Geoff Cooney, union organiser at the BHP plant, was at the International Metals Federation meeting of steelmakers in Washington 2000.
`It was resolved to stop dumping of the cheap steel in members markets,' Mr Cooney said.
Mick Eagles said:
The American steel workers have now struck the first blow.
The union not only endorsed the decision of the United States to introduce steel tariffs at the expense of Australian workers but also actively worked towards it. That is an extraordinary decision which puts at risk jobs in Cunningham, Throsby, Flinders and Paterson. In all those areas there is a risk from the very action which the union leaders have taken. But why would they do that? What is the mentality behind it? I continue with the article entitled `Steelworkers back US tariffs' in the Hastings Independent of 12 March 2002, six days after the US decision was announced:
He—
Mick Eagles—
said a ... decline in Port Kembla steel sales to the United States was not the main risk. `The danger is dumping. Makers of cheap steel, like Turkey, Russia and China, losing their American markets, would then try and dump on Australia.'
But here is the flaw in the logic: they prevent the export of steel to the United States by arguing for the US to impose steel tariffs, which in turn creates the risk of dumping, which in turn creates the problem for the Australian market, and then they complain that there might be a risk of dumping on Australian markets. It is extraordinary! They create the very risk of dumping and then they complain about it. Finally, there is the sheer hubris of the AWU position as set out by Mr Eagles himself, who goes on to say:
All it's about, this globalisation, is making the greatest profits at the cheapest cost centres.
The problem for Mr Eagles is that Australian steel makers are already some of the cheapest cost centres and most efficient producers in the world. Had it not been for the work of the government and its officials, perhaps 100 per cent of Australian steel would be exposed. Instead, it is now down to 15 per cent, which is still too high. That is why we aggressively fought for Australian steel jobs, and we did it without the help of the AWU's Victorian leadership, which actively fought to impose tariffs on US steel, which in turn imposed tariffs on Australian workers and put at risk the very jobs which all of us in this House would seek to protect and encourage. I am happy to ally myself with the motion and endorse its terms but it is critical that we look to the fact that—(Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>US Steel Tariffs</title>,Private Members' Business,0,1
"Martin, Stephen, MP",ALP,2002-06-03,"—I support the motion moved by my friend and colleague the member for Throsby and I support the comments that she and the member for Flinders have made. When looking at the decision taken by the United States and the effect that it has had on Australia, what has been said so far has been dead right: it is a betrayal of the basic tenets of the World Trade Organisation's principles and it makes a mockery of the United States rhetoric about their commitment to free trade. 
When the Prime Minister gets to Washington next week, he has said that he is going to lecture the Congress and the Senate about how dreadful some of the things are that the US government is imposing and which are bringing into question their commitment to free trade. I hope he does not concentrate on agriculture. I hope—and I hope that the member for Flinders will take this message to his Prime Minister—that he reruns this question about steel tariffs.
However, I cannot agree with the member for Flinders when he said that the government has achieved a strong outcome. As the member for Throsby so rightly said in her contribution, there is an 85 per cent exemption. That is true and, on the face of it, you would think that $400 million per year in value of exports into the United States by Australian steel producers with an 85 per cent outcome was reasonable, but it is not because the tariffs that are still imposed by the United States are at the high value end of the production. It is going to cost $100 million in terms of Australian steel producers' exports. That is one-quarter of an annual export earning capability of BHP and others from Australia into the United States which is now in danger. Is that a good outcome? I think not.
While the honourable member for Flinders is patting himself and his government on the back, I suggest that he ask the Minister for Trade and the Minister for Foreign Affairs that, if they saw this coming so long ago, how come that outcome came about? If they were out there lobbying on behalf of Australian manufacturing industry, how did this outcome come about? We see a lot of commitment and talk from the Minister for Trade when he is talking about agricultural subsidies, but then again he has a National Party constituency that he has to suck up to. However, the deal gets done. 
As a great friend of the United States, we put our hand up and we were the first over there in Afghanistan beside them, but when we want some economic benefit to come from our great ally, what do we get? Absolutely nothing. What we get out of it is a kick in the behind. We have seen it in steel and we have seen it in the US farm subsidies bill.
What else do we see as a result of this decision? We now see the portents of a trade war. The European Union and Japan are already taking decisions through the WTO to take the United States to the WTO with an action to get these decisions on steel overturned. And well they might do that. Are we doing anything about that? Is the Australian government saying, `We'll join the European Union and Japan to protect Australian jobs because this decision by the United States is an absolute dud. It's against the WTO and against the interests of steel makers in this country.' Are we seeing the Australian government doing that? Is the Prime Minister even talking about doing that when he is over in Washington next week? The answer, sadly, is no. My constituents in Wollongong, the constituents of the member for Throsby and the constituents of the member for Flinders down at Western Port will be scratching their heads. They will be saying, `Hang on. How come our Prime Minister and the Minister for Trade aren't saying that? Why aren't they trying to prevent a trade war? Why aren't they saying through the WTO processes that we want to protect Australian jobs?'
The honourable member and the member for Throsby are dead right in respect of the real issue of dumping, and we have to look at that. Any measures the government takes to amend that level of concern have to be supported. However, at the end of the day, there is no doubt that employment questions are still going to be raised. There are questions about contributions by different people to the level of support. The honourable member for Flinders asked whether I would support the comments made by the Victorian division of the AWU on this. I would say no—unequivocally no because I think they got it wrong. However, they did not get it half as wrong as US President Bush and the United States administration in signing up to this dud proposition to protect the steel industry in the United States.
Their industry needs total reform. We did it here in 1983 under the Hawke government's steel industry plan and we have gone through a lot of pain in Newcastle, Wollongong and around Australia. It is about time the United States, the great defenders of this great concept of free trade, were out there practising what they preach. They should review this and the Prime Minister should get that review next week.

"Baldwin, Robert, MP",LP,2002-06-03,"— Given the history of steel in the Hunter, I was particularly concerned when I saw the decision by the Bush administration on 6 March to restrict steel imports through quotas and tariffs of up to 30 per cent. In Australia, and particularly in the Hunter, we feel slighted by this US decision because we are a competitive producer of steel products and our industry has undergone the hard yards of restructuring. Through this restructuring, we have evolved into one of the most competitive producers of steel products in the world, and most importantly today, without any government subsidies.
I am concerned that this tariff and quota protection implied by the Americans will affect $450 million in annual steel exports to the US and that this decision has destabilised the world market. What will this do to world steel prices? You might say that now that BHP has largely gone from the Hunter and as we basically only have a few steel rolling mills left, what effect would this have in the Hunter?
Quite simply, and it is no secret, three consortiums are looking at putting steelworks into the Hunter. They are the Austeel proposal, which is to be located at Tomago; Hunter Specialty steel, which is to be located at Lidell Power station; and Protech Steel, which is to go into Kooragang Island. All these decisions and the threat of a glut of cheap steel on the market affect the viability and the opportunity of these projects coming to my electorate to provide work for the thousands of people who have left the steel industry. As I said, BHP has been good to the Hunter over the years, but not in recent times. We need encouragement to invest.
I congratulate the Prime Minister and Minister Vaile on effectively getting an 85 per cent exemption. On 12 March, the Prime Minister said in this House:
If you go back over all the difficult trade decisions that have been taken, adverse to the interests of this country, by the United States over the last 15 or 20 years, I cannot offhand recall one where, as a result of representations made by the government in power, the roll-back by the United States has been as great as it has been on this occasion. 
This government cares and is committed to free trade. However, let us have a look at the decisions and announcements by the Labor Party. Where has Simon Crean and the Creanites been on this? Today is relatively the first vocal decision we have seen except by members of the trade union movement, remembering that the trade union movement has a 60 per cent control over the Labor Party and therefore influences their decisions. The Victorian member of the Australian Workers Union, Mr Eagles, congratulated the US on its decision to impose tariffs. The US steelworkers union intervened to save US jobs, but what he does not understand is that this has the great potential to impact on Australian jobs.
Where are the Leader of the Opposition and the rest of the Creanites in supporting Australian jobs? We have heard today, for the first time, the member for Cunningham denouncing the announcement by Mr Eagles in Westernport; he does not agree with it. The reality is that this is a member of the union—an official of the union movement— who is a part of the Labor Party and who supports US introduction of tariffs to protect their jobs.
What we see from the Labor Party is a deep-seated desire to return to the days of protectionism, when we have achieved so much by opening up trade negotiations and decisions between countries that we deal with. As I said, my interest is to make sure that there are opportunities for companies like Hunter Specialty Steels, Protech and Austeel to set up here, to invest billions of dollars and to create the thousands of jobs which will bring money back into the Hunter. We do not want to see protectionism at any level because protectionism ultimately costs jobs.
We are a very competitive nation. I agree with what both the member for Throsby and the member for Cunningham have said; the Australian steel industry has done the hard yards and has paid the price and the penalties for taking these tough decisions. It is time we were given a competitive environment in which to put our products onto the world market. The steps taken by the Bush administration will effect that ability to a large extent.

"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,2002-06-03,"—I would like today to congratulate the Lions Club of Canberra—Kambah on the event of their 25th anniversary. I had the pleasure of attending their 25th anniversary dinner on Saturday just gone. This club was chartered on 30 April 1977 with 24 original charter members. They then came from the developing suburbs of Kambah and Wanniassa in the Tuggeranong Valley, an area which today houses over 90,000 people. In that first year the club raised $5,760 and donated to charities including the Kambah Scouts, the Lions Save-Sight Foundation and the New South Wales Muscular Dystrophy Association. They even donated blankets for distribution to needy families in the valley.
The club's view of life is that for most of its members and their families the Kambah Lions Club is not just a club. It goes beyond that—the bonds of friendship are very strong. They continue to exist and the members today are doing as their past members did: raising moneys for the community in which they live. 
In fact they have also produced a 25-year history of their club, and Rhoda Parker needs to be congratulated for that wonderful edition that she has put together. I am enjoying reading it because there is much local history in it outside and beyond the Lions Club. I just want to take the opportunity to congratulate all past and present members of the Lions Club at Kambah and say good on them. And to all clubs similar to theirs, all success for the future.

"Haase, Barry, MP",LP,2002-06-03,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	recognises and acknowledges the contribution made to the Australian economy by people working in remote areas of Australia;
(2)	recognises the disparity of services and increased cost of living faced by people working and living in remote areas of Australia;
(3)	encourages and compensates people choosing to live and work in remote areas of Australia by increasing the taxation zone rebate to an adequate level; and
(4)	discourages the practice of fly-in, fly-out employment by restricting the payment of taxation zone rebate to permanent residents in remote areas of Australia.
As many members present will be aware, I am proud to represent a geographical area of regional Australia which is diverse, unique, challenging and, thankfully, resilient. The 2.3 million square kilometres of the Kalgoorlie electorate alone take in much of what is classed as Australia's true outback. One of the things that people in my region can be commended on is that they do not ask for much. What we do ask for is some form of equity with our metropolitan cousins—equity for the communities that support investment in primary, mineral and resource rich industries that return millions of dollars to our national and state coffers every year— and a fair go for the people who opt to live there. Is this too much to ask?
In the past we paid the same tax as city people and wondered why we missed out on services such as sealed roads, public transport, hospitals, secondary schools and quality radio and television reception. Now we pay more tax than city people pay. With the introduction of the GST we pay more of our income in tax because the GST is paid on a base price that is already inflated by transport costs and low turnover. One of the recurring concerns raised by people living in the outback is the diminishing value of the taxation zone rebate, which was introduced to compensate for the disadvantages that are faced: harsh climatic conditions, isolation and high living costs.
We are community minded people out in the bush. To compensate for the lack of taxpayer funded services, country people volunteer time and donate their income at a much higher rate than their city counterparts. Fire brigades, ambulance services, search and rescue services, sporting club amenities, local halls and swimming pools are in the bush today only because of the efforts of volunteers and the local communities. In the past these efforts were recognised by a tax rebate that gave them about five weeks worth of extra wages a year, and the bush flourished. Today that same compensation will not pay the difference in price to buy the daily newspaper. The support for increasing the financial incentive to live and work in the bush is understandably strong in Western Australia, regardless of political alignments. Once it is increased, there will also need to be an indexing of this amount in line with inflation. I have widespread support: the state government, the National Farmers Federation, the Pastoralists and Graziers Association, local councils and shires and, most recently, the Goldfields Esperance Development Commission. And more is coming.
This is not the first time I have brought this matter to the attention of the House. I will keep hammering the issue. The bush is vital to Australia, and right now my constituents are bearing an unfair load—constituents such as those living in the Kimberley and the Pilbara. The Kimberley is known for its superb pearls and Argyle Diamonds and as a top-class tourism destination, but it is also reportedly the most expensive region in Western Australia, with living costs more than 13 per cent higher than in Perth. Broome residents are eligible for a tax rebate of $338 a year, but they still pay an average of $4,700 more than Perth households pay. 
In April this year, the Pilbara Development Commission revealed an overall increase in the variance between Perth prices and those in the Pilbara. Dampier produced the cheapest basket of groceries in the region, being 2.5 per cent more expensive than in Perth. That is up from 1.5 per cent more in October 2001. Marble Bar had the most expensive basket of groceries costing 45.5 per cent more than Perth. This is an increase of 20.2 per cent since October last year. The quality of perishable items varied from town to town. Not only do they cost more, but the quality of good often goes down. 
One of the biggest grumbles in my electorate is the price of fuel. At the time of the survey, fuel in Perth was 87.5c per litre, but in the Pilbara only Pannawonica and Dampier had unleaded petrol at under $1 a litre. On average, the Pilbara motorist pays 20 per cent more than the Perth motorist for unleaded fuel and 75 per cent more for LPG. Marble Bar again tops the prices with $1.15 versus 87.5c per litre in Perth and a whopping 89c versus 43.3c for LPG. They are paying more than double for LPG in Marble Bar. Try telling my constituents in Marble Bar that they are not disadvantaged by remote living! Not only is fuel more expensive, but we are forced to use more due to the great distances and no publicly funded transport. 
Too many communities in the Kalgoorlie electorate are missing out. Targeted Commonwealth funding has helped—and I have nothing but praise for initiatives such as the Regional Solutions and Regional Assistance Programs—but there are still communities which only have the most basic services in communications. We accept that we will probably never have a range of services equal to that in the city, but we would appreciate having enough communications services to be able to run a business with confidence.
Warburton in the Central Desert is an example of a community missing out. It is located on the Outback Highway and it has no mobile coverage. It is eligible under the Commonwealth government's $50.5 million regional mobile phone program, but it missed out when tenders were called in March this year. Although eligible, the estimated cost of providing mobile services in Warburton was more than the remaining funds available for the whole of WA.
In the bush we often lack services that the city takes for granted. We pay more for air services. A trip to the city from Kununurra will cost $1,400. Our dirt roads are impassable during wet weather. If banks choose to shutdown branches, inevitably it is the bush that suffers. We have greater problems in attracting qualified medical, teaching and administrative staff, and our choices are fewer and the cost of goods is higher. Due to the prevalence of cyclones and high building costs, to find an insurance company to provide cover north of the 26th parallel today is almost impossible.
City based bureaucrats and politicians tell me in exasperation, `If it's so tough living in the bush, why not move to the city?' Let me tell you why it is not such a good idea. Our remote areas are resource rich and government collects substantial income from royalties and the development of such royalties. There is a general recognition of the potential of tourism in this country and most of the attractions people want to see are in remote areas. The Australia they want to experience is outback Australia. If we do not recognise the efforts of people living and working in remote Australia, they will leave and, when city folk want to find out why we are such a lucky country and visit the bush, there will be no-one there to pour the very expensive petrol or the beer.
Linked to the taxation zone rebate argument is the practice of fly-in fly-out. Despite huge exploration and mining projects in some regions, these benefits simply are not flowing to the local communities. Royalties from mining go to state and federal government, not to local government, and many larger companies employ fly-in fly-out work forces. With the introduction of Labor's fringe benefit tax, many companies providing housing for employees were hit with exorbitant taxes because rentals were subsidised. Rather than be stung by Labor, companies allowed their workers to live in city suburbs and to fly-in fly-out—the cost being written off to production. 
In Western Australia's case, this results in employees who work in the outback living in Perth where most of their wages are spent. Even though this coalition government has exempted the provision of housing for employees from FBT, the practice remains with disastrous results. Families are under increased pressure. With spouses separated, the homemaker has the full responsibility of raising children and the children suffer an unbalanced view of life. This arrangement leads too often to family breakdowns, in turn placing greater pressure on an overpatronised welfare system. 
A recent edition of the Bulletin stated that FIFO recruitment policies were practised by more than a third of Australia's 156 non-energy mines, 90 per cent of which are in remote regions. In addition, due to these people being shown as living elsewhere in census numbers, this work force is not even taken into account when allocating money to local governments for necessary infrastructure. Not only do these councils need to cater for increasing use of utilities and pressure on services, they are not funded for these. (Time expired)

—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak. ",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Working and Living in Remote Areas of Australia</title>,Private Members' Business,7,1
"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2002-06-03,"—I do not always agree with the member for Kalgoorlie, but on this occasion I find myself agreeing with most of what he said. I point out to him that, if he were to trawl through speeches that I have made in this place over the years I have been here, he would see that most of the arguments he put forward have been put forward on a number of occasions previously by me and by others in this chamber. Our difficulty is that the bulk of the members of this place have no idea about the bush. 
When I visit communities in the Northern Territory, they refer to Canberra as remote, not vice versa. However, in Canberra we consider people living in small communities in Northern Territory as remote. The remoteness is part of a state of mind. The issue for people who live in remote Australia is to have governments and people who make decisions about their lives understand where they live, how they live and why they live where they live. It is apparent that in many of the decisions made by government in the past, and indeed currently, that understanding simply is not there.
I want to raise an issue with the member for Kalgoorlie. He rightly points to the disparity between the cost of living in rural remote Australia, and he refers to his own electorate of Kalgoorlie. For those who do not know what the seat of Lingiari consists of, my electorate comprises all the Northern Territory, except for 300 square kilometres around Palmerston and Darwin, and Christmas and the Cocos islands. It is 1.3 million square kilometres and, with deference to my friend the member for Kalgoorlie, is geographically a lot bigger, if not in area at least in the range that it covers. There is 3,500 kilometres from Perth to Christmas Island and 3,500 kilometres from Darwin to Christmas Island. It is not the area, member for Kalgoorlie, but the range.
The point I want to make is that I wonder if he was putting the same arguments to his party room during the debate about the GST. It is clear that as a direct result of the GST people in the bush, people in Northern Australia—people in Lingiari, Kalgoorlie, Kennedy, Leichhardt, Grey and a whole range of other remote seats—pay more in tax as a direct result of the GST. They pay more tax on fuel as a direct result of the GST. Their cost of living has risen dramatically as a direct result of decisions made by this government. I say to the member for Kalgoorlie, I hope that he has raised these issues previously in his party room about the impact of the GST because when I was raising these matters in this place and outside of this place they were not supported, except insofar as some members of the National Party—very occasionally—would get out and have a bit of a go about the impact of the government's GST on the cost of living of people who live in remote and rural Australia.
Let there be no doubt about it: the member for Kalgoorlie is right. People who live in remote and rural areas—in my case in Lingiari—suffer a great detriment as result of the impact of the GST. But he raises significant points about the disparity of services and the cost of living. What he says about the areas of the northern part of his state could be equally applied to any number of communities in Northern Australia, most particularly in Lingiari.
I also want to make the observation that we need to understand the communities we are talking about here. We are not talking about those magnificent pastoral leases that exist across Northern Australia; we are not just talking about mining camps. The member for Kalgoorlie rightly points to the issue to do with fly in, fly out. But we are talking about a very large number of very dispersed, small Aboriginal communities who suffer the most. They suffer more than any other Australians because of decisions taken on the issue of taxation, principally the GST. These people are, by any measure, the poorest and most disadvantaged of all.
The member for Kalgoorlie pointed to the fact that there is a misallocation, I believe, of resources in terms of equity and in terms of dealing with these people appropriately. He did not pinpoint Aboriginal Australians. I am doing so because the bulk of the people who live in my electorate—40 per cent of my constituents—are Aboriginal people who live in remote communities. I know the suffering they have as a result of where they live and as a result of failures of governments—successive governments, I might say—to properly deal with their disadvantage, which is caused by their location. This disadvantage is in terms of employment, education, health and infrastructure. You name it and they have got it in terms of their disadvantage.
The point that needs to be made on this day celebrating the 10th anniversary of Mabo is that we have a long way to go in terms of dealing properly with our Indigenous brothers and sisters, at least so far as giving them and providing them with the same opportunities that we ourselves have—those of us who are lucky enough to be living in white middle-class families elsewhere in Australia.
The other matter that I want to point to today is the fact that this is an important motion because we are, after all, celebrating the Year of the Outback. We are paying homage to, in many respects, the sacrifices that have been made by a whole range of people since this place was first settled by Europeans—by Arthur Phillip and his motley crew. Since that day, we have seen Aboriginal land taken over. They have not been very thankful for that, as you would imagine. But, at the same time, those non-indigenous people who were the pioneers in these parts of Australia operated under great duress. Bear in mind that we have a history of massacres and confrontations which took place during this period. But there were sacrifices which were made and we owe a great deal to those people who worked on the frontiers—the Afghan cameleers, for example, who were the lifeblood of Central Australia during the latter part of the 19th century and the early part of the 20th century. It is worth while pointing out that one of the events of the Year of the Outback will be to have a camel drive from Coober Pedy to Alice Springs. That will be replicating the work which was done by the Afghan cameleers in the late 18th and early 19th century.
We need to acknowledge the role that women have played and continue to play in supporting industry across rural and remote Australia and in supporting particularly those people who went to Northern Australia looking for new opportunities in this land of boundless horizons, opportunities which were difficult to come by. Great sacrifices were made. We should celebrate those who have actually done the hard yards in these mining camps.
I agree with the member for Kalgoorlie: we should not be rewarding people by giving them tax rebates if they are flying and in flying out. I might say to the member for Kalgoorlie that I doubt whether they should be eligible in the first instance but if they are eligible then their eligibility should be examined. They do get other benefits as a result of their fly in, fly out service.
We also should not forget, when we talk about Australian history and we talk about the need to recognise the great advances made by industry in Australia and settlement in Australia, that the brunt of the Japanese aggression during the Second World War was felt in Northern Australia. Bombing raids in Darwin in February 1942 were bigger than the bombing raids on Pearl Harbor. There were then bombing raids successively around the coast to Broome and inland as far as Katherine. These things happened during the course of the Second World War. They are not properly acknowledged when we teach history to our community. It again emphasises in a sense the remoteness question, because it is out of the minds of people. We recalled recently the submarine incursions into Sydney Harbour. Everyone understands them.
Very few people understand those of us who live in Northern Australia and what was endured during the Second World War, just as people today—this government and successive previous governments and administrators who have made decisions in Canberra—have yet to come to terms with their proper obligations to understand, comprehend and work with people who live in the bush and provide them with the sorts of conditions which they should properly be able to expect. It is on that basis that I think the member for Kalgoorlie's motion ought to be supported. I do think he raises significant issues which are of great importance to certainly all of the people who live in my electorate.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Working and Living in Remote Areas of Australia</title>,Private Members' Business,7,1
"Thompson, Cameron, MP",LP,2002-06-03,"—I am pleased to see the member for Lingiari supporting this motion. We seem to have a good degree of bipartisanship happening in this chamber on this issue which is important and vital to not only the remote regions of Australia but Australia as a whole, and that is good to see. There are a couple of issues, however, that I want take up with the member for Lingiari. Obviously, they hark back to the diatribe he inserted to do with the GST. I would have thought that, now that roll-back finally has been buried by members of the opposition, we would be in a position where we could acknowledge that both sides of this parliament now recognise the value that the GST has provided in all parts of Australia and the value that it contributes to the Australian economy, and I will go to some figures on that in a minute. Of course, the ALP now are continuing with the GST and at last knuckling down to some sense of reality in relation to that.
There was a report in April 2001 from the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Local Government and Shires Association of New South Wales—quite a heavy document—which began with the proposition that private sector job creation is the priority for regional Australia and, whether it is encouraged by budgetary expenditures or tax expenditures—in other words, tax revenues forgone—the commitment must be made. Indeed, the work of the regions has contributed a great deal to Australia's wealth. Going to the period 2000-01, I note that the State of the regions report from the Local Government Association stated that after the introduction of the GST:
Export earnings from resource based regions in Australia boomed over 2000-01. According to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, exports increased by nearly $12 billion, or 27 per cent, to a record of $55.6 billion over that period. Petroleum was the best performer, with exports increasing by 50 per cent to $13.5 billion, mainly from the North West Shelf. Other sectors where exports increased by more than $1 billion included alumina, coke and coal, iron ore and steaming coal.
That is the huge potential of the remoter regions of Australia to generate wealth for us all. Yet if we look at long-term employment growth as a measure of economic health and we go down the list of regions and look at employment growth in the longer term between 1991 and 2000 and look for the regions where there has been negative employment growth in the period, we will see that, sadly, a lot of them are in the regions. There is a negative rate of 6.58 in Eyre and Yorke in South Australia; in far north-western New South Wales there was a decline over that period by 0.64 per cent; in the Mersey-Lyall region of Tasmania, it was 0.5 per cent; and in northern New South Wales there was a decline of 0.9 per cent. That is employment growth in decline over a decade between 1991 and 2000.
In fact, in the 10 years to 1996 the population of metropolitan Australia grew by over 15 per cent and along the coastal areas of non-metropolitan Australia it grew by 23 per cent. But in the period 1991 to 1996 the inland regions lost something like 70,500 people and remote Australia lost 37,000 people. The broad picture that we see is a relative draining of the population of inland Australia. The population profile of inland Australia, also of concern, is ageing quickly. Therefore, it is important that we grasp hold of this, and I think there have been some recent initiatives put forward that can enable us to consider some alternatives.
The National Farmers Federation recently put forward a proposal to extend the existing zone rebate scheme for tax for individuals and to extend it to businesses in the more remote areas of Australia. I would like to push that proposal forward and to say that it needs to be considered in the wider context of the tax arrangements that currently apply. While the member for Lingiari was speaking on issues relating to the GST, there are also positive benefits of that in relation to fuel costs.

"Livermore, Kirsten, MP",ALP,2002-06-03,"—I am very happy to take this opportunity today to speak in support of the many people living in the rural and remote parts of my electorate. In this the Year of the Outback we are celebrating the great things about life in the bush and the special place that it holds in the hearts of all Australians. However, residents of rural and remote Australia are the first to admit that behind the apparent romance of the outback the reality is that they pay an increasingly high price for living beyond the booming coastal strip and far from metropolitan centres. That price is counted in the higher cost of living; in the lack of services or the distance from services in the areas of health, education and social support; and in isolation from friends and family.
It was the Labor Party that first recognised the hardship suffered by people living in remote regions, the people who live and work in difficult conditions while they develop the country's important pastoral and mining industries and the infrastructure that supports them. The Labor government sought to compensate those taxpayers for their higher cost of living by introducing in 1945 what was then known as the zone allowance, a concession granted in recognition of the higher costs of living and poorer service levels in remote regions. The boundaries of the tax zones have remained largely unchanged since that time, and I believe that the current boundaries create some anomalies that impact on my electorate in Central Queensland. I would like to mention in particular the status of the coalmining communities of Central Queensland. Those communities are between 150 and 350 kilometres from Mackay and most of them obtain important administrative, government and support services from Mackay. People living in those communities constantly point out to me how crazy it is for Mackay to receive the zone B concession, while the mining towns miss out on that rebate.
Mackay is a thriving coastal city of 60,000 people served by all major government departments, two airlines, a university and TAFE college, every major bank and a wide range of health and other professionals. You can see how it is a bit hard for the coalminers and their families to accept that people in Mackay need that concession when they are the ones travelling for hours into Mackay every time they need to see a specialist or get their tax done. They are the ones who receive limited services from agencies such as Centrelink and Job Network and have to drive their children up to 400 kilometres for a game of netball on the weekend. I note that the government announced a review of the zonal tax concessions well over a year ago now, and I urge that the review address this anomaly so that it is more fair to people living in the central highlands area of my electorate.
I find this concern for rural Australia from a member of the coalition very interesting, given the track record of this government when it comes to ripping away services and opportunities for the bush. I notice that no National Party MPs are speaking on this motion, and maybe that is an admission of the extent to which they have let down rural Australia by constantly sacrificing the interests of country people to the will of their bosses in the Liberal Party.
If, in fact, this debate is a signal that the government wants to reverse its neglect of rural and regional Australia, it can start by rejecting the full sale of Telstra. When Ben Chifley announced the zone allowance scheme in 1945, the idea was to reduce disparity existing between remote areas and larger centres close to the coast. Well, that disparity is still there in rural Australia and nowhere is it more obvious than in the availability and affordability of telecommunications services. If the regional and rural areas of this country are to reach their full potential, it is essential that they have access to telecommunications infrastructure comparable to that in the cities.
The people of my electorate know very well what a fully privatised Telstra means. We have already seen quite a preview of that. First of all, it means fewer jobs in our region. There have been over 100 full-time jobs lost in Rockhampton since 1996, when the Howard government started selling off Telstra. Just recently, we have seen 23 jobs lost out of the call centre. It means fewer services. People in my electorate are a wake-up to the fact that the improvements that they have seen in telecommunications services over the last couple of years are very much bound up with the privatisation agenda of Telstra and the government. They quite rightly ask: what happens when the honeymoon is over for the bush? Telstra would be fully privatised and they would be forgotten about. They know that it will go the same way as the banks— the bush will be just too difficult to worry about and too expensive to take care of in terms of investment in the telecommunications infrastructure, as the interests of shareholders become paramount. They are very well aware that time is running out for them to get the service that they need. They call on the National Party, as I do, to stand up to the Liberal Party and to reject any more sale of Telstra in the interests of country people.

"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,2002-06-03,"—The grievance debate this afternoon gives me the opportunity to comment on a recent announcement by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services on the AusLink plan and the absolute hypocrisy displayed by the minister on this issue. Just one week after the release of the Treasurer's budget, where it was revealed $300 million is to be cut from federal budget funding over the next two years, we have seen an astonishing backflip by the minister for transport on his plans for the future of land transport infrastructure development. Yet he refuses to see anything in transport beyond its relevance to the farm gate. He is irresponsibly inept and blinkered on the challenges of urban congestion.
The minister claims that this is a new approach by the government to do what he describes as make the `hard decisions' that are needed in Australia's national interest. Whilst this is a new approach by the minister, it is certainly not an original new approach. Ever since I assumed responsibility for the infrastructure portfolio this has been firmly on the Labor Party's agenda. I have consistently called for a smarter approach to infrastructure planning and management and an integrated national transport plan to secure the economic and social growth of Australia. The record will show that Labor took to the last election a plan for the establishment of a national infrastructure advisory council. That plan would see the private sector and all tiers of government working together to tackle infrastructure policy blockages. The policy also argued for an integrated approach to transport challenges and a national land transport plan. When this important policy initiative was announced, what was the minister's response? Did he support it? Most definitely not.
The minister, as the Hansard record shows, mocked Labor's plan and has continued to do so. In this place on 3 April last year the minister had the gall to claim this policy took a `top down' approach to regional and rural infrastructure. Clearly, the minister's attempt at the old smoke and mirrors trick is fatally flawed. Our policy unequivocally stressed a cooperative approach to infrastructure planning by all tiers of government and private enterprise. The minister's plan proposes no such thing. Instead of working with the states, local councils and private enterprise, the minister for transport wants them working for him. His plan constantly stresses that the Commonwealth government will be the decision maker. But all the time the plan puts the onus on the states, local governments and private partners to actually develop good infrastructure policy.
The proposal paves the way for the Commonwealth to make funding decisions based purely on local political considerations. It is about drawing state, local and Commonwealth funds under the federal minister's discretion. The minister has also hankered to claw back GST funding from the states. Yet again, the GST deal is revealed as ill-considered and regretted by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services.
The AusLink plan—or can I say the `Ausdud' plan, as it has been renamed by one of my Labor colleagues at a state level—is without a doubt a blatant attempt at breaking down the national highway system and shirking the federal government's responsibility for that national highway system. Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, as you know from the importance of the highway upgrade in your own electorate, national highways are the arteries of Australia. They are the vital transport link across the nation and the national highway system, by its very nature, is, and should be, a Commonwealth responsibility. In the same manner, the states and local government have clear responsibilities. It should not be open to the Commonwealth to arbitrarily tip bits of money towards state and local roads with no reference to broader plans and priorities for those authorities. 
It is also unrealistic to expect a broader program to be delivered within existing funds. Where is the funding for the plan—a blatant black hole in the minister's announcement? The minister's speech to the Re-engineering Australia Forum a fortnight ago made just one mention of the federal government's commitment to funding the plan—that is, to amalgamate Commonwealth land transport funding. There is no top-up, no additional funding for growing responsibilities to overcome the backlog on the infrastructure front. In essence, this can only mean one thing: less money into our national highway system. That is exceptionally important, because all around Australia we have major challenges to actually upgrade the national highway system, especially with respect to some of the major accidents that have occurred in recent times. In other words, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services is yet again going to rob Peter to pay Paul. What he proposes is that the Commonwealth scrap existing funding allocations, toss all the money into one pot controlled by the Commonwealth government and therefore put in jeopardy a number of essential transport infrastructure projects.
The minister also claimed that the federal government has committed every cent it had promised in the lead-up to last year's election. Let us recall what occurred. We had the minister flouncing about the countryside in a VIP jet, paid for by taxpayers, throwing money here and money there, promising everything if it delivered a vote, especially to National Party members in a range of marginal seats in northern New South Wales and Queensland. It is interesting to note that around the corridors some Liberal members of the coalition have actually pointed to the fact that they received very little from those announcements and that in essence it was a National Party program for members of the National Party caucus only. 
But now we have seen that $300 million had to be taken from committed roadworks to pay for those priorities. It is now blatantly clear that the minister could not afford his road commitments or his Black Spot program without taking it from other projects. The projects most at risk under the minister's AusLink are the politically unpopular projects, regardless of their safety priority. The gross deception of the electorate is that he was not honest about the cost of his commitments. He did not tell those whose projects have been cut, and the workers who will lose jobs as a result, that the promises had a big price tag. How, then, can the minister credibly commit to this announcement? Not only have we seen $300 million cut from roads funding in the budget, but the hollow commitment that the money is there in later years, indeed out years, is a disgraceful attempt by the minister to cover his own inadequacies. He has other plans for those out years, when he will have his new slush fund approach ready for the next election. AusLink has emerged from the minister only as a strategy to get him out of a funding fix. What kind of accountability is that?
There is no longer a firm commitment to fund any promised projects on the National Highway, Roads of National Importance and Roads to Recovery. Where was the minister's commitment to an integrated, inter-modal land transport plan in his election policy, in his statement of his third-term agenda or the budget? It was absent, missing, not thought of by the minister because it required a little bit of hard work—something that the Minister for Transport and Regional Services is not well known for.
If there is one thing that is certain, it is that Australia is facing serious transport challenges over the coming years. We need an integrated, intermodal approach to transport infrastructure to ensure that Australia has a modern, efficient and effective transport system. We need efficient passenger and freight transport networks linking Australian communities and Australia to the world and we need a progressive transport policy that addresses the challenges it faces. But it hinges around government accepting responsibility. We also need a minister that is genuinely committed to those changes, not committed to using those challenges to cover his political hide. AusLink is nothing short of a cheap attempt at cost shifting and responsibility shifting in an effort by an inept minister to hide his own shortcomings.
Labor has long recognised the need for a change in thinking on national transport infrastructure. We will deliver. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Roads: AusLink</title>,Grievance Debate,8,1
"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2002-06-03,"— Last Thursday at the commencement of my remarks on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03, I was explaining the policy failures in this year's budget. I explained to the House the very close link between deficit budgeting and higher interest rates. This link, of course, was confirmed with the testimony of the Governor of the Reserve Bank just last Friday when he announced that interest rates over the next 12 to 18 months are likely to increase by two per cent. This confirms the link: at the beginning of May a deficit budget here in Canberra; at the end of May the announcement of a prospective two per cent increase in interest rates. This is a deficit budget that has placed pressure on the upward movement of interest rates. It is a deficit budget where the price will be paid by home buyers and small businesspeople around the country. It confirms the long list of policy failures by the Treasurer. It also confirms one of the great adages in politics: where there is no belief, there can be no achievements.
Unfortunately, the Treasurer believes in nothing bar himself and image making. The one constant in his life has been the image makeover. I would argue that he has had more image makeovers than Gary Glitter. The Treasurer is always oscillating from one extreme of politics to the other. He started life as a Baptist nerd, knocking around the suburbs of Melbourne. Then he joined Young Labor and the Social Democratic Association at Monash University. Then there was another radical shift in political direction when he joined the HR Nicholls Society. Then he entered this parliament and became a budget cutting Treasurer, trying to boast about his surpluses. We all now know that he is a deficit Treasurer who has lost his fiscal discipline. Then, after his reputation as a budget cutting Treasurer, there was another oscillation when he became the leader of the moderates within the Liberal Party, trying to remake his image. Then, finally, we had the ultimate image makeover when, in a recent edition of the Bulletin magazine, he tried to present himself as a man of the people. Unfortunately for the Treasurer he was surrounded by everything but people. He was surrounded mainly by sausages and thin air in the photograph in the Bulletin magazine.
So there has been a series of image makeovers: Baptist nerd, Young Labor, HR Nicholls Society, budget cutting Treasurer, leader of the moderates, and now he is trying to pose as a man of the people. It begs the question: what next? What will the Treasurer do next in his oscillation from one political extreme to the other? Join the Hare Krishna? Try and reinvent socialism? Join the neo-nationalist movement in Europe? The truth is: where there is no belief, where there is no constant set of beliefs in politics, there can be no achievement. That, ultimately, is the Treasurer's political life story: no belief, no achievement. He shapes up as the Ben Doolan of Australian politics.
I would argue that this budget also bears the mark of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations—someone who has had his own troubles. The one thing about the minister for employment is that he is always trying to give the ALP his problems— not our problems; his problems, driven mainly by a sense of guilt—and one of my roles in this place is to give them straight back to him. I would argue that he has four great obsessions in his life: trade unions, the so-called elites, the royal family and, of course, Labor families. The first obsession is trade unions. Why does he have this problem with trade unions? It is his problem; it is not Labor's problem. He has this problem because his mentor, BA Santamaria, tried to take over the union movement in the 1950s and failed. So the minister for employment is trying to live out the failings of his mentor, Santamaria. Now he takes the view, along with many others in the National Civic Council, that what they cannot control they will try to destroy. 
For all the claptrap we hear from the minister for employment in question time, all the rattling on about the trade union movement, no-one should think for a moment that this is anyone's problem but his. It is his problem, and we need to give it back to him. It is his problem that Santamaria was unable to take over the unions in the fifties and sixties. It is a problem that the minister for employment is trying to live out: a father figure who did not get it right; a minister for employment bashing and trying to destroy the union movement. There is another reason that the minister for employment is obsessed with unions: all the great problems and scandals in his life have been a product of too many unions. That is how he became the `great hereditary disappear' of Australian politics: too many unions. No wonder he is always banging on about unions in question time— he has had too many himself.
His second great obsession in life are the so-called elites. Again, this is his problem, not ours—and we are giving it straight back to him. He is obsessed with elites out of a sense of guilt because he has the CV of a rolled gold elite: the son of a North Shore medical specialist, the product of an expensive private school, an Oxford education, an editorial writer for the Australian newspaper, press secretary to a Liberal Party leader, head of the Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy and now a cabinet minister in Canberra. This is the CV of a rolled gold elite. Yet in the straight half-world in which the minister for employment lives, it is the trade unionists, the housos and the working class of the Labor Party who are supposed to be the elites. No wonder they call him the `mad monk'. This is a crazy campaign against elites which, in its final form, represents a campaign against himself. It is another obsession driven by guilt in his own elite background. It is another instance of the minister for employment trying to give problems to the Labor Party, but again we are giving them straight back.
His third obsession in life is the royal family. You could not get any more elite than the royal family. This is the double standard that the minister for employment constantly exercises. He has got the hide to call young unemployed Australians `job snobs', he wants young or unemployed Australians to work for the dole, yet at the same time he supports a royal family that would not work in an iron lung. It is a double standard. It is a piece of hypocrisy. It is an obsession of the minister for employment. He tries to make out that other people have a problem if they do not support this elite institution, the royal family. The truth is that it is his problem and, again, we are giving it straight back to him.
His fourth and final obsession is Labor families. The truth is that the minister for employment, as we hear question time after question time, is obsessed. He hates the idea of Labor people nurturing their own families. He is obsessed with the strong and productive relationship between Kim Beazley Snr and Kim Beazley Jr. He is obsessed with the strong and productive relationship between Frank and Simon Crean. He has got the hide to call the Leader of the Opposition `genetically engineered'. It makes me wonder that, by this standard, he must think the minister for foreign affairs is Dolly the sheep! The truth is that the minister for employment gave away his genes yet he has got the hide to call others in this parliament `genetically engineered'. He has got the hide to call people on the Labor side `hereditary peers' when in truth he is the great hereditary `disappear' of Australian politics.
I would argue that the minister for employment is indicative of the new political correctness in Australia. There is a new political correctness in this country and it runs along these lines: it is all right for the minister for employment and the shock jocks on radio to beat up on the blacks, the unemployed, the disability pensioners, the marginalised and the disadvantaged in our society. They call that `political incorrectness'. But when someone else talks about one of the Melbourne establishment, like Tony Staley, or talks about Kerry Packer's gambling losses or the lifestyle of the publicly funded Queen Mother, all hell breaks loose. This is the new political correctness in Australia. It is a political correctness by which the elites and the privileged in our society are quarantined from any criticism. It is a political correctness that is a soft touch on the ruling elites and it is trying to turn them into a protected species.
We need to bust through this political correctness and have a bit of truth. In truth, people at the top end of town are living off the system as much as those at the bottom end. Sometimes those at the top end of the town are not exercising their proper responsibilities as citizens. We need to have an honest debate and recognition of these truths. We should not be looking just down the social ladder to those who might be breaking the rules. Very often those at the top of the ladder are also rule breakers. We need to break through this new political correctness and have one standard across society. We should not have the ruling elites, such as the royal family and friends of the minister for employment, quarantined from any public criticism.
I noticed this form of political correctness was evident in a recent article by `Nancy Boy' Bolt in the Herald Sun newspaper—and I even got a mention in dispatches. He accused me of `walloping a comedian with a foam club when he'—that is, me—`was stopped in the street for a skit'. The news for Nancy Boy Bolt is, in fact, that was the skit. It was a Logie nominated skit with a nerf bat. I can only imagine that if Nancy Boy Bolt is terribly offended, as he was in this article, at the thought of someone involved in a comedy skit with a foam club, as a kid he must have had nightmares about Tom and Jerry cartoons. Even today I can imagine that Nancy Boy Bolt breaks out in a cold sweat just thinking about the Three Stooges—all that violence and harm caused by foam clubs and nerf bats. Better that than beating up on the most disadvantaged parts of society as Bolt and the other tabloid shock jocks do day after day. This is what the slanderous Bolt said about disability pensioners on ABC TV on 19 May:
Tough. If you are disabled but you can pay your own way, then tough, do that. It is a shame politicians can't say such things.
So this is the new political correctness practised by so many Howard government ministers, practised in particular by the minister for employment, and echoed in the pages of the Herald Sun by people like Andrew `Nancy Boy' Bolt. It is a political correctness that says it is okay to be tough on disability pensioners but it is not okay to question the public funding that propped up the Queen Mother and her opulent lifestyle year after year, decade after decade. It is a political correctness that is a soft touch on the ruling elites in this country. It is a political correctness that is trying to turn the most privileged and affluent of Australian citizens into a protected species. It is a political correctness that applies rigorous standards only to the poor, the disadvantaged and the marginalised in our society. It is a political correctness that I thoroughly reject. Most of all I reject the way in which the minister for employment tries to call disadvantaged people, and those who advance their cause in this place, part of the elites, when he defends the real elites— the affluent, the privileged, the powerful in our society—from decent public scrutiny and decent public standards. 
So there are many things to criticise in this government. We can criticise the double standards and the hypocrisy of the minister for employment in particular. I note his obsessions in life and the problems he has. One of the sad things about this parliament is that he is always trying to give those problems to us. The truth is they are his problems and he needs to be accountable for them—the failings of his father figure, B.A. Santamaria; the failings of his own judgment and his own criticism of Labor families, the failings of his critique of so-called elites and the failings of his support for the royal family. They are his problems, and we are giving them back.
The most important thing in this budget debate is to give back to the Australian people some decency in the way in which the finances of the nation are organised. The truth is that we should not have a budget that is trying to make pensioners—disability pensioners, in particular—pay for the government spending spree prior to the last election. This was a government that promised a surplus budget prior to the last election—in fact the Treasurer said he would guarantee surplus budgets. But then straight after the election he has decided to slash support for older people and their pharmaceuticals, he has decided to slash public housing funding and he has decided to slash the disability support pension—and still produce a deficit. So much pain for disadvantaged Australians while still breaking his election promise.
The sad situation is that the government has lost fiscal discipline and the Treasurer believes in nothing other than his own image. That is why he has had more image makeovers than Madonna and Gary Glitter put together. The Treasurer believes in nothing, and that is why he has been so cavalier in breaking his election promise with a deficit budget. The sad fact confirmed by the Governor of the Reserve Bank last Friday is that the deficit budget will produce higher interest rates, and we heard it directly in the testimony of the governor. The governor has said that he wants to return monetary policy to a neutral setting, and he defined that as between three and 3½ per cent real interest rates. At the moment interest rates in real terms are two per cent, so there will be a one to 1½ per cent interest rate increase. 
But the real problem is that the Reserve Bank also said that underlying inflation will increase in the next 12 months from 2½ per cent to 3½ per cent, and that will produce further upward pressure on interest rates. So we are likely to see interest rate rises over the next 12 to 18 months of between two and 2½ per cent. This has been confirmed by the Reserve Bank. It is more than coincidence that in the same month we had a return to deficit budgeting in Australia we have had the announcement of a substantial interest rate rise. It is a bad budget that hurts the most vulnerable in our society and is bound to lift interest rates.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2002-03</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1
"McArthur, Stewart, MP",LP,2002-06-03,"—In rising to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03 I want first to totally refute the remarks of the member for Werriwa. His personal attacks on the Treasurer and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations show the paucity of his understanding of the budget. He purports to be the intellectual driving force of the Labor Party yet he comes into this House and attacks on a personal basis members of the Howard government. I totally reject his personal accusations against those ministers. I say to the intellectual of the Labor Party: where are your arguments? Where is your genuine attack on the budget? Why don't you concentrate on the main issues rather than indulging in a personal attack? I must say I am disappointed in the member for Werriwa.
The budget is a very responsible document and I would like to refer to some aspects of it in the short time available prior to the dinner break. The budget will be projecting a surplus of $2.1 billion and the debt has been reduced by $61 billion—a remarkable achievement. The border protection has been a major issue during the campaign, and the government will spend $2.8 billion over five years in order to protect our borders, fulfilling the promise of the Prime Minister and the government that the people of Australia could feel confident that the policies enunciated during the campaign would in fact be carried out during the life of this parliament. Under that policy 105,000 immigrants will pass through the border control in a legal manner—and I emphasise that point. There will also be 12,000 refugees, which indicates the government's compassion and the government's understanding of this very vexed issue facing the whole of the Western world.
Mr Deputy Speaker, I have suggested that there be incorporated in Hansard table 3 from Budget Paper No. 1 in relation to the national debt. I seek leave to incorporate the document.
Leave granted.

(b)	In 2005-06, there are some one-off factors leading to a marginal increase in estimated net cash interest payments, including the recognition in cash terms of the capital growth on inflation indexed bonds maturing in this year and repurchase premia on nominal bonds repurchased in earlier years and held to their maturity in this year.
(e)	Estimates.
(p)	Projections.
—I would like to draw the attention of the House to that document because it relates to the debt level that the government has now reduced by $61 billion. That document clearly demonstrates a remarkable change from the Fraser government. In 1983-84, under the Fraser government the net debt was $16 billion, a very small figure. If you then look at the table, you see that in 1991-92 it was $31 billion. I give the figures in round terms because it demonstrates the problem. In the following years it went from $31 billion to $55 billion, $70 billion, $83 billion and $95 billion. In 1996-97, the last year of the Keating government, it was a $96 billion debt. That debt was undertaken by the Keating government. Not only did they not repay capital items but they used that debt for recurrent expenditure. The other key figure is that when they incurred that debt of $96 billion they were incurring an interest bill of $8.5 billion. I put on the record that that was almost within range of the total defence expenditure of about $11 billion or $12 billion. So in simple terms we could have done a whole lot of very valuable things for the Australian people with the interest that the Keating government were paying on that massive debt. 
Under the Costello regime, the debt has been continually reduced back to $82 million, $70 billion and $53 billion and in the year 2001 back to $39 billion. It is projected on these figures 2001-02 to be $38 billion. These figures graphically demonstrate the argument the Treasurer has put to the Australian people that that massive debt has been reduced and that governments historically have borrowed money to pay their way and seek political favours. However, the Howard-Costello government in handling the finances have been responsible. They have taken the tough decisions, and this document graphically demonstrates the return to a more stable position, with lower interest rates, lower inflation and lower government debt—so much so that it is projected that by the year 2005-06 there will be a surplus of $18 billion. This is a remarkable turnaround and a turnaround to be commended. The member for Werriwa did not address that situation in his personal attacks on members of the government frontbench, particularly the Treasurer. 
I commend the Treasurer on his performance in this particular area. It is a matter that I have been concerned about for many years, and the government have turned it around. They now obviously have less interest to pay and that will mean resources to be devoted to those with disabilities and those poorer members of our community, and that will be a very commendable social outcome of a reduced deficit, let alone the reduced inflation and reduced interest rates that all Australians are enjoying.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.
—Prior to the suspension of the sitting I was referring to the very good performance of the government and the Treasurer in reducing the Commonwealth's debt. I would now like to move to the related problem of the household debt. I note from the budget papers that in 1981 the household debt was 40 per cent of disposable income, by 1996 it was 80 per cent of disposable income, and by 2001 it was 110 per cent of disposable income. That is a reflection of the low interest rates and the capacity of households, under the Howard government, to generate wealth and consume goods and services. I have some concern about that. I note that the graphs, as demonstrated in the budget papers, are similar to those of other developed countries, such as the US and the UK, where low interest rates occur. 
The other matter which I draw to the attention of the House is the consumer credit debt, which is in the vicinity of $50 billion. I re-emphasise the fact that Australian households and individuals have been encouraged to take on a con-sumer debt of $50 billion by way of Bankcard. If there is, by chance, a change in interest rates of one or two per cent, that will reflect very heavily on that amount of debt. To be fair, governments around Australia have reduced their level of indebtedness. Peter Costello, as Treasurer, has done a very good job of reducing the level of debt of the national government. I issue a warning to individuals that the excess of debt in changing circumstances is a problem that would worry us all.
Likewise, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme was costing the taxpayer approximately $1.2 billion in 1991. The Hon. Peter Walsh, a former finance minister, informed the parliament and the people that the escalation was going be a concern in the future. In 2002, it is costing the taxpayer and the government $4.2 billion, and it is projected that it could cost another $40 billion in 2040. If you follow that line of projection, the taxpayer and the government are incurring a debt of considerable magnitude in the provision of health services to individual older Australians. The change in the copayment from $3.60 to $4.60 is a minimal payment which encourages a more responsible attitude towards pharmaceuticals.
The Intergenerational Report, released in the budget, again looks at the future and where Australia will be in the year 2042 with the problems of an ageing population and declining birth rates. I note that the declining birth rate is a matter for concern; the number of people entering the work force will be very much reduced and, in the comparatively near future, Australians will not be reproducing themselves.
Taking the broad figures from the budget papers, we note that the world had a growth rate of 2.5 per cent in 2001, compared with 4.7 per cent in 2000. Obviously in that financial year growth and productivity around the world was reduced. The projections for the Australian economy, on the other hand, are very encouraging. It is projected from the budget that, in 2002-03, the productivity growth rate will be 3¾ per cent. That is a very encouraging figure. The fundamental outcome of this budget depends upon those growth rate figures, both in real and in monetary terms.
Productivity from the changes to the industrial relations regime, new innovation and the general good management of the government have ensured that, contrary to other Western developed countries, the productivity figures are very encouraging. When you look at the US figures, growth for 2001 was 1.2 per cent, which is a very low figure compared with the four per cent in the previous four years. This gives an interesting relativity of Australia's good performance under the stewardship of the Howard government compared with other developed Western nations. The Japanese economy, which is so important as a trading partner to Australia, contracted by 0.4 per cent. This gives a clear indication of the difficulties facing the Japanese policy makers in terms of the corporate debt, the banking debt and the ability of that economy to recover and be a genuinely good trading partner to Australia.
In Australia our exporters were doing well until recent weeks when the value of the dollar, relative to the American dollar, was very favourable to exporters. The cattle industry has done remarkably well, the grain industry is doing well and the dairy industry in the heartland of Corangamite is doing very well. Lambs are at $100 and those other big exporters of iron ore and coal are all looking favourable because of the low Australian dollar. Overall, the Australian economy has done well. There has been a very careful attempt by the Treasurer and the government to contain expenditure, to reduce debt, and I think all Australians are benefiting from those important initiatives.
I would like to look at a broader topic of globalisation and the importance of Australians and this parliament sticking with the difficult issue of making sure that Australia remains competitive in its agricultural products and manufacturing. It must remain competitive in everything it does, whether it be financial services, the provision of health, the provision of government services, or just maintaining a sensible balance of no extraordinarily high debt levels such as those the Keating government foisted upon this parliament. We need to ensure that there is a free flow of capital. This was assisted, of course, by the floating of the exchange rate. I commend the Labor government on that good policy in its early days of office. It assisted Australia in reaching a genuine competitive position.
Globalisation has been a benefit to Australia. All too often in our own electorates we see lobby groups of farmers or people who have enjoyed the benefit of a special interest group saying that globalisation is a difficulty. The facts of the matter are that globalisation and Australia's position in the world are very much supported by our ability to trade competitively, to trade internationally and to make a profit in the final analysis. The benefits of trade are so well known to many of us. I will quote an article by Mr Chris Pierson of the University of Nottingham in the Australian Journal of Politics and History, volume 47, dated 4 December 2001. He said:
World trade in goods has grown almost twice as fast as GDP since 1950.
What he is really saying—and this particularly affects Australia because Australia is a trading nation—is that, because those nations were prepared to go out and seek export markets, they were able to enjoy the benefits and prosperity that went with that world trade. World trade has doubled since 1950, and that is not so long ago—when there were a lot of forces in the world, they were restrictive and they said they would stick to the home market. He went on to say:
The trade in services also appears to have doubled in the period since figures were first reported in 1980, so that total world trade may now amount to as much as 45% of world GDP.
The facts of the argument support very much that Australia should be in the global market and that we should use everything in our power in this parliament to encourage exporters and support them, both by way of tax changes and by way of our attitude to exports.
Computing and Internet costs have dramatically decreased, of course, here in Australia and in the Western world. Technology growth has contributed massively to the growth of world trade over last few decades. The important debate that we need to have is that some of the social democratic political parties in the Western world are somewhat inward looking and can win the internal debate at the polls by saying that they want to protect the home market relative to arguing the case for globalisation and expanding their markets to other attractive markets around the world—although that would be more difficult.
In an interesting piece in the Australian Journal of Political Science, Mr Tom Conley of Griffith University had this to say:
The belief that turning inward and retreating to earlier Australian responses to deal with economic vulnerability would be catastrophic for Australia's future prosperity, does not mean that protectionist impulses will not continue to influence the Australian policy debate.
The protectionist debate will continue. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, the government are reviewing that protectionist policy. The issue for debate is not that the car industry enjoys a 10 per cent protection at the moment and the government are looking at reducing it; the fundamental debate that both sides of this parliament need to have is one of whether one particular manufacturing sector enjoys protection or whether we are prepared to go out and be competitive in the world, putting our goods and services, in terms of quality and price, on the world market and not expecting to be protected against others who are doing better than us.
In the few minutes remaining, I draw the attention of the House to the results of this globalisation and the benefits of trading internationally and competitively. Let us look at the OECD rankings of GDP per capita and the ranking of Australia. It is always very interesting to see where we sit internationally with other nations of the Western world. Switzerland seems to have done pretty well—it is at the top of the class—from 1975 to 2000. In 1975, Australia was 10th on the table; by 1980, we had slipped down to 12th; by 1990, we had slipped down 13th; and by 2000, we had come back to 11th.
Because there have been reforms of the industrial relations system, the tax system and our ability to export competitively, our wealth creation has improved. We have been competing with the United States, which has been sitting up near the top of the class— second in 1975, second in 1980, third in 1990 and second in 2000. We have moved up and down, and it is only with policy settings that we have been able to improve our position. Our position in terms of GDP per capita reflects the fact that the poorer sections of the community now have more ability to enjoy the benefits of the taxation system since the introduction of the GST, so the flow-on of the genuinely created wealth in Australia from exports can be spread through the whole community. I suggest to both the government and those sitting opposite that we continue the good fight to ensure that globalisation and Australia's position in the world continues.
The introduction of the US farm bill is a disaster for globalisation. The minister at the table, Minister Tuckey, with his Western Australian electorate, would appreciate only too well that the US farm bill, which is contrary to the spirit of globalisation and international trade—and for the political benefit of President Bush and the Republican Party—has set back the cause of globalisation and international trade.
When it came to the crunch, the US administration, while they advocate free trade at every forum around the world, were prepared to put a high tariff on their steel exports and a tariff on their farm products. I am very strong of the view that both are retrograde steps in terms of the improvement of those poorer countries, in particular Australia, who need to export, who need to be part of a world trading system and who need to be part of globalisation, which is so often bandied around as a bad thing. I commend the concept that we need to export, we need to be competitive, we need to make profits and we need to ensure that all those industries are looked after by a better tax system, a very responsible government and a very responsible budget.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2002-03</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1
"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,2002-06-03,"—In speaking to the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03, I support the second reading amendment moved by Mr Latham on behalf of the opposition. This evening I will restrict my remarks—wearing my shadow minister for health and ageing cap—to an area that is covered only minutely in the budget papers but which is a very important issue so far as our health system and the Australian community are concerned: that is, the issue of medical indemnity insurance. In the budget papers you find an appropriation of $2 million for consultants to advise and assist the government on medical indemnity insurance. Importantly, you also find medical indemnity insurance and, more precisely, the consequences of the United Medical Protection provisional liquidation listed as a contingent liability—not costed or quantified but nonetheless listed as a contingent liability— which reflects the government guarantee previously given from 29 April to 30 June and on Friday extended by an announcement of the Prime Minister. It is a very important area so far as our health care system and medical practitioners are concerned.
There are two aspects to the medical indemnity insurance issue: one goes to the general difficulties of medical indemnity insurance, which we have seen in the system for some time, and the second goes to the position of United Medical Protection— UMP—and Australasian Medical Insurance Ltd—AMIL, as it is known in the trade. UMP is the insurer for 60 per cent of Australia's medical practitioners: 90 per cent in New South Wales, a substantial proportion in Queensland, and just about all medical practitioners in rural and regional South Australia. It is a significant and important medical insurer.
So far as the issue of medical indemnity insurance generally is concerned, this is an issue that has been on the government's watch for some time. Indeed you could argue, if you wanted to be ferociously critical, that the government has been aware of the issues surrounding medical indemnity insurance since 1996, when it first came to office. When it came to office it had the Tito report, which drew attention to these issues coming down the track and to the fact that this was an issue requiring substantial reform and substantial application. Regrettably, in my view the government has been asleep at the wheel; it has not dealt with this matter until the crisis has been upon it.
In July last year Labor announced a comprehensive policy on medical indemnity insurance, and it did so at that time because the issue of public liability insurance abounded. Labor recognised that there was a need for a comprehensive policy response to the issue of medical indemnity insurance. There are a number of factors to Labor's policy announced then which stand the test of time and which ring true today. First was the need to ensure that we reduce clinical risk and improve clinical outcomes. Often neglected in this area but one of the most effective and constructive things the Commonwealth can do is to put the shoulder behind the wheel for a comprehensive effort to reduce clinical risk and improve clinical outcomes. That is one of the best ways of ensuring that issues of liability, indemnity and negligence do not come to pass. Yes, as a nation we perform well internationally but we can do better, and that is acknowledged by the profession at all levels and it is an area where the Commonwealth ought sensibly to put its shoulder enthusiastically to the wheel.
Secondly, we advocated the use of structured settlements, of periodic payments to get people off the pot-of-gold mentality and to have people treated and cared for essentially by way of annual payments or structured settlements, and to make the necessary taxation changes to see that as an attractive award so far as the courts are concerned. Thirdly, there was the need to pay special attention to the high-risk, special damages areas—neuro, spinal, obstetrics and anaesthetics. Those are the disciplines where you find the large and special damages areas. Seventy-five per cent of them come in the obstetrics area; the remaining 25 per cent generally come with serious road traffic trauma or serious spinal and neuro injuries. It is in this area—neuro, spinal and obstetrics—that concentrated and special attention is required. Fourthly, we drew attention to the lack of a national database and the need to ensure that, to assist in this area, national data is required. Finally, we drew attention to the need for improved prudential regulatory arrangements and improved prudential supervision and transparency.
We repeated those themes in the run-up to the November 2001 election. Regrettably, there was nothing from the government at that time. After the election, belatedly, in December last year, the Prime Minister announced a summit, which was held on 23 April this year. At the time the Prime Minister announced the summit, as shadow minister for health and ageing I welcomed it. I said that it was belated, but nonetheless I welcomed it, and I hoped that the government would look at the constructive, thoughtful and helpful suggestions that we had put on the record for some time. Indeed, I wrote to the Minister for Health and Ageing, requesting my attendance at the summit. I thought that this area would require long-term substantial change and reform and that an attempt at bipartisanship would be productive, but regrettably the minister thought that my presence would not be helpful.
On 23 April the summit was held. Regrettably, between December and April we heard nothing from the government. The Commonwealth was not there driving reform in this area. Indeed, on the day before the summit the minister for health, Senator Patterson, was reported as saying that it was not the Commonwealth's role to be driving policy in this area; it was a matter simply for the Commonwealth to liaise. The communique which issued from that summit in April essentially drew attention to the series of issues that Labor had drawn attention to more than nine months previously, but no final decisions or agreements were struck. On Friday, when the Prime Minister announced the extension of the UMP guarantee, those long-term issues were still there, and we had seen no movement on those issues since the announcement of the prime ministerial summit in December last year and the actual holding of the summit in April.
So far as the UMP/AMIL situation is concerned, one could argue that this is a particular issue that the government has had on its plate certainly for 18 months and probably for two years. UMP made an extra call upon its members in November 2000 and that was the first public sign that UMP was in trouble. In February this year, the government announced a $35 million guarantee to ensure that UMP could trade until the end of June. The government certainly created the impression that, if UMP got into further difficulty, it would be there. In my view, having created that impression, having backed UMP with a $35 million guarantee to ensure that it could trade until 30 June this year, having created the impression that it would be there essentially as an insurer of last resort, on the eve of the summit on 23 April when the Prime Minister wrote to UMP and indicated that the Commonwealth would not be there, the profession and the industry were somewhat startled. 
That is very adequately reflected by the front page story in the Sydney Morning Herald on Wednesday, 24 April entitled, `PM abandons doctors' insurer.' The report stated:
The decision to leave UMP to its financial fate, made by cabinet late on Monday, stunned representatives of state and territory governments, medical groups and malpractice insurers who gathered yesterday at a Canberra summit to confront the growing crisis in medical indemnity insurance.
The report continues:
After the cabinet meeting on Monday, government officials claimed a rescue package for UMP had been agreed on. But during the summit in Canberra yesterday it was revealed the package amounted to a commitment to maintain services whatever happened to UMP.
Either advertently or inadvertently, the government created the impression that they would be there for UMP. On the eve of the summit, the Prime Minister wrote to UMP and the impression was created that the government had pulled the rug on UMP.
In the aftermath of the summit, and with that becoming public, I called on the government to outline what their plan was to be. I was not alone: the New South Wales Minister for Health and the AMA called on the government to outline their plan. If the government and the Prime Minister were saying that they would not be there for UMP but they would guarantee the continuation and continuity of medical services, how were they proposing to do that? The prime ministerial letter indicating that no more would be there for UMP certainly came as a surprise. It scattered the horses and the government simply said, `We guarantee the continuity of medical services,' but they failed or refused to outline their plan.
On the following Monday, 29 April, UMP called for provisional liquidation. How did the government respond to that? People may recall that the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan, had to handle the matter in the absence of the Minister for Health and Ageing. She essentially conceded on the 7.30 Report that night that the government had no plan. She said that the government could not bind or guarantee the conduct of future governments or future parliaments. That certainly sent the profession and the industry into a pink fizz. On the afternoon of Monday, 29 April, UMP called for provisional liquidation and by a quarter to eight that night, following the appearance of the Assistant Treasurer on the 7.30 Report, everything was primed for chaos in the medical profession and we certainly saw that.
The front page story in the Australian of Tuesday, 30 April stated: `Health system in chaos as medical insurer faces liquidation. Doctors will shut out patients.' The front page of the Sydney Morning Herald on the same day read: `Doctors shut doors as insurer folds. Essential services in jeopardy. “Ironclad” protection demanded.' The following day, Wednesday, 1 May, the Australian headline read: `AMA calls doctors back to work after government backflip. Medical rescue operation.' On the same day, the Sydney Morning Herald headline read: `Doctors' bans stay despite deal. Private patients stranded as Government, AMA rush through short-term fix.'
The first dramatic evidence that the government had badly mismanaged a crisis was revealed. Having neglected for some time the long-term structural issue of medical indemnity insurance, we then found the government mismanaging a crisis. There was no plan to present to the profession when UMP said it was going into provisional liquidation and no plan to indicate how medical services would be guaranteed and that sent the profession and patients into a ferment.
The following day, the Prime Minister indicated that the government would legislate to effect a guarantee from 29 April to 30 June. There had been no talk of a guarantee the night before. Subsequently, Senator Patterson wrote to medical practitioners saying:
The government is committed to ensuring that these guarantees will be contractually binding on future governments. The government will legislate by 30 June 2002 to confirm the effect of that guarantee.
There was no talk like that from Senator Coonan on the key night. 
When the opposition was called on to indicate how it would respond to such legislation, I immediately said, sight unseen, that the opposition would support such legislation, giving the medical profession the parliamentary certainty it required to back up that legislative guarantee. The fact that the government badly mismanaged this crisis is more than adequately reflected in comment pieces in the Australian Financial Review on Tuesday, 30 April and Wednesday, 1 May. On Tuesday, 30 April, the Australian Financial Review stated: `Government adds to the confusion.' The article went on to state:
The Federal Government has been singularly unconvincing in its handling of the United Medical Protection debacle and has laid itself open to suggestions it has been calculatedly misleading.
Whether Government unsteadiness in its management of the UMP issue reflects differences among ministers themselves about what to do, or whether it is a consequence of a deliberate policy of obfuscation, there is a sense that indemnifiers, doctors and the public have been led up the garden path ... the Government's behaviour gives little cause for confidence that it will manage this crisis to a satisfactory conclusion ... but the Government's unwillingness to spell out exactly what it has in mind has been most unhelpful.
Reaction yesterday to UMP's announcement that it was appointing a provisional liquidator underscores the continuing uncertainty, which the Government seems intent on allowing to fester.
The following day, on the Wednesday, the FinancialReview headline reads: `Government has only itself to blame'. The FinancialReview comment piece says:
A Government which seems to have done its best in the past several days to cloud the issue ...
... the Government only has itself to blame for the confusion.
... calculated lack of clarity in the Government's position has contributed to the present debacle ...
Canberra's approach to this whole issue has been a textbook lesson in how not to conduct public policy in a highly sensitive area, namely health. The Government has had plenty of time to come to grips with this issue. The fact that ...
it—
... has allowed it to come to this where doctors are unsure whether they are insured or not reflects no credit on ... the Government ... All this could have been avoided with reasonable foresight.
So the government's own inept handling of a crisis sees disruption to medical services and the whole profession placed under an unnecessary lack of confidence. And that continued. On Friday, 24 May, in the New South Wales Supreme Court Mr Justice Austin was saying:
One my central concerns is a degree of uncertainty about the meaning and extent of the Commonwealth's commitment under the interim proposals.
In other words, the New South Wales Supreme Court could not work out the nature and extent of the Commonwealth's guarantee. Again, that is reflected in the Australian Financial Review on Monday, 27 May where the comment piece says:
Friday's day-long deliberations by the NSW Supreme Court highlight what a sticky mess the government is in with the medical indemnity crisis.
It's an incredibly complex mess of the Government's own making and, suffice to say, it is learning on the run.
Finally, when we have crisis upon crisis, deadline upon deadline, on Friday—with over 8,000 UMP insured doctors, mainly in Queensland, requiring some certainty from the government before they determined whether to reinsure with UMP or make other arrangements—we have the Prime Minister extending the guarantee from 30 June until 31 December, indicating a plan or a structure to ensure that UMP's tail, as it is so described, is dealt with and calling upon doctors to continue under the guarantee until 30 December. On Friday we find again no further delineation of long-term structural reforms, other than the Prime Minister saying the government now has another six or nine months to attend to it. Further last minute clarity so far as doctors are concerned, placing increasing pressure on the medical profession and on patients.
This is a matter which has been very badly handled by the government. The crisis has been managed very badly. That has seen disruption to service and lack of confidence for doctors. The general long-term structural reform issue has been neglected and also very badly handled. We now need to ensure that between now and December the government acts on those long-term structural reform issues: the tort law reform issues, structured settlements, special attention for the catastrophic care cases and ensuring that we have a concerted effort to improve clinical outcomes and reduce risk.
Ancillary to but not directly related to this particular UMP issue are the difficulties we have seen concerning the insurance of midwives, the insurance of the Family Planning Association of New South Wales and the insurance of Aboriginal medical services. Again, on all of these issues where the Commonwealth has an interest the government has either ignored the difficulties, as in the case of midwives, or been slow to act, as in the case of Aboriginal medical services and family planning.
Drawing to a conclusion, one of the proposals which you find in the Prime Minister's announcement on Friday refers to a potential levy on doctors whose insurer, UMP, may not be able to deal with the tail of claims confronting it. You might recall the Prime Minister earlier in the piece saying neither he nor the Treasurer had given any special consideration to a levy, but now we seem to be running counter to that. The point I make about the levy on doctors is that I notice that both the AMA and the Australian Divisions of General Practice have said that the consequences of a levy may be passed on to patients. Just as the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer have drawn attention to the need for a special role so far as the ACCC is concerned in dealing with any changes to public liability insurance, it seems to me there is also potentially a need for the ACCC at least to be engaged in a monitoring role in the event the government moves to a levy proposal. Why do I say that? It is clear that the great danger to the consumer, the customer, the patient—in addition to the disruption to medical services—is another addition to the cost of health care.
Already this year we have seen private health insurance increase on average by $150 per year per family. The government's proposal to increase, under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the cost of essential medicines will see 300,000 Australians in families whose cost of essential medicines will increase by the maximum $190 per year. We have seen bulk-billing go to record low levels—74.5 per cent—with the average cost of visiting a doctor now $12 more than it was when the government came to office. The flow-on cost of medical indemnity insurance will also add pressure on those families seeking to get quality health care at affordable rates from their medical practitioners.
Labor will now examine the government's proposed scheme in respect of unfunded liabilities, the tail, only scant details of which the government provided on Friday. But as well we will continue to press on the government the constructive suggestions that we made for long-term reform in this area so as to ensure that in future these matters will be much better attended to by the government of the day and much better attended to by public policy than they have been to date. ",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2002-03</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1
"Worth, Trish, MP",LP,2002-06-03,"—I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03. Looking back over the past year, there has been a decisive shift in the priorities of all Australians and of governments and people around the world. This time last year, terrorism was not a topic generally discussed around the dinner table. Osama bin Laden's name was unfamiliar to most, except for the occasional reference in the world pages of the newspaper. But all that changed on September 11.
Everyone's lives have been changed by the events in New York and Washington. This year's federal budget clearly reflects those changes in priorities that governments around the world are now facing as a result of attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon. It comes as no surprise, then, that this government should make vitally important decisions that ultimately will make our nation a safer place to live. The security of the nation is paramount. The defence budget includes an additional $1.3 billion over five years to upgrade security within Australia. While expenditure on securing our borders has increased to $2.9 billion over five years, it is a necessary budgetary shift given the events of the past year.
I welcome the release in this year's budget of the first Intergenerational Report prepared by the Commonwealth government. I believe it is one of the most significant reports released in many years. While the report seems to have received little publicity in the light of other key government decisions, the importance of the key messages in this document cannot be underestimated and certainly should not be ignored.
Governments are often accused of only looking forward as far as the next election. The Intergenerational Report looks beyond the next three years, or even the next decade. It is an important indicator to the issues to be faced by governments for the next 40 years to 2041-42. Not surprisingly, one of the main challenges highlighted is our ageing population and the pressures that this will place on Commonwealth government finances. To show the contrast, the report states that the proportion of the population that is very old—that is, over 85 years of age—is expected to triple over the next 40 years while the proportion in the prime working age range of 15 to 64 will fall. A recent article in the Herald Sun revealed that figure showed in 2001 that the country's 100 year-plus population almost doubled in the preceding two years, rising from about 2,500 in 1999 to 4,217 in 2001.
The impact on government finances is significant. The Commonwealth's spending on health as a percentage of GDP will more than double from just under four per cent to more than eight per cent. The impact of this spending growth is already evident. The report highlights that spending growth on the PBS has been rapid and that, of all the Commonwealth health expenditure components, spending on the PBS is projected to grow the fastest, even taking into account the current proposed budget changes. Spending on aged care will also more than double as a percentage of GDP, from 0.72 to 1.77 per cent. As Treasurer Peter Costello says:
... if we can explain the nature of the challenge—
that is, making social services sustainable—
if we can start taking steps now, the steps which we will have to take later will be less significant.
My colleagues opposite, of course, have fallen over themselves to criticise the government's health measures in a typically short-sighted attack on the budget, yet I am reminded of the words of one of their former ministers, who clearly had a better understanding of responsible government than his current contemporaries do. Former senator and health minister Graham Richardson in 1993, while Labor was in power, expressed great concern about the rapid decline in the number of people with private health insurance and the lack of forward thinking by his own party. He said:
There ought not to be a rule in Australian politics against thinking ahead. We have operated in a fog for a number of years in which that rule has I think been observed, by and large by too many of us. We think three years between elections—we can do something in the first, try and wrap it up in the second, and in the third spend the time talking about what we will do next time. That's a pretty pathetic way to run Government.
What Mr Richardson highlighted at the time—apart from the very key issue of the decline in private health insurance—was the complete lack of vision by his government. It is a matter of record that the coalition government acted swiftly and decisively on the matter of private health insurance. This government not only stemmed the massive decline in private health insurance but had people returning to private health insurance in their thousands. The 30 per cent private health insurance rebate and the introduction of Lifetime Health Cover showed that the coalition government had succeeded where Labor had failed. This, of course, is one part of the greater vision we must have for the future health of all Australians.
There are important parallels to be drawn between this year's health budget and the Intergenerational Report in the context of planning for the future health of this country. I thought it was worth looking back at the past 40 to 50 years to get an understanding of how rapidly our nation is changing. There is a fascinating publication put out by the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing to coincide with the Centenary of Federation entitled Putting life into years. It provides an invaluable insight into changes to our health system over the past 100 years.
Looking back to 40 or 50 years ago, Australia was in the midst of the baby boom, and the new Menzies government recognised its social responsibilities as part of its commitment to post-war reconstruction. As part of the plan introduced by then health minister Earle Page, everyone was to have access to free life-saving drugs. Hospital insurance and a voluntary medical benefits scheme were to reduce the cost of care, and pensioners would get free doctor services. This highlights that what are considered core services in our health system today were just being introduced only half a century ago.
What particularly caught my attention in this publication was that in 1948 the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme started operating. At the time, the PBS supplied drugs in the British Pharmacopoeia to pensioners as well as supplying 139 life-saving and disease preventing drugs for others. The cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in 1952— its first full year of operation—was £7.6 million. By 1959, the cost had already almost tripled to £21 million. Today, spending on costs and co-payments under the PBS has reached $4.77 billion. As of last year, the PBS covered 593 generic drugs, available in 1,469 forms and strengths, marketed as 2,351 different brands. It is estimated that 75 per cent of all prescriptions dispensed in Australia are subsidised under this scheme.
It comes as no surprise, then, that something needed to be done to address the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to ensure that it remains sustainable. In what smacks of rampant political opportunism, or the most severe case of selective amnesia in recent memory, the Leader of the Opposition has launched an amazing attack on the government's PBS measures. What makes this attack so hypocritical is the fact that, as Alan Ramsey from the Sydney Morning Herald pointed out, he was sitting not more than a few metres from then Treasurer Paul Keating when he announced similar measures in the 1990 federal budget, measures that included introducing concessional copayments for pensioners for the first time in the scheme's 42-year history. To quote some of the lines from Paul Keating's budget speech in 1990:
... the Minister for Community Services and Health is announcing tonight the most far-reaching restructuring of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme since it was introduced.
He went on to say:
It took almost 40 years—from 1948 to 1985—for the costs of that scheme to grow to half a billion dollars.
It took only another 4 years for the costs to grow by another half a billion dollars. 
And in another three years those costs would have doubled again to more than $2 billion were we not to have acted now.
And what was the core of Keating's announcement? He continued:
The measures we are announcing tonight will cut the growth in spending on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme by about $1 billion in two years.
It is the absolute height of hypocrisy for the opposition leader to now not only criticise the measures announced by this government but also say that he will have them blocked in the Senate. I hope that the Democrats and the Australian Labor Party will take the opportunity to further consider their views on this issue and realise that action must be taken now to ensure a sustainable health system in the years to come.
The Treasurer has already taken the opposition leader to task over his attempts to confuse the public by suggesting that all scripts will rise by $6.20—a claim that totally misrepresents the facts and is clearly wrong. This government announced that for non-concession card holders the maximum rate for any pharmaceutical would increase by $6.20 to $28.60. However, many commonly used pharmaceuticals are under the ceiling rate, so the price will stay the same. For example, Ventolin inhalers used by asthma sufferers cost $17.20; after 1 August they will still cost $17.20. The sedative Normison costs $7.58; under the new provisions it will still cost $7.58. The anti-inflammatory drug Voltaren costs $12.86; from 1 August it will cost $12.86. Similarly, the contraceptive pill Trifeme 28 will still cost $15.02, as it does today, and the antihypertensive drug Tenormin will continue to cost $12.61 per script after 1 August.
In fact, 45 per cent—almost half—of all items on the PBS are priced below the general copayment level, and therefore their price will not change. For pensioners and concession card holders the maximum copayment increases by $1 from $3.60 to $4.60. But it must be remembered that there is a safety net of 52 prescriptions in a particular year, after which they are free for pensioners and concession card holders. Importantly, however, medication that costs the taxpayers of this country hundreds or even thousands of dollars will still cost the consumer a maximum of only $28.60 or for a concession card holder $4.60. It is also important to remember that 85 per cent of scripts written are for concession card holders.
It should be pointed out that the PBS budget measures cover a much wider area than the changes to copayments. The budget measures also will see improvements to the rules for evidence based quality prescribing, an increase in the provision of information on PBS prescribing requirements to doctors, a strengthening of the current approach to identify and investigate pharmacy fraud, a decrease in the incidence of doctor shopping, better facilitation of the use of generic medicines and an undertaking of a review of drugs for the treatment of arthritis. This year's health budget also includes an $11.5 million commitment over four years for better diagnosis, treatment and care for Australia's more than three million arthritis sufferers. Earlier intervention and care for this complex and debilitating disease will allow sufferers to remain independent and in the work force longer.
The budget reaffirms this government's commitment to the National Illicit Drug Strategy. Since 1997, this government has provided $57 million towards 133 non-government programs that provide a significant number of treatment services for illicit drug users across Australia. The 2002-03 budget allocates a further $65 million to the Non-Government Organisation Treatment Grants Program and $14 million over four years to the Community Partnerships Initiative, which allocates grants for local projects that promote health and reduce drug related harm.
As I mentioned at the start of my speech, the events of September 11 have resulted in a significant change in budget priorities for this government, and the health portfolio is no exception. This budget has included key measures to protect Australians through the stockpiling of antibiotics, antivirals, vaccines and chemical antidotes in case of terrorist action. This is a necessary initiative in the face of the worst-case scenario of bioterrorism incidents. I recently had carriage of legislation through the parliament to enable this to happen.
I welcome another significant funding initiative—a $55 million package for palliative care. This package includes education and training for GPs to support palliative care nurses and allied health workers in their role of maintaining quality of life and dignity for people who are dying, more efficient specialist backup and better coordination between hospitals and community care, better support for families and friends who are trying to cope under such difficult circumstances and increased awareness of palliative care in the wider community.
The budget includes important initiatives that will benefit older Australians. As I indicated earlier, Australia has a rapidly ageing population, and this is reflected in the additional expenditure under the portfolio of the Minister for Ageing. The Intergenerational Report clearly highlights that aged care must be a priority for future governments. Under this budget, more than half a billion dollars will be spent on older Australians. The government will provide an extra $211 million over four years to increase residential aged care subsidies. This money will assist providers to meet labour costs and address the disparity between wages in the aged care and hospital sectors. A further $100 million in capital grants will help small aged care homes in rural and remote areas to upgrade their facilities. The Minister for Ageing recently announced an additional 8,231 new places worth an estimated $180 million for allocation in the 2002 aged care approvals round, bringing the total number of places allocated since 2000 to more than 32,000.
I would like to take the opportunity to point out that short-sighted decision making is not just an affliction of the federal Labor Party; I could not believe my eyes when I read about the actions of the new South Australian Labor government, which had recently cut funding to build aged care beds through the HomeStart Scheme, and yet it had the temerity to criticise this government's aged care budgetary measures. What is more, I am told the Labor Rann government's dumping of this funding for aged care beds was done in secret and certainly was not raised before the last South Australian election.
I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate East Timor and its people on gaining their independence. I am very proud to belong to a government that has played such a crucial role in making this possible. I was pleased that the Prime Minister was able to attend the independence day celebrations. I believe that neither he nor the government have received proper credit for the role they played in getting to this point. As Senator Robert Hill put it in a recent interview, if it were not for the courage of the Australian government and the professionalism of the Australian Defence Force, we would not have had independence day celebrations a week ago. As an aside, I would like to congratulate General Peter Cosgrove on his appointment as Chief of the Australian Defence Force. It is worth noting, too, that there are still over 1,200 Australian troops stationed in East Timor continuing their peacekeeping role.
I think a comparison of this government's role in East Timor with that of Labor governments of the past should be put on the record. In 1974, under Labor icon Gough Whitlam, advice that East Timor should be independent was rejected and Australia supported East Timor's incorporation into Indonesia. At that time, Australia's support was crucial if East Timor were to avoid the fate that eventually befell it. The situation was particularly exacerbated during the Keating years, as Australia's then Prime Minister had such a close personal relationship with Indonesia's Suharto.
Perhaps one of the most telling comments came from Mr Jose Ramos Horta, now foreign minister in the new East Timorese government. While campaigning in exile for independence in 1999, he said:
The people of East Timor will remember John Howard, his government as the government that tried to help them. They will remember the likes of Paul Keating who year after year were an accomplice of the Suharto regime.
It is important to note that East Timor would not now be independent if there had not been a change of government in Australia in 1996. As the Prime Minister said during the independence day celebrations:
... of the things that we have done in the area of foreign policy over recent years none has been more noble than what we did in relation to East Timor.
... we have adopted a policy stance which was right, it was fair, it was just, and it's something of which I'm very proud.
On matters quite specific to my electorate, I note that, in the budget, money has been allocated for the continuation of work on the Commonwealth Law Courts in Adelaide. People who have travelled in and around the CBD will no doubt have seen the demolition of the old police building, which had outlived its usefulness. I am proud to report that construction of the courts on that site is now well under way. The $76.6 million project on the corner of Victoria Square and Angas Street will provide accommodation for the High Court, the Federal Court, the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Service.
Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to place on the parliamentary record my congratulations to the Kilburn Knights, who exacted revenge on the Broadview Tigers after last year's defeat, to take home the Trish Worth Cup in a very tight encounter.
 (Mr Lindsay)—I am pleased to hear it.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2002-03</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1
"Irwin, Julia, MP",ALP,2002-06-03,"—I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03. The seventh Howard-Costello budget fails the most important test of any budget as far as the people of Australia are concerned. Forget about deficits or surpluses. Forget about intergenerational reports. Forget about strong defence and domestic security. Forget about the stock market reaction. When it comes to the most important test of a budget, the question is whether it is fair to all Australians, and this budget is just not fair to all Australians. It is a budget that pushes this government's agenda—there is no doubt about that. But that agenda is not about fairness; that agenda is about satisfying the narrow self-interest of a few Australians—not the majority and certainly not the most in need. It is not a fair budget but it is a clever one, because this government has developed wedge politics into an art form. The basis of its wedge politics has become the way it is able to turn some of the less fortunate in the community against those who are even less fortunate than themselves. This is a government that preaches downwards-envy. It tells those with little that it is okay to envy those with even less. But when it comes to upwards-envy, when someone is doing better than you, it is a sin to envy them.
We know that the Treasurer was brought up in a strong Christian home. No doubt he was taught the Ten Commandments, and he must have been at Sunday School on the day they dealt with the 10th commandment—that is the one about coveting. To remind the House, and to quote from a modern version, the 10th commandment says:
You shall not covet your neighbour's house. You shall not covet your neighbour's wife, or his manservant or maidservant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbour.
And `covet', of course, means to envy. We know that the Treasurer does not covet his neighbour's wife, or at least the wife of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, and I suppose he is not too envious of his neighbour's house nor his ox or donkey. We know that he covets the Prime Minister's job; however, that is not mentioned in the 10th commandment, so I suppose that that is okay. But, as far as the Treasurer is concerned, upwards-envy is a sin. It is not okay to envy someone who is doing better than you.
As they said when I was at Sunday School, `The Good Lord helps those who help themselves,' and so does this government. I will come to some examples of downwards-envy later, but let me begin with some of the ways in this budget—and in earlier budgets produced by this Treasurer—that the government has been more than generous to those who have been helping themselves to government handouts. Let me turn firstly to an excellent article by Brian Toohey in the Sydney Sun-Herald of 7 April this year. The article is headed `Millionaires receiving full age pension', and I will quote from it in part:
A couple with $1 million in assets can still get the full age pension following changes in social security rules designed to achieve the opposite result. Other changes allow a single retiree with an annual income of $74,000 to pay less tax than someone on less than $23,000 a year.
The article goes on to say:
Little notice has been taken of these complicated changes outside the rarefied word of retirement planners. But some Public Service economists in Canberra are expressing private concerns that the budgetary impact of the new rules will soon become unaffordable. One official, who does not want to be named, says the changes threaten to wreck the bipartisan policy of concentrating social security benefits on those most in need.
Hear, hear to that! The article continues:
Although next month's Budget is expected to contain tough crackdowns on spending, this official fears Treasurer Peter Costello would face a heavy backlash from the financial sector if he stopped well-off retirees from getting the age pension.
As we can see from the budget, there is no crackdown on millionaires getting the age pension. But we will see a crackdown on people who receive the disability support pension—some of the most disadvantaged people in the community. But they do not have retirement planners or the financial sector to go into bat for them. Let me give some examples of this `millionaires welfare state' that the Treasurer has definitely created. Brian Toohey goes on in his article to quote some actual cases. He quotes Graham Colley, superannuation manager for RetireInvest:
... a couple can have an income of $85,000 a year and still get the age pension. As well, special rebates allow them to pay no tax.
When I think of the working families in my electorate of Fowler who struggle to pay off a mortgage and to raise a family on less than half of $85,000 a year and pay thousands of dollars in tax, it makes my blood boil. But, according to the Treasurer, I would definitely be breaking the 10th commandment: you cannot envy someone because they are better off than you. That would be a sin.
I will give another example. Brian Toohey mentions the case given to him by Peter Morgan, senior technical manager with financial advisory group Sealcorp. His example is that of Martha, a 63-year-old who earns $18,000 a year from a cleaning job. Martha qualifies for $4,700 in age pension, but she pays $1,169 in tax. Morgan then gives the example of Casey, a 65-year-old single man. Casey has $1 million in assets, including $700,000 in an allocated pension. Casey misses out on the age pension, but receives a retirement income of $74,000 a year on which he pays the grand total of— now wait for it—$124 a year in tax. The point Morgan makes is that, if Martha works a few extra hours, she will have to pay tax at the rate of 68c for every dollar she earns over $20,000, while if Casey earns an extra dollar he will pay tax at the rate of only 27.5c. In any language, that is definitely not fair. There is nothing in this budget to make it fairer. To make matters worse, there is no indication from the Treasurer of any change to make it fairer in the years ahead. 
The Treasurer refers in his budget speech to the first Intergenerational Report and the need to start now to put in place measures which will sustain a decent health system and aged care system into the future. The Treasurer notes that the ratio of old to young in our society will increase. He says:
If we ignore moderate changes now the challenges will only get greater, the decisions will only get harder, and the solutions will slip outside our grasp.
If you will not make the kinds of changes that Brian Toohey tells us that public service economists have urged him to make, what hope is there for moderate change in the future?
But let us look at some of the changes in this year's budget and see just how fair they are. I will start with the government's baby bonus. The Treasurer tells us that this will allow claims of up to $2,500 per year for up to five years. But this depends on the amount of tax paid by the mother before leaving the work force. So to get the maximum of $2,500 per year—and we have to remember this—you would have to earn $53,000 per year. Less than that, and you find you are scaled down to a $500 per year minimum. The maximum benefit goes to mothers with higher incomes, and while the amount is capped at $2,500 per year there is no means test on income. The bonus is paid per year for up to five years, with a maximum of $12,500. But that is only if you can afford to stay at home for the full five years. When you add to that the non-means tested family tax benefit part B, a mother with a spouse on a salary of $1 million can get an extra $2,752 a year on top of the normal family allowance. Is that fair? Who earns more than $55,000 and stands to benefit most from the baby bonus? By the government's own calculations, only the top seven per cent of employed and partnered women will qualify. But do not say anything, because the Treasurer will accuse you of envy if you do.
Let us look at what other compassionate assistance the Treasurer has for the battlers, the working families, the people out there on `struggle street', those on low incomes who want to save for their retirement. If you recall what I said earlier about Martha, you might understand why they would. The government will make a superannuation co-contribution of up to $1,000 per year for individuals with an income of less than $20,000, tapering down to zero for incomes of $32,500 or higher. That seems fair enough. But you might ask how many working families get by on $20,000 a year and can afford to make $1,000 in personal undeducted superannuation contributions— not many I will bet, not many in my electorate. But how many wives of executives on big salaries might take advantage of it? Plenty, you can be sure. So what might seem fair at first glance is just another government handout for the rich.
Speaking of government handouts for the rich, the Treasurer says he is going to make super contribution arrangements more family friendly. But I do not think that means more friendly for working families. He will allow members to split future super contributions with their spouse. But the benefit of that will go to super fund members who can expect a tax-free lump sum payout more than $106,000 and a reasonable benefit limit of more than $530,000. The ordinary working family will get little or no benefit at all. And if that is not good enough for high-income earners, the Treasurer says he will cut the superannuation surcharge from 15 per cent to 10.5 per cent over three years. And who will benefit from that—people earning more than $85,000 a year, that is, the top five per cent of taxpayers
This government's generosity to the rich is not matched in any way by additional assistance to the less well-off in our society. Instead, the government will make life harder for working families and those people dependent on support. This Treasurer is like Robin Hood in reverse—he robs from the poor to give to the rich. And he has got the nasty band of merry men and women on that side of the House to help him with his dirty deeds. 
So who does the Treasurer pick on first? The unemployed, of course. Last year the government managed to underspend its Job Network program by $200 million, not because there were fewer long-term unemployed—in fact there were more. No, it just cut back on the amount of assistance it gave. And what has the Treasurer got in store in this budget? Since nobody squealed too loudly when the government underspent last year, he will cut spending to that level permanently. 
There is training assistance to mature age workers of $500 to attain basic skills in computer and information technology. I expect for that amount of money the 11,500 participants might just about learn how to turn a computer on. Clearly, the government will spare no expense when it comes to assisting the long-term unemployed to find work! But, in keeping with its approach to envy, the government would not want too many people to throw in their jobs just so that they could get $500 worth of computer training. They used to say that nothing was too good for the workers, but according to this government nothing is too good for the unemployed.
If you think the Treasurer is being hard by ripping off the unemployed, the mugging he has got in mind for disability pensioners really takes the cake. This part of the budget really shows up the difference between upwards and downwards envy. For those people over the age of 55 who have acquired sufficient wealth to be able to retire from the work force, this government gives generous tax concessions. As I explained earlier, the government wants to make it easier for people with large superannuation payouts to relax at their beachside homes and play a few rounds of golf. We do not hear it mentioned that their retirement pensions receive generous tax concessions when they were being accumulated. Very few people between 55 and 65 now enjoying their early retirement were part of the blue-collar workforce that built this nation.
What of those workers who have spent more than 40 years in the work force, who broke their backs to build this nation, and now find themselves unable or unskilled to continue in full-time work? This government is about crack down on them. In the weeks and months ahead we will see the government trying to demonise this group in our community. We can expect to see on programs like 60 Minutes and other shows how people with bad backs on disability support pensions are able to bend over and pick things up. We will see the government stirring downwards envy—but nothing about the over-55s who are enjoying early retirement courtesy of tax concessions. That is upwards envy. That breaks the 10th commandment, and your Sunday school teacher will tell you that is wrong.
Another example of this government's thinking is the budget's funding for education. Looking at a breakdown of Commonwealth funding for schools, the increase this year in funding for public schools comes out at an extra $24.92 for each public school student. Before your local public school goes out and spends that huge sum, we see that the increase in funding for each private student works out at an extra $298.31. So each public school student now receives $955 in Commonwealth funding, but each private school student receives $3,857. In fact, by next year the government will give more in funds to private schools than it does to the whole of the public university sector. But let us not have any upwards envy. Let us keep giving even more money to wealthy private schools and precious little for disadvantaged public schools or to our struggling universities. That might create downwards envy. 
Then we come to the area of health. Having taken the axe to funding for the unemployed and for disability support pensioners and to public education, the government turns on that other privileged class in Australian society, the sick. The same Treasurer who gave generous subsidies to people with private health insurance now wants to jack up the cost of prescriptions so that pensioners will pay an extra $52 a year and families could face paying an extra $190 a year.

"Cobb, John, MP",NP,2002-06-03,"— In rising to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03, I say that the electorate of Parkes is very much centred on small business and the people who work for small business. It really does not matter whether you work for somebody or work for yourself, it is small business and the production and employment it provides that is the make-or-break issue in the electorate of Parkes. In fact, to get an idea of just how big small business is, the town of Dubbo, a city of about 40,000 people, has well over 2,000 businesses, which is not one business per 20 workers but one business per 20 people, per 20 head of population in that city. The reason that this is what I would describe as a great budget is that it deals with some enormous issues. Even though we hear talk today of higher interest rates and higher inflation, without a budget as responsible as this one we would not be in the position that small business finds itself happily in today. 
The reason that the population of my electorate and I think country electorates in general have so much to be pleased about is that we are seeing growth in country areas, certainly in many areas of my electorate growth we have not seen for many years. Partly that is due to all those programs that have meant so much over the past few years, like Networking the Nation, Regional Solutions and Roads to Recovery. All the medical schemes that have come up over the last few years to retrain mature nurses, to give scholarships for nurses and doctors, to introduce clinical schools in places like Dubbo and the same type of situation in Broken Hill have had an enormous bearing on the potential quality of life and without doubt have arrested the slide of past years. 
The continuation of those programs does more than simply look after social problems. It means that all those businesses, be they large or small, that do exist in our region have much more confidence about whether in future potential employees are going to be there, are going to be happy and are going to be in a healthy situation. Out of a total of $650 million new spending given to health and aged care in this budget, almost 40 per cent goes specifically to country and regional centres. That is another reason that people in a seat like Parkes are so satisfied with a budget that they can see is specifically aimed at their concerns.
I would like to talk for a minute about small business. I have heard members on the other side of the House as recently as three weeks ago talk about the fact that they could see no mention of small businesses in this budget. Let us talk about the $96 billion in government debt that the current government inherited in 1996. The fact that about $62 billion of that is paid back actually means that the Commonwealth of Australia is not paying somewhere in the order of $5 billion in interest every year. The fact is that it takes the government out of the borrowing market. 
It was only last year that I was asked by a person in Canberra why it is that ordinary Australia does not realise how important an issue that is. We tell them, but I guess the detail is lost in the media and certainly lost to the opposition. But when you take government borrowing of $62 billion and payment of around $5 billion a year in interest out of the equation, that takes one heck of a big competitor out of the market for all the small businesses in Australia that want to do things and invest. They have an enormous reason to feel incredibly grateful that this government has seen fit to take itself out of the equation as a competitor for money in the money market. That is why interest rates have got low and that is why under what this budget does they will remain low, because this is not a deficit budget. In a tough budget we have managed to keep a profit rather than a deficit, so we are not re-entering the borrowing market. The fact that we do have in world terms one of the strongest economies in the world, with massive growth compared with most of our competitors, speaks volumes for the fact that business, be it large or small, can work with confidence and know that it can do so in the years ahead because the stage has been set once again in the new term. 
I heard the member for Werriwa earlier tonight mention that a member of the government frontbench—I cannot testify to the accuracy of the statement—may have been involved with Young Labor. He was obviously being very caustic about what he believed the Treasurer stood for. He should think about the saying that goes, `Anybody who is not reactionary when they are young has no go.' That same train of thought goes, `Once you grow up, if you don't become conservative about politics, you've also got no sense.'
The electorate of Parkes would, as would the vast majority of Australia, absolutely back to the hilt the spending on defence in this budget, the spending on security and the spending on border protection and processing. In fact, I would go further on that to say that the seat of Parkes, which is so very much centred on exports and agricultural production, would also say that those issues of border protection are important to us in another way as well: that the greatest selling point that we have in Australia is our virtual disease-free status, and border protection is certainly about that. One hint of BSE or foot and mouth and the cost to this country, not just the seat of Parkes, is incalculable. So we in country Australia can be enormously thankful for the border protection measures. 
Funds for housing for the aged are up by $100 million for country areas. For ageing at home there are 6,000 more places; for the training of aged carers, $211 million. This is one heck of an issue, for two reasons, when you live out in the west where caring is such an expensive business: one, because of the amount of money being made available for housing for the aged, and, two, there is not as much money out there for the simple reason that houses are not worth as much, and anyone who puts in a bond cannot put in anything like the bond that somebody from Sydney or Melbourne can. We have 39 providers in the electorate of Parkes. We spend around $35 million a year out of that money. 
The gold card extensions will cost somewhere around $93 million. It is a tough budget, and it is tough times. But this government is still looking after veterans. It is doing more for veterans, it is doing more for the aged, and it is protecting the needy.
I would even stop there and say that one of the great things out of this budget is that over $70 million is to be spent on six new cancer radiation treatment centres—an incredible thing to have out there, when you consider that people have to travel from the far west of my electorate to Melbourne or Sydney. Couples in my electorate do that on a weekly basis, and so you can imagine what it would mean to them to have a radiation treatment centre in their own backyard. 
There are not—and I stress `not'—many governments with the guts and the foresight to look ahead, see a need and act on it, particularly when it may mean that that budget will impact harder than it would otherwise do. I think the courage of this government to deal with the costs and ramifications of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for this nation into the future says an awful lot about looking at Australia for everyone in the long term rather than taking the short-term political view which has been thrown about this House so often in the past few weeks. But at the moment we are dealing with the issue of future costs and also protecting the needy. 
The opposition have made comments day after day, week after week, about the cost of every prescription going up. This is totally incorrect; they are trying to frighten people. In the seat of Parkes, where it has been explained to people what is going on, there is a deathly silence about how bad it is. I wonder whether that is because one dollar more to $4.60 for those on concessional rates is not a lot of money. When is it not a lot of money? A lot of those prescriptions can cost $700, others can cost $250, yet people will still get them for no more than $4.60. After 52 prescriptions have been issued, people get them for zip—nothing, free. I think that is the sort of truth the opposition benches should be concentrating on. 
I wonder whether part of the reason for this silence is that $28 for the rest of us— who then, after $875 or thereabouts, go on to the concessional rate—is also not much to pay for prescriptions that can cost $50, $250 or up to $1,000. I think that is the reason that Australia has accepted the courage of the government and the necessity of its actions. I think the other reason is that the majority of Australians realise, unlike our friends across the way, that we all pay for this. It is not some magic amount of money that falls out of the sky. We are all paying for it. We would have all been responsible for the $60 billion it was expected to rise if the government had not had the courage to take this action.
Then there are disability pensions, and we have had unremitting attempts by the opposition to frighten people who have no reason to be frightened. My office has had calls from people inquiring about the changes to the disability support pension. Nearly every one of them—in fact, I would go so far as to say every one of them—has been from people who have had absolutely no change in their circumstances as a result of this budget. This does not affect the severely disabled and the blind. Anybody with a serious disability problem has not been affected by this. I think it is very dishonest and it is very cheap to try to frighten people who have no reason to be frightened. 
The object of the changes—and it will cost government money for quite some time to do it—is to provide 73,000 places for help with retraining, training and rehabilitation. Probably what we are trying to do most out of these changes is simply help people become part of mainstream Australia. Who would not want to be part of mainstream Australia if they had the ability to do so? That is the point here: if they have the ability to do it, they will be helped to become part of mainstream Australia. Once again, in this budget we have a government that faces facts, but it is still looking after those who need its help.
The seat of Parkes has an enormous need for apprentices, and that is why there is another great amount of good news for us in this budget. The $750 that employers get for starting off somebody who is still at school, and the next $750 they get if they keep them on after they have left school, is a huge boost to our electorate. After doctors and nurses, tradespeople are probably the next in most demand. It does not matter how good your investment is or how good your businesses are, if you do not have the tradesmen you cannot do the work. The payment of $1,100 to supplement the cost of training information technology and high-skill people is also an enormous benefit for us, as is the training of mature people in the use of computers.
Total funding for government schools has gone up to $6.6 billion. Work for the Dole has been one of the bigger success stories for the Parkes electorate—not just in the bigger cities, like Dubbo, but also in the towns. Certainly, it has been an enormous issue in Broken Hill. Another $81.5 million is going into that. Once again, we have a government with a budget that has delivered to young people, delivered to education and delivered to training—and all of that in a tough budget.
The seat of Parkes is very export orientated. I think one of the most exciting things happening for a lot of our businesses is the fact that, because of this budget, in July we will have a TradeStart office opening in Dubbo. That office will do an enormous amount in educating, encouraging and running through the protocols with any business which may not have realised it had the potential to export. Out of this budget, there is more money going into the diesel fuel rebate for the hospitality and retail industries, which do not currently have commercial electricity available to them. Let me tell you, when you have a small business with the courage to go into those sorts of things—whether it be tourism or straight-out hospitality—and you do not have commercial electricity available to you, you certainly need a government that is willing to back you to that extent. That will cost over $20 million to implement. Our recommitment to the regional airlines and what we are doing for them gives my electorate every reason to be happy that we have a government delivering this sort of budget. Once again, we are talking about low interest rates and low inflation in this budget, because that is the way it has been designed. It is not borrowing $96 billion and it is not paying $5 million a year interest on that.
I started talking about small business and I repeat that my electorate revolves around it. We have a budget based on defence and security; it is a budget that deals with trouble before it gets to Australia. It deals with the costs of the future and it protects those who need its protection. It is a budget that recognises country needs, which are health, communication, education and business stability. I can go back to my electorate and look people in the eye when I tell them that they have a budget in tough times, but we will do the best for them that it is possible to do at this time.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2002-03</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1
"McLeay, Leo, MP",ALP,2002-06-03,"—I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03. It is sad to listen to someone who has gone through a metamorphosis. I remember the member for Parkes when he was, I think, the President of the New South Wales Farmers Association. He was a very strong advocate for people in rural Australia. In that incarnation, he understood the plight of people on the land. When you look at the city-country divide in this country, poor people in the country are far worse off than poor people in the city. But since the member for Parkes has become a member of the parliament, rather than as a National Party backbencher—
—Since he's become a Lib.
—Like most members of the National Party, he has become a Liberal in gumboots. The parliamentary secretary at the table was never stupid enough to join the National Party, even though they wanted him to.
—They used to stand for something.
—He had a better standard. National Party members, prior to their positions in this parliament, were proper farmers' advocates and had a thing to say about what people on the land needed, particularly people who live in the small country towns. Now you see them come into the House and say that a dollar extra on people's prescriptions does not matter much. It probably does not matter much to a member of parliament who is earning over $100,000 a year but, for the constituents of the member for Parkes, particularly the poor farmers whom he used to represent—and now he is walking out of the chamber—if they have two or three things wrong with them, a dollar per script represents a fair bit of money. There is nothing worse than National Party members, who out there on the stump are okay, but as soon as they get in here become Liberals in gumboots and forget the lot, figuring that they are now on $100,000 a year as a member of parliament, so the rest of the poor little people in the bush can go to hell. At least the parliamentary secretary reckoned everyone could go to hell; he did not care about them one way or the other. He has a little more credit going for him. I cannot help liking him, too, which is one of my sins rather than his.
This budget has not been a good budget for anyone. It certainly has not been a good budget for people in this country who are not well off. In the 22 years I have been in parliament I have not seen such a budget that attacks those least able to protect themselves. I did not think that I would find a budget that attacked the disabled, a budget that attacked those who are terribly sick, or a budget that basically says, `We haven't been able to identify a threat to Australia, but we're going to put a lot of money into defence.' Unfortunately, the people who are going to make the sacrifice are those at the bottom end of the scale. We will have some nice little tax cuts for people like the member for Parkes who are on high salaries. They will not have to pay as much on their superannuation levy— at least they think that, but we will not let that get through the Senate. We are giving tax cuts to the rich and imposts to the poor— a traditional Liberal government budget, one might think. Even in the past I did not see the Libs be as bad as that. To find new members coming in here who are apologists for things like this is just a little bit hard to take.
When we were debating the additional estimates for 2001-02, I was struck by the bits-and-pieces ordinariness of those bills. There was nothing in them that grabbed the imagination and nothing to inspire us or to give a lift to the Australian people. Often, the additional estimates are where governments come good—they have been naughty in the budget but they realise that they ought to put a bit of a lift back into the system. The additional estimates are where you find a bit of decency. But not this time—it was dull, plodding stuff. So what do we have now? We have more of the same—another unimaginative, uninspiring group of budget bills. They are hardly likely to bring much joy to anyone in the community, but they are very likely to bring unhappiness to those who are less well off.
The budget was introduced by the Treasurer with references to the war on terrorism and the depressing events of the previous eight months. The budget speech must have had some listeners wondering what was going to be announced next—war with Germany or something like that. He had some listeners thinking that they were listening to one of those 1939 broadcasts. They must have thought that war was about to be declared—in some ways I suppose it was, given the commitment of our troops in Afghanistan, our obligations under the ANZUS alliance and the fact that we were facing a time of increasing austerity. 
We would all be asked to tighten our belts, according to the Treasurer, and to make do with less for the sake of the cause—Australia et cetera. No doubt those references were intended to set the scene for what was to come in his speech: to justify the expenditure on defence and security, for example, to be paid for by cuts to other programs—welfare programs. The poor would pay, as they usually do in these circumstances. It was very depressing and I am not sure that it achieved much, nor do I believe that it fooled the Australian people. I think that the Australian people, while acknowledging that the past year has not been a good one, in many ways would like to go forward without being constantly reminded of past events, horrific as they were.
It was a strange way to begin a budget speech, and not in my view an appropriate way. People look to governments for leadership and a positive attitude. They look to the budget speech as one of the most important speeches made in parliament each year. The budget establishes the financial context for the coming year and it sets out the government's agenda. Just look at the amount of media interest it attracts. That media interest is generated in response to the interest of the public. The Treasurer had a captive audience that night. What did he do this year? He spent time delivering a lesson about the state of the world, focusing on doom and gloom— doom and gloom that none of us really needs to be reminded about. The government say that, in all the assessments that they make, there is no threat to Australia. But the government use it as a mechanism for tightening our belts and delivering on the surplus that they had squandered. As we are all aware, it was just another tactic to enable the Treasurer to put forward yet another miserable budget.
The so-called Intergenerational Report is another odd document which the Treasurer decided to feature as part of this year's budget package. It also seems to be designed as part of a softening-up process. You can see the government's tacticians' minds ticking—`Let's give them a bit of a blast on the ageing of the population and the low birth rate, then we will identify the emerging issues associated with an ageing population and then they will have to accept some proposals which try to address the problems resulting from looking after an increasing number of aged, sick and disadvantaged et cetera.' The budget is a bit of a mixed bag on those matters. It claims to be addressing their needs but I am not convinced that their needs are being addressed—quite the opposite in fact. Look at the reaction from the disabled and organisations representing them. 
Unlike what the member for Parkes says—his electorate must be different from everybody else's—we have all received messages from people who have been done in the eye by this budget. We have all seen reports in the media about the inequities that will be produced by the proposed changes to the disabled pension eligibility. By altering the work test for recipients of the disability pension from a minimum of 30 hours a week to a minimum of 15 hours a week the government will force genuinely disabled Australians to lose up to $52 a fortnight in payments and access to other benefits. If they do work, they could face a marginal effective tax rate of up to 80c in the dollar. It is outrageous to even try to make out that this measure will help people with disabilities. However, the government and ministers go out and tell that blatant untruth.
Far from encouraging people with disabilities to find work, this measure is a real disincentive to working more than 15 hours a week. It will have the opposite effect to what the government intend and it will be a terrible thing to visit upon people with disabilities who, more than any others, want to try and contribute and do their very best to become part of the community. This government are now going to sock them right in the hip pocket. They are going to give the disabled a hard choice to make: whether to try to overcome their disability and get back into the work force or to take a drop in the disability pension.
Look at the reaction to the proposed changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme by pensioners and others at the lower end of the income spectrum. They are justifiably worried and confused. The reaction of my constituents has been entirely different from that of the member for Parkes. No-one has rung my office to say, `Well, another $1 a week, what do I care?' I suppose if you were earning over $100,000 a year, as a member of parliament does, maybe you would not care all that much. However, if you are on the pension, you care a lot. If you are on a low income and you have a sick child, you care a lot. If you are struggling with a husband or wife who has a debilitating disease which means they need three or four different types of medication, you care a lot. To gratuitously say that an extra $1 a week is not much is just not to understand the situation at all.
Some commentators have questioned the government's research behind the Intergenerational Report, which is the government's next move on Australians. There is certainly not universal agreement among the experts in this field about what will happen. The threatened unimaginable bill for the taxpayers of the future may never eventuate. I believe that the government are taking a particularly pessimistic view, because that suits them, of the future and demands that might be placed on the welfare budget in order to justify the harsh budgetary measures in this year's budget. It is rather interesting that the Treasurer has brought this forward now. The report has been before the government for some time and there has been discussion for some years about the effect of the changing age profile of Australia. However, all of a sudden, when we have one of the worst budgets we have seen in the last decade, the government trot out this shock horror: no-one is going to be able to fund the baby boomers. The government are just overestimating the case.
To put a human face on some of the proposed budget measures, I would like to tell you about one of my constituents. As it is not question time, I can get into the specifics. This particular lady contacted my electorate office. She was most concerned about the cost of prescriptions. While the member for Parkes and other members of the government are not concerned about that, this ordinary Australian had a problem with that. She needs eight separate medications and she tells me that that is not unusual, particularly for some of the elderly in our community. Any increase in the cost of her prescriptions is not just another $1 a week; it is $8 a time. She has no choice about taking these medications. She has been prescribed them and she needs them to maintain her health at an acceptable standard. She is just one person out there who is concerned and upset about the cost of her pharmaceuticals, some of which are subsidised and some of which are not.
The government have said that the increased cost of pharmaceuticals would mean only an extra $52 a year for a pensioner. As we know from the people in our constituencies, even if it is only $52 a year, that is a significant amount of money for a pensioner. Every dollar counts when you are on a low income. It might not count when you are on $100,000 a year, but if you are on the pension, every dollar counts. However, the government do not understand that most people are on more than one prescribed medication. Sometimes they are on five or six—or eight, like my constituent. The government do not understand that when you are on a very limited income, this becomes a significant impost. It is fine if you are a healthy person who does not need medicines, but for those who are not healthy, like so many older people, it is a significant burden to have to meet the increased charges. Most of these older people have chronic illnesses. They require constant ongoing medication. They cannot afford to pay the increased costs of their prescribed pharmaceuticals.
Another example is the proposed changes to the eligibility for disability pensions. What the government are about to do is too cute by half. The government are starting to realise this themselves. Even with all their chest thumping at the beginning, and even with the speeches that government members have been making over the last few days on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03, while they are defending these outrageous claims and the things the government have done, the Prime Minister is quietly and carefully preparing the ground for a backtrack. 
With this government's budgets we get these big claims up front that they are going to do this, that or something else. But they misjudge public opinion every time and they backtrack a lot of the time, and we are seeing that at present. I think the government are starting to realise they have made a mistake. Labor and the community have made sure they understand that what has happened to pharmaceuticals and what has happened to the disability pension is just so outrageous that even this government, with a smokescreen of national security, are not going to be able to get away with it. That has happened so often under this government: they come up with what they think is a good idea and then they are forced to come to grips with the full implications of the policy. That is what happens when you let ideology get in the way of good sense. That is part of the problem with this government: ideology always gets in the way of good sense and then after the outrage occurs they have to fix it up. You have to wonder why the government runs into this tactic so often. You have to wonder why they did not learn the first time and get smart the second time or the third time or the fourth time. If they listened to the marginal seat holder at the table, the honourable member for Leichhardt, they might realise they should get smart the second or the third time. But they do not and that is their problem.
Ultimately, even governments full of ideology like this one have to bow to public opinion. And we all know where they are going to go: they announce draconian measures and then they seek to backtrack after they have terrified everyone. Why do they do it? Why do they want to frighten old people? Why do they want to frighten people with disabilities? Why do they want to frighten the most disadvantaged people in our community? Why don't they just come clean at the beginning? But no.
Even today we have seen yet another apparent backflip. On budget night, the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Vanstone, was unequivocal in her threat to withhold $100 million of Commonwealth, state and territory disability agreement funding promised before the election campaign if Labor did not vote for cuts to the disability support pension. As the minister said, the increases would also be dependent on parliament passing the government legislation on disability support pension reforms. But what did we have today on the Alan Jones program—Alan Jones, the Prime Minister's ideological friend, the former Liberal candidate for the state seat of Earlwood, Malcolm Fraser's speechwriter, the man who has disgraced himself over many years? What did the Prime Minister say to the parrot today? The Prime Minister, in commenting to the parrot, said:
... there are two things that were in the budget linked to the changes to the Disability Support Pension. One of them was additional funds called unmet need money, and the other was an investment in new services. Now in relation to the investment in the new services we can't make that money available if the changes to the Disability Support Pension is blocked. In relation to the other issue that is something we'll have to give consideration to.
There we are: a backdown. He tells the parrot, the parrot tells the Sydney community and what we have once again is a budget that sets out to hurt people, and the government will have to change it.

"Draper, Trish, MP",LP,2002-06-03,"—I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03. The budget introduced by the Treasurer on 14 May provides a blueprint for future governments on how to respond effectively and fairly to a growing international threat to Australia and its people. None of us could have predicted the events of September 11 and their aftermath but they have caused this nation, as well as our friends and allies, to devote greater resources and attention to the safety and protection of our borders and to fight a war in the defence of our way of life.
At the same time, the Treasurer has not neglected the very real need to plan for our future. Governments have often been criticised for focusing only on short-term responses to issues and a failure to adopt a long-term vision in response to changing circumstances and to build a better, stronger and more prosperous nation. The Intergenerational Report does this. It provides the government and the community with the necessary tools for the creation of sound policy that will serve us well into the future.
The report provides a picture of what Australia will look like 40 years from now. We are an ageing population, which means we have to design policies today that will provide equitable services to the people of tomorrow while maintaining strong economic growth and security that has been so much a part of the focus and the success of the Howard government. Australia is not alone in facing this situation. Most Western nations are having to cope with an ageing population. It will not be long before the baby boomer generation starts to reach old age—the middle of the next decade. If we do not start planning now then our welfare system will simply not be able to cope with the increasing demands that will be made on it.
A report released late last year State of the nation 2001: a century of change by the Centre for Independent Studies demonstrated how government expenditure had tripled over the last four decades and that the largest increases in spending were on education, health and welfare. According to figures from the Commonwealth Department of Family and Community Services, the percentage of Australians receiving pensions and benefits increased from five per cent in 1973 to 18.4 per cent in 1998.
To do nothing in response to the clear evidence that an ageing population will mean a greater call on the public purse for health and welfare needs would be to abrogate our responsibility as legislators. The Intergener-ational Report shows us that our budgetary position is in good shape now and probably will be for the next 10 years. But if we fail to make long-term plans today, taxpayers in the future could face much higher taxes, and a high taxation regime would stifle enterprise and lead to a decline in the economy, leaving future generations with even less ability to pay for required services and welfare. Taking action now is a responsible path for the government to take, and I congratulate the Treasurer and the ministry on acting responsibly and in the national interest.
One item in the budget on which the opposition has attempted to engender a scare campaign is the decision to restore the balance between what the government pays and the contributions patients make to the cost of their medicines. The government subsidises the cost of a range of medicines to make them affordable through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. This will continue but, in order to maintain the scheme's viability, the government is asking people to pay a little more for some of their medicines. 
Pensioners and concession cardholders will be asked to pay an extra $1 per script but only up to 52 scripts. After that, they pay nothing. General patients will pay a little more but it is important to remember that the price will only rise if the medication has already reached the ceiling rate of $28.60. If the medicine is priced below the ceiling rate, then there will be no increase as a result of this budget measure. For example, Ventolin is a medicine much used by sufferers of asthma, but Ventolin is below the ceiling rate so the price of Ventolin will not change. In fact, the price of many antibiotics will not change. An example of this is Augmentin. It costs $18.19. It will still cost $18.19 following this budget measure. There is no change, because it is priced below the ceiling rate.
The real cost of medication is hardly ever discussed but it ought to be something all Australians understand and appreciate, because without the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—that is, a subsidisation of medicines by the federal government, and the taxpayers, more importantly—we would be asked to pay hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars for each and every script. By way of illustration, the actual cost, I am advised, of a recently listed treatment for cancer on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is $6,745 per script. This is what patients would have to pay if the PBS did not exist. But, because of government subsidisation, the most a pensioner will have to pay for a prescription is $4.60.
I believe the public would benefit from having this information included on their receipts when they purchase their medication, because by knowing the actual cost they would have a greater appreciation of the decisions that governments of all political persuasions have to make when formulating their budget priorities. Setting national priorities is something only governments can do, but an informed and advised citizenry can increase the chances of ensuring the right priorities are set.
With regard to higher education, recent figures released by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee show a significant increase in university enrolments in 2002. Numbers have increased by 14 per cent over 2001 to an estimated 835,327 students. It is certainly true that a university education is attracting greater numbers despite the doomsayers and protestations when the government made changes to HECS. Mutual obligation is no deterrent to those who understand the value of education. But is quantity to be the only and final judgment of a system of education? The Governor of the Reserve Bank, Ian Macfarlane, made the observation at the recent Towards Opportunity and Prosperity conference in Melbourne:
... although we have made great progress in the breadth of our education system, we cannot make the same claims about the depth. At the higher level of higher education we are not keeping up.
Another eminent Australian, the Hon. James Spigelman, Chief Justice of New South Wales, in a recent article in the public affairs journal Quadrant, expressed a view about the limits of quantitative assessment. The jurist said:
Not everything that counts can be counted. Some matters can only be judged—that is to say they can only be assessed in a qualitative way.
The quality of a nation's education system, in this latest wave of globalisation, is becoming increasingly important. That is why I am very pleased to support the minister in his decision to instigate a higher education review. As Dr Nelson said when making this announcement:
The higher education sector is at an important crossroads. Fourteen years after the last major reforms, it is time to take stock of where we are, where we want to go and how we intend to get there. We must have the maturity as a nation to now consider our policy options for the future.
True to the progressive nature of this government, the minister is challenging all of those involved in the education sector, in industry and in the general community to take a renewed look at the way higher education is delivered in this country. He challenges us to strive to have one or two universities in the top universities in the world. I dare say many Australians would be surprised to learn we do not have any Australian universities numbering among the 50 best universities in the world. I share the minister's enthusiasm to take up this challenge.
Because this is a government which is forever looking for new and better ways to advance the Australian nation and its people, it sometimes surprises me to see how policy negligent the opposition has become. When Minister Nelson asked, as he did at the Economic and Social Outlook Conference in Melbourne, `What are the barriers in Australia that prevent private investment in university infrastructure as occurs in other countries?' a person could have been forgiven for answering, `The Labor Party.' The Labor Party have become so opposed to private enterprise and so opposed to small business that they are fast gaining the reputation as the blocker of all new and invigorating measures to improve the quality of services and outcomes for the Australian people.
They ought to take a look at what their cousins in the United Kingdom are up to. The Labour government of Prime Minister Tony Blair do not share their Australian counterpart's dislike and distrust of private enterprise. Quite happily, they are working on improving service delivery in health and education through partnerships with the private sector. In fact, the Labour Secretary of State for Education and Skills, Estelle Morris, has recently been advocating private sector involvement in schools as a means of lifting standards and improving outcomes.
Improved standards and outcomes are nowhere more needed than in the area of our natural environment, and I commend the measures announced in this budget by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Dr David Kemp. As the minister stated in a recent article in the Australian:
... we are not yet managing Australia's environment on a sustainable basis. Although good progress has been made in a number of key quality-of-life areas—such as urban air quality, improved streetscapes and parks and more energy efficient homes—the main national tasks of halting and reversing the destruction of prime agricultural land through salinity and the degradation of water quality in our river systems remain.
In this year's budget, the government has allocated a further $100.7 million to tackle salinity and improve water quality as part of the seven-year $1.4 billion National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. South Australia, Victoria, Tasmania, Queensland and New South Wales have all signed bilateral agreements with the Commonwealth to implement the national action plan, which targets the 21 regions that have been the worst affected by salinity and poor water quality. Working with the local communities, sustainable natural resource management strategies will be planned and implemented. The government is also working with state governments on a package of water efficiency projects in the Murray-Darling Basin as part of an initiative to restore up to 28 per cent of average natural flow to the Snowy River and increased environmental flows in the River Murray. One of the targeted water quality projects, I am pleased to say, is in Adelaide's Port River waterways, which is well known for its dolphin population.
It is sometimes said that a society can best be judged by the way it treats its most vulnerable members. Australians have never shirked their responsibilities when it comes to offering a helping hand to a person in genuine need. True to this national tradition, the Howard government is implementing the Personal Support Program as part of Australians Working Together. Personal Support Program providers will help people who have multiple, non-vocational barriers to employment such as drug and alcohol problems, mental illness, homelessness or domestic violence. They will assist people to achieve goals that match their abilities, capacities and circumstances. The Personal Support Program will help people with many personal barriers to move towards employment and join in the community. It will also encourage local organisations to network with each other to deliver better services.
I am particularly pleased with the announcement that a number of organisations will deliver the Personal Support Program to needy people in my electorate of Makin. I wish to congratulate and thank the Adelaide Central Mission, Centacare Australia, Community Bridging Services, Heta Corporation, the Offenders Aid and Rehabilitation Services of South Australia, Ostara Australia, South Australia Career Consultants, the Service to Youth Council, Relationships Australia, Anglicare South Australia, Baptist Community Services South Australia, Career Systems Inc., Para Worklinks Inc. and Workskill Inc. not only for being successful in tendering to become program providers but also for demonstrating an ongoing commitment to our local community. This is solid proof, once again, of the value of government, private enterprise and community organisations working together to provide improved services to the community.
I will be supporting this bill because it delivers on the promises made to the Australian people by the Prime Minister during last year's election campaign. The measures it seeks to implement will provide more not only for the defence of our nation and the protection of the Australian people but also for the foundations for our long-term prosperity. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2002-03</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1
"Grierson, Sharon, MP",ALP,2002-06-03,"—I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03 that has been a shock for most people in Australia. The 2002-03 budget was not just a fiscal failure for Australia but also a failure for the people of Newcastle, who I represent in this House. After 10 years of economic growth, a low inflation rate and decreasing national unemployment figures, the best economic performance the Treasurer, Peter Costello, could achieve was a $1.2 billion deficit. To create a surplus in the coming financial year, the government will overlook Newcastle, regional Australia and sound fiscal management and will expect those who can least afford it—the aged, the chronically ill and those with disabilities—to help them out of their financial mismanagement.
This government would like us to believe that, because of new security threats, tough decisions were needed to get the economy back on track. No-one denies that this is the right time to make sure our defence and security forces are well resourced and well equipped, but securing the country and securing our future economically and socially should go hand in hand. It seems that this government only makes tough decisions after an election, but it is happy to squander our future on election sweeteners—elections sweeteners that it is now obvious we could not afford.
Costello and Howard intend to save $2 billion on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and $350 million by toughening up the eligibility criteria for disability payments. Every health card recipient will now pay $1 more each time they fill an essential prescription for the first 52 prescriptions—one prescription a week, every week of the year. Thankfully, our veterans escaped this increase. But, if you are not on a benefit, you will need to find $28.60 per prescription—an extra $6.20 each time. We will all pay more, but this measure will particularly affect families with several members needing regular medications.
In Newcastle we have a particularly high rate of respiratory disorders, and there is now very real fear that families will cut back on preventative medication because they will just not be able to afford it. The potential human suffering that could result is one our local doctors look on with dread. So everyone will pay more, whilst our pharmaceutical companies refuse to lower the prices of prescription drugs and pass on the money they saved when sales tax was removed and exemption from the GST allowed them to make even greater profits.
To top that off, the Costello budget will make it tougher for people to receive disability support payments. If they are assessed as being able to work just 15 hours a week, they will be forced on to the lower unemployment assistance payments—a reduction of up to $52 per fortnight—and they are expected, of course, to look for work. Last week in the parliament I named a constituent of Newcastle who in the last two years has applied for 175 jobs and remains unsupported by the Job Network system, and if we follow this budget we are going to put more people in this position.
Newcastle has the second highest level of disability payments in the country—not only a legacy perhaps of our industrial past, but also a direct consequence of people needing to be close to special disability support services and health care that Newcastle, the regional capital, offers. Many people with disabilities will now be expected to join the other 10 per cent of our local population competing for jobs—all for the cold comfort of knowing that the government is saving $350 million and that the Treasurer, Peter Costello, thinks that these measures `will improve their self-esteem and self-reliance'.
But there is no corresponding boost to employment and training programs or any major changes to the Job Network system. Although Job Network agencies will now have to spend a minimum of $850 per long-term unemployed person to help with their job-seeking costs, this is made possible because they failed to spend $214 million of the intensive assistance funds allocated last year. That money was not spent, because the Job Network agencies did not reach their outcome targets and did not actually put people into real jobs. So in Newcastle 22,000 people will still be looking for employment.
Another 8,500 Work for the Dole positions Australia-wide over three years and a modest bonus system for employers to take on apprentices are very poor substitutes for job creation projects, which would have been most welcomed in Newcastle. The reality for the people of Newcastle is that, for every 100 people on a Work for the Dole project, only eight will actually gain a job. Of course, while they are working for the dole, they are not undertaking training courses that perhaps could equip them better for the employment market. In an area of high unemployment with high numbers of mature age unemployed, there was no funding in this budget for regional job creation schemes targeting local needs. Incentives for business growth seemed to come from small gains in existing innovation and export programs, but support for strategic industry development is left for the states, apparently.
There was also no funding for regional infrastructure or capital projects that could boost our local economy and create much needed jobs. So the football stadium that, as Andrew Johns would say, we so dearly need—and I would agree—joins the many capital infrastructure projects on the Hunter wish list that the Howard government expects the state government and the community to pay for. There is no funding for a national transport plan to make sure regional Australia has access to the best freight and transport links. There is no funding for port development in Newcastle and there is no funding of partnerships to deliver high-speed broadband and telecommunication links to the people of Newcastle.
Budget support for regional aviation extends to the Gold Coast and Canberra, apparently, but not to Newcastle. But the Newcastle tax office may pick up some of the jobs it lost last year, with the expansion of compliance and taxation recovery units so that small and large business can be pursued for tax avoidance. It is quite ironic that small business looked forward to some gains to compensate them for the burden of GST collection that they have to bear.
As for big business, Newcastle's major employers, health and education, missed out completely. It appears no accident that financial support to these vital areas continues to decrease under the government as they pursue their mean-spirited policies that divide Australia into those who can afford private health care and private education and those who will be left with access to a far diminished public health and education sector. These measures to diminish education and health care must and will be resisted by those of us on the opposition benches. We will not stand by and allow the government to dismantle a public education system and a public health system that were the envy of the world. But each successive budget of the government makes our task so much harder.
On a first reading of the budget, there seem to be some extra GP places and higher Medicare rebates for lower income patients. But these appear to be only for GPs in outer metropolitan areas of capital cities, not regional cities. In fact, Newcastle may have to provide service to assist the capital cities when we too face challenges in retaining enough GPs for Novocastrians. It is also unlikely that any of the six new regional facilities for radiation oncology are meant for Newcastle, but we are well served in that area. However, we would have liked to have seen some support for our burgeoning medical research industry. After this budget, aged care remains seriously underfunded and access to dental care for those on support payments and low incomes has not been reintroduced. Intergenerational change apparently means that as you get older the government will do less for you unless you are fortunate enough to have benefited from high income tax subsidies during your working life. Match those omissions in health spending with no increased investment in schools, TAFEs or universities and you may understand that this government is dodging its real responsibility for securing our future.
If securing the country from terrorism and asylum seekers is the real agenda in Costello's budget, then what will Newcastle gain? Nothing, it seems. One year's expenditure to complete the upgrade of facilities at Williamtown RAAF base is very pleasing, but hours after the budget was released Senator Hill quietly announced that his government would favour new partnerships to rationalise defence shipbuilding. This effectively would mean that a region like Newcastle with a strong and proud shipbuilding heritage would now be outside the naval shipping contract process. So the Newcastle based ADI facility that delivered the minehunters on time and on budget need no longer apply. For this mean--spirited and short-sighted government, New South Wales shipbuilding industry and high-tech jobs in Newcastle are apparently quite dispensable.
In the budget, there are some rewards for the more fortunate. The 15 per cent surcharge on superannuation contributions by higher income earners will be reduced over the next three years to 10½ per cent and the age for personal contributions will be raised to 75. If you have spare cash, you can contribute to a child's super fund without it affecting your entitlements and with no requirement that you use your superannuation as a pension—a saving system for the rich. The reality that this policy ignores is that since superannuation was introduced the take-up of the age pension has not diminished in a correlated way. So, instead of introducing measures that assist more people to save for their retirement, this budget assists the most wealthy to avoid taxation.
For intending mothers, the baby bonus sees higher earners receiving more to care for their babies, although all mothers know that babies come with the same costs irrespective of the family's income. The First Home Owners Scheme also continues without any means test being applied. If investment is your aim, then you might prepare to buy more Telstra shares, planned for release perhaps as early as next July as we see the National Party ready to sell out rural and regional Australia. But it is worth noting that the increased consumption and monetary flow that result from measures like the home owners grant have already contributed to an increase in inflation and an upward pressure on interest rates. With national and credit debt at an all time high, these bonuses may very soon turn into mortgage nightmares for many Novocastrians and many Australians.
This budget disregards the needs of the people of Newcastle and, in doing so, it robs Australia of increased economic prosperity. Newcastle is a clever city that contributes significantly to the national economy. With planned strategic support from the federal government and encouragement of focused partnerships with the private sector, major economic, social and environmental dividends could be achieved. But this budget does not reflect clever thinking or a willingness to work with regions like Newcastle to maximise economic performance. So it falls on me as the representative of the people of Newcastle in this House to give some guidance to the government. 
The following is a Hunter and Newcastle wish list that we would like to see advanced through strategic federal policy that targets regional and urban development, promotes public-private partnerships, invests in regional infrastructure, encourages cooperation across all tiers of government and delivers genuine economic growth and community prosperity. The wish list for Newcastle would include funding support for the following projects and programs: a new international standard football stadium; local employment programs that provide local jobs for long-term unemployed and disadvantaged job seekers; increased resources for our schools and hospitals in Newcastle; support for a multipurpose shipping terminal to expand the port of Newcastle—the most economic and efficient port in Australia; efficient and competitive regional aviation services at Newcastle airport, and perhaps we here understand that, at the moment, regional aviation has not been delivering efficient service; support for a new clean steel industry in Newcastle; support for the provision of broadband services to Newcastle and the Hunter; expanded defence presence in the Newcastle and Hunter region; higher funding levels for Newcastle university, so it can reduce its lecture sizes and increase its face-to-face teaching and its research programs; increased GP training places at regional universities such as Newcastle; higher rebates to GPs for low income patient groups; family support packages that target early parenting, child care and early learning; sufficient funds for the delivery of quality age care in residential facilities and at home; reinstatement of the Commonwealth dental program; support for the construction of the Hunter Medical Research Institute Centre; a new Federal Court building in Newcastle with accommodation for our Family Court, which suffers under great pressures at the moment; expansion of the new CSIRO energy centre as a centre of excellence in national energy strategy and environmental sustainability. 
Perhaps some top-up funds for the Social and Community Services employees award in New South Wales would also stop programs from ceasing in Newcastle. We would also have liked to have seen some increased staff levels in Commonwealth departments, like Centrelink. In our office we have dealt with 500 cases in five months. With three Centrelink offices we know the pressures that those people are working under. We would also like to see some relocation of Commonwealth departments back into Newcastle. Perhaps our unemployment rate would decrease as well. The list is a very long one, but so much could be achieved if the Howard government supported investment in regional cities like Newcastle. Unfortunately, budget expenditure on short-sighted and exclusive policies that ignore local needs, like we have seen in this budget, will fail to deliver for the people of Newcastle.
I also support the amendment proposed by the opposition. The opposition's amendment condemns the Howard government for its failure to deliver a budget surplus; for its failure to deliver a budget surplus without breaking previous commitments on defence, roads and working credits; for its false claims that cuts to health and welfare payments are needed to fund border protection and the war against terrorism; and for wasting $5 billion of taxpayers' money by gambling in foreign currency markets through cross-currency derivatives. The losses in defence spending because of our foreign exchange risk not being managed has been sorely felt by this country. It is a budget of failure. It has failed to consider the fairer options that we have put forward to offset the harsh measures that it imposes on families, the sick and the disabled. This budget fails in its strategies to deal with the ageing population, fails in positioning us for the knowledge future, and it certainly fails the people of Newcastle. Fortunately, Newcastle has always been a region that backs itself—with the callous disregard shown to the people of Newcastle and the Hunter region by the Howard-Costello government through this budget—and it is just as well. We will need much resolve and much determination to recover from this budget. We deserve better and we will continue to assert that in this House.
Today we had a visit from the Lord Mayor of Newcastle and the general manager, working with two other regional cities— Geelong and Wollongong—to put forward strategic policies for regional cities. I would hope that, through their efforts and the community efforts of Newcastle, we see in the next budget some recognition of regional Australia and some policies that target regional development, that equip regions to compete effectively in this economy and that provide the infrastructure and capital projects that they need to prosper.
In conclusion, this is a budget that fails Australia. It is a budget that is fiscally irresponsible. It is a budget that fails Newcastle. In targeting the people who can least afford it—the chronically ill, the disadvantaged, people with disabilities and families perhaps struggling with illness—it certainly dodges the responsibility to build prosperous and harmonious communities.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2002-03</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1
"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2002-06-03,"—On the 26th of this month, my son Julian will celebrate his 16th birthday, which is great news. Unfortunately, not so great news is that he will be eligible for his learner driver plates. Of course, self-interest is the best interest when you try to take notice of issues and you want to do something about them. So, in that interest, I have looked at the issue of novice drivers, particularly in my home state of Tasmania, and the statistics related to novice drivers. It is an area of concern for two different but related reasons, and I would like to share these reasons with the House.
First of all, I do not wish to say that novice drivers cause all the road crashes, but the statistics do indicate improved novice driver safety would result in a substantial road safety benefit. The second is that currently in this country we do not have specific codes such as exist in New Zealand and the UK related to motor vehicle advertising, and it is an area of concern. All that exists are some very general statements in section 2 of the equally general advertising standards guidelines, so general in fact that one could—excuse the pun—drive a semi through them. Many motoring bodies throughout Australia and concerned community groups have tried to rectify the situation, and slowly the car industry is beginning to move on the issue. A self-regulatory code has been produced, initially without much consultation but, hopefully, that is being addressed now—although I notice that the Australian Automobile Association has accused the proponents of the code of being `tardy and dismissive' in establishing the code. 
I will, along with many other interested parents and concerned citizens and organisations, watch these developments closely to ensure that we do not have advertising which contradicts the basic road safety message that `speed kills' both on—and I would add—off public roads and even in family driveways. Despite Australia having the highest fatality and injury statistics for driveway accidents involving children in the world—an appalling statistic—we have a TV advertisement of a car weaving through toys in a driveway with a youngster looking on with glee and enjoyment. I am sure, Mr Speaker, you will attest that I am no stick in the mud and I can laugh with the best, but what is the message in this advertisement? I noticed in a recent discussion of this matter in the Australian newspaper on 23 May 2002 that a spokesperson for the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries—questioned, I must add, by non-industry people—said:
... under the agreed proposals ... no fines will be administered to offending carmakers but any ads deemed to contravene the code will need to be modified or dropped.
I certainly hope there is a renegotiation of this pretty insipid proposal. Self-regulation is not an excuse to pussyfoot around. It is a means to deal effectively with an issue without the need for external regulation—and I emphasise the word `need'. I can assure everyone interested in this matter that insipid or dismissive self-regulatory practices will result in sustained political and community pressure to dramatically change the situation. I know there are many, both on my side of the House and on the other side of the House, that will not allow this insipid self-regulation to take place, if that is what they intend. I note the work of Senator Boswell in trying to advance this matter and I hope Minister Anderson provides some determined leadership to support his efforts.
I was going to introduce some more sobering statistics to share with you, Mr Speaker, the House and my son Julian, but I will do that when I get home and particularly on his birthday on the 26th of this month. Happy birthday, Julian.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Road Safety</title>,Adjournment,10,1
