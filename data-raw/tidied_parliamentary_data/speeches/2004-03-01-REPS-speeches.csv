"Jull, David, MP",LP,2004-03-01,"—On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, I present the committee's report entitled Intelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—In the three months since the committee adopted the report, a number of factors have intervened which have confirmed the more tentative of the committee's findings. In particular, the final report of Dr David Kay to the President of the United States and the United States Congress consolidates the committee's conclusion that there was unlikely to be large stocks of weapons of mass destruction—certainly none readily deployable. At one level, the accuracy of the prewar intelligence on Iraq must be judged against this reality.
The committee's terms of reference asked it to examine the nature, accuracy and independence of prewar intelligence and the accuracy and completeness of the government's presentation of that information to this parliament and to the people of Australia. In the course of its inquiry, the committee held one public hearing and a number of private hearings with the intelligence agencies. Twenty-four submissions were received. The submissions from the intelligence agencies outlined, by way of extracts, the assessments that were made on Iraq prior to the war. The Director-General of ONA assured the committee that these extracts were representative—`a reasonable reflection of what was said to government'. Chapter 2 of the report quotes the assessments at length so that readers can get a clear sense of what was being said in the agencies' own words, because assessments are very specifically worded and cannot be easily summarised.
On the question of independence, the committee was unable to make definitive pronouncements. Most of the intelligence relating to Iraq came from overseas sources, particularly our major intelligence-sharing partners—the US and the UK. The Australian agencies said that they saw all the intelligence, both raw and assessed, and were therefore able to make their own judgments. They also assured the committee that the intelligence-sharing arrangements were good. However, they claimed not to know until very late about the dissenting views within the US agencies on issues such as the claims about uranium from Africa, because the classified US National Intelligence Estimate was not supplied to them for four months after its US `release' in October 2002. Moreover, agencies did not appear to be completely clear about what was happening inside the British Joint Intelligence Committee as the September dossier was being developed. This may not be surprising.
The volume of material on Iraq coming to the agencies from all sources was increasing—a tenfold increase in reports just prior to the war—although it is notable that the actual number of reports underpinning this percentage was small. Only two in 10 reports came from tested sources, and it was not clear how many actual sources were involved in this increased reporting. The committee was unable to examine the quality and clarity of this information received from overseas. Nevertheless, it was clear from the assessments received that the Australian agencies, particularly the DIO, remained more cautious than their larger overseas counterparts.
Both Australian agencies reported directly to ministers and the Prime Minister. As far as independence from internal political pressure is concerned, the Australian agencies denied any political pressure. The committee noted this and accepted it. However, the committee was aware of a sudden and as yet unexplained change in the assessments provided by ONA between 12 and 13 September 2002. The assessment of 13 September was made at the request of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and was the basis of government speeches. The change marks a divergence in assessments between ONA and DIO, and DIO commented in their submission that `the final product was not formally cleared by the contributing agencies'. This was the only hint the committee received of any dispute between the agencies.
With respect to accuracy, hindsight is, of course, a wonderful thing. Assessing the accuracy of the intelligence was complicated by the moving feast of revelations that has been occurring during the past 12 months. The committee looked at as much information as it could. It considered the evidence and reports of the British Intelligence and Security Committee and the British parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee. It examined all the evidence made public by the Hutton inquiry, although that report was not issued until well after the committee had finalised and adopted its own report. It followed the wealth of public commentary by news organisations from around the world. Our conclusion was that the assessments of the Australian intelligence community were more moderate and cautious than those of the partner agencies in the US and the UK. However, despite their caution, insofar as they thought there were any weapons of mass destruction left in Iraq, it is possible they overstated their case.
It should be noted that up to 13 September 2002 both Australian analytical agencies had similar views. They both spoke of small stocks of WMD, degraded and declining capacity, inconclusive and patchy evidence, and disputes overseas regarding aluminium tubes. As the war approached, the Defence Intelligence Organisation continued to be sceptical and in hindsight provided the most accurate assessments. These are summarised in chapter 4 of the report. The DIO argued that Iraqi possession of WMD was `possible' and the rebuilding of capacity was `likely'; however, right up to the war they assessed that there were no nuclear weapons and there was no evidence of production of chemical or biological weapons, no intelligence on the location of WMD and no reliable intelligence that Saddam had delegated authority to use chemical or biological weapons in the event of war. It appeared that the ONA, particularly after 13 September, was more ready to extrapolate a threatening scenario from historical experience, more ready to accept the new and mostly untested intelligence and more ready to see the rebuilding of dual-use infrastructure and mobile facilities as indicating the concealment of new production and the consequent possession by Iraq of WMD.
It seemed to the committee that the judgments made about the strategic circumstances in Iraq—factors underpinning many of the assessments—did not take full account of Iraq's recent history; namely, the 1991 Gulf War and its extensive bombing, the sanctions, the inspections and the further bombing in 1998. I am reminded of a previous so-called intelligence failure: the failure of Western intelligence to recognise the potential for collapse in the Soviet Union. To paraphrase some famous lines, Iraq in 2002, like the Soviet Union then, was like `a broken spring in the factory yard, rust clinging to a form that strength had left, hard and curled and ready to snap'. Much credence was given to the prevailing view that UNSCOM inspections, despite their being determined, meticulous and intrusive, had not been effective. While these matters might underpin assessments, they are, of course, also matters for advice to government from the broader policy departments. The committee did not pursue this issue as it fell outside its terms of reference. The committee also concluded that assessments that suggested there was a continuing interest in WMD—and this was the view of both Australian agencies—were valid.
On the accuracy and completeness of the government's presentation, the committee found that the presentation by the Australian government was more moderate and more measured than that of its alliance partners. The government did not rely entirely on the intelligence from the Australian intelligence agencies for the speeches it made prior to the war. Information came from a number of sources: directly from the US National Intelligence Estimate and the UK dossiers, and from UNSCOM and UNMOVIC reports. The Office of National Assessments checked speeches for accuracy but, where the speeches relied on direct overseas sources, they were checked for the accuracy of the transcription, not the content itself. It was not clear to the committee whether the government had questioned the obvious change in ONA assessments in late 2002. Clearly, problems with intelligence-sharing arrangements and intelligence handling have become apparent as a result of this experience. Correcting those problems will be an important challenge for the future. Good intelligence is too important.
The committee would like to reiterate the view that there are limits to which intelligence can and should be used. Intelligence is not an exact science and never provides a complete picture. It is fragmentary, indicative and speculative, suggestive rather than definitive. When the ONA was established in 1977, it was envisaged that there had to be a protective barrier between the assessments of agencies and the political process. This needs to be reaffirmed. Broader issues of Australia's intelligence-sharing arrangements with partner agencies also need to be re-examined in the light of the apparent failure of, or the potential for possible interference with, intelligence in these domains.
In the light of its findings, and noting the inherent limitations on any parliamentary inquiry, the committee has recommended that there should be an independent assessment of the performance of the intelligence agencies, conducted by an experienced former intelligence expert with full access to all the material, which will report to the National Security Committee of cabinet and which, in the light of the matters raised— (Time expired)",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>ASIO, ASIS and DSD Committee</title>",Committees,0,1
"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2004-03-01,"—by leave—There is a great deal in the chairman's tabling statement with which I agree. He was not able to get out the remainder of that recommendation for an inquiry, but it will be obvious from the report. It is also obvious from what has appeared in the press. As he would no doubt have done had he had an extra couple of minutes, I express the thanks of the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD to Margaret Swieringa and Charles Vagi, who did the bulk of the work on the report and assembled it all for us. We are indeed very grateful for their efforts, as we are grateful for the efforts of Tiana Di Iulio and Daniel Miletic, who also assisted.
Australia did not go to war because intelligence made available to the Australian government through its agencies suggested a clear and immediate danger was posed by Iraqi WMD either directly or through passage to terrorist organisations. However, Australians were entitled to think that those were the reasons we went to war, given the cases presented by the Prime Minister and his ministers. Well before such intelligence hardened up in the latter part of 2002—and even then it did not harden sufficiently to present a clear and compelling case—the Prime Minister had declared his support for American action if it occurred. By the middle of 2002 the Prime Minister had gone clearly to a domestic political pitch that sought to box any critical comments by his domestic political opponents to a war course as anti-American and a danger to the alliance. Having thus positioned himself he placed his government and his country on the coat-tails of any actions our allies undertook. To have abandoned that course would not have killed the US alliance; it has more substance to it than that. The US, however, would have lost his address as firmly as it lost David Lange's back in the 1980s. That was what was at stake. We can all make our judgments on the value of that.
Though our intelligence community may well have got some judgments wrong—and, as this report points out, there is a need for close analysis of its interpretative capabilities and the way it advises government—it is innocent of any responsibility for a determination to go to war. That responsibility lies with politicians. Another more important responsibility lies with politicians: they must not shift blame to agencies which are vital to the struggle with international terrorism. That struggle is an intelligence and police struggle. To discredit them where they do not deserve it is to weaken us in that struggle.
What this report makes amply clear is that there were deficiencies in intelligence and in our intelligence structures. There was never, however—particularly from the Defence Intelligence Organisation but also the Office of National Assessments—emphatically delivered hard advice without some form of qualification attached. The exaggeration and the sense of immediacy was the work of politicians, outside the intelligence advice they were being presented with—at least from the Australian agencies and, I would suggest, their American and British counterparts. Insofar as that internal intelligence reporting came close on rare occasions to government presentation, it can be seen, at least in part, as a response to unusual pressures placed on them by the atmosphere created by the political leadership—not direct pressure by the political leadership—which was determined on a course to war.
Given the self-interested leaking that has occurred of committee findings and conclusions, I would suggest, as a counter to that, diligent attention to chapter 5. It analyses the relevant speeches of ministers against the background of the intelligence they received from our intelligence community. In those speeches a case was presented that suggested the continued existence of a `massive program' of WMD, that quantities unaccounted for were `large' and that, rather than increasing the terrorist threat, action in Iraq would `make it less likely that a devastating terrorist attack will be carried out against Australia'. As the committee finds in paragraph 5.16:
Therefore, the case made by the government was that Iraq possessed WMD in large quantities and posed a grave and unacceptable threat to the region and the world, particularly as there was a danger that Iraq's WMD might be passed to terrorist organisations.
But as the committee says in paragraph 5.17:
This is not the picture that emerges from an examination of all the assessments provided to the Committee by Australia's two analytical agencies.
The committee also says:
... accuracy must also encompass whether the picture being presented is complete. Ignoring significant elements of fact or opinion when citing intelligence assessments can have a distorting effect.
Completely excluded from any minister's presentation were intelligence assessments that war might provoke the circumstances in which WMD might be used or passed on to terrorists. The government, however, in fact received such advice from the intelligence community. Ignoring it was a very big call indeed, given the circumstances of September 11.
A typical example of distorting effects is shown in paragraph 5.22, where it says that the Prime Minister used materials provided by Saddam Hussein's son-in-law in 1995 as evidence of `a massive program for developing offensive biological weapons—one of the largest and most advanced in the world'. As the committee points out, the bulk of the debriefing of Saddam Hussein's son-in-law pointed to a repeated failure of these programs and the destruction of them in the wake of successful UNSCOM inspections. Rather than being a current assessment of the state of affairs, it was what Saddam Hussein's son-in-law said was the state of affairs, until things were effectively dealt with by UNSCOM inspections.
The PM now relies on the capture of Hussein and the end of his bloody tyranny as a justification for war. As the committee points out, in the lead-up to war he specifically disclaimed this as an adequate case for war. `The world,' says the Prime Minister, `is a better and safer place without him.' Certainly the world is a better place; whether it is safer is yet to be determined. On the positive side, the Iraqi people do have the chance to develop a democratic and kindly form of government. Countries such as Libya have clearly become more accommodating. It has proved possible for the United States to exit Saudi Arabia and reduce a sense of offence in the worldwide Islamic community. On the negative side, the war has clearly energised reactionary elements in Iran who see new possibilities for influence in Iraq and, more broadly, in the gulf. Taking the focus off Afghanistan, as the war did, has seen the revival of the Taliban and the emergence of war lords prominent in the international drug trade. In Iraq itself new opportunities have been opened up for al-Qaeda. If Iraq becomes a bloody mess of three or more warring groups, with untold innocent casualties, a heavy burden will fall on all of us.
In a world difficult to understand and where it is hard to determine who our friends and allies will truly be, two things stand out as absolute necessities: firstly, politicians who tell the truth, with an eye to our real national security interests and not to the politically usable; and, secondly, effective intelligence services unpressured by politicians but capable of providing accurate information on our situation. The circumstances of this conflict have not advanced us on either front.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>ASIO, ASIS and DSD Committee</title>",Committees,0,1
"McArthur, Stewart, MP",LP,2004-03-01,"—The member for Fadden ran out of time and, for the record, quoting from the chairman's speech, I would like to read out the final recommendation. He says:
... there should be an independent assessment of the performance of the intelligence agencies, conducted by an experienced former intelligence expert with full access to all the material, which will report to the National Security Committee of Cabinet and which, in the light of the matters raised by the consideration of the pre-war intelligence on Iraq, will recommend any changes that need to take place for the better functioning of the agencies.
The report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD on Intelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction is a very important report in that it brings a parliamentary assessment of Australia's intelligence services and their role in the lead-up to the Iraq war. Given the nature of intelligence services in Australia, the UK and the USA, and the desirability of a democracy to demand open and politically accountable answers of their intelligence services on the one hand and the importance of maintaining the integrity and ability to function covertly on the other, this process is fraught with difficulties. On this occasion the committee has worked conscientiously to achieve a balance between these two competing objectives. Along with other members, I express my dismay that contents of the report have apparently reached the public domain prior to its tabling in the House today.
The references given to the committee were to inquire into the basis of the prewar assessments undertaken by Australia's intelligence agencies and its partner agencies in the USA and the UK prior to 19 March 2003. The key element of the inquiry was addressing the issues of the existence of WMD in Iraq and the capacity and willingness of Iraq to use these weapons.
The United Nations agency known as UNSCOM undertook inspections of WMD between the 1991 Gulf War and 1998. These inspections did not find definitive evidence of WMD programs. However, it would appear that the chemical weapons program was by far the most extensive and advanced of all Iraq's WMD programs. The biological weapons program of Iraq was the most secretive of its programs and its existence was not acknowledged until July 1995. The report identifies the small quantities of biological agents required to develop lethal WMD which could be used in both military and civilian circumstances. It becomes clear from all the evidence, in particular the UK dossier on Iraq's WMD dated 24 September 2002 and the CIA document of 2002, that Iraq possessed mobile facilities for biological weapons agent production. Given that scenario, in my view it was always going to be difficult to find biological weapons and their production facilities after the war in Iraq.
The key question facing the USA, the UK and Australia was the assessment by these countries as to whether Iraq would use WMD. The leaders of these countries had to make the difficult judgment of going to war against Iraq based on intelligence reports supplied to the military and political leaders. The report notes that command, control, training and logistics support for deployment and use of biological and chemical weapons was a key component of Iraq's military doctrine.
In developing an assessment of the Australian intelligence agencies, the parliament should have very much in mind that the Australian agencies depended upon source material from their counterparts in the UK and the USA. The Office of National Assessments and the Defence Intelligence Organisation provided unclassified information to the inquiry which allowed the committee to develop an understanding of their approach and their capacity to reassess foreign intelligence sources. It appeared to the committee that the ONA was cautious in its assessments of information supplied to it from other sources.
The key element of the report to the parliament is the question of the independence of these intelligence assessments to the Australian government. The committee noted the assurance from the ONA and DIO on the question of their objectivity and independence. It accepts their declaration that there was no overt pressure from the government to change the assessments. In my judgment, this is a key finding of the committee. In assessing the accuracy of the assessments, the report says:
The Committee is acutely aware that intelligence is not an exact science, that it is often speculative and should be judged in those terms. Intelligence is not evidence. The parts of the jigsaw are never completely there and the information is often suggestive rather than definitive.
This is a very good description of the way in which intelligence works, unlike that of many of the post-Iraq war commentators, who have the value of hindsight in reaching their conclusions.
The controversy about the British dossier as published by the British government on 24 September 2002 is well known. In discussing the presentation of prewar intelligence, I support the committee's conclusion that the presentation by the Australian government was more moderate and more measured than either of its alliance partners. The government did not make the claim that Iraq's WMD were deployable in 45 minutes. In the light of the worldwide debate about the effectiveness and functioning of intelligence agencies, I support the recommendation that an independent former intelligence expert with full access to the material should report to the National Security Committee of cabinet. In this way a frank assessment could be made of the Australian agencies, knowing that these recommendations will remain confidential.

"McLeay, Leo, MP",ALP,2004-03-01,"—At the beginning of March last year, this House debated the issue of going to war in Iraq as part of the coalition of the willing. In that debate I said I was opposed to the war and that I had never seen so wide a cross-section of the Australian community so opposed to a war—for example, a former President of the Liberal Party, former ADF commanders and former secretaries to the Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Twelve months later, the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, of which I am a member, is tabling a report on the intelligence assessments received by the government in the lead-up to that war.
Given that the role of the intelligence agencies has already been widely canvassed, it might be useful to concentrate on the last of the terms of reference given to the committee—that is, the accuracy and completeness of the government's presentation—and on chapter 5 of the report. That term of reference reads:
d) whether Australia's pre-conflict assessments of Iraq's WMD capability were as accurate and comprehensive as should be expected of information relied on in decisions regarding the participation of the Australian Defence Forces in military conflict.
The evidence given to the committee by the intelligence agencies, in my opinion, shows that the government's presentation was neither complete nor accurate. The analysis undertaken by Australian agencies provided inconclusive intelligence to support the proposition that Saddam Hussein was a `grave and unacceptable threat'; so, on the government's part, there was a careful process of selection that avoided, in the most part, the agencies' assessments. It was not so much that the Australian intelligence agencies got it wrong but that they were largely ignored by the government except where they could bolster the case for war. Where they could not, other sources were found—for example, the infamous British document and a reliance on gung-ho US documents.
The committee says in chapter 5 that the government based its argument for going to war not just on intelligence but also on `historical experience, first principle hypotheses, deductive logic, assumption and assertion, as well as specific intelligence'. The government's arguments were carefully crafted—and were faulty. They were based on false historical analysis, false logic, false assumptions and assertions without tested evidence. Senator Hill's reported concern that Australian intelligence agencies were not gung-ho enough suggests that this was a conscious government position.
In chapter 4, there is a discussion of the problems with the approach that the government adopted. The view that Saddam Hussein had weapons in 1991, had used them and therefore still had them did not take account of the reality in Iraq since 1991—the bombing of Iraqi installations on a number of occasions, the sanctions and the inspections. The government implied that Saddam Hussein would supply al-Qaeda with weapons of mass destruction, the implication being that because the Iraqis were supporting the Palestinians it therefore followed that terrorist groups would get their hands on these weapons. The government did not take account of UK intelligence assessments made before the war that an attack on Iraq would actually increase the al-Qaeda threat.
The government misused UN information. The fact that UNSCOM and UNMOVIC could not find material led to the idea of massive hidden stockpiles. The government quoted very selectively from the agencies' reports. When UNMOVIC talked about progress, this was ignored. When UNMOVIC inspectors inspected sites and found nothing, this was ignored. Where UNMOVIC questioned or doubted the sourcing of uranium from Africa and the use of aluminium tubes for a nuclear program, it was ignored. When UN debriefs of Saddam Hussein's son-in-law, Kamil Hussein, reported that all weapons had been destroyed in 1991, they were ignored.
The Prime Minister's speeches talked about compelling evidence and made unequivocal statements about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. This so-called evidence must have come from sources other than Australian agencies, as they were saying pretty much the opposite. The Australian agencies had found stocks to be small and capacity to be degraded. They had found no evidence of any new production after 1991. When asked about the unequivocal statements in the Prime Minister's speeches, the agencies told the committee that they were not necessarily judgments they would have made. The unanimous report of the committee says:
5.16 Therefore, the case made by the government was that Iraq possessed WMD in large quantities and posed a grave and unacceptable threat to the region and the world, particularly as there was a danger that Iraq's WMD might be passed to terrorist organisations.

As he would no doubt have done had he had an extra couple of minutes, I express the thanks of the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD to Margaret Swieringa and Charles Vagi, who did the bulk of the work on the report and assembled it all for us. We are indeed very grateful for their efforts, as we are grateful for the efforts of Tiana Di Iulio and Daniel Miletic, who also assisted.
Australia did not go to war because intelligence made available to the Australian government through its agencies suggested a clear and immediate danger was posed by Iraqi WMD either directly or through passage to terrorist organisations. However, Australians were entitled to think that those were the reasons we went to war, given the cases presented by the Prime Minister and his ministers. Well before such intelligence hardened up in the latter part of 2002—and even then it did not harden sufficiently to present a clear and compelling case—the Prime Minister had declared his support for American action if it occurred. By the middle of 2002 the Prime Minister had gone clearly to a domestic political pitch that sought to box any critical comments by his domestic political opponents to a war course as anti-American and a danger to the alliance. Having thus positioned himself he placed his government and his country on the coat-tails of any actions our allies undertook. To have abandoned that course would not have killed the US alliance; it has more substance to it than that. The US, however, would have lost his address as firmly as it lost David Lange's back in the 1980s. That was what was at stake. We can all make our judgments on the value of that.
Though our intelligence community may well have got some judgments wrong—and, as this report points out, there is a need for close analysis of its interpretative capabilities and the way it advises government—it is innocent of any responsibility for a determination to go to war. That responsibility lies with politicians. Another more important responsibility lies with politicians: they must not shift blame to agencies which are vital to the struggle with international terrorism. That struggle is an intelligence and police struggle. To discredit them where they do not deserve it is to weaken us in that struggle.
What this report makes amply clear is that there were deficiencies in intelligence and in our intelligence structures. There was never, however—particularly from the Defence Intelligence Organisation but also the Office of National Assessments—emphatically delivered hard advice without some form of qualification attached. The exaggeration and the sense of immediacy was the work of politicians, outside the intelligence advice they were being presented with—at least from the Australian agencies and, I would suggest, their American and British counterparts. Insofar as that internal intelligence reporting came close on rare occasions to government presentation, it can be seen, at least in part, as a response to unusual pressures placed on them by the atmosphere created by the political leadership—not direct pressure by the political leadership—which was determined on a course to war.
Given the self-interested leaking that has occurred of committee findings and conclusions, I would suggest, as a counter to that, diligent attention to chapter 5. It analyses the relevant speeches of ministers against the background of the intelligence they received from our intelligence community. In those speeches a case was presented that suggested the continued existence of a `massive program' of WMD, that quantities unaccounted for were `large' and that, rather than increasing the terrorist threat, action in Iraq would `make it less likely that a devastating terrorist attack will be carried out against Australia'. As the committee finds in paragraph 5.16:
Therefore, the case made by the government was that Iraq possessed WMD in large quantities and posed a grave and unacceptable threat to the region and the world, particularly as there was a danger that Iraq's WMD might be passed to terrorist organisations.
But as the committee says in paragraph 5.17:
This is not the picture that emerges from an examination of all the assessments provided to the Committee by Australia's two analytical agencies.
The committee also says:
... accuracy must also encompass whether the picture being presented is complete. Ignoring significant elements of fact or opinion when citing intelligence assessments can have a distorting effect.
Completely excluded from any minister's presentation were intelligence assessments that war might provoke the circumstances in which WMD might be used or passed on to terrorists. The government, however, in fact received such advice from the intelligence community. Ignoring it was a very big call indeed, given the circumstances of September 11.
A typical example of distorting effects is shown in paragraph 5.22, where it says that the Prime Minister used materials provided by Saddam Hussein's son-in-law in 1995 as evidence of `a massive program for developing offensive biological weapons—one of the largest and most advanced in the world'. As the committee points out, the bulk of the debriefing of Saddam Hussein's son-in-law pointed to a repeated failure of these programs and the destruction of them in the wake of successful UNSCOM inspections. Rather than being a current assessment of the state of affairs, it was what Saddam Hussein's son-in-law said was the state of affairs, until things were effectively dealt with by UNSCOM inspections.
The PM now relies on the capture of Hussein and the end of his bloody tyranny as a justification for war. As the committee points out, in the lead-up to war he specifically disclaimed this as an adequate case for war. `The world,' says the Prime Minister, `is a better and safer place without him.' Certainly the world is a better place; whether it is safer is yet to be determined. On the positive side, the Iraqi people do have the chance to develop a democratic and kindly form of government. Countries such as Libya have clearly become more accommodating. It has proved possible for the United States to exit Saudi Arabia and reduce a sense of offence in the worldwide Islamic community. On the negative side, the war has clearly energised reactionary elements in Iran who see new possibilities for influence in Iraq and, more broadly, in the gulf. Taking the focus off Afghanistan, as the war did, has seen the revival of the Taliban and the emergence of war lords prominent in the international drug trade. In Iraq itself new opportunities have been opened up for al-Qaeda. If Iraq becomes a bloody mess of three or more warring groups, with untold innocent casualties, a heavy burden will fall on all of us.
In a world difficult to understand and where it is hard to determine who our friends and allies will truly be, two things stand out as absolute necessities: firstly, politicians who tell the truth, with an eye to our real national security interests and not to the politically usable; and, secondly, effective intelligence services unpressured by politicians but capable of providing accurate information on our situation. The circumstances of this conflict have not advanced us on either front.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,0,2
"McArthur, Stewart, MP",LP,2004-03-01,"—The member for Fadden ran out of time and, for the record, quoting from the chairman's speech, I would like to read out the final recommendation. He says:
... there should be an independent assessment of the performance of the intelligence agencies, conducted by an experienced former intelligence expert with full access to all the material, which will report to the National Security Committee of Cabinet and which, in the light of the matters raised by the consideration of the pre-war intelligence on Iraq, will recommend any changes that need to take place for the better functioning of the agencies.
The report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD on Intelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction is a very important report in that it brings a parliamentary assessment of Australia's intelligence services and their role in the lead-up to the Iraq war. Given the nature of intelligence services in Australia, the UK and the USA, and the desirability of a democracy to demand open and politically accountable answers of their intelligence services on the one hand and the importance of maintaining the integrity and ability to function covertly on the other, this process is fraught with difficulties. On this occasion the committee has worked conscientiously to achieve a balance between these two competing objectives. Along with other members, I express my dismay that contents of the report have apparently reached the public domain prior to its tabling in the House today.
The references given to the committee were to inquire into the basis of the prewar assessments undertaken by Australia's intelligence agencies and its partner agencies in the USA and the UK prior to 19 March 2003. The key element of the inquiry was addressing the issues of the existence of WMD in Iraq and the capacity and willingness of Iraq to use these weapons.
The United Nations agency known as UNSCOM undertook inspections of WMD between the 1991 Gulf War and 1998. These inspections did not find definitive evidence of WMD programs. However, it would appear that the chemical weapons program was by far the most extensive and advanced of all Iraq's WMD programs. The biological weapons program of Iraq was the most secretive of its programs and its existence was not acknowledged until July 1995. The report identifies the small quantities of biological agents required to develop lethal WMD which could be used in both military and civilian circumstances. It becomes clear from all the evidence, in particular the UK dossier on Iraq's WMD dated 24 September 2002 and the CIA document of 2002, that Iraq possessed mobile facilities for biological weapons agent production. Given that scenario, in my view it was always going to be difficult to find biological weapons and their production facilities after the war in Iraq.
The key question facing the USA, the UK and Australia was the assessment by these countries as to whether Iraq would use WMD. The leaders of these countries had to make the difficult judgment of going to war against Iraq based on intelligence reports supplied to the military and political leaders. The report notes that command, control, training and logistics support for deployment and use of biological and chemical weapons was a key component of Iraq's military doctrine.
In developing an assessment of the Australian intelligence agencies, the parliament should have very much in mind that the Australian agencies depended upon source material from their counterparts in the UK and the USA. The Office of National Assessments and the Defence Intelligence Organisation provided unclassified information to the inquiry which allowed the committee to develop an understanding of their approach and their capacity to reassess foreign intelligence sources. It appeared to the committee that the ONA was cautious in its assessments of information supplied to it from other sources.
The key element of the report to the parliament is the question of the independence of these intelligence assessments to the Australian government. The committee noted the assurance from the ONA and DIO on the question of their objectivity and independence. It accepts their declaration that there was no overt pressure from the government to change the assessments. In my judgment, this is a key finding of the committee. In assessing the accuracy of the assessments, the report says:
The Committee is acutely aware that intelligence is not an exact science, that it is often speculative and should be judged in those terms. Intelligence is not evidence. The parts of the jigsaw are never completely there and the information is often suggestive rather than definitive.
This is a very good description of the way in which intelligence works, unlike that of many of the post-Iraq war commentators, who have the value of hindsight in reaching their conclusions.
The controversy about the British dossier as published by the British government on 24 September 2002 is well known. In discussing the presentation of prewar intelligence, I support the committee's conclusion that the presentation by the Australian government was more moderate and more measured than either of its alliance partners. The government did not make the claim that Iraq's WMD were deployable in 45 minutes. In the light of the worldwide debate about the effectiveness and functioning of intelligence agencies, I support the recommendation that an independent former intelligence expert with full access to the material should report to the National Security Committee of cabinet. In this way a frank assessment could be made of the Australian agencies, knowing that these recommendations will remain confidential.

"McLeay, Leo, MP",ALP,2004-03-01,"—At the beginning of March last year, this House debated the issue of going to war in Iraq as part of the coalition of the willing. In that debate I said I was opposed to the war and that I had never seen so wide a cross-section of the Australian community so opposed to a war—for example, a former President of the Liberal Party, former ADF commanders and former secretaries to the Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Twelve months later, the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, of which I am a member, is tabling a report on the intelligence assessments received by the government in the lead-up to that war.
Given that the role of the intelligence agencies has already been widely canvassed, it might be useful to concentrate on the last of the terms of reference given to the committee—that is, the accuracy and completeness of the government's presentation—and on chapter 5 of the report. That term of reference reads:
d) whether Australia's pre-conflict assessments of Iraq's WMD capability were as accurate and comprehensive as should be expected of information relied on in decisions regarding the participation of the Australian Defence Forces in military conflict.
The evidence given to the committee by the intelligence agencies, in my opinion, shows that the government's presentation was neither complete nor accurate. The analysis undertaken by Australian agencies provided inconclusive intelligence to support the proposition that Saddam Hussein was a `grave and unacceptable threat'; so, on the government's part, there was a careful process of selection that avoided, in the most part, the agencies' assessments. It was not so much that the Australian intelligence agencies got it wrong but that they were largely ignored by the government except where they could bolster the case for war. Where they could not, other sources were found—for example, the infamous British document and a reliance on gung-ho US documents.
The committee says in chapter 5 that the government based its argument for going to war not just on intelligence but also on `historical experience, first principle hypotheses, deductive logic, assumption and assertion, as well as specific intelligence'. The government's arguments were carefully crafted—and were faulty. They were based on false historical analysis, false logic, false assumptions and assertions without tested evidence. Senator Hill's reported concern that Australian intelligence agencies were not gung-ho enough suggests that this was a conscious government position.
In chapter 4, there is a discussion of the problems with the approach that the government adopted. The view that Saddam Hussein had weapons in 1991, had used them and therefore still had them did not take account of the reality in Iraq since 1991—the bombing of Iraqi installations on a number of occasions, the sanctions and the inspections. The government implied that Saddam Hussein would supply al-Qaeda with weapons of mass destruction, the implication being that because the Iraqis were supporting the Palestinians it therefore followed that terrorist groups would get their hands on these weapons. The government did not take account of UK intelligence assessments made before the war that an attack on Iraq would actually increase the al-Qaeda threat.
The government misused UN information. The fact that UNSCOM and UNMOVIC could not find material led to the idea of massive hidden stockpiles. The government quoted very selectively from the agencies' reports. When UNMOVIC talked about progress, this was ignored. When UNMOVIC inspectors inspected sites and found nothing, this was ignored. Where UNMOVIC questioned or doubted the sourcing of uranium from Africa and the use of aluminium tubes for a nuclear program, it was ignored. When UN debriefs of Saddam Hussein's son-in-law, Kamil Hussein, reported that all weapons had been destroyed in 1991, they were ignored.
The Prime Minister's speeches talked about compelling evidence and made unequivocal statements about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. This so-called evidence must have come from sources other than Australian agencies, as they were saying pretty much the opposite. The Australian agencies had found stocks to be small and capacity to be degraded. They had found no evidence of any new production after 1991. When asked about the unequivocal statements in the Prime Minister's speeches, the agencies told the committee that they were not necessarily judgments they would have made. The unanimous report of the committee says:
5.16 Therefore, the case made by the government was that Iraq possessed WMD in large quantities and posed a grave and unacceptable threat to the region and the world, particularly as there was a danger that Iraq's WMD might be passed to terrorist organisations.
5.17 This is not the picture that emerges from an examination of all the assessments provided to the Committee by Australia's two analytical agencies—

"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2004-03-01,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	supports the wider spread, across every category of company and to all their employees, of substantial employee share ownership exercised through the agency of Employee Share Ownership Plans (ESOPs);
(2)	notes that the existing legislative and regulatory regime inhibits the spread of employee ownership especially to unlisted and private companies chiefly on account of the failure of Corporations Law to provide a disclosure regime proper to ESOPs;
(3)	notes that those employees who do benefit from ESOPs are actively discouraged from developing substantial holdings in the employers' companies by tax provisions which favour token employee ownership (through a tax exempt share plan) over the acquisitions of larger share holding (through a tax deferred share plan);
(4)	acknowledges that properly designed ESOPs provide, importantly, a mechanism by means of which employees become co-owners of the businesses for which they work and, thereby, more deeply engaged in, and committed to, the free enterprise system of wealth creation and distribution;
(5)	acknowledges that ESOPs also provide an important pre-retirement savings vehicle through which families and individuals can save for obligations which arise prior to their retirement;
(6)	recognises that ESOPs belong to a spectrum of pre-retirement savings vehicles so far undeveloped in Australia yet urgently called for by national demographic and social realities;
(7)	calls for targeted reforms of tax and corporate law to ensure that ESOPs can easily spread to all employees in all comp-anies and provide these employees with a mechanism capable of delivering them substantial (rather than token) ownership of the companies in which they work;
(8)	calls for the development of practical regul-ations to ensure adequate disclosure and investor protection measures for all ESOPs;
(9)	calls for the introduction of a new pre-retirement savings vehicle modelled on the United Kingdom Individual Savings Account to provide a comparable means of making medium-term savings for those employees who cannot benefit from an ESOP.
Employee share ownership is about three things. Firstly, it is about the democratisation of wealth: it is about sharing wealth and it is about ensuring that the productivity of our society is shared across the full base of that society, so that those who participate in the creation share in the benefit—and it is about doing so in a way which is different to that provided by just salaries and wages. Secondly, it is about productivity. It is about improving the nation's productivity as a whole, contributing to the sum of wealth for the future and ensuring that people throughout Australia benefit from developments in not just one industry but in all. Thirdly, it is about improving social and industrial harmony. It is about ensuring that people have a stake in their firms—in the places in which they work—and ensuring that the old-style divides some still hanker for between capital and labour cease to exist. It is about creating a harmonious society and a harmonious workplace. That is the basis, in looking at this motion, of why we support and argue for increased employee share ownership.
This motion is all about developing a stronger base for employee share ownership programs within Australia. It is a tough motion. It looks at what the government has done and it seeks to extend it further. I make no apology for that. It is clear eyed in its recognition of the importance of employee share ownership programs. It is clear eyed in its recognition that the conditions available need to be extended over time in order for these programs to take root, to take effect and to have a real impact on the way in which both our microeconomic firms work and the macroeconomic benefits flow as a result of that.
In looking at this motion, which encourages reforms to improve employee share ownership programs throughout Australia, I want to proceed in three stages. Firstly, I want to look at the reasons for fostering employee share ownership programs. Secondly, I want to look at the steps that we have taken to date to encourage those programs. Thirdly, I want to look at the reforms that are still necessary: what will be the next wave of steps we can take that will show how we can encourage, expand and develop employee share ownership programs further within Australia?
I mentioned at the outset that there are three main reasons for fostering employee share ownership, but perhaps a little anecdote might illustrate them best. I recently met with Mr David Simmons, the Managing Director of Hills Industries. Hills Industries is a South Australian company which makes, amongst other things, the Hills hoist. It has a highly developed employee share ownership program. Mr Simmons pointed out the benefits of that. What that does is a very simple thing: it allows people to develop their own savings plans, in addition to—not in place of, but in addition to—the superannuation system. So it is about providing workers and participants with the benefits. This is not some highfalutin notion of options for the senior executive but a base for people throughout the firm to participate in the benefits of that firm. It is a simple, very Australian concept in its nature.
When we look at this notion of democratisation of wealth, we see that under the current government 2.9 million Australians have been introduced to share ownership for the first time, some of them through employee share ownership programs. But more should be introduced through that very scheme. The broadening of the ownership of shares has been one of the great achievements of this government, but the next wave and the next frontier in that process must be, I believe, the broadening of the opportunities for employees to participate in share ownership programs within their own firms.
The second great reason why you would encourage employee share ownership is, of course, productivity. As David Simmons from Hills Industries mentioned to me, people are interested in the value of their shares. People are interested in the performance of their own company. There is a sense of seeking to participate so as to improve the outcome for the individual, for all employees and for all shareholders. There is a sense of a common purpose which comes from it. I would like to quote on the productivity benefit which the Employee Ownership Group outlines in its recent document, Employee share ownership in Australia: the future. In relation to productivity, the Employee Ownership Group states:
Companies with high levels of employee ownership demonstrate higher measures of commitment to the interests of the business by their employees and, consequently, higher productivity and profit levels, than their peers with lower levels of employee ownership, or none at all.
Significant evidence is provided to back that up on a statistical, empirical, hard factual basis. 
The third reason for supporting employee share ownership is the question of industrial and social harmony. This is a long-term process; this is a generational process. It is about making the change from some of the old-style confrontation that I used to see in Huntingdale in Victoria when I worked as a storeman and packer on the floor of a warehouse where there was conflict between the two sides and people on one side saw those on the other as the enemy. Employee share ownership programs are part of the long-term process of change; they are part of giving each a stake in the other, and that is what is important here. Employee share ownership is about breaking down the ridiculous 19th century—not even 20th century—notion of a divide between capital and labour. That is old-style thinking, and employee share ownership is a new style way of breaking away from that old-style thinking.
What are the steps to date that we have taken to try and encourage employee share ownership? The government has done a number of things. What you see is an increase in the rise of employee shares over the course of this government. But, as I say, where there has been a dramatic increase in the total level of shareholders within our society, there have been modest increases in employee share ownership participation. Diversification of shares and broadening the base of shares are the areas which most need to be developed within our society. In particular, the government has developed a number of reforms to help on that front. Firstly, and perhaps most importantly, was the doubling of the tax concessions on qualifying employee share plans—from $500 to $1,000 tax free per year. I state clearly before this House that I believe that threshold has now reached the point where it needs to be raised—and raised significantly. I stand squarely before the House and clearly state that the threshold should be lifted. I make that claim because I believe it is a critical step—perhaps the critical step—in expanding employee share ownership programs.
There are other things that we also need to look at in terms of steps to be taken as we go forward. I think that there are three important steps above all else which flow from this motion. Firstly, there need to be targeted reforms of tax and corporate law to ensure that employee share ownership programs can more easily spread to all employees in all companies and provide these employees with a mechanism capable of delivering them substantial ownership of the companies in which they work. There are additional steps on both the taxation and corporate law reform front which do need to be considered, and with a group of others we are working to that exact end.
The second of the great reforms that I believe needs to be undertaken is the development of practical legislation to ensure adequate disclosure and investor protection measures for all employee share ownership programs. If you are going to have these programs, investors and existing shareholders need to be protected. Thirdly, we need to look at the introduction of a new pre-retirement savings vehicle, modelled on the United Kingdom individual savings account, to provide a comparable means of making medium-term savings for those employees who cannot benefit from an employee share ownership program. We saw the beginnings of that with the announcements from the Treasurer last week. He is developing the notion of a lifetime superannuation approach for people with or without work. That is very much in line with what this motion is talking about. Above all else, the vision we have is of people being able to participate, own and contribute. (Time expired)

"Sawford, Rod, MP",ALP,2004-03-01,"—A couple of parliaments ago, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations, of which I was deputy chair, reported to the parliament on employee share ownership plans. I remember beginning that inquiry with probably a similar view to that of the member for Flinders—and the member for Rankin, who will speak later in this debate. But as the committee got into the nitty-gritty of the inquiry, it became clear that encouraging employees to participate in employee share ownership in family, private or unlisted companies was fraught with danger and was very poor financial and investment advice. There are very sound financial reasons why this is the case. In private unlisted companies, employee share ownership can be attractive to company owners, directors and executives, limiting their taxation liabilities, but as far as employees on the floor are concerned, it has little to offer. Commonsense tells us that, if an employee receives the major part of their income from wages and salaries, it would be foolish to invest savings in the same company. No financial adviser would advise a client to put all their eggs in one basket.
The aim of share ownership is to supplement income from wages and salaries. What is likely to occur with employee share ownership in private unlisted companies is income substitution rather than income supplementation. If share ownership is the goal—and there is nothing wrong with that—workers would be wiser to invest in the top 50 or 100 Australian companies. That would be safer. There is little or no flexibility in the transportability of shares when employees, as many do these days, shift their employment 10 or 15 times during their working lifetimes. The same employee share ownership in publicly listed companies causes no such difficulty. During the parliamentary inquiry, the enthusiasts for employee share ownership were overwhelmingly marketers of the schemes. Certainly there were enthusiastic company owners and executives, but not as many as you might think. As far as employees were concerned, I detected almost no genuine enthusiasm at all; in fact, they displayed sound commonsense. If they were interested in a share portfolio, they wanted their investment to be varied and to be in the top publicly listed companies—and, of course, they were right to want that.
In part 2 of his motion, the member for Flinders notes the failure of Corporations Law in this country. That is a far more complex issue, requiring more than merely noting that the existing legislative and regulatory regime is inhibiting the spread of ESOPs. In part 3 of the motion, the member acknowledges that tax provisions favour only token employee ownership. Again, he is correct, but have we asked the wrong question? The question should be: who is advantaged by the current provisions? Clearly, it is the marketers of schemes and executives, not employees. Part 4 of the motion encourages the partnership in business between owners and employees. That is good, but ESOPs are not necessarily the right or the only mechanism. The most effective incentives are related to income and time, not investment policy.
In parts 5 and 6, the member's motion encourages the spread of ESOPs and states that they belong to a spectrum of pre-retirement vehicles largely undeveloped in Australia. The member's enthusiasm for employee share ownership is admirable. However, any financial adviser worth their salt would steer employees interested in share ownership away from investment in a company in which they work. Sensible advice would be to vary the portfolio, not limit it, and to invest in the top 50 or top 100 publicly listed companies rather than private concerns. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to be involved in the stock market.
Part 8 of the member's motion, which calls for adequate disclosures and investor protection, is fine. But it is difficult enough to achieve that in the public arena, let alone in private companies. Part 9 of the motion, calling for the introduction of new pre-retirement savings vehicles for employees who cannot benefit from ESOPs, has considerable merit and is worthy of further investigation by a parliamentary committee. As to whether that vehicle should be modelled on Britain's Individual Savings Account, I have not yet developed a view. Although I have a very negative view of ESOPs in private listed companies, I congratulate the member for Flinders for bringing it forward in private members' business. It is an important debate and it needs to be further explored. Perhaps it could be explored by asking the Treasurer about it instead of the nonsense he trotted out last week.
There is a lack of savings in the country. You could just raise that superannuation levy up to 15 or 20 per cent. That would be a good move. You could legislate to stop those sharks in superannuation funds taking a third of the growth of an investment in superannuation in fees and legislate to cut that down to 0.2 per cent instead of the current two per cent. That would then protect workers' entitlements and workers' pre-retirement savings. There should be none of this nonsense about fiddling at the edges. Let us get to the guts of the issue, which is to increase the superannuation levy to at least 15 and maybe 20 per cent and stop the rorting of superannuation funds.

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2004-03-01,"—The previous speaker, the member for Port Adelaide, has missed one of the important points of employee share ownership plans, which is that they provide a very important motivating force for employees. If you asked employees, `Is it better to have some personal stake in the company that you work for?' most employees would say yes. I am pleased to support the motion.
I want to speak about how employee ownership plans have benefited a firm in my own electorate—Hills. As many members will know, Hills was the creator of the innovative Hills rotary hoist, back in 1946. Hills was able to take advantage of the changes that this government made to the tax concessions for employee share ownership plans and introduce a very generous employee share ownership plan, which is available to all its workers. Most of the well-known employee share ownership plans are in the banks and large public companies. Hills is a little bit different. It is principally a manufacturing company and is not typical of many of the companies where we see employee ownership plans.
Recently, a large number of the workers wrote to me, highlighting concerns about the future of the scheme. One writer from North Brighton said:
... the Hills plan offers shares in Hills at no cost to all employees up to a maximum value of $1,000 per year. The value of shares issued is linked to the profitability of Hills, which I believe is a good message.
The writer then urged support for an exemption to changes to proposed international accounting standards. The changes are apparently aimed principally at moderating what are considered to be excessive executive benefits. The problem is that most of the employees at Hills would be on modest incomes. They are not receiving large executive benefits or anything of that sort. They do value their employee share ownership plan. Most of these people were not shareholders before. They now at least have some shares, and that has enabled them to take an interest in what is going on in the stock market and so on.
The concern is that some of the changes may have unintended consequences of impacting on share ownership plans, such as those at Hills. It is an issue I have taken up with the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, and I am pleased that his officers are now talking with Treasury on this matter. Employee share ownership plans are to be encouraged. I was interested to read that the Leader of the Opposition is a great supporter of them. Most people would think it is odd that a man who has opposed every tranche of the privatisation of Telstra, and opposes any further privatisation of Telstra, would be so committed to widespread share ownership, but then contradictions like this are nothing new for the member for Werriwa.
The previous speaker mentioned that back in 2000 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations released its report called entitled Shared endeavours: an inquiry into employee share ownership in Australia. As I remember, that was a unanimous report.
—No, it was not.
—Okay. Its recommendations included taxation changes, improved monitoring arrangements and greater promotion of employee share ownership. In last year's budget, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations announced the formation of an employee share ownership development unit, committing $1.7 million of funding over four years for the project. The unit will work with employers and employees to help with the design and implementation of employee share schemes and carry out related promotional work. It will also collect information about the barriers to participation in share ownership. Therefore, its role in responding to the concerns of employees at Hills will be extremely important. 
Preserving, boosting and widening the coverage of employee share ownership will be vital as part of the investment strategies for Australian workers in the years ahead. No, of course we do not want everyone to put all their eggs in one basket; they should have diversified investments. But I think it is important for employees to have the opportunity to have at least a very small stake in the enterprise in which they work. I welcome the motion. I urge members of the cabinet and my parliamentary colleagues to take appropriate steps to support the continued growth of employee share ownership schemes.

"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2004-03-01,"—There is nothing wrong with employee share ownership. It is a good idea and a good concept. But why do taxpayers have to foot the bill all the time? Why can't we just have Liberal Party members standing up saying, `We don't need to call on the taxpayer every time we come up with a scheme'? Is there anything remotely like the integrity of the income tax base? Does that ring a bell for members opposite at all? The fact is that we looked at this through the Shared endeavours: an inquiry into employee share ownership in Australian enterprises report. Labor produced a dissenting report because so much that is peddled about employee share ownership plans insofar as tax concessions are concerned is snake oil or worse: blatant contrived tax avoidance schemes. That is why Labor members dissented from this report. It was not unanimous at all—we dissented.
There have been many spurious arguments. We heard from the member for Flinders about productivity. When we were producing this report, it was embarrassing. We were sitting through day after day of deliberation, trying to find some link between productivity and employee share ownership plans. People were twiddling their thumbs and looking at their shoes because we could not find any links. Of course, the only people who can are those who are promoting the schemes—they find these links, but when they are subjected to a bit of parliamentary scrutiny there are no such links at all. 
In relation to the member's third claimed benefit—industrial harmony—imagine the workers at Mount Isa Mines when they come into one of the schemes at $1.40 a share and the share price falls to 90c or 80c. There is not much industrial harmony there. I wonder how much industrial harmony there was at Ansett, which had a large employee share ownership plan, but of course went belly up.
This report is full of recommendations to promote blatant tax avoidance. Most appallingly, recommendation 31 recommends that liability for taxation occur at the time of disposal, not after 10 years. This would send out the cessation event to the never-never so that company executives would be able to get in on these rorts and defer their tax liability indefinitely. That is what government members, led by the current Minister for Education, Science and Training, wanted. Fortunately, Treasury prevailed.
The member for Flinders said, `There have been these great government responses to this report.' Do you know what the government's response to the report was? They set up a web site. That is what they did. They did not even increase the concession from $1,000 to $2,000 as the current minister for education had wanted—the government did not even do that. So I say to the member for Flinders: do not come into this parliament saying, `The government has done all these things.' If you think setting up a web site is a great achievement, then go for your life—I suppose at least it has not cost the sort of revenue that would have been at risk because of recommendation 31, peddled by snake oil merchants on the government side. The member for Flinders has not been in parliament that long, but if he had he would have gone through this and known this—but, no, they have to keep reinventing it.
I wonder where the member for Flinders got the nine parts of this motion. I am sure that he did not write them. I am sure one of those peddlers of employee share ownership plans did. I have here a Hansard record of the hearings. We asked the Taxation Office during the hearings whether they were aware of any more aggressively marketed schemes. They said, `No; we are right on top of that.' One of our members then tabled one and said, `What do you think about that?' They said, `That is very good information. We'll have a look at it.' From that time onwards, the tax office has been trying to clamp down on these aggressively marketed tax rorts. The recommendations in this document—the government report—would keep those rorts going and in fact extend them.
At no time in his speech did the member for Flinders mention a concern of the Managing Director of Hills Industries, Mr David Simmons, that the government's proposal to adopt the new international accounting standard requiring the expensing of shares given by a company to employees would result in Hills abandoning their employee share scheme. This is because the Hills board fears that their results will be downgraded by analysts when compared to the results of similar companies which do not have employee share schemes. The question is: what are the government doing to address the concerns of David Simmons and the employees at Hills? The answer is: not very much, just as they have done nothing to address the recommendations of this inquiry. You do not hear me say it too often, but I say good on the government for not picking up the shonky recommendations in this shonky report that would just mean that more taxpayers' money would go down the drain, lining the pockets of company executives instead of doing what ought to be done—that is, spreading employee share ownership among genuine working people but not at extra expense to taxpayers.

"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,2004-03-01,"—I would love the member for Rankin to go down to Wollongong and talk to the 11,000 employees of BHP who received $1,000 each, tax-free, as part of an employee share scheme. Here are the Labor Party arguing that it destroys the integrity of the tax system to give employees share ownership. It is a disgusting argument they are putting to the workers of Australia. I am ashamed of them saying that they represent the workers. Up to 2.5 million ordinary shares have been offered to the workers of BHP—$11 million worth—and 11,000 employees are going to share in this. They are going to have a share of a great Australian company, and here are the Labor Party arguing today that that should not occur.
—Not at the taxpayers' expense.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The member for Rankin seems to disregard standing order 55, which is very clear.
—I cannot believe that you would advance those sorts of arguments. I know that you would agree, Mr Deputy Speaker, with BHP having shared its benefits and its profitability amongst its workers. The partnerships that develop between employers and employees and the prospect of working together for similar goals are things that should be endorsed and advanced.
There is research about the benefits of such programs. From New Zealand, Australia and Canada all the research I have come across is positive and supportive. For instance, in a recent study by the Consortium of Alternative Reward Strategies—
—That sounds impartial!
—in New Zealand, 663 companies were examined, about one-third of which were small firms.
—What's that called? A rorter's think tank?
—If members wish me to explore standing order 304A, I will.
—Of the companies that quantified performance, productivity gains produced a 134 per cent net return. Built to last, a study by Collins and Porras, found that one significant feature of visionary companies was the management succession of key employees. Promoting from within was almost a mantra in some of the visionary companies. This occurred where there was a sense of corporate ownership. In Canada, five-year profit growth was 123 per cent higher in ESOP companies. Net profit margins were 95 per cent higher. Productivity measured by revenue per employee—which is a rough measure of productivity, I grant you—was 24 per cent higher. Return on average total equity was 92.3 per cent higher. Return on capital was 65.5 per cent higher in these Canadian companies examined by the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Employee share plans have been used by many large companies such as AMP, ANZ—I have already mentioned BHP—Boral, Coles Myer, the Commonwealth Bank, IAG, Lend Lease, NAB, Qantas, St George Bank, Westpac and Woolworths. I cannot believe that there is not an anxious enthusiasm from Australians to advance these programs so that employees and employers benefit from their mutual goals and aspirations.
I have noticed that the Employee Ownership Association has proposed that there be variations to the current arrangements regardless of whether or not there should be an exempt or deferred process in the plans for ownership and tax treatment of these programs. The recommendation—which I think is a sensible one—would, rather than allowing either a $1,000 exemption from taxation or a deferral proposal, wed the two together so that the first $1,000 is exempt and any amount above $1,000 can be deferred until realisation, at which point the tax should apply. I think these are realistic suggestions that ensure that, rather than being tied down to a deferred or an exempt program, through a mixture of the two people have more flexibility to both defer and be exempt from taxation. It would be a significant advance on the current arrangements. I see a lot of commonsense in it. It would spread it to firms which need to be more flexible.
The percentage of Australians currently owning shares directly increased from nine per cent in 1996 under the Labor Party to 20 per cent in 1997 and then to 37 per cent in 2002, with a further 13 per cent owning shares indirectly through superannuation. These are great records. Apart from the family home, Australians have become the greatest owners of their own industries and their own businesses. That is what we need. We need involvement by the workplace. We need its application in the place where people gain the most benefits.

"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,2004-03-01,"—It would be interesting to learn whether the member for Mitchell has actually looked at examples from Australia. He only needed to go to the Adelaide Review of March 2001 to read some very insightful comments about how employee share ownership plans are working within the country. The article cites the submission from BHP to the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations. Their submission states:
It needs to be recognised that, even though the nature of their equity participation may be similar in some respects, employees can be in quite different circumstances from the non employee shareholders as co-owners in a company. In some ways, employees may be classed as disadvantaged investors.
Unlike the outside shareholder, employees do not have the same choices in terms of type of investment, timing of the investment, freedom from restriction in trading nor an entirely uninfluenced context for making their investment decisions under an employer sponsored equity plan. The employee is offered an investment opportunity only in the employer company, at a time and on conditions that generally are set by the employer. Further, the employee may face restrictions in terms of both minimum and maximum holding periods as well as ... restrictions on trading to limited windows following periodic profit announcement. The employees may also feel influenced positively or negatively by the options of their colleagues and by their attitudes to their work situation.
That is BHP's own submission to the committee inquiry that has been referred to. BHP recognise the shortfalls with employee share ownership plans. And they were not even making recommendations or contradictions about taxation; they were making comments about the restrictions employers place on these funds. Nobody on this side of the fence is saying that employees should be restricted from investing in their own corporations. We have been in support of it.
The majority of these employee share ownership plans have been instigated by unions. Very few have come about through employers alone. I have been involved in negotiating four or five of them at the major banks. We got the banks to give to each employee $1,000 worth of shares for free. It was gratis. It was a very good idea. We proposed and supported it. Why $1,000? Surprise, surprise! Because of the taxation benefit. But that did not give the bank employee with $1,000 worth of shares any more advantage over the company's direction or decision making. I have been to enough AGMs of shareholders. I am not sure whether any of you have sat through them. They are as boring as all get out. I have seen about 500 people on the floor vote down a motion. There is nothing more dispiriting when sitting in an AGM fought out by shareholders and employees—and the union is there too because we are shareholders in these companies too—than seeing all these people voting down bad policy by directors and then seeing these policies still get up. They always get up because the institutional investors hold all the cards.
If you want to talk about ensuring greater participation in the work force, listen to employees. Do things that employees say and do things that the mum and dad shareholders say that might turn around some of these companies. It has not stopped the thousands of employees losing their jobs within the banks that I represented before entering this place from owning shares in those companies. Most of them said: `The only thing I will walk away with is the shares. I'll keep the shares because they're still going up, but they are going up at the expense of my job.' Every time a job was lost, the share price went up. You need to sit here and think about what that means to an employee. They do not have the ability to say, `Please, don't go to the boards and the investment community and say that we are rationalising by losing jobs.' That is what these companies do to increase their share value. Think about it. On the one hand, the employee who is a shareholder might see an increase, but it is generally at the expense of their job.
None of the material presented to the committee on this very good report entitled Shared endeavours demonstrated in any way that there were productivity gains by having people as owners of companies. The committee's dissenting report says:
Many of the parties who appeared at the inquiry believed `genuine' employee share plans were an effective mechanism to better align employee and employee interests and to foster increased productivity and workplace harmony.
The Labor members accept that this conclusion seems logical but note that there is no clear and objective evidence on the question. No submissions to the inquiry produced a sound study which demonstrated the claimed benefits of employee share plans.
Not one person who came before this inquiry demonstrated that there was a benefit. There has been no research inside Australia that demonstrates it. I find it a bit disconcerting that we are debating this motion. Why isn't the government responding to the report appropriately? Why isn't it dealing with those issues? And why have we had eight members speak on this matter and only four on the report of the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD?

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2004-03-01,"—First, may I congratulate the member for Flinders on bringing this motion on employee share ownership before the House and opening up debate on this very important issue. Some of the debate we are hearing from those on the other side of the floor is on the premise that the glass that is half full is actually half empty. Sure, there are some problems and difficulties to overcome in these schemes, but it does not mean that it is not worth while pushing to improve them.
I fully support the nine elements of this motion and the proposition that all reasonable steps should be taken to remove legislative and regulatory inhibitors to this scheme being fully utilised across a wider spread of businesses, including unlisted and private corporations, where the appropriate safeguards can be employed. In particular, if corporate owners and managers are to offer employee share ownership plans to employees then tax measures should encourage rather than discourage acquisitions of larger shareholdings. I listened to the member for Port Adelaide, who spoke at the beginning of this debate. I think that there is no suggestion that this would become the sole means of saving. He would perhaps have people listening think that that is what the motion is about. It is simply another vehicle.
Talking about the savings aspect of this, there are two very substantial reasons why we should do more to encourage investment in employee share ownership plans. Appropriately designed plans do offer employees an opportunity to become co-owners of the business they work for. I hear all of this carry-on about the fact that there was no link in the report to ownership and productivity. But there was nothing to refute it either. The previous speaker, the member for Chisholm, was arguing against herself there. She said there was no evidence provided in the report that linked those two things, yet she said that no definitive study had been done in Australia that could demonstrate a link between ownership and productivity. So I think that is an argument against them.
This proposition provides incentives for employees to take a keener interest in the business in which they work. It also has the potential, I think, to lift productivity. That argument has not been satisfactorily refuted, so I think we can continue to put that proposition. It stands to reason. Now that Australia does have very strong productivity—and there have certainly been great gains in that area—this could certainly be another way to further improve productivity in this country.
Lifting productivity is important. It is important to demonstrate the benefits of a free enterprise system of wealth creation and distribution. My colleague the member for Flinders expressed to me, while we were sitting here, his surprise at Labor members' vehement opposition to his motion. I am not surprised at all. I think that many of the unions would probably not want to improve labour relations between employees and employers because they might be out of a job if that were the case. I cannot imagine that they would be going for it in a big way.
This motion highlights the importance of the employee share ownership plan as a way of providing a pre-retirement savings vehicle. I think that is an important part of this. The motion also recognises that employee share ownership plans as pre-retirement savings vehicles remain undeveloped in Australia. Given that the recently released paper entitled Australia's demographic challenges highlighted both the economic and social challenges facing an ageing population, we need a scheme that vigorously encourages savings and other schemes—not just one, but probably a number of different options. This could be one of them.
The second reason for ensuring that these schemes work efficiently and effectively is that they can be an important source of capital for business. I note that a Western Australian company was built up on this basis. Small businesses have a hard time getting access to capital and this is one way they could do that. From an employee and employer perspective, it is important that the schemes go beyond token schemes. Building up these schemes to become substantial vehicles for saving will require carefully targeted reforms of taxation and corporations legislation as well as regulations to ensure adequate disclosure and investor protection measures. No-one would suggest them on any other basis. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Employee Share Ownership</title>,Private Members' Business,1,1
"Edwards, Graham, MP",ALP,2004-03-01,"—Like the member for Port Adelaide, I congratulate the member for Flinders on bringing forward this motion on employee share ownership and initiating this debate. It is indeed, as the member for Port Adelaide said, a very important debate. The member for Flinders said that this debate is about three things: sharing wealth, productivity and improving social and industrial harmony. We on this side happen to agree with those sentiments. This is exactly what unions have been arguing for and endeavouring to initiate over a very long period of time. Indeed, I think it has been the unions, in representing the workers in this nation, that have endeavoured to put forward schemes such as the BHP scheme and others that reflect similar sorts of schemes overseas.
The member for Flinders also indicated that there need to be targeted reforms in this whole area of employee share ownership. He is right—there do need to be targeted reforms. But those targeted reforms need to be carried out in the context of enhancing employee share ownership opportunities and, at the same time, tightening regulation to ensure credible and genuine opportunities for workers—not in the context of generous income supplements for top executives that are funded by the taxpayer.
Like many members in this place, I have been subjected to very strong lobbying from members of my constituency. There has been a very genuine endeavour on the part of these constituents to bring this issue to our attention. For instance, I have a letter from just one of my constituents, who is employed by Hills Industries. He says:
David Simmons, the managing director of Hills, has advised me that the future of the Hills employee share ownership plan is under threat due to proposed changes to international accounting standards.
He goes on to say:
It seems most unfair that planned changes to international accounting standards aimed at moderating excessive executive benefits should have the unintended consequence of threatening broad based plans like ours.
—Order! It being 1.45 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 106A.

"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,2004-03-01,"—On Saturday evening I had the pleasure of attending a function at the Tuggeranong Valley Vikings Club in my electorate. The reason I would like to talk about this today is that that dinner on Saturday night marked quite a remarkable achievement. It saw the 20th annual presentation of sports awards made by the club to the local community through their 55 affiliated sporting and social clubs. Through those clubs in the Tuggeranong area in my electorate, 5,800 junior and 4,000 senior athletes, in 600 teams, participate in the sporting community.
On the same night the club also gave out sporting scholarships. These have been running for 17 years and have totalled over half a million dollars in assistance to 370 young local athletes over that time. Each year the club gives out these scholarships, which amount to $1,000 per university student and $500 per college student, with the aim of assisting them in their chosen sport whilst they continue their college and tertiary studies. In both cases this is a very good and clear demonstration of a local licensed club—the Tuggeranong Valley Vikings Club—being very much involved in its local community and in supporting younger people. I commend its actions.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Canberra Electorate: Tuggeranong Valley Vikings Club</title>,Statements by Members,2,1
"King, Peter, MP",LP,2004-03-01,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	calls on the Leader of the Opposition to renegotiate the lease in relation to Centenary House; and
(2)	calls on the Australian Labor Party to return to the Australian people the moneys paid in respect of rent income on Centenary House over and above the market rate since 1993.
The Centenary House lease, as it has become known, is a public scandal. It can be fixed now by the Leader of the Opposition lifting a pen and writing a letter to the Special Minister of State, Minister Abetz, offering to renegotiate the lease on what is now known to be a commercial basis. The reasons the lease is a public scandal are threefold. Firstly, it is a long lease without a fixed market review provision. The reason that that is scandalous in the current circumstances is as follows: it was entered into in 1993, as a 15-year lease with a five-year option. The fact that there is no market review provision is highly unusual. In a long lease of this type—and any lease of more than six years is usually considered to be a long lease—there would be, in almost every case, a market review provision of 12 months, two years or possibly three years at the most. The reason for that is that nobody is able to anticipate market movements beyond that period of time. That is considered to be a reasonable period for market review.
The fact that the lease in this case has a nine per cent escalation clause is another very cogent reason it has become a scandalous commercial document. The reason for that is that the nine per cent is cumulative. At the end of the 15-year period—that is assuming the five-year option has not been exercised, which it has not—it leads to a gross amount far in excess of any proper rental basis. That is easily observed by the following fact. When the lease was entered into, the per square metre basis was $367.94 over a 6,000-odd square metre lease. The current rental is $871 per square metre and will escalate again in September this year. But last year, because of the scandalous public waste, the ANAO—which is rather ironically the body that ended up leasing the premises—leased out the prime part of the premises at $314.65. So when an offset was sought against the incredible costs to the community last year, the best part of the premises—the prime area, the top floor—was only leased at $314.65, which is less than the rate when it was negotiated back in 1993.
The third scandalous aspect of this is that over the 15-year period it will be a cost, over and above what is an acceptable market return, of $36 million to the taxpayers of Australia. There is another aspect of this, which I know my friend the member for Cowper will take up. It is a very important aspect. The valuation on the premises, because of the nature of the rental provisions, will mean that its value is far in excess of that of any other property in the area or indeed in Canberra as a whole.
This whole issue gives rise to a test for the Leader of the Opposition. He says—and he has been saying this since his election—that there is more to life than economics. He says that issues other than economics should prevail in determining the test of mettle of leadership in this country. He has talked about MPs' superannuation; he has gallantly offered up his own superannuation and that of the opposition as a test. Then he has spoken about the crisis in masculinity and about Read Aloud Australia and other issues such as this, which, when they are really examined, look to be populist tosh. What he is really saying is that he is putting people before the economy. He is saying, `Let's not have alienation within our community, because that's what has happened under the Howard government.'
With the greatest respect to the Leader of the Opposition, the very question now is before him. The test for new Labor, the test for the Leader of the Opposition, is staring him in the face. If he wants to show that the Labor Party is not seeking to alienate the public from the political process, from Labor and from what they are doing, then he can pick up the pen, write the letter to the Special Minister of State and show that the Labor Party means business, that it is not alienated from the people and that it is a party that cares about the responsibilities of government.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2004-03-01,"—The king is dead! That was Tony Abbott's response to the member for Wentworth being cut adrift by the Liberal Party and losing preselection on Saturday. And he spent last week campaigning for him! What would he have said if he opposed him? This pathetic motion is yet more evidence that those opposite have no vision for the country's future, more evidence that they have made political hypocrisy an art form. There was nothing from the member for Wentworth about free trade, bulk-billing or childhood development—nothing about the real issues, because they require some forward thinking and political will.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I have a point of order. The honourable member opposite is obliged to address the motion which is moved by the honourable member for Wentworth, and I would ask him to direct his remarks to the substance of the motion. Obviously he has nothing else to say!
 (Mr Jenkins)—The honourable member for Grayndler knows the requirement to be relevant to the question. I will listen closely.
—I will be very relevant. The member for Wentworth raised a whole lot of figures. The fact is, he should have spent time concentrating on the one figure he needed to hear: 76. Instead he is here, proving his loyalty to the Liberal machine, banging the old drum—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. On a question of relevance, we have gone from the member for Wentworth, the king, to the court jester. The member for Grayndler needs to be brought to order.
—Order! The minister will resume his seat. He will not approach the dispatch box like that.
—Instead, the member for Wentworth is here, moving this motion, proving his loyalty to the Liberal Party machine and banging the old drum about a lease that is more than a decade old and has been cleared by a royal commission headed by one of this country's finest jurists. I will quote from Mr Justice Morling's report, which said in no uncertain terms that the agreed rental was `reasonable and not unduly generous to the lessor'. It also said it was:
... a fair market rental for accommodation in a building such as Centenary House ... This was supported by extensive market evidence and there is nothing to suggest that it was excessive. 
Indeed, it is not a unique lease. It was based upon the AUSLIG lease of the Scrivener Building in Bruce between Lend Lease and the Commonwealth in 1991.
This is a party room that shed tears for the super scheme when they thought reform meant retrospectivity. Now they want the ALP to pay back years of rent. Even more galling is that the Howard government has real form when it comes to spending taxpayer dollars. I remind the House that the PM has spent almost $5 million on 21 taxpayer funded overseas trips, including one European trip which cost the taxpayer $1.35 million and included a four-night stay at the St Regis Grand in Italy worth $180,000. The government has wine and gift consultants costing $15,000 and $34,000 respectively. There is the $2 million spent on commuting flights between Sydney and Canberra. Promotion through government advertising, which goes up every time there is an election, has cost $650 million. The government spent $30 million just prior to the 1998 election, including $15 million in three weeks on the tax information campaign. In just three weeks it spent half of what this entire lease is going to cost. There was a spike of $117 million in government advertising costs in the six months prior to the 2001 election.
Then there is the 10-member government members secretariat, a taxpayer funded continuous campaign unit which prepares material for government senators and members. It costs around $1.5 million every year to run. Costs over the past eight years have totalled at least $12 million, not counting the massive TA claims during the election campaigns when they all move to Melbourne. The printing bills of the coalition members of the House of Representatives came to $10.5 million in 2001, which means that, per head, $128,000 of taxpayers' money was used on their political party campaigning. The Liberal Party consistently want to raise the tax deductibility of political donations of $100 to $10,000. This would mean $30 million a year, every year, of taxpayers' money going to Liberal Party donations. I hope that the member for Wentworth—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I think the juxtaposition has gone on long enough. There is no relevance associated with the Centenary House matter here. The member for Grayndler is talking constantly about rules that were set in place by the previous government.
—Consistent with the arguments used by the honourable member for Wentworth in support of his motion, I think that the honourable member for Grayndler is in order.

"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2004-03-01,"—I want to address specifically in this matter of Centenary House the royal commission headed by Mr Justice Morling. The first point that I want to make is that it was an extraordinary royal commission in that no counsel assisting the royal commissioner was appointed. Although the Labor Party was represented by counsel, for reasons that we need not go into at the present time the Liberal Party arguments were not represented by legal counsel at all. I want to go specifically to the findings of the royal commission and I want to make a case as to why this whole matter should be reopened and investigated. Firstly, in paragraph 12 of the summary of findings of the Morling report, Mr Justice Morling found that Centenary House was owned by interests associated with the Australian Labor Party. I refer you to the annual accounts for the year ended 30 June 2003. The note to those accounts, as filed by John Curtin House Ltd, states that the company is a company limited by guarantee whose members are appointed from time to time—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order which relates to the order of the House. It was circulated that the next speakers would be the member for Fairfax and the member for Cowper. I am very concerned that they may miss out on their speaking opportunity.
—There is no point of order.
—I would just like to address the point of order.
Opposition members interjecting—
—The member across the chamber said, `You won't get a word in edgeways.' I would refer you to page 187 of House of Representatives Practice. It says:
The opportunity to raise a point of order should not be misused to deliberately disrupt proceedings ...
I would ask that you not recognise the point of order from the other side made during my speech, Mr Deputy Speaker.
Secondly, their financial accounts said, `The company is controlled by the Australian Labor Party national secretariat. The transactions between these parties consist of donations and rent received.' It goes on to say, `The company is also provided with certain administrative services from the Australian Labor Party National Secretariat.' Their accounts also reveal, most significantly, that the company—that is, John Curtin House Ltd—has given an unlimited guarantee to the ALP National Secretariat for their operating account, should it be overdrawn. That is their campaign account, I would point out, Mr Deputy Speaker.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order, I ask that the member for Mackellar table the documents from which she is reading.
—I am more than happy to. I would be delighted to table those reports. Paragraph 1 of the Morling report raises the question of a $50,000 fee offered by one Ms Penny Morris, who was a representative of the proposed lessor—that is, John Curtin House Ltd. Note it: they offered $50,000 to the Australian Property Group to accept the lease. That is a finding of the Morling report. It said that the $50,000 was offered to the Commonwealth agency charged with the responsibility of finding accommodation for Commonwealth agencies.
It is also to be noted, although it is not in the findings of the Morling report, that that same Miss Penny Morris was employed previously by the Australian Property Group. There is something very foul in the smell of this whole deal. It was never investigated fully by the Morling report and it should be looked at now. Furthermore, what people forget is that the original lease—and I had it tabled in the Senate on 1 June 1992—curiously omitted all the details of how much was to be paid. Not only did the then government of the day omit to lay a copy of the lease before both houses of parliament, as required by the Lands Acquisition Act, but in fact they deliberately withheld the information. This aspect has never been looked at.
There are many questions to be answered. It was originally a 15-year lease, plus another five-year option. The option had to be exercised in the 10th year of the lease. We did not do that. However, should this lot get re-elected for the next two terms and be able to renegotiate in 2008, they will be able to keep the Australian Audit Office there on the rent that applies—that is, $8.8 million a year—for perpetuity on a monthly lease. There is a lot at stake in this lot winning the election. I think it is time that we had a further inquiry to outline where the pipeline goes from the mint—from taxpayers' money—into the Australian Labor Party's operative account.

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2004-03-01,"—I am quite happy to speak on this private member's motion in relation to Centenary House because it may lay this issue to rest once and for all. But I doubt that it will because that is not the intent of the government member—soon no longer to be a government member—coming into this House and putting this motion forward. That is the tragedy of this. When you have run out of ideas and things to attack us on, you start going for something at the edges. That is all this is: something at the edges. We all know that this has been cleared by a royal commission. We all know that this is reasonable. It was a fair deal at the time. Just because it is good for us, you guys attack it.
This motion is about, as the government would say, a waste of taxpayers' money. Let us talk about waste and how taxpayers' money is used. This government would have to be the absolutely best at it. Nobody can waste more money than this government. In fact, if we look at the statistics on the actual amount of waste, it really is incredible. People would be shocked to learn how much waste there is. There are consultancies and fees on advertising. This is the first government in our history that has set up its own propaganda unit. It is on a scale that has never seen before. It is a propaganda unit charged with only one responsibility: the re-election of this government. I will give you an example.
—What a joke!
—The minister at the table says that it is a joke. I do not think the people out on the street think that it is a joke. I do not think they thought it was a joke when they received their fridge magnet during the `don't be alarmed, just be alert' campaign. Does anybody remember that? Probably not, but I will remind you of it. Remember that campaign and that booklet that the government spent hundreds of millions of dollars on, mailing to every single household in Australia? Do you remember that? What was the intent and the purpose of that? Apart from keeping you scared and making you a bit more fearful, what was the purpose of that? It was just to demonstrate that the government was actually doing something. What have people done with that book? Let us do a random survey around the country. Where do you think that book is today? Let me tell you: it is probably in a recycling bin. And where is the fridge magnet? That fridge magnet is long gone. The best you could have done with those fridge magnets was to stick them over your head, in case there was some sort of explosion or something like that. There was no way—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This motion is about Centenary House. It is about a specific lease. Indeed, there has not been one mention of the motion by the current speaker. I know you have chosen to recognise great latitude in this debate; however, there has to be some semblance of at least adhering to the motion.
 (Mr Jenkins)—If the honourable member for Oxley contrasts certain behaviours, he must contrast them under the realms of the motion before the House.
—It is true: the member has raised a couple of issues, and I will tackle them. I did mention the lease and that it was cleared by a royal commission. I also mentioned that it was reasonable and fair. But what I am talking about is the intent of this motion, about why this motion was put on paper and brought into this House. I will tell you what it is about: it is a knee-jerk reaction, a panic move from this government, in terms of superannuation. It is about their own super and their own pockets. That is what it is about. When we raised the superannuation issue, they were worried about retrospectivity and what was going to happen to their superannuation. It is always the case with this government. We have a prime minister who for nearly 30 years defended the superannuation entitlements of members of parliament. But in 48 hours, when he thought his political hide was on the line, he did the greatest backflip of all time and managed to do a complete reversal.
That is what this motion is about: it is trying to attack us on something that we have raised in this place, and that is what I am going to talk about. Let us talk about waste. Government members have talked about $36 million. Let us look at some of their consultancies. Senator McGauran spent $40,000 on getting a speechwriter because he could not employ one through normal means, and he had to go out and get a specialised consultant. We have the cost of spin doctors. There has never been such a cost before. We are talking about paying $500 million for specialised spin doctors to put some sort of a gloss on what the government do. That is unacceptable; that is a waste of taxpayers' money. No matter which way you look at it, if you start making comparisons about the waste of money, it is never ending. It is never ending in terms of what this government spend. They have spent $2 billion more on consultancies and paying for spin doctors than any other government before them. Since 1996, they have spent $2 billion—I am not talking $36 million. So, if we are talking about a waste of money, you should look at your own side first.

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",NATS,2004-03-01,"—The matter of Centenary House raises the question of what is fair and just and what is totally unreasonable. It raises the question of why the Leader of the Opposition defends an arrangement which is totally outside commercial practice—an arrangement which may be barely legal, but it certainly is not right. Any reasonable analysis of the Centenary House lease shows that it is rotten to the core.
It is standard real estate valuation practice that, in order to assess the value of a property offered for lease, a valuer examine comparable properties with regard to the features of the building and the terms and conditions offered by the lessor. In 1992 a report on this matter prepared by Price Waterhouse made some interesting observations. In preparing their report they carried out a survey of leasing activity with particular regard to five new quality buildings in the vicinity of Centenary House. The critically important rent review clause for Centenary House was far more generous to the owner than commercial standards of the day. Under the lease, the rent had to increase by at least nine per cent per annum and could not fall during the term—a review to the greater of market or nine per cent. This compared unfavourably with other comparable leases, which generally had reviews to market every two years or had increases far less generous than those of Centenary House.
Price Waterhouse found that the `arrangement is extremely generous to the owner and we have difficulty, unless there are facts of which we are not aware, concluding that the arrangement is a good position for the government'. It was a rort then; it is a rort today. Why would the department of finance enter into such an arrangement when the evidence is clear that it is outside sound commercial terms? The only conclusion which a reasonable person could draw from these facts is that the department was unduly pressured by the Australian Labor Party in government.
If I were to seek to lease space in Sydney, I could get a short-term lease over a floor in Chifley Square for $378 per square metre, a long-term lease over a floor in Macquarie Place for $550 per square metre or even level 21 of the prestigious Grosvenor Place overlooking Sydney Harbour for $830 per square metre. But how much does the Australian taxpayer pay for Centenary House? It is $871 now, going up to $949 in September—and the figure just keeps increasing.
It is obvious from the comparable evidence that the department of finance was pressured into signing an agreement to lease on unconscionable terms by the Australian Labor Party. It is obvious that the Leader of the Opposition supports this rip-off. But, according to the Leader of the Opposition, you only look forward—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The member for Cowper is alleging corrupt criminal conduct on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, and I object.
 (Mr Jenkins)—Order! The honourable member will resume his seat.
—According to the Leader of the Opposition, you only look forward; what happened in the past does not matter. So let us look to the future. I know that the Australian National Audit Office have indicated that they do not wish to renew the lease, but would a Latham Labor government seek to force the Auditor-General to renew? That is the question. The Leader of the Opposition has not ruled out requiring the lease to be renewed on similar terms. The Leader of the Opposition has not ruled out maintaining this rort for the benefit of the Australian Labor Party. What would the deal be like for the Australian taxpayer—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I think that the statement impugns the motives of the Leader of the Opposition, and there are forms of the House if the member wishes to pursue that.
—I will listen carefully, but in my opinion the honourable member has not transgressed the standing orders as yet. I will listen to him carefully.
—What would the deal be like for the Australian taxpayer if the current lessor sought to renew the river of gold that is currently flowing? I can tell you that a renewed lease for 15 years on the same terms and conditions would make the current $36 million rort look like an absolute bargain. If the Australian Labor Party forced the hand of the Auditor-General and required a 15-year lease which represented a continuation of the current arrangement, the rort value—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The member for Cowper is pursuing an absolutely hypothetical, fictional account of what might occur, and the member for Werriwa—
—Order! The honourable member will resume his seat.
—The value of the lease for a renewed 15-year term would be approximately $185 million. That is on top of the current $36 million bonanza. This figure is staggering, and the Australian public deserve to know where the opposition leader stands on this matter. He should state clearly and unequivocally in this House that the Australian Labor Party in government will guarantee that this arrangement will not be continued. If the Leader of the Opposition were to go into Macarthur Square shopping centre and steal from every person in that building—(Time expired)
—I think the honourable member was about to overstep the line. He should be very careful.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2004-03-01,"—The member for Cowper should indeed withdraw those comments. They are clearly not true. I think it is more important for us to talk about the substantive part of the motion moved by the member for Wentworth. There is no doubt that the member for Wentworth has been asked by his party to lead us down a path of diversion and distraction, away from the substantial issues that confront this nation. That is what the Liberal Party has asked of the current member for Wentworth. I could almost feel somewhat sympathetic for the member, given that he has been a victim of one of the largest, if not the largest, branch-stacked preselections since Federation. It is somewhat ironic that the current member—the mover of the motion—has, although complicit in that process, become a victim of a branch stack of some 3,000 members into that electorate. Because he is complicit, I do not feel totally sympathetic. However, clearly the bigger branch stacker won on the day.
It is really important to appreciate some of the comments that have already been made on the motion by members on this side. The fact is that there has been a royal commission into this matter. The royal commission found:
The terms of the lease of Centenary House are reasonable and are not unduly generous to the lessor. The terms of the lease were the result of arm's-length negotiations between the lessor and the Australian Property Group.
The commission went on to say:
No party to the lease of Centenary House obtained unfair or above-market commercial advantage from the lease ...
The royal commission was headed, as was indicated earlier by the member for Grayndler, by the Hon. Justice Trevor Morling QC, who, before undertaking his role in that commission, was a Federal Court judge and the chair of the Australian Electoral Commission and therefore someone of high standing, who actually found that there was nothing untoward about that lease arrangement. But that will not stop this government from continuing to divert the attention of the Australian public away from its deficiencies.
What we do not need in this place is this government lecturing us on ethics or morality. This morally bankrupt government should refrain from chastising anybody for improper conduct, because the fact is that it has no ethical construct in which it works; it has no moral compass when it comes to clinging to power. At the last election campaign, as we know now, the nation's reputation was traduced by a Prime Minister seeking to be re-elected through vilifying asylum seekers. Who will forget the Prime Minister's exploitation of this issue when the fabrication of children being thrown overboard was found to be untrue? Who will forget the Prime Minister's misuse of the Australian Navy in making them complicit in this fabrication?
Today the member for Wentworth has moved this motion in an attempt to distract the electorate at large from the fundamental failures of this government. It is the highest taxing government in our history, yet our education institutions and health services are struggling to match the needs of the nation. It is also failing in the area of bulk-billing. The capacity to find a doctor—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It pains me, because I know this member is fairly recent to this parliament, but he is simply not being relevant to the motion before us. He might be trying to form a contrast, but he is missing the point.
—The honourable member for Burke will continue to be relevant to the motion.
—Indeed. I am making a clear comparison between matters raised by those opposite and the fact that this government has failed in its responsibilities. We know why this motion has been placed on the Notice Paper. It has been put on as a diversion.

"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2004-03-01,"—My grievance today relates to the impact of importing apples from overseas. This is an issue I have been following since 1994 when an argument arose on the quarantining of salmon. In 1997 I introduced a private member's bill which addressed the risks associated with allowing the importation of apples from countries that had been affected by fire blight. In particular, we were looking at New Zealand because of the incidence of blight over there and I was urging the government not to risk the Tasmanian industry in the interests of some sort of trade deal. These arguments have not changed.
I would like to question the latest recommendations of Biosecurity Australia to allow imports into Australia from apple-growing countries and in particular from New Zealand where there is deemed to be a risk to the phytosanitisation of the local industry. In Australia trade interests seem to override quarantine interests, and those who are part of the quarantine assessment do not seem to be batting for their own country. I will put some facts on the record. My source is the Tasmanian Apple and Pear Growers Association, who spend an awful lot of money and time ensuring their product is at the top end of the range of products and environmentally clean and green—a principle that is vital to the survival of the industry.
Let us have a look at what has happened in the past. The quarantine measures since Federation have been effective in protecting apples and pears from a large number of pests and diseases being imported into the Australian environment. In 1990 Australian apple and pear producers complemented the quarantine action by being the first major commercial group to join forces with consumer and environmental groups, including the National Association for Sustainable Agriculture Australia, the Australian Conservation Foundation, Greenpeace and the Australian Consumers Association, to examine issues concerning pesticide uses.
The industry took the initiative to sign a pesticide charter in 1992, committing to a program to reduce pesticide use. The original target was a 50 per cent reduction by 1996. This was surpassed, and a 75 per cent reduction has now been achieved by the industry through being responsible and adopting integrated pest management programs and the development of biological control, breeding interruption programs and predatory control with beneficial insects. This industry puts great emphasis on food safety issues.
All Tasmanian growers operate under an accredited quality assurance program which contains a high level of traceability, including regular residue testing. The industry's opposition to Biosecurity's latest recommendation is based on scientific evidence relating to Biosecurity's own risk assessment identification of seven insects, one bacterium and two funguses directly associated with the importation of apples from New Zealand. In fact, all the Tasmanian industry and national industry responses to Biosecurity's import risk assessments over the past three years have been based on well-researched scientific information at great personal cost to industry members.
Australia does not have fire blight. Should it be introduced, the devastating effect will not be limited to the apple and pear producers. The adjacent bushland will also be affected. Some other groups will also be affected, including beekeepers, wholesale and retail nurseries, home and public gardens, fruit-processing companies, distributors, transport businesses and packaging companies. The New Zealand industry has compromised the health of its industry and associated environment over the years in favour of trade. This has resulted in a large problem with pests and diseases. I spelt this out quite clearly in earlier speeches, and I have no further information to tell me that things have changed over there.
In order to sustain an apple industry at all, chemical control by routine spraying is practised freely. In New Zealand, antibiotic sprays have been used since the early 1950s, including streptomycin. Australia does not have antibiotic sprays registered for use in the apple and pear industry. The question must be asked: does the Tasmanian consumer want to purchase fruit that has been subject to such high levels of chemical control and, in particular, antibiotic sprays?
Should fire blight become established in the Tasmanian environment, there will be an economic impact on the communities located in the growing region. These regions employ around 3,500 people, the industry has a gross value of around $70 million and Tasmania accounts for 18 per cent of total Australian production—about three million cartons annually and 65 per cent of total Australian apple exports. Tasmania exports to about 20 countries. The major markets are Singapore, Malaysia, India, Sri Lanka and Taiwan. Japan is one of the developing markets for Tasmanian Fuji apples. A lot of work has been done to establish that market and to open it up further in the longer term. Another market being pursued in Japan is for the Jonathon gold apple variety, and other developments are being considered along those lines.
Australia is one of only a few countries in the world free of fire blight. There is no method of eradication. If this disease were introduced, it is estimated that one in three growers could be forced out of the industry. Altogether, the estimated cost to Tasmania could run to millions of dollars and it would cause enormous problems for the other groups who would be affected, as I mentioned before. Tasmania is the largest exporting state for apples in Australia. The effect on access to existing and new markets—particularly those in Japan, which have a very high quality standard to overcome for exports—could be devastating. Getting into the Japanese market is very difficult. It took the apple and pear growers of Tasmania many years and a lot of hard work to do so. We have been able to reach there now, but there would be no way we could do it if fire blight became established. Our credibility would be completely shot.
We have to question these so-called free trade agreements when they threaten a local specific industry for some apparent greater good that is not specified. I believe that, as with the salmon argument, if we are to be threatened with a lowering of standards for some trade deals, Tasmania should go it alone and ban imports of apples from fire blight countries. It is not sound and reasonable trade if it threatens an established and growing industry in this way. I will be one of the first to stand up for the apple and pear industry should these imports ever be considered.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Trade: Apple Imports</title>,Grievance Debate,7,1
"Cobb, John, MP",NATS,2004-03-01,"—In resuming debate on these appropriation bills, I would like to switch topics to an extent and talk about health, particularly health in the state of New South Wales. The Australian government's contribution to the health budget generally is over $42 billion over the next five years. That is just, amongst other things, to provide free public hospital care. There are numerous programs over and above those which are already funded by the federal government, such as the Tough on Drugs strategy. That is funding of well over a billion dollars. There are also various strategies to bring doctors and nurses to regional Australia and to lift the number of Australians we have entering medical schools. This includes scholarships of around $700 million.
The Commonwealth provides enormous money for the federal health system. However, the downside of all that is that health is administered by the state governments. It is their responsibility under the Constitution, even though one way or another the Commonwealth provides most of the funding. Yet the states are very quick to blame any problem with health—and let me tell you that they certainly do have problems with health in New South Wales—on the federal government.
I wonder if it is time for a review not just of funding but of how funding is administered. Perhaps it is also time to look at who administers health. It seems ridiculous that we in the federal government finance health, and take as much blame as the states can put on us, yet we have no say over what happens on the ground in the hospitals or in the general running of health—and certainly not in New South Wales, which is without doubt the worst managed state for health in Australia. Whether or not health should be run by the federal government with local governments is something that needs to be looked at in the future, because the current system does not work for the patients and it does not work for the people of Australia. In New South Wales, it has created an incredible mess in hospitals and incredible waiting times in doctors' surgeries.
The New South Wales government seem to make very little attempt to deal with the problem. While the bureaucracy of New South Wales Health is without doubt the largest bureaucracy in Australia, with what must be approaching 100,000 people, very few of those people deliver health care to patients in New South Wales. It seems incredible that we can have such a large bureaucracy—almost one-sixtieth of the people in New South Wales—involved in the delivery of health, and yet very little health seems to get delivered. I wonder if one of the reasons the state government are not willing to tackle this huge bureaucracy is that it has pretty much become a political force in itself and the state government are not willing to upset those who are in it by sorting it out. By any criteria you choose to use, the New South Wales government and their health department are the most inefficient producers of outcomes that I have seen anywhere in Australia—or anywhere else, for that matter.
For an example of just how cost ineffective and inefficient the New South Wales government are at delivering health services, you could look at the town of Menindee in my electorate, 100 kilometres east-south-east of Broken Hill. Despite incredibly strong community support and numerous representations from me, the New South Wales government are refusing to even look at Menindee as a possible multipurpose centre. Multipurpose centres are one of the few areas of cooperation that we have been able to attain with the New South Wales government. They bring together health services, including primary health care, aged care and specialists' services, to disadvantaged and isolated communities. Without doubt, Menindee comes into this category.
To set up and fund a multipurpose centre, a state government has to establish a case and then put that case to the Commonwealth, because the Commonwealth funds the recurrent costs of aged care. But, as the New South Wales government is not taking any of those steps, the federal government is not in a position to pursue an MPC for Menindee. The state health department claim that they can support only the existing facilities in the area, and they are primitive in the extreme. They are going to put a new health centre there, but there will be no beds and nowhere to take people for acute or chronic care. Menindee is an isolated community. As I said, it is 100 kilometres from Broken Hill, which does have a good hospital, but it has an airstrip which is only any good in dry weather and a road that is cut off in flood.
The health centre that is proposed would only replace what is there—routine and basic accident and emergency services, and that is done by contract with the Royal Flying Doctor Service. The Royal Flying Doctor Service is one of the great successes of Australian development. The Royal Flying Doctor Service do a magnificent job, and I am certainly not casting any aspersions on what they do. But we are talking about a growing town of approximately 800 people in a very remote and isolated position, 100 kilometres from the nearest hospital. The state government do not say that they cannot afford to look at this, but that is the only reason there could be. If you compare Menindee with towns which, I am very happy to say, are getting multipurpose centres—such as Tullamore and Tottenham—you find that those towns are in nothing like the same isolated situation as Menindee. Those are towns of about 300 people with districts probably double that, and Tullamore is probably only 130 or 140 kilometres from a centre as major as Dubbo. It has access to Parkes as well, by bitumen road. It is nowhere near as isolated, cut-off and disadvantaged as Menindee.
Tottenham, a little further away, is similar in size to Tullamore, with a district of similar size. It is way under the size of Menindee. Menindee also has a very large Indigenous population. I fancy that not far under 300 out of the 800 people in that region would be Aboriginal people—who, for health care and aged care, are the hardest people to move; their culture does not make it easy for them to move even as far as Broken Hill, 100 kilometres away.
If ever I saw a town that was deserving of this sort of help, it is Menindee. I think it is the most, or the second most, disadvantaged community in western New South Wales. There is no respite care, no residential care, no handicapped care and no patient care in a town that has a population of around 800, with almost 300 Aboriginal people as well as an itinerant community of around 300 to 400 people when we are not in drought and when there is harvesting of the various horticultural activities around Menindee Lakes. As I said, Menindee was classified in 1999 as being the second most socially disadvantaged town in New South Wales. That is unlikely to change while ever the New South Wales government refuse to look at upgrading its health facilities, in a permanent sense and in a wider sense, to include aged care, and not simply a medical centre.
The high Aboriginal population and the high itinerant population very much back up the case that the community has put forward and that at this stage the New South Wales government are refusing to look at. Tourism and industry are both increasing in this region. It is not a shrinking population. It is no good for the New South Wales Labor government to simply sit back and say, `If we wait long enough, like some other communities in western New South Wales this one will become so small it won't be a problem.' That is not the case. This is a growing community, a strong community—but it is a community that needs the ability for the Australian government to look at a proposal from the New South Wales Labor government to further the health situation there. I think any reasonable person would say that is merited.
I am unyielding in my belief that the citizens of this area deserve a multipurpose centre, and if the New South Wales government is unable to see that then perhaps it is time we had a change in the Constitution. Perhaps it is time we had one government not only funding health but looking after it as well, perhaps in conjunction with local government. Here we have 100,000 people and the biggest, most inefficient, unwieldy bureaucracy in Australia, with a state government that refuses to look at the situation because it sees it as its own political mess. It is a disgrace in any terms that you look at it, and it is the people of New South Wales, especially western New South Wales, who unfortunately have to bear the cost of it.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2003-2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"Roxon, Nicola, MP",ALP,2004-03-01,"—I want to address the allocation of a modest sum of money for what is a major social problem and follow how this money has been underspent, diverted, delayed, mismanaged and wasted. The sorry tale I want to tell is of federal expenditure that has been allocated to the prevention of violence against women, and it is a story that has many parts. The first part is to set some context for why I am raising this matter in the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004.
I think it is worth touching briefly on a couple of incidents that have happened recently, and more generally, in the community. In Victoria just this last week we have seen that keeping a woman as a sex slave and torture victim in his own garage, with his wife and son living inside the house and his neighbours witnessing abuse from only metres away, was no real problem for a Warrnambool businessman who has just been convicted. Witnesses are now saying in the courts that they wish they had done something to help this victim sooner. In New South Wales there has been massive coverage about the alleged gang rape of a young woman by professional rugby players in the resort town of Coffs Harbour. This is being papered over very quickly by the club's media people, but some players, from this club and others, are now commenting that this sort of behaviour is not uncommon in rugby circles.
Nationally, about 63,000 women reported assaults to the police in 2002. We know that this figure is probably only about 10 per cent of women who have actually been assaulted, as that is the proportion of women that will go to police. Yet many in this House still do not believe that violence against women is a major social problem. Women and children are being subjected daily to violence and sexual assault by male members of their families in Indigenous communities across the country, and we are seeing drug addiction and suicide as the only escape for many of these young victims. A three-year-old child with syphilis is, I think, horrifying to everyone in this House, but it is not an uncommon story. Last year more than 32,000 women with young children in tow were assisted by women's refuges around the country, and many thousands more women on their own were also assisted. Many have suffered years of abuse and only leave when they finally see that the next violent episode may actually kill or severely maim either them or their children.
What do each of these awful stories or issues have in common? They all have in common the casual, almost dismissive manner in which the horror of sexual assault and violence against women is accepted within our community. Nearly 40 per cent of homicides in Australia are the result of domestic violence. Too often this is the tragic end of a relationship that has gone through all the preceding steps of emotional, physical and sexual abuse that are passed off as private matters by those who witness them or suspect them. On top of those women who show up in our homicide statistics, there are of course thousands and thousands of others who are not murdered but injured and abused each year by men who are often their friends, partners, husbands, lovers or fathers. This is the brutal truth.
So what funding has the government allocated in the budget to this issue? I use the context to emphasise that this is such a serious problem. Even though the extent of this problem is not widely acknowledged in the community and the statistics are just as neglected as the issue, it was welcome that the federal government recognised that it has a role to play in preventing further violence against women. As far back as 1997 the Prime Minister announced a new program of Partnerships Against Domestic Violence, with funding of $25 million over four years. Many groups in the community were led to believe that this was a signal that something substantial was going to be done to help prevent violence against women. In 1999 it was announced that the PADV stage 2 would attract an additional $25 million and that the program would be extended to June 2004. This looked like an additional commitment at the time but, with the benefit of hindsight, I am unsure whether this was just a way of stretching the period for payments over a longer time.
In 2001, a further welcome announcement was made that $16 million was to be spent on a national initiative to combat sexual assault. This was to be run over a four-year period. It was only $16 million to tackle this epidemic of violence and assault against women, and the most disappointing part of it is that we are now three years into that four-year period and we have yet to see anything for that money. Although it was a modest amount, it was enough of a commitment that, if spent properly, it could have a significant impact in this area. But, in order to have impact, the government must not only allocate this money but also develop the campaigns and spend real money on these prevention projects and campaigns.
Unfortunately, after a promising start, we can track a very sad tale when we look at the Howard government's neglect on this issue. We find that these small allocations of money have been left unspent; they have been diverted to other programs and then the money has been wasted, when it has been spent in this area. The budget papers for 2003-04 read as a Monty Python script when it comes to analysing the commitment the government has made to women's programs and women's issues. Words appear, such as `parameter adjustments', `unspent funds' and `rephasing of resources', which all basically come down to a smokescreen to divert attention from the fact that the limited amount of money allocated to women's programs has been consistently underspent and poorly accounted for by the Prime Minister's own department. However, there is one clear statement and that is on page 45 of the Prime Minister and Cabinet budget papers. It states:
Women's programs end in 2004-05.
What is going to happen after that? The additional estimates statement still notes that the money which has been allocated to these campaigns is there to be spent but, on this side of the House, we are starting to get suspicious that we will ever see anything for that allocation. Given the struggle to get money allocated to this sort of issue, when it is so hidden in the community, we are concerned that allocation is not enough. We also have to make sure that this money is going to be spent on the project.
The Prime Minister did refer to the prevention of domestic violence against women as one of his priorities after his election to government in 1996, but he now presides over a country that has increased levels of sexual assault and a domestic violence prevention strategy that has not delivered a single national anti-violence campaign in more than eight years. The government has spent several years talking about developing a national campaign against sexual assault but, in the meantime, it has allowed this money to be spent elsewhere. A shift in priorities saw $10 million of the money go, instead, to producing fridge magnets for the 2002 antiterrorism campaign. When the government was sprung for having diverted the funds in this way, it promised to spend the extra money in the following financial year—the financial year we are now in—on an exciting community awareness campaign, described as exciting by the Office of the Status of Women. This campaign was ready to be run at the end of last year, television and newspaper ads had been produced, media space was booked and experts from the US had assessed the program and were being flown here to speak at the launch.
At last those of us who had been following these issues could see that some of the money that had been allocated to this issue was being spent. Obviously money had been spent on the extensive research that had been conducted and it was found that the ads and the campaign devised were very well received in the target group of young people. Obviously the research cost some money and the ads that had been developed cost some money—we had ads for print and TV, and broader materials for schools and community education campaigns. We know that at least $2.7 million has already been spent in the production of these materials.
In December 2003, just a week before the launch was due, there was another spanner put in the works. A committee, consisting of three government male MPs and Mr Howard's private secretary, shelved this campaign. The real reason for the shock decision is not known. At best it reveals to me serious mismanagement of funds, atrocious planning by the government and, if this campaign material is never used and the campaign does not see the light of day, wasteful expenditure. At worst the decision is sexist, ignorant to the research and completely dismissive of the importance of this issue. Are we ever going to see proper resources allocated to this issue and spent on a decent project that comes to fruition? Surely this is not too much for us to ask.
What is the next stage? What is the Prime Minister now saying? Where will this campaign go? It is interesting that the Prime Minister, a couple of years ago, said he believed that we are living in a post-feminist age where women have got just about everything they need in terms of equality. Leaving aside issues that we have argued vehemently with the government about, like paid maternity leave, child care and pay equity, just to name a few, Labor clearly disagrees, on a large number of social and economic indicators, that women have achieved the equality that they deserve, but that is not my focus for today. When the Prime Minister thinks that we have everything we need in terms of equality, there is nothing very equal about the fear and reality of sexual assault and violence that so many women in our community are experiencing. The sad reality is that the majority of that violence is within relationships, perpetrated by somebody well known—often intimately—to the women.
I think these sorts of realities really focus on why the campaign that was going to be called `No respect, no relationship' was so important. In fact, the brief that the government designed to give to the advertising agencies to produce this campaign specifically says that it is targeted at relationship violence—to tackle this issue in a way that previous campaigns have not been able to do. I would like to read a comment from the brief that was given to the tenderers. It states:
Most state/territory interventions have a crisis end focus. The Australian government has committed to a leadership role on the issues of relationship violence and sexual assault, particularly in the areas of prevention and early intervention.
I am at a loss to understand how the Prime Minister can stand up in this House and say that the reason the campaign has been cancelled, delayed or postponed—we are not sure which—is that he thinks people should be referred to the police. That is the only answer he can see in this area. I will come to that in greater detail later.
The minister responsible for the status of women, Minister Kay Patterson, seems to have taken the cue from her predecessor, Minister Vanstone, and decided that, in the face of obviously almost no support from her male colleagues at the cabinet table, she will just keep quiet and not rock the boat. The sorts of things that are keeping women quiet in the community appear to be keeping women quiet in the cabinet room as well.
Minister Patterson has walked into this job inheriting more than one muck up. The debacle of the way we would celebrate women's suffrage is just another, where the Howard government could not even put up a sculpture to commemorate 100 years of women's suffrage in this country. It seems to me they had only 100 years notice that it was coming up but apparently that was not quite enough time to get things organised. Now the minister has been lumped with the shreds of the community awareness campaign that four blokes from the coalition, including the Prime Minister's own private secretary, have overturned. This is although the materials developed for the campaign and the public money already spent on it had received international acclaim as a progressive and effective campaign to stop relationship violence, particularly among young people. It is interesting that Donna Carson, a woman the Prime Minister recognised on Australia Day this year as a local hero for the work she had done in the prevention of domestic violence, has called for this campaign to be run because it would be so effective in preventing people from suffering the sorts of injuries and abuse that she herself has gone through.
That brings me to the final part of this story: what can actually happen now? How do we make sure that the money that has been allocated for this campaign, which in fact has now been spent partially, in developing this campaign, has some benefit in the community? The bottom line is that this campaign must be run. Public money has been spent and the campaign has been effectively researched; it is long overdue. It has been shown, through testing, that it is going to be a successful campaign, and we call on the government to run this campaign. We have already called on the government to change its mind and go ahead with this campaign, but if it is not prepared to do that it must release the materials that have already been produced and paid for. They were paid for with public money and they are well-developed materials. If the government is not prepared to pay the extra money to run the campaign, there may be others in the community who are. There may be television stations that would run the materials as community announcements; there may be state governments, domestic violence groups and others who would piece together some way to fund this campaign. It is not cheap to produce the materials that have been produced, and I know that many other people in this House and outside it would not like to see wasted all that work which finally has been done.
There is plenty of evidence that this sort of campaign is needed, with recent surveys showing in particular that many young men still believe that using violence against their girlfriends or pressuring girls into having sex is acceptable behaviour; clearly, it is not. The old beliefs that some young women are just asking for it, or that it is not always wrong to hit someone because sometimes they provoke it, are scarily still present and are still strongly held by some young men. The campaign effectively identified this as an issue that they could tackle. It used young men talking to other young men, which was a very effective way of getting the message through that this is not acceptable behaviour. It seems a waste to let all that work now be used for nothing.
In fact, the Prime Minister himself seems to hold some of those old-fashioned views and beliefs that the campaign was specifically designed to address. I am not saying the Prime Minister would agree with the statements I used before, but, in justifying the government's decision to shelve this campaign, the Prime Minister said he would prefer that the campaign just told young women to go to the police, their priest or someone else to talk about the issue, rather than referring young people to information on a web site or highlighting unacceptable behaviour through print and media ads. But this fundamentally ignores the fact that nearly 60 per cent of sexual assaults happen within a relationship context and that only 10 per cent of victims are ever likely to report it to the police.
Rather than relying on his own outdated ideas of what constitutes violence in a relationship or how it should be handled, the Prime Minister would be well advised to sit down and study the comprehensive brief that outlined the government's reasons for wanting to develop a mass community awareness campaign in the first place. He should take the time to understand the reasons why a simplistic answer such as, `It's a criminal act; report it,' in many cases of relationship violence and assaults does not work and, in any case, only deals with part of the problem. The government's own advice said this, yet the Prime Minister and his gang of four have ignored it.
When we talk about domestic violence, I think it is important for us to send a clear message about what is wrong and, certainly, what is criminal, and to give people the support they need to get assistance and to report criminal behaviour to the police. But what we in this House are surely trying to achieve is to prevent these instances from happening to start with. As I quoted to the House before, this campaign was directed at prevention—not at dealing with how people should cope in a situation where they have been assaulted or have been a victim of domestic violence, but at encouraging young people to develop strong and healthy relationships of mutual respect, where violence is not going to occur to start with, and perhaps to pick up some of the warning signs early on and to make sure that they get out if they see that their relationship is going in the wrong direction.
I think it is really critical that this campaign be run. It is an issue of national significance. The government has moved the money around, underspent it, not really been quick off the mark, spent it on something else and now says that it is going to spend it on this initiative. It finally spent some money on the initiative and then pulled it at the last minute. That is a great waste, and I think the Prime Minister should reconsider his position.
Evaluations from the first year of the Partnerships Against Domestic Violence projects, which were all pilot projects, show that, if we are serious about preventing violence and not just reacting to it, we have to work in the ways that this campaign was directed towards: we need to work with young people to break an intergenerational cycle; we need to work with communities to educate against violence; and we also need to work with victims and perpetrators. Going back to the old approach of telling women that if they do not go to the police it is not really violence is taking us back light-years to a culture that has ignored the insidious nature of the power imbalance and fear that characterises many relationships. 
So I call on the Prime Minister to understand, as I know he does, that violence against women is wrong. It is about the abuse of power, and it is often about relationships and respect. We need the Prime Minister's leadership to help stop this cycle of violence. We need him to be brave enough to change his mind. We need him to show some leadership and override the decision that has been made by his small committee and let this campaign run. It might be difficult and ugly for many of us to confront the reality of violence against women in the community, but it sure is a lot uglier for those involved in abusive and violent relationships. I call on the Prime Minister to change his mind.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2003-2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2004-03-01,"—I am delighted to speak today on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004 before the House because they give me the opportunity to update the parliament on matters that are important to the people in the electorate of Farrer, which I represent. The main issue on the table for us is the recently concluded free trade agreement with the United States. This will have positive outcomes not just for farmers and exporters but for ordinary consumers as well. The deal gives substantial market access gains to most of the farmers in my electorate. The beef quota, which is currently at 378,000 tonnes and is rarely filled, will rise by 80½ per cent over 18 years. Lamb and sheep meat will have most tariffs reduced to zero immediately, with the rest reducing likewise in four years. Our dairy quota is currently worth $40.5 million; it will increase by $55 million in the first year and build from there to be seriously worthwhile trade. The citrus producers in the west of my electorate in the Sunraysia region, part of which is also in the electorate of the member for Mallee, will get a zero tariff immediately. 
Our single-desk marketing arrangements for wheat have been preserved. Recently I attended a seminar in Corowa organised by the Grains Council of Australia, and farmer after farmer spoke to me in support of the single desk for wheat. This government stands behind them in support of the present marketing arrangements. I noted with interest that the chairman of US Wheat expressed disappointment that the US free trade agreement did not address what he called the `inequities inherent in the AWB monopoly' and as a result he opposes the free trade agreement. I mention that because there are those in this place who think that the Americans got it all their own way in the deal, whereas clearly a major sector of their agricultural producers is unhappy. Wine producers, who already have a rewarding market, will see all tariffs reducing to zero over 11 years. I am sure Australia's great wineries look forward to spreading to even more countries the good word about the quality wine we produce. 
It is not just agricultural producers who will realise advantages, but manufacturers and service providers will as well. For example, Australian manufacturers will be able to export light commercial vehicles—utes—to the United States once their 25 per cent duty has been removed. Deniliquin, in my electorate, is home to the annual world record ute muster, which sees utes from all over Australia come together to be counted while their owners get together and celebrate what it means to be young in rural Australia—and we look forward to assisting the Americans with a similar initiative. 
On the free trade agreement, Hugh Morgan from the Business Council of Australia said: 
The Agreement will provide massive opportunities for Australian companies of all sizes to gain access to the world's largest market.
...	...	...
It will deepen Australia's economic and investment relationships with the US beyond what we might reasonably expect from WTO arrangements to improve access for Australian business in key markets. 
Dick Pratt from Visy Industries, which runs the Visy Pulp and Paper Mill in the town of Tumut in my electorate, said:
The FTA will protect trade access and encourage expansion. This will be good for growth and the health of the Australian economy. 
Investment is the key feature of the free trade agreement because of fundamentals in the world economy that we cannot escape from—and, in fact, we should embrace them. We have become used to looking at exports, but that tends just to restrict analysis to an assumption that every country exports from its home base when, in fact, it does not. Worldwide sales by offshore subsidiaries of companies now exceed global exports. US investment in Australia is now worth about $240 billion. Australian investment in the US is worth about $190 billion. The US is, of course, the biggest foreign investor in Australia. Our own Australian icons such as the Ford Falcon and the Holden Commodore would not have come about were it not for foreign investment. Also the free trade agreement will be good for Ion Transmissions, a company that makes transmissions for Ford and Holden in its manufacturing plant in Albury. 
We are now also substantial foreign investors in our own right, particularly in the US. Our investments in the US earn income for Australians and keep our businesses on their toes. Competing in a market as tough as the American one does make for a successful enterprise, wherever it may locate and do business. I mentioned wine before, and Southcorp is a good example of a leading Australian business with significant investment in the US that also supports business in Australia. 
Superannuation and its value are of supreme importance to all Australians, as was recognised by the Treasurer in his recent announcement about the inevitability of present demographic patterns in this country. Superannuation funds have to provide the best possible returns to enable a person to retire on the best possible income, and noone would expect any less. I think it is fair to say that to earn the best returns most super funds do have investments in the US, the world's largest economy. Therefore, if we look after our investments in the US, we look after the superannuation of ordinary Australians. 
Increased technology comes from investment. That is why Premier Beattie with his smart state, Premier Bracks with his technology parks, and others in the other states all support the free trade agreement. They know that the IT and biotechnology investment they can get from the US will be invaluable to the economies of their states. This is why every Australian premier supports the free trade agreement: they want IT and biotechnology investment from the US. 
Some say that we should not enter bilateral negotiations but rather hold out for multilateral outcomes. The last WTO round stalled and we are hopeful of further progress in the next one. Clearly, multilateral outcomes have greater positives than bilateral ones. But we should not wait for perfect outcomes; they are rare in the affairs of the world. It really is a twoway street. There is a less fashionable outcome of trade liberalisation—at least one that is spoken of less often—but it does mean that prices across a wide range of imported products tend to go down and consumers do benefit. 
I was surprised to hear the level of protectionist policies and antibusiness speech-making that came out of the Labor Party conference recently. It may not come out of the mouths of the Labor members in this place to the same degree, but I am sure that it will be part of the directions they receive from those who pay the piper and call the tune. Protecting Australian jobs is the excuse used time and time again by unions and the Labor Party. Australian jobs are important, but Australian mums and dads cannot subsidise a concentrated protected sector of industry that looks after the jobs of a few while digging into the pockets of many.
At the recent Labor Party conference, the offering on trade policy by union leader Doug `free trade not fair trade' Cameron was laughed at by the Premier of New South Wales, who basically said that the removal of tariff protection in the textile, clothing and footwear sector meant that parents could afford cheaper shoes for their school children—and that is important. I thought we had moved beyond this tired old stuff. I thought we had a broadly bipartisan position on trade and industry policy that accepted that we are a small open economy competing in a global market for capital that moves around the world more quickly than it ever did. 
Chapter 11 of the ALP national conference draft agenda is called `Engaging with the global economy'. It starts off with a series of sensible remarks about the link between trade and increased standards of living, but then the platform says that a Labor government will ensure that trade agreements that the Australian government enters into:
... are assessed to ensure that they are consistent with the principles of sustainable development and environmental protection for all distinct regions of Australia.
No doubt there is a similar blurb about protecting the jobs of the workers in developing countries so that they do not have to work in Asian sweatshops and we pay them a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. I have even observed this sort of rubbish coming out in our school curricula—ruthless international capitalism trampling across the world's poor. The symbol of this—and you see it in the antiglobalisation movement and, yes, in the union bosses who fund the ALP—is the Nike shoe. So I was interested recently to read that the ruling Communist party of Vietnam described Nike as a good, responsible business. Some of the facts are as follows.
Nike has four times as many workers in Vietnam as in the US. If you compare Vietnamese factories with American ones, the work looks tough and the conditions hard. The workers in those factories compare this with their alternatives, which are much worse, like farming 10 to 14 hours a day, bending your back in the hot sun with your ankles covered in warm water and goodness knows what insects floating around. The average pay at Nike in Vietnam is three times the minimum wage. Workers used to have to walk miles to work. Then they were able to afford bicycles, then scooters. Some are now buying cars. This is globalisation at work. Multinationals bring better technology, better machinery, better management, education and, of course, access to markets. Growing productivity in a country like Vietnam will make it possible to invest in improved education and health care. Surely this will make the lives of average people easier.
While we are discussing the ALP draft national platform 2004, I thought I would examine Labor's agriculture policy. There were 17 chapters covering the platform, including one about the environment. However, agriculture does not warrant a separate chapter. It is buried in the chapter on industry, which covers manufacturing, services, transport, tourism, small business and mining. Regarding the future of agriculture under the ALP draft platform, I checked out the section entitled `Investment in Innovative Agriculture', which says:
Labor will examine and develop policies which will encourage new forms of ownership and investment by Australian capital in Australian primary industries. 
...	...	...
... specific incentives and structures that will encourage [super funds] to play a significant role in contributing to the capital base required in the agricultural industry.
...	...	...
... the development of alternative farm ownership models that may make it more attractive for institutional investors to contribute to the capital costs required to improve returns.
Can I suggest to the ALP that they do some more work on their agriculture policy and that they recognise that, in spite of successful and welcome corporations in farming in Australia today, the backbone of Australian farming is still the smaller family farm.
Superannuation funds deal with serious money, and those who rely on them for retirement have a right to expect them to perform in the global marketplace for the best possible return. But this does highlight an important difference between us and Labor. Labor says that super funds should be forced to invest in Australia and the shape of Australian agriculture should be made to change to suit this. We say that Australian agriculture should be allowed to develop in the way that lets it best reflect the society it supports and the competitive nature of farming in the 21st century.
While on agriculture, I wish to make some remarks about native vegetation laws. There is no doubt that the state laws relating to native vegetation are having a severe impact on the farmers in my electorate. I have spoken before about the NSW government and the peculiar manner in which it says it is a friend of the farmers but acts contrary to their interests time after time. The Productivity Commission has just released a draft report on the impact of existing native vegetation and biodiversity regulatory regimes on landholders and local communities. It has found that substantial costs have been imposed on landholders who have retained native vegetation on their properties. Regulation does not appear to have been particularly effective in achieving environmental goals and may have even been counterproductive. Many landholders gave evidence to the commission about the negative impacts of native vegetation legislation. I do not believe anyone was positive.
Of course, when this debate is portrayed in the cities, people possibly think that `clearing' means heading down to the back paddock where you have a stand of 100-year-old eucalypts and bulldozing the lot of them. It might mean that, but it also means that you are unable to remove native grasses in a paddock that you ploughed 10 years ago—a paddock that is an integrated part of your production cycle. The report also found that innovations such as introducing centre pivot irrigation and self-drive tractors as well as fencing and paddock rotation are being frustrated because of clearing restrictions. This can be as silly as being prevented from removing trees that have fallen down or lopping branches from trees that hang over your fence line.
I saw an example in my own electorate, where fallen timber in a dry creek bed choked any possible stream flow. The farmer dragged some of this out and left it in a heap. He did not burn it and actually left quite a bit in the creek, understanding the need for fish to have logs as part of their habitat. He is now facing a $1 million fine after a police style inquisition. Of course, you will not necessarily find a law that prevents these normal farming activities, but you will always find the forces of green advocacy acting as a gatekeeper. Everything is allowed, notionally and theoretically, but you will always need a permit or a soviet style panel to approve everything that you do.
I have another example. In the recently passed NSW native vegetation act you cannot touch remnant vegetation. Remnant vegetation is any native vegetation that has regrown following unlawful clearing or clearing caused by bushfire, flood, drought or other natural causes. Does this mean that seedlings coming up after bushfires, floods et cetera cannot be touched, even if the seedlings are not native to your area? I think it does. Further provisions of the bill indicate that you can only clear up to three metres out from your cattle yards and five metres along the sides of farm roads. Talk to any farmer about that, and they will tell you how ridiculous it is. I have said many times that regulation is a severe burden to farmers, and they continue to say to me: if governments would just get out of our back pocket and hip pocket, we would really appreciate it; we would not ask for subsidies and handouts if we were just left alone to do our business.
I am glad to say that one year after the last time I addressed the appropriation bills in this place, most of my electorate is recovering from a severe and exceptional drought. I attended a small country show in the little town of Jingellic—population less than 100 people—yesterday, and I was pleased to see that an optimistic mood prevailed. People were looking towards the future with a great deal more satisfaction and a much calmer attitude than they had 12 months ago. I can certainly understand why when I look back at what they have been through. It has rained, but we know that when it rains it does not rain money into your bank account. It will take a while for them to extract themselves from the circumstances that the drought put them in. But further out west it is not so good, and western New South Wales is still very dry. There have been some good rains in northern New South Wales and Queensland, but it literally takes months for that water to flow down in the river system. So very little water has arrived at the Menindee Lakes or the Lower Darling River. The Darling in that area has dried up into a series of rather sad waterholes.
I was very upset to receive, from somebody along that stretch of the river, an email that described the devastation, with many Murray cod dying along the banks:
In the last day or so, we found, every 200 metres, large cod floating dead in the river—estimated weights between 30 and 60 pounds. We do not know why. It has been excessively hot weather but more likely though the consistently rank water quality has taken its toll. Whatever the cause it is too late for these big monarchs of the Darling. It really is a tragedy.
I hasten to say that the cause of the deaths of the Murray cod is not the ghastly practices of irrigators who sometimes get attacked so unfairly but simply that it has not rained. The water, as it does in these river systems, has retreated into a series of holes where it has heated up and become an environment for blue-green algae. As soon as we get a flush of fresh water from up north, things will start to improve, and I look forward to that.
I, along with many other members and senators, attended the ecumenical service for the opening of parliament at the beginning of this parliamentary year. Professor James Haire gave the sermon. All of us who listened were inspired by his words and were encouraged in the work that we do. I am sure Professor Haire would not mind me quoting his concluding remarks, which I believe serve to remind all of us of the positive things we are capable of doing and our responsibility to be a force for good. I will conclude with those words:
As you come down from the Hill each night, or even in the wee small hours, can you ask yourself two questions: Am I at peace with God?

"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,2004-03-01,"—I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004. In particular, I want to make some comments about parliamentary reform and to take up the challenge of the honourable member for Farrer to do positive things and think about what we can do for good, especially in relation to the opening of the parliament.
It is no secret that I am privileged to be a member, in fact the deputy chair, of the Procedure Committee. We have been a very busy committee in this 40th Parliament. Factors of this are the good work by committee members and a hardworking secretariat. We have brought down six reports and one discussion paper in the 40th Parliament. For a government that allegedly does have a third term agenda and is committed to parliamentary reform it is surprising to go through the reports. On the Trial of additional tellers report tabled on 1 December, there has been no government response to date. Nor has there been a response to date on the Arrangements for second reading speeches report tabled on 1 December; Parliamentary paper 394 of 2003, tabled on 24 November 2003; Parliamentary paper 211, House estimates: consideration of the annual estimates by the House of Representatives tabled on 13 October; Review of the conduct of divisions, tabled on 18 August; and Sessional order 344, tabled on 19 June 2003. In fact, the government has not responded to a Procedure Committee report since 27 June 2002.
I also want to draw the House's attention to a report in the 39th Parliament that still has not been responded to: Balancing tradition and progress: procedures for the opening of parliament. This report was tabled on 27 August 2001 and, again, there has been no government response to date. Recommendation 1 of the report was that there should be an Indigenous welcoming for the opening of a new parliament. As a member of that committee, I want to reiterate my strongest support for such an occurrence. As an adult, it pains me to think that the first occasion that I can recall that our Indigenous community was truly incorporated into the opening of anything was the Sydney Olympic Games. The whole nation was uplifted by the way our Indigenous community was involved and participated in the opening of the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. How sad it is that this is the only occasion that I can recall as an Australian citizen when that has occurred. Surely you would join with me in saying how uplifting it would be to have a welcoming ceremony in the forecourt of Parliament House by the Ngunnawal people. I believe that, should Labor win the next election, that will be entirely possible. In addition to that, in any subsequent opening, wouldn't it be nice to have not only a welcoming by the Ngunnawal people—a sacred smoking ceremony—but also Indigenous representatives at that ceremony from each state and territory in the land?
The Procedure Committee also suggested that there should be a message from the Australian people and that someone like the Australian of the Year could do it. For me, I would be more inclined to have one or two young people make that message to the assembled senators and members.
The symbolism of having such a welcoming ceremony, a smoking ceremony, would place our Indigenous people at the heart of our deliberations. I think its incorporation in the opening of the Australian parliament is long overdue. It is an utter shame, an utter disgrace, that since that report was tabled on 27 August 2001—nearly 2½ years ago, when the Leader of the House was Peter Reith—the present Leader of the House, Mr Abbott, has failed to respond to the report. It is a disgrace. The failure to respond reflects the antipathy of the government and the cabinet to having an Indigenous welcome.
In this new century and this new millennium, having a welcoming ceremony would be an appropriate and a healing thing for us to do. It would bring the nation together. The people of Australia would welcome such a welcoming ceremony by our Indigenous community, just as they did with the Sydney Olympic Games. We hear government members saying, `Do positive things; do what we can for good.' I say to government members and to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, who is at the table: why won't you respond? Even if you reject the suggestion—and I would hope you would not—at least respond to the report; at least respond to the recommendation that there should be such a welcoming ceremony.
There has been a lot said about having an independent Speaker. In fact, in a number of speeches that he made, the member for Hotham proposed the idea that, for six years, you would have a Speaker from one side of the parliament and, after six years, the next Speaker would come from the other side of the parliament. This was the most creative suggestion about changes to the role of Speaker that we have had in a long time. It is not that I do not support that idea—I think it is a very worthwhile proposition—but the point that I would make is that, unless you have a government committed to reforming the parliament, it will not work in this House.
The Speaker is a prisoner of the standing orders. As much as you can have a Procedure Committee making recommendations for changes to the standing orders, if a government is of a mind not to change those standing orders, the Speaker is stuck with them. I do not know how many times Speaker Neil Andrew has suggested that the standing orders ought to be changed to allow him to rule one way or another—and I respect him for that; that is not a criticism.
I am pleased to say that the honourable member for Werriwa, when he was Manager of Opposition Business, agreed on behalf of the Australian Labor Party to two important changes in how we might reform this chamber. One was to set up a standing committee on appropriations and staffing. The Labor Party cannot claim that this is an idea that it developed. It was in fact Senator Jessop in the 1970s who proposed that there ought to be staffing and appropriations committees both for the Senate and the House to deal with their respective departments and that they would meet together for the joint departments. It is a matter of fact that the Senate proceeded to set up a staffing and appropriations committee, and successive presidents of the Senate would, I think, agree about the utility of the move and how it has been very helpful to them in negotiating with the Department of Finance and Administration for extra funding for the various things that are pertinent to the Senate.
We have no such body in the House of Representatives. It is a fact that the Department of the House of Representatives is the only area of government activity—if you can call it government activity; that is, department or statutory authority—that is not subject to any particular form of scrutiny. In this day and age, this lack of transparency and accountability is totally unacceptable. The honourable member for Werriwa supported a proposition, which the parliamentary Labor Party has adopted, to set up a staffing and appropriations committee for the House of Representatives—and I say well done.
The other area was to change the Procedure Committee. My notice of motion No. 19 proposes replacing standing order 330. It proposes that we establish a standing committee on modernisation and procedure of the House of Representatives. More importantly, it proposes that the Speaker or his appointed deputy speaker be a member of the committee. It also proposes that the Leader of the House and the Manager of Opposition Business be on the committee. If you have a government that is committed to reform and you have people like the Speaker, the Leader of the House and the Manager of Opposition Business as well as other members on that committee, clearly you will get reform. I am pleased to say that that proposal has already been adopted within the Australian Labor Party. Clearly, we in the Australian Labor Party are committed to reforming this place.
I contrast that with what the government has done. This is the 40th Parliament. The Procedure Committee has produced six reports, and not one of them has been responded to. The report on changing the procedures for the opening of parliament, which was tabled in August 2001, has not been responded to. It is an utter disgrace. There is no way that the government can claim to be of a mind to reform this parliament. The record speaks for itself. If we are to get a modern parliament, a parliament that is responsive to the people of Australia, it is not going to come from the other side of the House. I will make a prediction. There is no way that in this parliament the government will respond to the proposal to set up House estimates committees. What do the people of Australia want members of the House of Representatives to do? They want them to do their job and to hold the executive, government departments and statutory authorities accountable.
It is true that we have an appropriations debate, but that can in no way or measure suggest that we are holding the executive—the ministers of the Crown—their departments and their statutory authorities to any form of parliamentary scrutiny. We all know that the Senate does that, so why shouldn't the House? In particular, why shouldn't House ministers be accountable here? Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie, I know you to be a person of wide interests on behalf of your constituents. Why shouldn't you have the opportunity on behalf of those constituents—representing the needs and aspirations of your electorate—to home in on particular departments to find out how the money is being spent, where it is being spent and whether or not your constituents are getting a fair share? You do not get that opportunity now.
In terms of developing our parliamentary knowledge and skills, compared with senators we members of the House of Representatives are handicapped. It is true that the Procedure Committee did not mirror Senate estimates procedures but represented completely different ones. But it would benefit us all and, essentially, we would be doing our job as members of this House acting on behalf of our constituents in a way that we are not now.
I will refer to a matter that occurred in my electorate. I was very pleased to be at the award presentation with Senator Marise Payne—who was the special guest—for a program for lone mothers, called Learning Circles. There were 32 participants in the program. Half of them are now in work and the others are in training. The cost was $53,000. I would like to read a couple of testimonials. Sherrie Harris was a sole mother who came to Mount Druitt with four children. This is what she had to say:
I joined the Lone Parents program, firstly to find a full-time job and being new to Sydney, I wanted to find people I could socialise with and learn self-respect. The ultimate goal was to become fully independent and off the pension.
The Lone Parents program taught me how to find employment and training opportunities and also establishing friendships with people you saw once a week gave me a lot of support and respect for others and myself.
Doing this program enabled me to find full-time employment in May 2003 at Krispy Kreme in Penrith and I am still happily working there after 8 months (and I will still be working there when I am old enough to have a walking cane). I am extending my skills and knowledge on a daily basis through completion of various training programs and have been heavily involved in training new employees at other stores. Last week I was promoted to the Marketing and Promotions department where I will be involved in various functions and events and I have been enrolled in TAFE to complete the Certificate IV Workplace Assessment and Training.
My involvement in the Lone Parents program has enabled me to provide my children with more opportunities and has certainly improved our quality of life.
Thank you to all who have helped in making my dreams come true.
Another participant, Gemma Currey, said:
I joined the Learning Circles program to update my skills and to get the support I needed in order to boost my confidence to re-enter the workforce.
Through the program I could focus on my chosen career path (not just a job) and in July 2003 I successfully gained full-time employment at Blacktown Boys High School in the position of Science Assistant.
This opportunity has enabled me to attend various training courses and provided me with the skills and networks necessary to work in other departments within the Education system.
The Learning Circle has provided me with strong friendships and a solid support base for the future. It has also provided 31 other sole parents to achieve their dreams and be positive role models for their children.
These are two tremendously moving stories, and to hear Sherrie Harris on that day was an absolute knockout. Why am I raising this? Tragically, this program did not have Commonwealth funding. There was a mere $53,000 for a 12-month program for 32 participants. It had a huge success rate, but it appears that the program is going to close. There appears to be no opportunity to get federal money to continue this program. We have demonstrated the benefit and the impact that it has on the participants, yet it looks as though Learning Circles will just be a one-off. We cannot afford that. We keep on lecturing people about getting into the work force and getting a job but, when it comes to having programs that actually provide the wherewithal to allow that to happen, it does not happen. We do not just need programs for the Mount Druitt Learning Circles; we should have more learning circles right across Australia.

"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,2004-03-01,"—This evening, in speaking on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004, the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004, I would like to focus on the vital issue of health. There is little doubt that in the recent Queensland state election, health and the state of the Cairns Base Hospital was the No. 1 issue of concern in our region. The debate between the sitting Labor members in the Cairns region and the challenging Liberal candidates, Stephen Welsh and Bob Manning, was certainly very interesting to watch. It was characterised on the one hand by the silence and denial from Labor about the problems plaguing the Cairns Base Hospital while, on the other hand, Bob Manning and Stephen Welsh had the guts to come out and put forward a well thought out and very sound plan for reform. Labor blamed everyone but themselves for the seemingly entrenched problems and low staff morale at the Cairns Base Hospital. Labor members refused to acknowledge the genuine concerns of nurses and doctors and effectively said, `We have spent something like $130 million on redeveloping the local hospitals, so stop complaining.'
In fact, 2003 was a bad year for health in Cairns. Patients suffered and staff were demoralised. The health department unleashed a punitive review, and staff who spoke out were threatened with losing their jobs. The hospital lost an acute medical ward of some 22 beds, ignoring the fact that, despite being isolated at the northern end of the state, the number of beds per capita is one of the lowest in Australia. Cairns also lost its public cardiology service by driving three cardiologists out of the public system in less than a year. They were driven out because there was absolutely no support whatsoever given to them in their work, and it is not surprising that replacements have still not been found for those positions. An intensive care bed that was promised after a rally of concerned people from the local community in February 2002 simply disappeared due to nursing cuts.
The women in Cairns are coping with a gynaecology ward that is often closed or has dramatically reduced bed numbers. We have a situation there where women who have lost a child are sharing rooms with new breast-feeding mums. This is very difficult for those women who have lost a baby. A top-heavy centralised bureaucracy is running the show for its own self-interest. Nurses, unfortunately, are leaving in droves. If, as Labor claim, they have done a raft of things to fix the Cairns Base Hospital, you have to ask why local doctors and nurses are still expressing some very serious concerns about the state of the hospital and why patients are still being left untreated for hours and hours on end. The answer is that unfortunately we have a state government which is run by a presidential style Premier who is more interested in providing slick public relations fixes to serious problems affecting our hospital in Cairns than he is in addressing the real problems that he is responsible for.
Late last year I was inundated with letters of concern from constituents in relation to the standard of the Cairns Base Hospital. I was overwhelmed by some 4,000 responses to a letter drop calling for public comment on the condition of the hospital. One of the most heart-wrenching responses was from a woman claiming that her newborn child had died because she could not get medical attention fast enough. Another woman told of going into labour with her first child but being sent home twice over three days with sleeping tablets and pain-killers to delay her contractions because no beds were available. Finally, a 73-year-old man from Redlynch who had been waiting for new dentures for three years was forced to get by with a pair that were more than 30 years old.
We should not have to be talking about the chronic problems plaguing the Cairns Base Hospital; these problems should have been fixed many years ago. We should instead be talking about and planning right now for a new hospital and health services that Cairns will inevitably need in the next 15 to 20 years. The fact that we are not talking about the future—that the state government is still running around trying to fix the health problems of its own making—is nothing short of a tragedy.
Our state Liberal candidates during the recent election campaign got it right when they put forward a plan for addressing the problems of the base hospital. The current situation at the hospital is characterised by withdrawal of services, very low staff morale, questionable management practices, lack of resources and certainly no political leadership. What is needed is a genuine commitment to fix the problem, and they can start by reopening the lost acute medical ward and the lost gynaecology beds. Also, they could look seriously at the reclassification of Cairns as a group A hospital, which would be in recognition of the isolation of Cairns and the services our population has paid for. We also need a very transparent funding system and involvement of our local population in the running of the hospital. This has to be clear of government control of the bureaucracy.
The government has to clearly articulate just what level of health service is to be provided by the Cairns Base Hospital: no more political spin; just a statement of fact so that everyone knows and understands what is going to be done. So far all the Beattie government has provided are bandaid solutions to major problems, running around patching up one public relations crisis after another with no understanding of the cause behind these problems. Simply throwing money around in the hope of a quick fix is no answer. Funding must be backed up with serious management reform. What we need is accountability and transparency. At the moment, major funding decisions are made by bureaucrats in Brisbane who do not have to live with their decisions.
These bureaucrats should be replaced, in my view, by a hospital corporation with a board of directors headed by local business, community leaders and a chief executive officer, which would provide a degree of ownership for the Cairns community that they do not have at present. This board of directors would include specialist medical representation and, together with the CEO, would be responsible for staffing and structure in accordance with broad government policy. They would agree with the government on budgets and performance criteria, based on the specific requirements of the Cairns Base Hospital.
Mr Beattie should accept his responsibilities, stop blaming everybody else for the problems in Cairns and stop trying to wallpaper over the fundamental structure and management issues contributing to the ongoing problems. It is time to give the ownership of and responsibility for the Cairns Base Hospital back to Cairns and back to the Cairns community. Health is the No. 1 issue in this community, and the Queensland state government has to face up to this fact.
On the other hand, though, I think this situation presents a very strong argument for nationalising the Australian health system. This would ensure that all of the funding was taken out of the states' hands and given directly to the communities who needed it, avoiding the bloated administrative bureaucracy from state governments Australia wide which is certainly contributing to the dreadful problems that we are seeing in many of our state hospitals. I would encourage that line of thought; I think it is a great opportunity for us to start thinking outside the square. Given the state governments' chronic mismanagement of our health system in recent years, I do believe that this presents an opportunity to start thinking about direct funding to local communities, which would see a significant improvement in our hospitals and the provision of health services. And I believe that, by preventing the states from syphoning off and cost shifting significant amounts of Commonwealth funding, we would see greater injections of funds into these areas.
On a more positive health issue, I would like to say a few words about a wonderful non-government funded program based in my electorate which helps children with hearing difficulties. The Hear and Say Centre in North Queensland is based in Sheridan Street, Cairns, and provides education services to children with moderate to profound hearing difficulties located in areas from Townsville to Cairns and throughout the Cape York region. Hear and Say supports 10 children living with major hearing impediments throughout North Queensland. These children have cochlear implants or other hearing aids.
Hear and Say teaches children with hearing difficulties to listen, interpret and understand what they are hearing, often for the first time in their lives. Treating and teaching young children locally certainly delivers more effective outcomes than if they had to travel regularly to Brisbane—which would be the case if this service were not available—to access this support. Children identified as having profound hearing loss have only a very small window of opportunity, following corrective treatment, to learn how to listen and, just as importantly, to interpret and understand what they are saying. By the age of 6½ the learning window is all but closed.
It is clear that this is a very important service. However, as a self-funded organisation, Hear and Say North Queensland faced closure at the end of 2003 unless it secured funding for 2004. Closure would have been disastrous for those 10 young children that Hear and Say currently supports, who would have been forced to travel to Brisbane to receive the help that they need to overcome their major hearing difficulties. As you can imagine, the cost of those children having to travel to Brisbane for assistance would have been very significant, to say the least.
For many of those families, there was no way in the world that they were going to be able to afford those ongoing travel costs, given that it would have been necessary for them to travel to Brisbane on a very regular basis—every few months or so. That would have caused a huge financial drain on them. In fact, some of those families would have had great difficulty finding that money, so there is a chance that some of those kids would have missed out on that valuable ongoing training and support that they need. On top of the financial cost, the disruption to family life would also have been very significant: in most of these families there are other children, and parents having to travel with the child with the hearing disability would mean that those other children would be outside the family unit on a regular basis. It would certainly have been a great problem.
Fortunately, a local cooperative effort has led to a funding solution by securing ongoing financial support for the Hear and Say Centre in Cairns. I had a call from Hear and Say's founder and Clinical Director, Dimity Dornan, to alert me to the serious funding challenges that it faced. After a meeting with Dimity in my office, I discovered that the centre needed in the vicinity of $50,000 or its doors would close in May this year, and that that funding had to be ongoing. It could not be raised just once; the centre had to show that it could continue to provide that level of funding on an ongoing basis.
The centre's local coordinator, Kerry Endres, who has a profoundly deaf son, Sam—and I have spoken about Sam in this place before—had voiced her concerns also about the possibility of having to travel to Brisbane on a regular basis for Sam to receive treatment. Another mum, Andrea Crimmins from Port Douglas, had great concerns for her seven-year-old son, Corey, who would no longer be able to receive local treatment. I could certainly appreciate the concerns that they had. Having been previously associated with the good work Hear and Say had done, I could not say no to helping these kids to find a solution to their problems and to have the best possible start in life.
I contacted a friend, the General Manager of Trinity Petroleum—a fuel outlet company in Cairns—Jeff Hopgood. I spoke to Jeff about the plight of these families, and the response of Jeff and Trinity Petroleum to the situation was nothing short of magnificent. After some discussion, Trinity Petroleum agreed to donate $24,000 a year to Hear and Say North Queensland. This is, as I said, ongoing funding of $2,000 a month; the funding will be continuing. I suggest this is probably one of the more generous philanthropic contributions in our region. On top of that, Trinity Petroleum have offered to put collection boxes in their eight service stations throughout the region to encourage further donations from motorists. To encourage those donations, each month Trinity Petroleum will draw a prize of some $100 worth of fuel for motorists generous enough to contribute to Hear and Say.
Trinity Petroleum certainly has shown itself to be a very community conscious corporation. It has previously supported local groups and individuals in need over a number of years. But this particular contribution is something that is certainly worthy of recognition. It just shows that there are people out there—people like Jeff Hopgood—who are prepared to share some of their successes with their home communities by giving ongoing support to such wonderful organisations as Hear and Say.
I believe it would also be appropriate for us to look at ways in which both state and federal governments could also make some contribution to this organisation. Not too many years ago the opportunities in life for children afflicted with profound deafness would have been very limited. We now have a situation where these kids, through the Hear and Say centre, are able to reach their full potential. A small investment by both state and federal governments in these children would be money very well spent.
It is interesting, too, that during this process I was approached by the owner of a local restaurant, Marinades, in Cairns. They had also been made aware of the situation with Hear and Say. I spoke to Mr Dev Rao, who is the owner of Marinades, and he told me how he appreciated the fact that he had come into this country and had been very successful in his business. He was looking for some way in which he could show some level of appreciation for the support that he had received from the Cairns community. He came into my office and presented me with a $5,000 cheque. That was his way of saying thank you to the Cairns community. That $5,000 cheque went into the coffers of Hear and Say and certainly helped to guarantee that we would see Hear and Say staying in Cairns well into the future.
There is no doubt about it: Hear and Say North Queensland is an essential service for our region. I have to again say thank you very much to Jeff Hopgood of Trinity Petroleum and to Dev Rao for their incredibly generous support for this wonderful organisation. It is through their generosity that we in Far North Queensland can all look forward to seeing that organisation continue their vital work for hearing impaired children.

"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2004-03-01,"—Last week, in a desperate search for a policy—any policy—the government discovered the need to address the problem of inadequate retirement incomes in this country. In its documentation, the government said in relation to retirement incomes:
Compulsory employer superannuation contributions comprise the second pillar of the retirement income system. The Superannuation Guarantee was introduced in 1992 and the ten-year phase in of the Superannuation Guarantee minimum contribution rate was completed on 1 July 2002 with the rate now at 9 per cent. The coverage of superannuation in Australia has grown significantly as a result of the introduction of the Superannuation Guarantee system. The latest estimates show that 98 per cent of employees with leave entitlements and 72 per cent of casual employees are covered by superannuation.
You would be forgiven for believing that the government embraced superannuation; that it thought it was a good idea. But that is not the truth. This government has been hostile to the very notion of superannuation for working Australians. If the Prime Minister and Treasurer had had their way there would be no superannuation for wage earners; there would only be superannuation for the privileged. I refer to statements by the then opposition spokesperson on superannuation, speaking on Labor's Superannuation Guarantee Charge Bill 1992. In his speech on the second reading debate, the Liberal opposition spokesman said:
That is why we find this legislation so absolutely abhorrent ... Australia does not need, and cannot afford, these proposals at this time.
That is the coalition view on Labor 's superannuation initiatives that were introduced into the parliament by Prime Minister Keating. But that is not all: there is a range of further statements by this government that show exactly what their attitude has been to superannuation as a contributor to adequate retirement incomes. The now Treasurer, Mr Costello, said in this parliament on 13 May 1991:
The Government cannot expect people to create jobs when it wants to load superannuation contributions and training taxes onto them ...
That was the now Treasurer saying what he believed about superannuation and the merits of it. The current Prime Minister, when he was Treasurer back in 1981, said:
... the government had decided not to introduce the scheme of national superannuation recommended by a majority of the committee.
That was the Hancock committee back in 1981. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer of this country have a long track record of stated hostility to superannuation, and they come into this parliament now and say that they are the friends of superannuation—almost as if they had invented superannuation; but of course they did not. They displayed nothing but hostility towards superannuation. In a speech on 25 November 1985, the Prime Minister said:
The issue of superannuation is, day by day, assuming more importance in the economic and political debate in Australia, and well it may because the current campaign for superannuation benefits which flows out of the renegotiated prices and incomes accord owes more to a Chicago-style extortion racket than it does to a proper and logical extension of superannuation.
...	...	...
That was a phoney, dishonest deal contrived at the time by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. 
Of course, that action is now coming back to haunt the Government. More importantly, it is coming back to haunt the poor unfortunate employers of Australia. The employers were not given a seat at the renegotiation of the accord. They were not asked two and a half months ago whether they believed in paying 3 per cent more in respect of superannuation.
There you go: that is the current Prime Minister then, again, indicating his total hostility to superannuation for working Australians. But, of course, Prime Minister Keating prevailed. He said in a speech in July 1991:
It's a very long way off for most of you here, but what I want to talk to you about today is an issue that is going to be of critical importance to Australia over the next few decades. That is the issue of retirement, and how we pay for it. What we need is not only recognition of the problem and a solution, we also need decisive action to put that solution into effect ...
And he went on to explain what he had in mind. That was Mr Keating back in July 1991—and here we are in 2004, and this government have now discovered the importance of superannuation to adequate retirement incomes. Back in 1991, Labor leaders were saying, `That is exactly what we need,' but they were opposed, root and branch, at every opportunity by the coalition. Worse than opposing superannuation, when this government came into office they cancelled Labor's co-contribution in their 1996 budget. In so doing, the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, broke his promise. An article in the Age of 3 February 1996, before the election, states:
Mr Howard said the coalition would guarantee that taxpayers would get the “full measure and the full value” of the proposed Government payments, but this could be “by way of supplementation or some other benefit”.
...	...	...
He said people would “be no worse off” or “short-changed by a Howard government”.
Short-changed? They cancelled the superannuation co-contribution that would have taken superannuation adequacy up to 15 per cent; and then they have the gall, last week, to say they have discovered superannuation and the need for an adequate retirement incomes policy. What hypocrisy! Hypocrisy, thy name is Liberal.
The government continued with the big Liberal lie. The big Liberal lie is this: this government cancelled the superannuation co-contribution, which was the second instalment of the tax cuts that were promised by the previous Labor government, and the Treasurer has said repeatedly, `There was one tax cut which did not pay $1 to one person for one day.' The Treasurer has said this time and time again. He said it again, in parliament on 11 May 2000, when he said:
... the last time they were promised them they were not paid for one day and for one dollar.
Not only did he say it then and once before but the Treasurer of this country has said in this parliament 12 times that Labor's tax cuts were not paid for one day or for one dollar—including in a matter of public importance speech titled `Public life: Ethical standards and honesty'. In that speech, the Treasurer repeated his lie that Labor's tax cuts were not paid for one day or for one dollar.
Let us have a look at the truth. The first half of those tax cuts were delivered, and they were delivered ahead of schedule. Just the first half of those tax cuts were a much bigger proportion of income tax collections than the Treasurer's own tax cuts in the 2003 budget were. I have worked it out. The Labor tax cuts, delivered ahead of schedule in 1993, were 5.1 per cent of personal income tax; whereas the Treasurer's tax cuts of 2003 were 2.5 per cent of personal income tax. The second instalment of the tax cuts was converted by the Keating Labor government into $4 billion worth of superannuation contributions for working Australians, and it was that co-contribution that was cancelled by this government after Mr Howard, then the opposition leader, promised that there would be no disadvantage, that he would not be taking anything off the working men and women of Australia. But he did. One of the very first measures of the government, when they came into this parliament, was to cancel that co-contribution, worth $4 billion, which would have taken superannuation up to 15 per cent. Then they come along and say, `We really need to do something about the adequacy of retirement incomes.' How on earth these people have managed to get away with this for so long is beyond me. It is absolutely breathtaking. When the Treasurer speaks about tax cuts, he also speaks about budgets. In parliament on 10 May 2000, he said:
First of all, we put the budget into surplus on a headline basis, which the Labor Party never did. Then we say, `We ought to put the budget into a surplus on an underlying basis,' which the Labor Party never did.
That is just untrue; it is another great Liberal lie. Labor produced headline surpluses in 1987-88, 1988-89, 1989-90 and 1990-91, and Labor produced underlying surpluses in 1972-73, 1973-74, 1974-75, 1987-88, 1988-89, 1989-90 and 1990-91. Yet the Treasurer said Labor never produced a surplus on a headline basis or an underlying basis. When talking about tax cuts at the National Press Club to a packed audience of journalists on 10 May 2000, the Treasurer said:
... there is a very large proportion of the Australian public which has no experience of income tax cuts. If you've been in the workforce for 10 years, you've not known what an income tax cut is ... And I was thinking back through my own experience of taxation policy, of my own experience and I can vouch for someone who has been in the workforce for about 20 years. Was that whenever we seemed to get to the barrier on income tax cuts, for some reason or another they were never paid.
Again, this is another great Liberal lie. Labor gave tax cuts seven times in 13 years. I will give you the years: November 1984, December 1986, July 1987, July 1989, January 1990, January 1991 and November 1993. Yet the Treasurer went to the National Press Club in 2000 and said there had not been a tax cut in this country for 20 years, and the Press Club full of journalists apparently accepted that.
This Treasurer says the same thing over and over again—the same untruth, the great Liberal lie. He is getting to the point where he knows that, if he says it over and over again—and he has already said it a dozen times in the parliament—people will believe him. He says that there were no tax cuts for 20 years, yet there were seven tax cuts in 13 years under Labor, handing back every cent of bracket creep and even more. That is something that this government has never done. This government owes the taxpayers of Australia a large amount of money in bracket creep—a fact that has been reported widely in the Australian newspaper, amongst many.
How much longer are the government going to get away with the big Liberal lie that Labor's tax cuts were never paid for one day or for one dollar? The fact is that the Liberals in government in 1996 cancelled the very superannuation co-contributions that would have taken retirement incomes up to an adequacy of 15 per cent, the target figure. They withdrew that—they axed it—after promising that they would not do so. That is why I say: `Hypocrisy, thy name is Liberal.'
The government has been searching for a third term agenda, a third term policy. It has no third term agenda, let alone a fourth term agenda. For eight years the Howard government has been harvesting the productivity yield from the hard economic reforms implemented by the Hawke and Keating governments. Now, tragically, productivity growth is forecast to turn down again, after a record-breaking decade. And what is the government doing about it?
I started warning about this in the year 2001, because the portents were then clearly evident. For its productivity growth and Australia's prosperity the government has relied, overwhelmingly, on Labor's creation of an open and competitive economy. But you cannot create an open and competitive economy twice. Without a new economic reform program aimed at the new sources of productivity growth, Australia's productivity performance was always going to suffer. And a slump in productivity growth and the ageing of the population are about as dangerous a cocktail as you could possibly imagine. Each ingredient—the productivity slump and the ageing of the population—is harmful, but together they are pure poison. Yet that is the official outlook.
The report heralded by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister of this country last week, their own Intergenerational Report, forecasts productivity growth to slump back to its 30-year, mediocre, long-term average by the middle of this decade—which is one year away. And what is the government doing about this disastrous outlook? On productivity, it is doing absolutely nothing. If you combine that forecast slump in productivity growth with the ageing of the population you get a startling result. By the year 2010 onwards that poisonous combination is expected to cause an almost halving of Australia's per capita GDP growth. This forecast slump in Australia's per capita GDP growth from the end of the decade onwards would constitute the slowest rate of improvement in measured living standards in Australia since the 1930s.
The government's own official documentation is forecasting a per capita GDP growth rate from the end of this decade not seen since the decade of the Great Depression. And they have only just woken up to it. They have an Intergenerational Report and last week they woke up to the need to address retirement incomes policy in Australia. And what was their response? They did a bit of tinkering here and there, and they attempted to appropriate the whole notion of a retirement incomes policy. They are attempting to appropriate for themselves the whole notion that superannuation is good when, for the last 15 years—or going back to 1981, in the case of the Prime Minister—they have expressed and displayed nothing but hostility to superannuation for the working men and women of this country. Over that entire period, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer and other spokespeople have argued that superannuation should be the preserve of the privileged and not be available through the mechanisms that Labor has used to deliver superannuation to the working men and women of this country.
The prognosis on productivity is a slump in productivity growth from next year back to the 30-year, mediocre, long-term average after a record-breaking decade. So what is the government doing about productivity growth? Nothing. The three sources of modern productivity growth, as recognised around the world, are skills development, new ideas and infrastructure. This government has failed to invest in skills formation in this country—a fact that is recognised by the Productivity Commission. There has been no discernible contribution to productivity growth through skills formation over the last decade. What an indictment on this government. There has been no contribution from skills formation because there has not been any significant skills formation.
The government's contribution to all of this is that, over the 10 years to 2001-02, government spending on education fell from 4.3 per cent of GDP to 3.8 per cent of GDP. The Intergenerational Report forecasts further reductions in government spending on education. The government has done nothing about skills formation. A yawning gap has opened up in Australia's private sector investment in research and development, compared with that of the countries with which we compete. There is precious little in the way of infrastructure and in the other area—the ageing of the population—in which the government is tinkering. 
There was a great opportunity for Australia in 1996 as a result of the second tranche of tax cuts that were converted into superannuation co-contributions. The most vandalistic action of this government, which has prejudiced the retirement incomes of generations of Australians, has been to cancel the co-contribution. Yet the Treasurer of this country says that the tax cuts that were promised by Labor were never delivered for one day or for one dollar. He said that 12 times in the parliament and many times in other places. It is a great Liberal lie. He has the temerity to speak about public ethics, in a matter of public importance, and about the importance of telling the truth. Give us a break! 
That is what this Treasurer has been up to. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have displayed nothing but hostility to superannuation for the working men and women of Australia. Last week they discovered a problem, but they have never posed a solution because they do not believe in a retirement incomes policy for the working men and women of this country. They are vandals and they ought to be condemned for their vandalism for cancelling those co-contributions back in 1996 and for then having the temerity to lie about it.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2003-2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2004-03-01,"—I rise to speak in support of the government's Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004,Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004. Amongst other initiatives, these appropriation bills include expenditure critical to maintaining Australia's peacekeeping commitments and aid work in the Pacific. As well, there are funds to assist in putting people traffickers out of business. Such appropriations demonstrate that this John Howard led government does not simply offer platitudes or pay mere lip-service to the values that underpin our society. This government is prepared to commit funds, our own defence forces and other resources to actively assist countries who seek to deliver the freedoms and safety that we now take for granted. 
More than 1,000 individuals holding three- to five-year temporary protection visas live in the electorate of Murray. Most came originally from Iraq. They have joined another 4,000 or so humanitarian refugees, also mostly from Iraq, who came through the legitimate channels and have recently settled in the Cobram and Shepparton communities. The TPV holders tell harrowing tales of unseaworthy, dangerously overcrowded boats, and of the misinformation peddled by the criminals operating the trafficking networks. Many consider it a miracle that they managed to survive the last leg of their journey that took them by aircraft through a number of countries until they pushed off from a beach on their short sea voyage from Indonesia, bound for Australia. We will never know how many people drowned at sea during a time when human trafficking seemed a comparatively straightforward way to jump the queue for refugee resettlement in Australia. Through swift and appropriate action, our government has broken the back of the people-smuggling gangs, who had no interest in the safety of their human cargo once it had paid up and was pushed off. 
I strongly support our government's measures that have helped to put the people smugglers out of business. This measure has saved lives. As well, it helps to ensure that our own carefully managed humanitarian program delivers relief and a new life to the most needy. Priority access to the security and protection of Australia should not be determined according to who has the best connections with criminal networks and who can most readily raise the funds to buy their way across borders.
While the appropriations detailed in these bills ensure that our international peacekeeping and aid work continues, the appropriations also deliver nearly $300 million in drought assistance and interim support payments to rural and regional Australia, where families are struggling to overcome the economic, environmental and community impacts of one of the worst and most extensive droughts on record. The Commonwealth's exceptional circumstances drought assistance continues to put food on the table for over 1,000 families in the electorate of Murray. 
Unfortunately, because of the failure of the Victorian government to cooperate, at least another 1,000 families, trying to survive on the Murray irrigation system, received only six months of interim Commonwealth support. This support ceased in September last year. The Victorian state government refused to drought declare the area covered by the Murray irrigation system. However, it did declare others—the Goulburn, the Campaspe, the Loddon and some dry land areas—as drought affected, opening for them access to the full `exceptional circumstances' support that the Commonwealth could provide. Farms in these state preferred areas also became eligible for a $20,000 grant offered by the state in a small window of opportunity which they snapped shut immediately the 2003 state election was over. Hundreds of families in these state preferred areas missed out because of the sudden withdrawal of funds. Those in the Murray irrigation area never had the opportunity to apply, even though they too were in desperate circumstances. I cannot begin to tell you how stressful it is when some in a community receive assistance and others, equally worthy, miss out. 
I wish to thank the Commonwealth government for stepping in and delivering at least some six months of interim support for Murray irrigators, despite the lack of recommendation from the state. Sadly, however, without the state backing their bid for full `exceptional circumstances', their interim support lapsed. Since then the local Centrelink office has noted a 500 per cent increase in applications for the Commonwealth Farm Help program which continues to deliver some weekly support payments that are literally putting food on the table for the numbers of these farm families now without EC support. 
It is very difficult to imagine how the Victorian government can continue to justify why the Murray irrigation system irrigators, who are operating the same mix of enterprises as those next door and are experiencing the same weather conditions and with very similar economic circumstances, have never been given access to the Victorian government's drought relief package. I believe they have a moral obligation to now extend the state package to such farm enterprises, given that the Victorian government's refusal to supply the data or statement of support required by the EC regulations meant their application for full EC payments could not proceed.
In a cruel twist of fate, on 29 September last year the coldest series of frosts on record wiped out much of the season's harvest for these same drought affected orchardists in the Murray and Goulburn valleys. Hail and strong winds followed. Cereal crops, as well as fruit, were destroyed. So here we go again: trying to get the state to support the case for exceptional circumstances funding for another extraordinary event, which wiped out more than 50 per cent—and in some cases over 95 per cent—of the returns of the farm enterprises affected. In a rerun of the drought EC application debacle, the Victorian government argued for months that they did not intend to pay for the data collection—a task which is readily and regularly undertaken by other states as part of their responsibility in bringing forward EC applications to the Commonwealth. In northern Victoria, because of the state's refusal to pay, local councils have employed consultants and farm organisations have tried to raise the funds to produce the data, which then must still be passed through the state as it makes its application to the Commonwealth. Four and a half months after the frost damage, the Victorian government submitted an EC application for the Goulburn Valley orchardists. The omissions in the data submitted were so significant that the Australian government has requested that further information to argue the case be urgently supplied. Is it any wonder that small orchards in particular are in despair and banks are becoming extremely nervous.
Quite clearly, the review of the exceptional circumstances regulations and processes now under way must eradicate the potential for uncaring city-centric state governments to stymie applications for assistance. They should not be able to deliberately go slow or cause delays by delivering such incompetent material that precious time is wasted. Exceptional circumstances support should not be about political point scoring but about delivering emergency funding in exceptional circumstances from caring governments which understand what is at stake.
To compound the problems of frost damage and the consequent loss of the season's early fruit, early pickers were turned away; they have now failed to materialise when the pears and late fruit crops are in need of harvesting. So, in the first weeks of full operation in local fruit manufacturing, after many weeks of delay, with significantly less fruit to process, with export returns being killed by exchange rates, with the domestic market's dominant retailers viciously squeezing suppliers' prices because they can, and when things could not have been tougher for the northern Victorian fruit industry, the unions decided to shut down the factories. Can you imagine a more bloody-minded and short-sighted action than the union bosses of the AMWU pulling out the workers at the SPC Ardmona factories, with demands for wage increases, long-term job security and less management flexibility in transferring workers between the two factories sites, which are some 10 minutes drive apart. This was a strike that took work from a huge casual pool of seasonal workers who depend on the few months of work to supplement family income for the year. It was a strike timed to do maximum damage to an industry sector that was at its most vulnerable due to circumstances way beyond its control.
Obviously, all Victorians are going through an industrial relations induced nightmare at present, as the Bracks government leadership reaps the results of years of capitulation to union interests—too often at the expense of a competitive and flexible business sector. Job security becomes fairly meaningless—in fact, academic—when the boss's business has gone to the wall. Nor is the public sector immune from this current industrial unrest. Victorian teachers' strikes could see 60,000 students being kept at home next week. Nurses are keen to see their demands met or else. Power has been cut by workers who did not seem to care who was hurt, how or when. There is currently 30 per cent more industrial disputation in Victoria than in any other state.
The federal Leader of the Opposition, the member for Werriwa, in his first few days in the job liked to claim that anyone in Australia can achieve and make good—make a future—if they would just put in the hard yards, like him and his mum and the rest of his mates. I challenge him to look a Goulburn Valley fruit grower in the eye, when they have invested everything and have worked very hard only to find that freak weather conditions and the exquisite timing of the union's actions have put all this at risk. Old Labor habits die hard, despite the rhetoric. When a few union leaders can disrupt the enterprise of a region that is struggling to regain momentum after the worst drought on record and the worst frosts on record and the financial consequences of the state's dairy deregulation decisions, there can be no direct relationship between effort and earnings.
When the factory that converts your fruit to income to feed your family and to pay off the overdraft is shut down because no-one is going to break the picket line, there is not much joy in the words of the member for Werriwa. Besides, primary producers have long memories; they remember the days when sending top grade fresh fruit to the ports in containers was a lottery: `Would it leave on time?' `Would it go at all?' `Would the wharfies work this week?' Those days are over, thanks to the courageous industrial relations reforms of the Howard government. Today we boast some of the most efficient waterfront practices in the region and, because of the huge investment the Australian coalition government has made in major and minor roads and rail, the fresh and manufactured produce can get to the wharves in record time and in peak condition.
As I talk to my constituents, tough-spirited as they are, they like to reflect on aspects of their business activity that sustain them during this adversity. They thank the heavens and the Treasurer, Peter Costello, for the low interest rates in a growing economy. They remember only too well the 22 per cent interest rates in the early 1990s when Labor governments held sway in the state of Victoria as well as federally. They remember `the recession we had to have'. They applaud the free trade agreement and its prospects for them if it is passed by the Labor opposition. They acknowledge the more than $1 million per week from the Commonwealth which flows into the region for those still receiving exceptional circumstances payments and the support from Farm Help.
My constituents acknowledge the efforts being made to bring better services and infrastructure to small towns and diminishing communities—for example, through the great rural transaction centres, through small equipment grants, for veterans' projects and for the aged, and for employment projects to try and get work for the Indigenous population and for those who have not had a job in their family for generations. Since 1997, mobile phone coverage has become a reality across most of the electorate of Murray. Over 30 exchanges have been upgraded, giving access to faster and better telecommunications services. It is becoming less of a disadvantage to advertise the fact that you do business from home. These appropriation bills put another $12.8 million into helping fund the government's response to the recommendations of the inquiry into regional telecommunications.
To the Murray electorate goes the dubious distinction of having what are amongst the lowest bulk-billing rates in Australia, and this is not a recent phenomenon. The rates were at around 30 per cent when the Liberal government was first elected in 1996. Low bulk-billing rates are a direct consequence of a lack of sufficient health service providers—doctors, nurses, specialists of any description. General practitioners are more inclined to charge $20 or more above the Medicare rebate than offer bulk-billing to individuals—it does not matter if they are health care card holders, juveniles or those in deep distress who wait for weeks for a very short appointment.
These appropriation bills nominate some $38.8 million in funds for the implementation of the MedicarePlus package. This package aims to give greater incentive to doctors to offer bulk-billed services in particular to welfare recipients and the young. As well, it aims to provide a safety net for those who end up having to buy a significant number of health care services because of their circumstances and their health. The John Howard government recognised the decades of neglect that had occurred and started investing in the Murray electorate's health care future seven years ago. A Goulburn Valley department of rural health and clinical school was funded, amongst some other half dozen such projects across Australia. This clinical school and department of rural health operates in association with the University of Melbourne. The aim is to train city based students in a region where hopefully they will choose to stay.
The measures in the 2003--04 federal budget build on the government's $562 million regional health strategy. As part of a package to help with medical indemnity, the federal government is providing $10.3 million over four years to increase financial support for obstetricians in rural and remote areas. Given our need for such services with babies now very often not able to be born in nearby hospitals, I can only applaud the efforts being made to bring back gynaecological and obstetric services to rural and regional Victoria. There are rural retention program incentives and special rural women's GP services now being funded; there are financial incentives to help rural students study medicine. In Murray some of our brightest and best students can now go to university and study medical or other health related sciences because the government is helping them pay their way.
 There is a critical need to enhance the provision of health care services in northern Victoria, where rates of depression have escalated due to the financial pressures from the drought—and, tragically, suicide rates reflect this. Schools report extreme distress in adolescents and young children, reflecting the tensions being experienced in families where—for the first time for many—there is simply not enough income for new school uniforms, shoes, excursions or school equip-ment, which are needs that accumulate and are accentuated at the beginning of each school year. A cry has gone up from teachers and parents pleading with the Victorian state government for special assistance. Its only response to the crisis in the schools has been to threaten to withdraw teachers, given declining enrolments as families are forced to leave the region due to the drought. Even a call for the state supplied education maintenance allowance to be brought forward for eligible families has fallen on deaf ears.
The Commonwealth is committed to trying to ameliorate the impacts of extraordinary seasons and circumstances on the longterm viability of otherwise sustainable rural and regional communities—commun-ities that would not otherwise recover from the impacts of eroded assets and escalated debt. The Commonwealth government has been left to tackle this job virtually alone. State governments have walked away, given piecemeal support or implemented policies like fodder or feed transport subsidies, which simply inflate prices and make the problem worse.
Over $900 million has been earmarked by the Howard government to sustain individual enterprises, both farm and small dependent businesses locked up in drought or blighted by frost or some other unique and not to be planned for event. These assisted individual enterprises can in turn sustain employment and grow the economies and social capital of rural and regional communities. Our government understands how important this is. Given their location in the landscape and their utilisation of the land and water to generate personal income, farming households have an additional responsibility compared with those who are salaried or who live in urban Australia. Farmers must generate their income in such a way that does not degrade the natural resource. Such degradation would have longterm consequences not only for their own livelihood but also for the nation. David Suzuki is fond of reminding us: `In a world where everything is connected, any action has repercussions and so responsibilities accompany every deliberate act.' Rural communities, especially those in Murray, are very alive to the consequences of land management practices and they accept full responsibility for trying to sustain resources on their own land. They cannot do that, however, if their own economic survival is in jeopardy or they are too exhausted or too dispirited to pick up the pieces and try yet again. 
Once again I commend the Commonwealth government on acknowledging the needs of rural and regional Australia—needs which are often the same as those in urban societies: adequate, affordable and accessible health services, transport, telecommunications, housing and educational opportunities, a fair return for a fair day's work and a sense of a future worth pursuing. But smaller regional communities often require different institutional arrangements to operationalise their service delivery. This government has both the heart and the soundly managed economy that will make and is making a difference. I am proud to be part of this government and I commend the bills to the House.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2003-2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2004-03-01,"—Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004 before the House involve additional spending to the tune of some $957 million this year. That is $957 million additional of taxpayers' money. But what this highlights again is that this is a government that is profligate, a government which has no agenda—because it keeps making these decisions on the run—and a government which runs a non-transparent budget policy. An analysis of the Howard-Costello budgets reveals that the only thing greater than its propensity to spend money is its propensity to tax Australians. Indeed, in the latest mid-year economic and fiscal outlook, spending as a result of government policy decisions rose by a further $5 billion over the forward estimates—$5 billion from when the budget was brought down in May to the MYEFO at the end of last year.
How was this expenditure paid for we may well ask, because the government is often saying to us, `Where does the money come from?' In the government's case it did not come from reordering priorities or cutting waste and mismanagement; it came from raising taxes, because over that same period between the budget and the MYEFO the figures reveal that the Costello tax grab increased by $19 billion—in the same forward estimate period. But this spending spree that we have talked about—the $5 billion to date—has only just begun. It is not only that which is contained in the appropriation bills before us. There is also the `MedicareMinus' package that the government is still trying to get through. What that proposes is spending up from the original $900 million to some $2.4 billion. But even with that additional spending it still cannot save Medicare and restore bulk-billing for all Australians. It will pay for a $5 rebate for concession card holders to lift bulk-billing but not for the whole of Australia. Only Labor will do that. If it is right to lift bulk-billing through that $5 rebate for concession card holders, why not do it for the lot? We have demonstrated that that can be achieved for less than what the government is proposing.
There is also the $300 million higher education backdown. University fees are still going to go up 25 per cent but, for the minister for education to get his higher education bill through, another $300 million of expenditure is still on the way. Then there were the weekend's announcements: $363 million for Catholic school funding arrangements; the $100 million-plus cost of fixing medical indemnity; and the $225 million which was the government's botched attempt to respond to the Clarke review—that humiliating circumstance in which the Minister for Veterans' Affairs was forced to not proceed with her ministerial statement. We still await with interest what that solution was, but $225 million was committed and it failed to achieve the result. We also await the additional expenditure consequent upon the government's response to the Hogan review of aged care. There is the expected continued bailout of the Job Network. There is the ongoing arrogance of the Prime Minister's overseas trips—the $10,000 a night hotel bills in Rome and other places—and there are the two public houses for the PM at Kirribilli and the Lodge. There is no public housing crisis for our Prime Minister. The list goes on.
—That is cheap.
—It is not cheap. This is costing the Australian taxpayer every time, and the parliamentary secretary at the table says it's cheap. Cheap? It is billions of dollars, and they want to talk about fiscal discipline. The list goes on, and there is only one solution to how the government pays for all of this—higher taxes. Tax and spend is the Howard government legacy. They have rewritten the book. Their first golden rule of fiscal policy is: tax to the hilt and then spend the people's money. Their second golden rule is: spend the surplus as a tactic against political opponents. It is hard to imagine an approach that could display more contempt for Australian families or more disregard for Australia's economic future.
Of course, budget honesty has been the great casualty. The budget papers are so turgid that they are almost indecipherable. Decisions are masked through accounting tricks and sophistry. Indeed, in the bills before the House, two new clauses have been added which increase the power of the minister for finance to make decisions with relevant ministers on any line item of the budget. But in true style there is no provision to have these decisions disclosed. To make these provisions worthwhile and to improve the integrity of the budget process, what is needed is a system of continuous budget disclosure—something this government refuse to do, yet they talk about the Charter of Budget Honesty.
The cost of the misplaced value system of the Howard government is borne by Australian families. Our families have never been under greater financial stress than they are now. They face record taxes, they have never been more in debt and, as interest rates are forced up because the Treasurer has fuelled a housing bubble, it will be Australian families that are hit again. First, there are higher taxes, then increased charges for basic services and now higher interest rates. And what is the solution that is offered to these people by the Treasurer? Work till you drop and get paid less for the work that you do, while the government makes it easier for people to be sacked from their job. That is the extent of the future offered by this government. We do not see any agenda to boost productivity, any agenda to invest in our people, any agenda to invest in our communities and our infrastructure or any agenda to reduce the stresses, financial and otherwise, on our working families.
We know that this is the highest taxing government in Australia's history. We have seen new tax after new tax on airline tickets, sugar and milk—all new slugs on Australian families. Then there is the mother of all taxes, the GST. This is a Treasurer who has never seen a tax he has not fallen in love with, but the GST is a tax he does not want to even own. I mentioned earlier that to see the propensity of this government to tax Australians you need only observe their behaviour in the last six months of last year. Between the budget last year and the mid-year economic forecasts, estimated tax revenues over the forward estimates went up by $19 billion. The Treasurer boasts that he has reduced debt. That is easy if you sell the nation's assets. Of course you can pay off the mortgage if you sell the house. But debt reduction on the back of privatising Telstra has not been good policy in the past and it is not good policy now.
—Where did the Commonwealth Bank go?
—The member for Sturt, the prattler, is never able to make a contribution in the House except to prattle at the table. No wonder he still sits on the backbench.
The government has forced Australian families to take on more debt, as budgets are squeezed by the cost of education and health services, and higher taxes. Never before have Australians faced higher levels of household debt. Now the government says it wants to debate fiscal strategy. At this stage of the economic cycle, we should be seeing significant budget surpluses over the forward estimates. Instead, what we see is an exorbitant budget spending spree. At every election, this government spends up big—very big.
Our shadow Assistant Treasurer, David Cox, has done some interesting analysis on this. In the election year 1998, the net spend by this government was $20.7 billion. In the election year 2001, there was a net spend of $25.6 billion. In 2003, while fuelling speculation of an early election, we saw a net spend of $23.2 billion—it is fiscal deterioration at its worst. There is still no agenda—just a government making policy on the run and prepared to buy votes at any cost.
Let us look at what the government does in non-election years. In non-election years the average spending of the Howard government is around $125 million—not the $20.7 billion as in 1998, or the $25.6 billion into 2001 or the $23.2 billion in 2003. The Howard government's fiscal strategy is well known: build up the war chest and spend it all at election time. Herein lie the two golden rules I outlined earlier as the government's approach to fiscal policy.
Labor, of course, have a different approach to fiscal policy, because we take it seriously. Labor's policies are, and will be, fully costed and funded. We will ease the tax burden on Australian families, with our highest priorities being relief for lower- and middle-income families. These families are struggling under the pressure of high effective marginal tax rates. If the Treasurer is concerned with work force participation, he will target this group for tax relief too. Labor will cut the Howard government's waste and mismanagement. We will redirect funding towards Labor's priorities on education and health. To date we have identified savings in the Howard-Costello budget of over $5 billion—by reordering priorities, cutting waste and exercising the choices a budget gives to invest in people. We have shown that we can make education more accessible and affordable, we can save Medicare, we can save the Murray River and we can do it by a reordering of priorities. Indeed, we have even embarrassed the Treasurer into acknowledging some of his wrong priorities and into accepting Labor's savings. It underscores our claim that budgets are about priorities. This is a government that has made the wrong choices. 
The government says that we need a long-term strategy to deal with the ageing population. The Treasurer's solution, and we saw him out there last week, is to repeat the old ideas—forcing Australian families to pay more for education and health care, cutting disability benefits and making older people work till they drop. He will push these old ideas and he will call it reform. What he will not do is offer new ideas about how to provide for the future.
An important part of providing for the future must be to increase national savings. The government's approach to one element of national savings, the budget surplus, is to spend it—no assistance there. But another important mechanism for national savings is the system of superannuation—the system introduced in this country by a Labor government. 
The Treasurer has made some minor changes on superannuation in the past week. They are changes that are welcome as far as they go. But you are left asking yourself, `After more than eight years in government, is that all the government has to say?' We heard the Treasurer say after a budget four years ago that his next big challenge was superannuation. The Intergenerational Report was released two years ago, and all he did was re-release it the other day. As many commentators have said, there is a huge gap between the scale of the challenge and the Treasurer's policy response. Ross Gittens summed it up best of all when he said:
If what Peter Costello announced yesterday is the answer, it must have been a pretty small question.
Given the hype, Australian superannuation fund members will be disappointed by the lack of tax relief in the government's package. The Treasurer's announcements are worth $5 million per annum, but they have to be seen in the context of the government's $5 billion annual tax take from superannuation. The government have also failed to respond to Labor's plans to make superannuation simpler and safer. They have done nothing to address the crippling fees and charges that are eating away at the retirement incomes of Australian families. 
Labor has shown how, with the right priorities, you can do more on superannuation. When the government announced a superannuation tax cut that benefited just four per cent of income earners, Labor proposed an alternative that would have delivered a superannuation contribution tax cut to everyone in the work force—a tax cut from 15 per cent to 13 per cent. The government chose to look after only the very top income earners. Labor's choice is to distribute that fairly, back to the whole of the work force. Under our alternative, adequacy could have been improved for the many, not just a few. But the government rejected Labor's approach and spent the money on the top four per cent of income earners.
The Treasurer's statement highlighted some important issues confronting us in terms of the ageing population. These issues are well known to Labor; we have been highlighting them for seven years now. The Secretary of the Treasury, Dr Ken Henry, says that the three most significant economic issues facing the nation are population, productivity and participation. Yet we still have a Treasurer who refuses to invest in the drivers of productivity and growth: infrastructure, education and research. There is a famous saying of the Treasurer's: `demography is destiny'. If that is the case, why don't we have a population policy, Treasurer. It is a slogan; it is not a solution—and it typifies this government's approach. Also, for some inexplicable reason, the Treasurer refutes the evidence of demographers when they say that family friendly policies can improve both incentives and fertility rates.
With his newfound concern for mature age Australians, the Treasurer forgets that his budgets made the largest cuts to support for mature age job seekers this country has ever seen and abolished incentives for employers to take on older, long-term unemployed job seekers. The Treasurer has also imposed on older job seekers an impersonal privatised system of job seeker support—a system now in a shambles. And of course who could forget the Treasurer's last big idea—that mature age Australians should just get out there and mow our lawns?
It takes more than just an update of the Intergenerational Report or a slogan about demography to address the policy challenges that we face. The solution lies in an agenda to lift the growth potential of the economy by investing in the drivers of economic growth, to lift participation by rewarding effort and removing disincentives to hard work, and to address the incentives to provide dignity in retirement. This Treasurer is trying to convince people that he has an agenda for Australia's future. Over this year we will see a debate about the future economic and fiscal direction of our nation. From the government we will hear the same tired old ideas, but from Labor you will hear about new solutions—solutions that will produce a better future for the people of Australia and solutions that are consistent with the Australian ethos of opportunity for all. The next election will be about a challenge: our ideas versus the government's staleness. I look forward to that challenge and to meeting it and putting forward, through the new leadership of the Labor Party, the very ideas that will advance the interests of all Australians, not just the privileged few.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2003-2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2004-03-01,"—I welcome the opportunity to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004, because the responsibility of government to balance the national budget—and the member for Hotham has this right—is pivotal to the quality of life for individuals and for the successful operation of the nation's businesses and, indeed, the government itself. It is the small business community that I often get up here and speak about that stands to lose in a major way if the federal budget is not adequately managed—as we saw during Labor's 13 years in government. We saw their knee-jerk reactions, unfettered spending in some areas and unseemly haste in bringing in certain economic reforms. All of this contributed to some disastrous years for small business in particular.
I noted the member for Hotham's comments about his view on wasted expenditure. But no-one can forget the tremendous waste under the Labor government—a government that allowed young people to leave school and leave the family home and go on social security. So many millions of dollars were squandered. But it was not the dollars squandered that was the big concern; it was the policy that encouraged young people to leave school, to leave education, to leave job training, to leave the family home and to go on social security benefits. No funding could have been squandered more and no policy could have done more harm than that particular policy of the then Labor government.
Going back to the small business issue, it is very easy to forget what the economy was like during Labor's 13-year period. It was marked by unacceptably high unemployment rates; troughs and peaks, making it impossible for businesses to plan with any certainty; high interest rates and burgeoning inflation. I recall with great clarity the pleas of farmers, small businesses, mums and dads whose kids could not get jobs and the mums and dads who could not get jobs during that time. They pleaded with the coalition to change things when they got into government—to even out the highs and lows; to ensure a reduction in unemployment; and to reduce the excessively high interest rates and high inflation rates that were rapidly eating up any gains they were making. They wanted a government that would manage the finances—and that is what they got. That is what the Howard government delivers. Rather than being tired, the Howard government continues to deliver and continues to come forward with fresh programs and policies which will make a very big difference to the lives of many people in our community.
Since coming to government in 1996, the Howard-led government has evened out the economic highs and lows, reduced interest rates, reduced inflation and, importantly, reduced unemployment rates to below six per cent. In an assessment at the end of October last year, the International Monetary Fund assessed the Australian economy as continuing to perform remarkably well over the year. This was despite a weak world economic environment, despite the worst drought we had seen in this country in a hundred years and despite the SARS epidemic, which hit the travel and tourism sectors very hard indeed.
Despite a small rise in interest rates last year, home loan rates are still below the average over the last six years. Based on an average new mortgage, families with home loans are currently paying $585 per month less than they did in 1996 under the Labor government. As the Prime Minister said, the Australian public will never forget the 17 per cent interest rates that we had under the Australian Labor Party. 
Under the economic management of the Howard government, for the first time in 21 years unemployment in non-metropolitan areas of Australia fell below six per cent. Those areas included my electorate, a large part of which is rural. Again, despite the worst drought in 100 years, unemployment in country areas fell below six per cent, almost 75 per cent of non-metropolitan Australia recorded a drop in unemployment, and across the country the number of people in work increased by 70,000. This does not happen with poor management; it happens with good economic management.
When Sensis released its business index for small and medium enterprises late last year, it revealed that perceptions of the Australian economy are at their highest level since the business index commenced. The index revealed that the confidence of small and medium businesses continued to increase, taking it to the highest level since August 1994. Again, these indicators do not come about because of poor targeting of money raised by the government through the tax system; they come about through sound economic management and the application of some sound principles. These figures were supported by an ACCI report that revealed that small businesses reported an improved outlook for sales, revenue, profitability, investment and job creation.
The steady management of the economy by the Howard government is particularly important to people living in the Pearce electorate, because they have been the beneficiaries of the savings that have been made by the poor targeting of spending under Labor. The rank and file out there in the community welcome measures to improve the safety of roads, such as the $1 million allocated to safety measures and a passing lane on the Clackline bridge in my electorate. It is a particularly nasty area. That will be met. Mums and dads benefited from the new home child-care places in Western Australia that the federal minister made available. Twenty-five new home places were made available to Narrogin, in my electorate, in the Upper Great Southern region of Western Australia. These are the kinds of measures that we have been able to put into place, because we have had sound economic management and we have been able to give back.
That is why the Howard government has also been able to take a practical, commonsense approach to protecting and repairing the environment. My electorate has been the beneficiary of some of the $2.7 billion that has been allocated to the National Heritage Trust—the largest and most successful environmental restoration project in Australia's history—since 1996. People in many electorates throughout Australia have benefited from that. In addition, we established the Green Corps project, which has given 5,500 young people the opportunity to receive training to participate in projects addressing significant environmental issues, giving them a lifelong appreciation of the importance of the environment and providing them with training and skills that they will have for a lifetime. The Green Corps program has been enormously important, as has the Green Reserve program, an initiative of the Commonwealth government under the Work for the Dole program. These are the kinds of areas that this government has been able to target, with programs that help local people. The government has also created programs in rural areas which give additional money to assist with the delivery of health services.
My electorate is the third-largest, in geographical terms, in Western Australia. It covers an area of 26,000 square kilometres or thereabouts. It has a diverse range of interests, from broadacre wheat and sheep farming to intensive agriculture, including fruit, wine, olives, milk products and fishing, just to name a few. There is a mix of rural areas and some very significant outer metropolitan urban cells—new areas which are growing very rapidly. For those areas, many of the programs that the government has been able to put into place, because of savings made in other areas, have been immensely important.
Infrastructure in an electorate like Pearce is absolutely essential. We have the crossroads of the major highway from the eastern states to Perth and we also have the north-west mining and pastoral region road to Perth. These two transport routes are vital to farming, industry and tourism, and to local people who rely on fast, efficient and safe transport to major centres, the wharf and the airport. The federal government has recognised the importance of these roads and has allocated funding to improve their efficiency and safety. As a result of a public rally, the minister for transport allocated $14 million recently to improve a dangerous section of the Great Northern Highway, the main road to the northern pastoral and mining areas. That is very welcome.
We have a long way to go, of course. We need some major works done and another $80 million or so spent on that road, which now carries some very large double and triple load trucks. The road was never designed to carry that kind of transport. At least the federal government is taking responsibility and allocating money. After receiving many representations from local government about the condition of local roads, which are a state government responsibility, the federal government has again agreed to continue the funding of the Roads to Recovery program. This was particularly welcome in the Pearce electorate because it responded to local representation about the woeful condition of local roads neglected by the state government.
In Western Australia, many local road projects have been shelved as the Gallop Labor government have poured all their money into the rail to Mandurah. Indian Ocean Drive is an important link from the coast to the major north-west highway, but they have shelved the project on that road—they have mothballed it—because all of the money is going on the rail to the south. I am not against rail; I think it is a very good plan, but I think it is premature, given the state of roads in the eastern and northern corridors. It is premature to put a rail down south when there is a perfectly good freeway, and buses that run quite often with few passengers on board, while our eastern and northern corridors and roads such as the Indian Ocean Drive get mothballed. Indian Ocean Drive was a particularly important road to the locals. It is important from an industry point of view but it is important also to continue the fast-growing tourism in the region. After discussion with our Ian Campbell, who is now Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, we are hopeful that we might be able to reignite state government interest in coming good with their earlier promise to construct this road.
There continue to be challenges in my electorate to ensure that major highways are safe and efficient, and I will certainly continue to work very closely with the community of Pearce to do my best at a federal level. What we need is a commitment by the state government to ensure that priority is given to work in the eastern region. Too often they come with the excuse that they need money from the federal government. The federal government hands them a bucket of money but quite often the state puts its priorities somewhere else. We need that commitment from the state Labor government.
In fact, the state Labor government has shown little interest in infrastructure in the eastern corridor—an area that produces much of the agricultural wealth of the state and, indeed, of the nation. Roads are but one of the casualties of state Labor's budget priorities. Power, particularly to the country, has also been neglected. Indeed, in the city we saw recent 40-degree heat and power failures. I must say that I was impressed that it so quickly made changes at the head of the power supplier, but the fact is the government has ignored the issue of power for too long. Recently I had calls from York in my electorate to say that a number of ageing power poles had been knocked over in a storm. They were propped up only by a tree, and there were sparks flying. This is in conditions where the grass and other growth is tinder dry, which puts the area at high risk of fire. We saw recent tragic deaths in the southern area of Western Australia from fire caused by faulty power lines or poles, and it is high time that the state government got its priorities right in its budgets and attended to these concerns in the rural areas of Western Australia.
Lack of adequate power inhibits the development of regional areas and thus hampers local efforts to continue to provide local jobs for people. The federal government has gone to a lot of trouble to establish area consultative committees to put money into the development of the regions, and then we find that they are hampered. If we take Avon Industrial Park, which we have tried to get up and running—the federal government has allocated money to try and assist that project on more than one occasion—we find that major industry, which wants to establish businesses there, is inhibited by the lack of an adequate power supply. The power supply in Western Australia's rural areas was designed probably in the fifties and little has been done to really address the matter of adequacy of power in these regions. It is hampering development.
One of the most important areas of federal funding for families is the education and training opportunities for their children and for school leavers going into the job market. I am very pleased that apprenticeships under the Howard government have more than doubled compared to the last year of Labor's incumbency, from 520 in 1995 to 1,070 in 2003. This is a very important issue for not only the apprenticeship system but also other training means and scholarships for professions, because we have a shortage in many skilled and professional areas. Spending on new apprenticeship incentives has continued to increase in Pearce, from $1.7 million to $2.246 million over a relatively short period of time. Given the continuing shortage of tradespeople, the need to continue to provide job opportunities to young people and ensure appropriate levels of skilled people becomes critical.
On the issue of schooling, the Australian Education Union has launched against the government a campaign which is deliberately misleading in its portrayal of school funding. It is important to clarify the facts around the important area of funding, which is one of great concern for parents. Schools are funded by both state and federal governments. Under the Australian Constitution, state and territory governments have primary responsibility for funding state schools. They own them, manage them and provide 88 per cent of their public funding. While the Australian government is the primary source of funding for Catholic and independent schools, it is also a significant contributor to state government schools. Australian government funding has risen by an estimated 60 per cent since 1996, when the Howard government came to office.
Overall, state schools continue to receive considerably more public funding than Catholic and independent schools. There are 2.25 million students in state schools receiving $19.9 billion in public funding and there are just over one million students in Catholic and independent schools receiving a total of $6.2 billion in public funding. In other words, state government schools enrol 68 per cent of students and receive 76 per cent of total public funding for schools while Catholic and independent schools enrol 32 per cent of students and receive 24 per cent of total public funding.
I think it is really important to keep the record on whose responsibility is whose. It is very easy—for our state government, anyway—to pass the buck in that respect, and I have worked very hard to get, for example, library facilities for a little state school in my electorate where the buildings have been there for 100 years. I must say again that it is because of this deficit in the eastern region by the state Labor government. It seems very difficult for them to find funds to put into schools in my region—although I am pleased to hear that the state minister, after much pushing and prodding, is now considering establishing, finally, some kind of specialist music school in the eastern region. We have two of them in the western suburbs and nothing in the eastern sector, where we have some very talented students.
The federal government also has the great responsibility of funding Medicare, and is doing so through the MedicarePlus package, worth $2.4 billion. This would not have been possible if the government were mismanaging the economy—if it did not manage the economy very carefully. It does have a big responsibility in these areas. I think the Howard government will stand on its record. The people out there know that there are many benefits in the proper economic management of the national budget.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2004-03-01,"—I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004. The purpose of my contribution this evening is to discuss a number of issues relating to Indigenous policy in Australia. I want to concentrate my remarks on one community and, using that community as an example, demonstrate the fatuous nature of remarks which have been made recently by a number of people, not the least of whom is Keith Windschuttle, who had an opinion piece in today's Australian, headed `Assimilation already a reality'.
The community that I want to refer to is an Aboriginal town, Wadeye, which lies about 420 kilometres south-west of Darwin. I refer to this place for a particular reason: it is the largest Indigenous community in the Northern Territory. It is an interesting place for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that it is the site of a COAG trial, one of the community coordination pilots. This trial is a partnership between the Thamarrurr Regional Council, which is the local governing body of Wadeye; the Northern Territory government; and the federal government. 
As part of that trial, work was done to establish some baseline information on the community. The report, by John Taylor, was released only last week and is entitled Baseline profiles for social and economic development planning in the Thamarrurr region—a report to the Thamarrurr Regional Council and the Northern Territory Office of Indigenous Policy, Wadeye and Darwin, December 2003. John works for the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research at the Australian National University. The reason I mention this document is that it will now go forward, as part of this COAG process, to be deliberated upon by the territory and federal governments, as well as the Thumarrurr Regional Council. The information it contains is quite significant in the context of towns in the bush because it is symptomatic of what is happening across northern Australia, and certainly in the Northern Territory, to Aboriginal communities.
According to this document, Wadeye has a total service population of 2,373, of which 45.7 per cent are under the age of 15. Significantly—and this is an issue I will not have the opportunity to discuss in a great deal of detail this evening—women predominate at ages above 29. It does not take too long to conclude that this is because of a number of factors, not the least of which is the mortality rate for Aboriginal men. What is significant about this population is that John Taylor's work projects that it will increase by 88 per cent in 20 years, by 2023, to a population of 4,045. If that were its population now, on current figures that would make it probably the third, fourth or maybe the fifth largest town in the Northern Territory.
This is significant because it means the population is growing at the rate of four per cent per annum. You would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, as a keen student of this sort of data, that that is more than twice—almost three times—the annual population growth rate of Australia generally. What we are seeing here is a population boom, and that creates a number of interesting dilemmas for those who provide services to that population. It also goes to the need to develop an argument for far greater government outlays for the purposes of providing infrastructure and services to these communities. I will come in a moment to one startling statistic showing the immediate need for housing in this particular community.
But before I do I want to go to this article by Windschuttle. The House would know that Dr Windschuttle made a contribution to a conference in Perth last week in which he said `remote Aboriginal communities are a failure', that they should be closed and that Aborigines should be moved to cities and towns. I am not sure what he regards as remote or whether he would regard Wadeye as a town. What I am certain of is that he has absolutely no comprehension of these issues as they relate to Northern Australia, or any real appreciation of the history that surrounds these communities in Northern Australia and particularly—in this case—in the Northern Territory. I would suggest to him—just so he gets his head around a few things—that he go to source material which has been made available to respective Aboriginal land commissioners in the form of claim books. These claim books document local and regional histories in relation to Northern Australia. They tell us the very sorry state of public policy over the decades of the last century—particularly, I might say, the decades when assimilation and integration were the hallmarks of government policy.
I noticed last week that he was seeking to protect the good name of the Chief Protector of Aborigines in the 1930s in Western Australia, A.O. Neville. I suggest, judging by what he has written and what we have seen in the press today from Dr Windschuttle, that he would have been at home in the 1930s, because clearly he has yet to come to terms with the fact that Indigenous Australians have the capacity to make decisions on their own for their own communities. Whilst it is true that for many of these communities there are real difficulties in terms of substance abuse, if we look at the data we will see that levels of alcohol consumption among Indigenous Australians, certainly in the Northern Territory, are lower than levels of alcohol consumption among non-Indigenous Australians. But it is true that in some communities there is very demonstrable evidence of social dysfunction.
But what Windschuttle tries to tell us is that this is all because of the policies of self-determination. He says as much in this document today—this opinion piece in the Australian. He talks about the need for paradigm shifts. Well I have got news for him. I have been working in this region now for a quarter of a century. I have spent a lot of time talking to Aboriginal people in their home communities. He might tell us, as he has done in this newspaper article, that these Aboriginal people should be dealt with differently than they are at the moment—he refers to Hasluck in the sixties—and say that we should not be providing special resources for Indigenous people to live in their home communities but, frankly, I think that is a bit pass. It is about time he understood that we live in a new century—one in which Indigenous Australians have rights and one in which we have responsibilities in terms of affording those rights some special recognition.
One of the rights they have is to be afforded some measure of justice. Whether or not Keith Windschuttle agrees is irrelevant, frankly, but I imagine, Mr Deputy Speaker, that he would be one of those who would say that the stolen generation was a figment of my and your imagination; that those people in the Northern Territory who, as a result of government policy, were taken away from their families were being done a good service by the community and that the issue of an apology should be something that we should forget about. I have to say that is not the view that I hold. Certainly it is not the view of Aboriginal people in my electorate.
Windschuttle makes the point in this article today that 70 per cent of Aboriginal people now live in the cities and larger country towns. Let me tell him that in the case of the Northern Territory 72 per cent of the Indigenous population live on Aboriginal land in their home communities. They live in communities like Wadeye; communities that are growing and vibrant; communities that have, however, been neglected by successive governments of both political persuasions over the decades to the point—and this is the value of this work that has been done in recent weeks—where there is a housing shortfall. The average house occupancy in Wadeye is around 17—that is a three bedroom house. In some houses, it is as high as 20; in others I know of it is certainly higher. Can anyone imagine 17 people living in a small housing commission three bedroom house? Where do these people live? Where do they have their beds? In the corridors? Outside the lavatory? Behind the kitchen benches? Those critics—Windschuttle and others—would say, `That's their choice.' The fact of the matter is that if governments were to provide resources so that housing in these communities was sufficient to allocate, say, seven residents to every three bedroom house, they would need to provide for the current shortfall of 207 extra homes. By 2023, if it is not addressed now, that figure will be 465 extra homes.
There are many problems in many of these communities, but I stress that it is not the communities' fault that the resources have not been provided for infrastructure such as housing. Despite whatever Windschuttle might like to think, if these 2,373 people were to migrate immediately to Darwin, where would they live? Who would provide the resources and the public housing? Of course, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, you and I both know. The issue here is that we have a vibrant community which is growing, unlike many rural communities in other parts of Australia, and this is true of other Aboriginal communities in my electorate. We also know that in this community, like others, there have been dreadfully poor educational outcomes. What have these been the result of? You could look at housing for a start. Nutrition is an issue, school attendance is an issue and the availability of school is an issue. 
The fact is that, like many other communities in the Northern Territory, this community has been neglected in terms of the provision of this sort of infrastructure. There is no high school to speak of at Wadeye, and the school attendance rates are abysmal. According to John Taylor's report, only a third of secondary school-aged children are enrolled, only 18 per cent are attending school, and only 13 per cent of 12-year-olds are attending school. I would ask you to think about that, because 16 per cent have never attended school. Think about it. Then think about the abuse that is heaped on these communities by people like Windschuttle and others, who think they know what is good for the world, and think about the blame that is foisted upon these communities because people cannot get mainstream employment opportunities because they cannot achieve at university. These educational attainment levels are an issue to do with the way in which the community sees education. But, contrary to what Windschuttle might like to think and contrary to what he expresses in his article, they are primarily related to the willingness of successive governments to provide the resources to make sure that these educational services can be properly provided.
It is true that, at Wadeye, Maningrida, Galiwinku, Yuendumu and many other places across my electorate, successive governments—and I might say successive conservative governments; 27 years of CLP governments—since self-government in 1978 have absolutely neglected these communities. Now we are left with a problem. Instead of providing essential infrastructure, as they should have done, they deliberately chose not to. Now we have the likes of Windschuttle saying that, because these communities have problems, the whole issue of self-determination has been a failure. I have a rough appreciation of what `self-determination' means, and it is worth recalling that a committee of this House gave us a working definition of `self-determination' in a unanimous report titled A chance for the future, which was published in 1989. It described `self-determination' as `Aboriginal people having the authority, resources and capacity to control the future of their own communities within the legal structure common to all Australians'. I think that is a reasonable proposition.
I can tell you that Aboriginal people in my electorate and those in communities such as Wadeye and Thamarrurr are an expression of self-determination—the ability to make their own decisions—because they have redefined what their local government structure should look like so that it reflects traditional decision-making practices. There is a unique opportunity here, and it has happened because this community took control of itself and took control of these questions. Now it is working within its COAG framework to try to find solutions to some of these problems. 
The resolution of these problems is not helped by the idiocy of people like Windschuttle and the bigotry that they reflect in what they assert. What we have to do is work with communities. We have to work with Aboriginal leaders across Australia to overcome these problems—and there are problems—but we are not going to do it by kicking people in the guts. We are not going to resolve these problems by smacking people around the ears. We are going to resolve these problems by recognising that Indigenous Australians have rights. Then we need to sit down and talk to them as equals and work out the parameters under which they can be funded, by negotiating and working out outcomes which are commonly accepted. We should not, as Windschuttle would have it, close these communities down and relocate their populations to major urban centres.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2003-2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2004-03-01,"—I would like to speak tonight about an event that I attended yesterday afternoon. It was organised in Redfern, on the Block in the Holden Street Community Centre, by the Darlington Branch of the ALP. In particular, I would like to thank Trevor Davies, who did the bulk of the organising, and a number of the residents of the Block who have been there many years—especially Aunty Joyce but also Uncle Dick, Lyal Munro and a number of others who came to that meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to keep dialogue open between ALP representatives at various levels of government and the Aboriginal community in Redfern. 
The House would be aware that slightly over two weeks ago there was a very tragic death of a young man in Redfern—Thomas Hickey, or T.J. Hickey, as he was known. The death of any young person is a terrible tragedy, and there are many people in Redfern who are still very much affected and will be mourning for a long time. If there is anything positive to come of this young man's death, perhaps it is that there is a renewed focus at the moment on the terrible disadvantage suffered by many Aboriginal people in this country, as the member for Lingiari was just explaining, and by many residents of Redfern in particular.
Redfern is an area where there has been a long history of disadvantage, not only but most particularly in the Indigenous community. As a community, it suffers the scars of dispossession and racism. The picture is not completely grim though. The meeting that we had on Sunday was a very positive meeting, and it was in part an opportunity to hear from many of the people who are involved in community efforts in Redfern for individuals to improve their own lives and the situations of their families and for their community to be a stronger, better community.
There was a young man at the meeting, who was also called T.J., who had been employed by the Premier's Department to work specifically with kids on the Block. The sort of work he has been doing—and he is going to stop doing it shortly, unfortunately, because he has resigned—made the most enormous difference to the lives of young people. He made sure that kids got to school and that they had a positive environment to do their homework in. These sorts of things are absolutely vital.
What gets covered in newspapers is not the positive efforts that people like T.J. are making but kids throwing rocks. While there is never any excuse for that sort of violence, it saddens me that the amount of media attention that is given to kids throwing rocks is so many times greater than the attention given to the much bigger, sadder story of over 200 years of racism and dispossession in this country. We live in a modern country where Aboriginal life expectancy is still 20 years less than the national average and imprisonment rates are 15 times higher than the national average. I think that is a disgrace in a modern nation like Australia.
We need to see construction start straightaway on Aboriginal housing on the Block. The state government has committed many millions of dollars to this. It will certainly cost over $20 million. So far the Commonwealth government has refused even to discuss this with the state government and the Aboriginal housing corporation. We need to make sure that the people building that housing employ Aboriginal apprentices, Aboriginal builders and Aboriginal architects.
There is so much that is being done currently by people of goodwill, but there is so much more than can be done in the area. I think that our whole community has to be engaged in this battle against poverty, racism, disadvantage, unemployment and abusive drug pushers. It heartens me that there are so many local people who are fighting this fight. I am heartened also by the support I see in the wider community for tackling the disadvantage faced by the Aboriginal residents of Redfern.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Sydney Electorate: Redfern</title>,Adjournment,12,1
