 (09:31):  The committee is considering the amendment on sheet 8491 moved by Senator McKim. The question is that the amendment be agreed to.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Treasury and Finance) (09:32):  I won't respond too much to Senator McKim's contribution except to make the comment in passing that, according to Senator McKim, it was all an accident that the economy crashed in Tasmania under a Labor-Greens government and it was all to do with exchange rates rather than the disastrous antibusiness policies of the Labor Party and the Greens. That contribution was an interesting one. I don't think that many would find it particularly persuasive.


The government won't be supporting the Greens amendment. The government announced in the 2018-19 budget that it will extend the $20,000 instant asset write-off by a further 12 months, to 30 June 2019, for businesses with annual turnover of less than $10 million. This will improve cash flow for small businesses, providing a boost to their activity and investment for a further year. The Greens amendment would increase the threshold to $30,000 for assets relating to energy efficiency or clean energy, on an ongoing basis. The government's $20,000 instant asset write-off is widely supported by stakeholders and applies to all small businesses with an annual turnover less than $10 million. In extending the $20,000 threshold for a further year, the government has sought to strike a balance between helping small businesses' cash flow and investment and the revenue impact on the budget. We therefore don't support the amendment.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (09:33):  It is no surprise that neither the Labor Party nor the LNP will be supporting this amendment, because we know that they are fully owned—lock, stock and smoking barrel—by the fossil fuel industry in this country. They both receive massive donations from fossil fuel companies. This amendment would encourage and incentivise small businesses to invest into infrastructure and assets that would result in an energy-efficiency dividend for small businesses, which would bring Australia's emissions profile down as well as improve the bottom line of small businesses. It would also encourage and incentivise small businesses to reduce their use of fossil fuels and to fuel-switch from gas to electricity. So it's no surprise at all that what we're getting from those political parties that accept large corporate donations is, once again, backing in of the fossil fuel sector and voting against an amendment that would ultimately deliver a more energy-efficient country, a more energy-efficient small business sector, and a country and a small business sector that would actually reduce their greenhouse emissions. Senator Seselja's been rewriting history once again in here this morning in regard to what happened in Tasmania. I had to put him over my knee last night when he tried to do that, and I'm going to do the same thing to him again this morning. I didn't hear everything he said, because I've just come from a meeting of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, but my friend and colleague Senator Whish-Wilson informs me that Senator Seselja's been at it again. Despite being schooled last night, he's going to have to be schooled again this morning.


Firstly, I want to make it clear that, in fact, the period of government between 2010 and 2014 in Tasmania was government for grown-ups. It was a government that Liberal leader and current Tasmanian Premier, the Hon. Will Hodgman, could have actually participated in, if he'd had a bit of spine, backbone and courage. Of course, on election night in Tasmania in 2010, Mr Hodgman got up and made a victory speech, and a fine victory speech it was, too. There was only one problem with it. Ten seats out of 25 doesn't give you a majority. In fact, he hadn't won; he'd lost. We all remember that speech, and Senator Bushby, I'm sure, remembers that speech as well. He might even have been there. I don't know. I was there when Mr Hodgman gave that speech, and I was having a good old giggle at it because I knew that 10 out of 25 does not equal 50 per cent. I knew that, but Mr Hodgman didn't know that, and he thought he could walk into government with 10 seats in a 25-seat lower house in Tasmania. History proved me right and proved him abjectly wrong and exposed his lack of understanding of basic mathematics.


What did happen, ultimately, is the Greens and Labor got together and engaged in a government for grown-ups. What that government for grown-ups did was massively put the budget back on track. It engaged in taking on the forestry issue in Tasmania, something that successive majority governments had consigned to the too-hard basket for decades. And do you know what? We actually landed that issue—something that had split our community apart and resulted in violence in our community and resulted in arrests, including my arrest back in the 1980s for protesting at Farmhouse Creek. Other people were arrested there and in other places. We were arrested defending our magnificent, globally unique forests, defending the carbon in those forests to ensure that it wasn't emitted and would contribute to the disruption of the climate that we are seeing today, and defending those forests on behalf of the people who actually own them, which is the Australian and Tasmanian people, not the governments of the day. Governments of the day are only ever temporary trustees of any public asset. We did it to stop the transfer of wealth from public to private, because, of course, for many decades in Tasmania, the more trees you chopped down, the more money you lost. That still applies today, with a massively subsidised and, in fact, mendicant forest industry in Tasmania.


In landing the Tasmanian forest agreement, in getting it through parliament—albeit in an imperfect way, because the upper house took the chainsaw to it when they had the opportunity—what that government did was deliver hundreds of millions in investment into Tasmania, thanks to the federal government. That's hundreds of millions of dollars of investment that the Liberal Party is now running around trying to claim credit for. That's hundreds of millions of dollars that set Tasmania up for the future, with investment into tourism, investment into everything from cut flowers to berry production, and investment into transitioning the Tasmanian economy out of an overreliance on the old 'dig it up, chop it down' mentality that the Liberal Party love so much and into an economy that could thrive and prosper in the 21st century. When you look at Tasmania now, you see—and it's generally accepted—that our economy is moving forward in a more beneficial way not only for Tasmania but also compared to the rest of the country. And what's the major reason that is happening? It's that shot in the arm that was given to small businesses, tourism operators and primary producers in Tasmania, thanks to the hundreds of millions of dollars that flowed in through the Tasmanian Forest Agreement that the Liberal Party opposed. Senator Seselja has again displayed his extreme level of ignorance with regard to anything Tasmanian. I would have thought that Senator Bushby might have known a bit better, but clearly not. He should have advised his colleague Senator Seselja about the facts of the matter. I place on the record that I'm proud of the role the Greens played in that government. We delivered stable government. We addressed the primary challenges facing the state at the time.



The CHAIR:  Senator McKim, I draw your attention to the amendment. You started off talking about the amendment. You have come close, and I appreciate that it's a wide-ranging debate, but perhaps you could focus more on the amendment before the Senate.




Senator McKIM:
  I am, I believe, speaking in the main about small business, and, obviously, this amendment is with regard to providing more incentives for small business to become more sustainable. But just to complete the thought that I was engaged in: that period of government was government for grown-ups. It was a government that the Tasmanian people voted for comprehensively at the 2010 election, it was a government that took on all of the hard issues that had been left in the too-hard basket by majority governments of both political stripes in the past, and it was a government that, as I said, could have involved the Liberal Party, had Mr Hodgman had the backbone and courage to take it on. But instead, he had to sit there for four years on the opposition benches and impotently gnash his teeth every time the Labor-Greens government conducted itself in a way with which he disagreed. All of this was within the context of very difficult economic times for the whole country and particularly for Tasmania, the most export-exposed economy in the country, with a very high exchange rate between the US dollar and the Australian dollar.


It is very disappointing that neither the Labor Party nor the Liberal Party are prepared to support this amendment, but, as I said earlier, it is not surprising at all, because this is an amendment that is beneficial to small business, and we know that the Liberal and Labor parties are the parties of the big corporates, big business and the top end of town. The small business community, I might add, support the Greens' move for this scheme with a higher expenditure limit for renewable assets. That's important to place on the record, and has been placed on the record by Mr Peter Strong from COSBOA. As I said, it's disappointing but not surprising that the major parties in this place—who accept those tens of millions every year in corporate donations—are not prepared to support an amendment that would not only help small business but also help bring Australia's emissions profile down.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2018-09-12,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (09:43):  I rise to urge the Senate to support Senator McKim's amendment, and make the point very clearly that the Greens have been the leaders on small business policy in this place over the last six years. You may not want to acknowledge that, Minister—through you, Chair. We brought the most comprehensive small business policy package to the 2013 election. That included a cut for real small businesses with a turnover of under $2 million, which make up the big bulk of my state of Tasmania's economy, that needed a leg-up. We worked with the small business community and COSBOA on accelerated depreciation and another 11 policies, and we took that package to the 2013 election. After the 2013 election, Senator McKim, my colleagues in this place, and I were all proud to vote for a tax cut for small business, and for accelerated depreciation for small business. There's a really important history here, Senator Seselja—through you, Chair. You should be taking this amendment seriously.


While we're talking about how the Greens delivered for Tasmania, it's seldom acknowledged that the price on carbon, which is the international gold standard for action on climate—and Senator Bushby would know this—delivered billions of dollars in windfall to Hydro Tasmania, who then paid a dividend to the Tasmanian government which funded schools, hospitals, policing and national parks. In fact, the Greens pretty much provided a lifeline to Tasmania's Treasury through a price on carbon. That has never been acknowledged in any public comment by the Liberal Party, who came in here and recklessly ripped up action on climate and billions of dollars of revenue to the Tasmanian government and to the Tasmanian people. That has never been acknowledged. Had that price on carbon gone into its final phase, after three years of being a carbon trading scheme, which is what it was set up to do, we would have had an official price on carbon. And we were that close to getting offsets for Tasmania's forests that would have been in the billions. The forests that Senator McKim, in his time in government, saved for the Tasmanian people, were eligible for offsets under the additivity principle, and there were advanced negotiations for the Greens to deliver billions of dollars to the Tasmanian economy. That was ripped up by the Liberal Party, with their cavalier attitude towards climate and the Tasmanian economy. 


So, Senator Seselja, if you want to talk about economy-wrecking policies of the Greens, you should have a look at yourself and what you've done to my state of Tasmania. The hundreds of millions of dollars that we delivered through the diversification funds in the Tasmanian Forest Agreement—which I'm proud to say my colleague Nick McKim played a role in delivering—have gone towards setting up mountain bike paths that are now leading the charge in the diversification of the Tasmanian economy. That is another win for the Greens, and for the Tasmanian people. In fact, I could go on and on all day about our 20-year vision for the Tasmanian economy that's come to pass. 


In 1992, previous senator Christine Milne and the Green Independents put together a policy for Tasmania. This did include a policy for small business, because they knew back then that small business was the backbone of the Tasmanian economy. They knew that the big businesses that were tied to global commodity cycles would, unfortunately, likely fail in a changing world of globalisation. They predicted the demise of price-taking industries that had no control over their future, and they were right. They said governments should be investing in small business, incentivising small business, and focusing on the competitive strengths of Tasmania—what we have that is unique, that the rest of the world wants and will come and see and will pay good money to see. And we were right. 


The only thing that's held Tasmania back for decades—it's benefiting from this now—is the Liberal Party and the Labor Party and their anti-Greens rhetoric and the action they have taken to do everything they possibly can to put us out of business. But I say to Senator Seselja that we were right about small business and the importance of small business in Tasmania. 


Senator Bushby, I urge you to support this amendment of Senator McKim's, because you know how important small business is to Tasmania. You have small business interests in your family. You know both my wife and I have run small businesses in Tasmania, and we're just like the tens of thousands of Tasmanians that have small businesses. They work really hard; they employ the majority of Tasmanians. This is exactly the kind of amendment that you should support, to support Tasmanians.

"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2018-09-12,"



Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Chief Government Whip in the Senate) (09:48):  A few points that were made by the previous two contributors to this debate need some comment. Senator Whish-Wilson was just talking about the so-called windfall to the hydro-electric corporation in Tasmania as a result of the so-called carbon tax that was introduced by the previous Labor government. There is no doubt that they did have an opportunity to make extra money at that time. But that money didn't come from nowhere; that money was coming because they were able to charge higher energy prices to Tasmanians—to Tasmanian households and to Tasmanian businesses—because, as part of the National Electricity Market, the carbon tax had increased the national price of energy and therefore they were able to charge more for their energy. That meant that Tasmanian households and Tasmanian businesses were paying higher energy costs and that Hydro, because it's renewable and was not having to contribute the same degree of cost through the carbon tax, was making a windfall. But make no mistake: that windfall was coming at the expense of Tasmanians and Tasmanian businesses—Tasmanian small businesses, which Senator Whish-Wilson is saying this amendment will assist. I think there was also a mention of mountain bike paths as one of the magnificent things that were delivered by the previous Tasmanian state Labor-Green government. Most of the mountain bike paths that exist in Tasmania—that have been built—have been funded in large part by the federal Liberal government since 2013. 


The fact is that, by most economic metrics, prior to March 2014 Tasmania was languishing at the bottom of the pack relative to other states. We were seen as the poor cousin right across the nation, no matter which metric you looked at. That turned around after March 2014. There was an immediate improvement in business confidence just because of the election of the majority Hodgman Liberal government. There was an immediate improvement in confidence that resulted in an immediate increase in business and other investment, which led to Tasmania now being around the middle or higher in those same economic metrics. 


So let's not pretend and try to rewrite history that the Labor-Green state government was somehow a miraculous government that just happened to miss out on all the good things showing up because it lost the March 2014 election but all the good things that they did came out afterwards. The reality is that it was the election of the majority Hodgman Liberal government that provided confidence for businesses in Tasmania to make the investments.



The CHAIR:  Senator Bushby, I appreciate the passion of the Tasmanians in the chamber this morning, but, in the same way that I cautioned Senator McKim, I have been listening very closely to your contribution, and we are discussing the amendment that's been proposed. 




Senator BUSHBY:
  I did mention small business, which is what the amendment is about.



The CHAIR:  You mentioned small business once. Could you focus particularly on the amendment before the chamber.




Senator BUSHBY:
  I think I've sufficiently corrected the record to make sure that Hansard adequately doesn't record unchallenged those incorrect assertions that were made by previous speakers.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2018-09-12,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (09:51):  If anyone wants to talk about incorrect assertions maybe we should look at what Senator Bushby has just said. You elect a Liberal government in Tasmania and, whoosh, everything changes—magic takes place. It doesn't work like that. Economics doesn't work like that. 



Senator Bushby interjecting—




Senator CAMERON:
  I know you've got an economics degree, but I've never seen it really deliver much in this place. You haven't really filled me full of faith that you've got any understanding of economics if you think an election suddenly and immediately makes changes.


I want to come back to the issue. I don't know what it is with the Greens this morning, and I don't know what it is with the Liberal Party, but maybe it's because you are both doing so badly in Tasmania. Maybe that's the problem. Maybe you've just got to get up here and not worry about the depreciation bill that we're talking about for small business. I simply say: let's get this bill up and help small business and stop the nonsense and squabbling that's going on here between the senators from Tasmania—the Greens, who will never be in government, and the Liberal Party, who are just about to lose government.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Treasury Laws Amendment (Accelerated Depreciation for Small Business Entities) Bill 2018</title>,BILLS,2,1
"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2018-09-12,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (09:53):  I won't hold the chamber up much more, because as Senator Cameron rightly points out this is an important piece of legislation, and, in fact, is going to be passed with the LNP voting for it, the Labor Party voting for it and the Greens voting for it. The problem that we face is that neither the LNP nor Labor are going to vote for the amendment that's currently before the Senate. Remember, this amendment would incentivise small business to invest in energy efficiency and to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. That position is not surprising, given the massive donations that both the LNP and the ALP get from the fossil fuel sector—tens of millions of dollars a year straight into their parties' coffers so they can run campaigns to get re-elected. Of course, those donations buy the fossil fuel industry policy outcomes, and we're seeing that play out on the floor of the Senate this morning.


I just want to be clear on this amendment: Senator Bushby and every other Liberal and National senator from Tasmania are voting against an amendment that would encourage small businesses, through an instant asset write-off threshold increase, to invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency, which would help those small businesses bring their bottom lines into a more favourable state, because it would bring their energy costs down. Every single LNP and Liberal senator is about to vote against that and vote against small business in Tasmania. The same applies for every single ALP senator from Tasmania. They're about to vote against every small business in Tasmania being able to receive a more favourable tax treatment for assets they invest in, up to a threshold of $30,000, which would allow them to invest in energy efficiency, to reduce their use of fossil fuels and to fuel switch from gas to electricity.


Climate disruption, the disruption of our climate that we're seeing today, is by a long way the pre-eminent public policy challenge facing humanity. As part of that, all senators ought consider it the pre-eminent public policy challenge facing Australia and facing this parliament. We're in a situation where the new Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, is washing his hands of responsibility to act on the disruption of our climate; to bring Australia's emissions profile down; to show global leadership and show other countries that as a rich, developed nation we can step up and fulfil our moral obligations to the rest of the world.


I'm glad Minister Payne is in here to hear it. At the Pacific Islands Forum, Minister Payne managed to give a speech which didn't mention climate change. How absurd is that? Last week she went over to Nauru and gave a speech that didn't mention climate change to a Pacific Islands Forum.




Senator Payne:
  You'd be completely wrong, Nick.




Senator McKIM:
  If that's the case, I'm happy for you to correct the record. If you believe that I am wrong, I'll have a look at your speech.




Senator Payne:
  What speech did I give to the Pacific Islands Forum?




Senator McKIM:
  I have seen reports—



Senator Payne interjecting—




Senator McKIM:
  No, you can get up in a minute, Minister. You don't get the chance to talk over me when I'm on my feet and you're not.



The CHAIR:  Senator McKim, please resume your seat.




Senator McKIM:
  I have seen—



Senator Payne interjecting—



The CHAIR:  Order! Senator McKim has the right to be heard in silence. Senator McKim, please direct your remarks to the chair.




Senator McKIM:
  Thank you, Chair. I've seen reports that one of Minister Payne's speeches to that forum did not mention climate change. Pacific island nations have shown global leadership on this issue, because some of them are going to disappear this century, Minister. It's not good enough for you and your government not to take the issue of emissions reduction seriously. Australia should be a global leader in showing the way forward on this issue. It is a disgrace that we have a Prime Minister who basically said this week that Australians are not interested in climate change. He's wrong. The polls show he's wrong. It's part of the reason why he's going to be ignominiously turfed out of government next year, along with Minister Payne and all his colleagues. He is misreading the mood of the nation.


Australians want strong action on climate change. They want far stronger action than even the Australian Labor Party are proposing on climate change. In fact, it is the Greens who are proposing setting a pollution standard for power stations and progressively shutting them, starting with the worst first. It is only the Greens in this place who oppose the Adani coalmine. The Queensland Labor government wanted to give free coal, free water and free money to one of the most corrupt corporations in the world, the Adani Group. That's exactly what they were doing. The Liberal National Party—



The CHAIR:  Senator McKim—




Senator McKIM:
  Oh, we've hit a nerve here now, haven't we!



The CHAIR:  please resume your seat. Senator Cameron on a point of order?




Senator Cameron:
  A point of order: we are dealing with an amendment to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Accelerated Depreciation for Small Business Entities) Bill 2018. It's not for me to argue that everyone should be on point every time in here but, come on, can we get this bill done. Senator McKim, basically what you should do is go back to Tasmania and see if you can get more votes. Stop trying to get them here.



The CHAIR:  On the point of order, Senator Cameron is quite correct. Senator McKim, you were absolutely focused on the amendment. You'd started to drift away. I was waiting for you to come back to the point before I drew your attention to the amendment.




Senator McKIM:
  Thank you, Chair. I appreciate your drawing the amendment to my attention. In continuing my contribution, I would draw the committee's attention to the fact that our amendment is actually all about reducing emissions, at least in part, as well as helping the bottom line of small business. Senator Cameron wrote the book on digressing from the topic at hand in this Senate, in my experience, so I'm very happy to take his counsel on that!


It is extremely disappointing that we're not going to get support for this amendment, because ultimately it would show leadership on climate action and it would help small businesses drive an investment into their operations which ultimately would help them bring their emissions profiles down and improve their bottom line. It would give the opportunity for every small business in this country to thrive and prosper to a greater degree than will be the case when this amendment fails.

He should have advised his colleague Senator Seselja about the facts of the matter. I place on the record that I'm proud of the role the Greens played in that government. We delivered stable government. We addressed the primary challenges facing the state at the time.



The CHAIR:  Senator McKim, I draw your attention to the amendment. You started off talking about the amendment. You have come close, and I appreciate that it's a wide-ranging debate, but perhaps you could focus more on the amendment before the Senate.




Senator McKIM:
  I am, I believe, speaking in the main about small business, and, obviously, this amendment is with regard to providing more incentives for small business to become more sustainable. But just to complete the thought that I was engaged in: that period of government was government for grown-ups. It was a government that the Tasmanian people voted for comprehensively at the 2010 election, it was a government that took on all of the hard issues that had been left in the too-hard basket by majority governments of both political stripes in the past, and it was a government that, as I said, could have involved the Liberal Party, had Mr Hodgman had the backbone and courage to take it on. But instead, he had to sit there for four years on the opposition benches and impotently gnash his teeth every time the Labor-Greens government conducted itself in a way with which he disagreed. All of this was within the context of very difficult economic times for the whole country and particularly for Tasmania, the most export-exposed economy in the country, with a very high exchange rate between the US dollar and the Australian dollar.


It is very disappointing that neither the Labor Party nor the Liberal Party are prepared to support this amendment, but, as I said earlier, it is not surprising at all, because this is an amendment that is beneficial to small business, and we know that the Liberal and Labor parties are the parties of the big corporates, big business and the top end of town. The small business community, I might add, support the Greens' move for this scheme with a higher expenditure limit for renewable assets. That's important to place on the record, and has been placed on the record by Mr Peter Strong from COSBOA. As I said, it's disappointing but not surprising that the major parties in this place—who accept those tens of millions every year in corporate donations—are not prepared to support an amendment that would not only help small business but also help bring Australia's emissions profile down.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2018-09-12,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (09:43):  I rise to urge the Senate to support Senator McKim's amendment, and make the point very clearly that the Greens have been the leaders on small business policy in this place over the last six years. You may not want to acknowledge that, Minister—through you, Chair. We brought the most comprehensive small business policy package to the 2013 election. That included a cut for real small businesses with a turnover of under $2 million, which make up the big bulk of my state of Tasmania's economy, that needed a leg-up. We worked with the small business community and COSBOA on accelerated depreciation and another 11 policies, and we took that package to the 2013 election. After the 2013 election, Senator McKim, my colleagues in this place, and I were all proud to vote for a tax cut for small business, and for accelerated depreciation for small business. There's a really important history here, Senator Seselja—through you, Chair. You should be taking this amendment seriously.


While we're talking about how the Greens delivered for Tasmania, it's seldom acknowledged that the price on carbon, which is the international gold standard for action on climate—and Senator Bushby would know this—delivered billions of dollars in windfall to Hydro Tasmania, who then paid a dividend to the Tasmanian government which funded schools, hospitals, policing and national parks. In fact, the Greens pretty much provided a lifeline to Tasmania's Treasury through a price on carbon. That has never been acknowledged in any public comment by the Liberal Party, who came in here and recklessly ripped up action on climate and billions of dollars of revenue to the Tasmanian government and to the Tasmanian people. That has never been acknowledged. Had that price on carbon gone into its final phase, after three years of being a carbon trading scheme, which is what it was set up to do, we would have had an official price on carbon. And we were that close to getting offsets for Tasmania's forests that would have been in the billions. The forests that Senator McKim, in his time in government, saved for the Tasmanian people, were eligible for offsets under the additivity principle, and there were advanced negotiations for the Greens to deliver billions of dollars to the Tasmanian economy. That was ripped up by the Liberal Party, with their cavalier attitude towards climate and the Tasmanian economy. 


So, Senator Seselja, if you want to talk about economy-wrecking policies of the Greens, you should have a look at yourself and what you've done to my state of Tasmania. The hundreds of millions of dollars that we delivered through the diversification funds in the Tasmanian Forest Agreement—which I'm proud to say my colleague Nick McKim played a role in delivering—have gone towards setting up mountain bike paths that are now leading the charge in the diversification of the Tasmanian economy. That is another win for the Greens, and for the Tasmanian people. In fact, I could go on and on all day about our 20-year vision for the Tasmanian economy that's come to pass. 


In 1992, previous senator Christine Milne and the Green Independents put together a policy for Tasmania. This did include a policy for small business, because they knew back then that small business was the backbone of the Tasmanian economy. They knew that the big businesses that were tied to global commodity cycles would, unfortunately, likely fail in a changing world of globalisation. They predicted the demise of price-taking industries that had no control over their future, and they were right. They said governments should be investing in small business, incentivising small business, and focusing on the competitive strengths of Tasmania—what we have that is unique, that the rest of the world wants and will come and see and will pay good money to see. And we were right. 


The only thing that's held Tasmania back for decades—it's benefiting from this now—is the Liberal Party and the Labor Party and their anti-Greens rhetoric and the action they have taken to do everything they possibly can to put us out of business. But I say to Senator Seselja that we were right about small business and the importance of small business in Tasmania. 


Senator Bushby, I urge you to support this amendment of Senator McKim's, because you know how important small business is to Tasmania. You have small business interests in your family. You know both my wife and I have run small businesses in Tasmania, and we're just like the tens of thousands of Tasmanians that have small businesses. They work really hard; they employ the majority of Tasmanians. This is exactly the kind of amendment that you should support, to support Tasmanians.

"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2018-09-12,"



Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Chief Government Whip in the Senate) (09:48):  A few points that were made by the previous two contributors to this debate need some comment. Senator Whish-Wilson was just talking about the so-called windfall to the hydro-electric corporation in Tasmania as a result of the so-called carbon tax that was introduced by the previous Labor government. There is no doubt that they did have an opportunity to make extra money at that time. But that money didn't come from nowhere; that money was coming because they were able to charge higher energy prices to Tasmanians—to Tasmanian households and to Tasmanian businesses—because, as part of the National Electricity Market, the carbon tax had increased the national price of energy and therefore they were able to charge more for their energy. That meant that Tasmanian households and Tasmanian businesses were paying higher energy costs and that Hydro, because it's renewable and was not having to contribute the same degree of cost through the carbon tax, was making a windfall. But make no mistake: that windfall was coming at the expense of Tasmanians and Tasmanian businesses—Tasmanian small businesses, which Senator Whish-Wilson is saying this amendment will assist. I think there was also a mention of mountain bike paths as one of the magnificent things that were delivered by the previous Tasmanian state Labor-Green government. Most of the mountain bike paths that exist in Tasmania—that have been built—have been funded in large part by the federal Liberal government since 2013. 


The fact is that, by most economic metrics, prior to March 2014 Tasmania was languishing at the bottom of the pack relative to other states. We were seen as the poor cousin right across the nation, no matter which metric you looked at. That turned around after March 2014. There was an immediate improvement in business confidence just because of the election of the majority Hodgman Liberal government. There was an immediate improvement in confidence that resulted in an immediate increase in business and other investment, which led to Tasmania now being around the middle or higher in those same economic metrics. 


So let's not pretend and try to rewrite history that the Labor-Green state government was somehow a miraculous government that just happened to miss out on all the good things showing up because it lost the March 2014 election but all the good things that they did came out afterwards. The reality is that it was the election of the majority Hodgman Liberal government that provided confidence for businesses in Tasmania to make the investments.



The CHAIR:  Senator Bushby, I appreciate the passion of the Tasmanians in the chamber this morning, but, in the same way that I cautioned Senator McKim, I have been listening very closely to your contribution, and we are discussing the amendment that's been proposed. 




Senator BUSHBY:
  I did mention small business, which is what the amendment is about.



The CHAIR:  You mentioned small business once. Could you focus particularly on the amendment before the chamber.




Senator BUSHBY:
  I think I've sufficiently corrected the record to make sure that Hansard adequately doesn't record unchallenged those incorrect assertions that were made by previous speakers.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (09:51):  If anyone wants to talk about incorrect assertions maybe we should look at what Senator Bushby has just said. You elect a Liberal government in Tasmania and, whoosh, everything changes—magic takes place. It doesn't work like that. Economics doesn't work like that. 



Senator Bushby interjecting—




Senator CAMERON:
  I know you've got an economics degree, but I've never seen it really deliver much in this place. You haven't really filled me full of faith that you've got any understanding of economics if you think an election suddenly and immediately makes changes.


I want to come back to the issue. I don't know what it is with the Greens this morning, and I don't know what it is with the Liberal Party, but maybe it's because you are both doing so badly in Tasmania. Maybe that's the problem. Maybe you've just got to get up here and not worry about the depreciation bill that we're talking about for small business. I simply say: let's get this bill up and help small business and stop the nonsense and squabbling that's going on here between the senators from Tasmania—the Greens, who will never be in government, and the Liberal Party, who are just about to lose government.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2018-09-12,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (09:53):  I won't hold the chamber up much more, because as Senator Cameron rightly points out this is an important piece of legislation, and, in fact, is going to be passed with the LNP voting for it, the Labor Party voting for it and the Greens voting for it. The problem that we face is that neither the LNP nor Labor are going to vote for the amendment that's currently before the Senate. Remember, this amendment would incentivise small business to invest in energy efficiency and to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. That position is not surprising, given the massive donations that both the LNP and the ALP get from the fossil fuel sector—tens of millions of dollars a year straight into their parties' coffers so they can run campaigns to get re-elected. Of course, those donations buy the fossil fuel industry policy outcomes, and we're seeing that play out on the floor of the Senate this morning.


I just want to be clear on this amendment: Senator Bushby and every other Liberal and National senator from Tasmania are voting against an amendment that would encourage small businesses, through an instant asset write-off threshold increase, to invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency, which would help those small businesses bring their bottom lines into a more favourable state, because it would bring their energy costs down. Every single LNP and Liberal senator is about to vote against that and vote against small business in Tasmania. The same applies for every single ALP senator from Tasmania. They're about to vote against every small business in Tasmania being able to receive a more favourable tax treatment for assets they invest in, up to a threshold of $30,000, which would allow them to invest in energy efficiency, to reduce their use of fossil fuels and to fuel switch from gas to electricity.


Climate disruption, the disruption of our climate that we're seeing today, is by a long way the pre-eminent public policy challenge facing humanity. As part of that, all senators ought consider it the pre-eminent public policy challenge facing Australia and facing this parliament. We're in a situation where the new Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, is washing his hands of responsibility to act on the disruption of our climate; to bring Australia's emissions profile down; to show global leadership and show other countries that as a rich, developed nation we can step up and fulfil our moral obligations to the rest of the world.


I'm glad Minister Payne is in here to hear it. At the Pacific Islands Forum, Minister Payne managed to give a speech which didn't mention climate change. How absurd is that? Last week she went over to Nauru and gave a speech that didn't mention climate change to a Pacific Islands Forum.




Senator Payne:
  You'd be completely wrong, Nick.




Senator McKIM:
  If that's the case, I'm happy for you to correct the record. If you believe that I am wrong, I'll have a look at your speech.




Senator Payne:
  What speech did I give to the Pacific Islands Forum?




Senator McKIM:
  I have seen reports—



Senator Payne interjecting—




Senator McKIM:
  No, you can get up in a minute, Minister. You don't get the chance to talk over me when I'm on my feet and you're not.



The CHAIR:  Senator McKim, please resume your seat.




Senator McKIM:
  I have seen—



Senator Payne interjecting—



The CHAIR:  Order! Senator McKim has the right to be heard in silence. Senator McKim, please direct your remarks to the chair.




Senator McKIM:
  Thank you, Chair. I've seen reports that one of Minister Payne's speeches to that forum did not mention climate change. Pacific island nations have shown global leadership on this issue, because some of them are going to disappear this century, Minister. It's not good enough for you and your government not to take the issue of emissions reduction seriously. Australia should be a global leader in showing the way forward on this issue. It is a disgrace that we have a Prime Minister who basically said this week that Australians are not interested in climate change. He's wrong. The polls show he's wrong. It's part of the reason why he's going to be ignominiously turfed out of government next year, along with Minister Payne and all his colleagues. He is misreading the mood of the nation.


Australians want strong action on climate change. They want far stronger action than even the Australian Labor Party are proposing on climate change. In fact, it is the Greens who are proposing setting a pollution standard for power stations and progressively shutting them, starting with the worst first. It is only the Greens in this place who oppose the Adani coalmine. The Queensland Labor government wanted to give free coal, free water and free money to one of the most corrupt corporations in the world, the Adani Group. That's exactly what they were doing. The Liberal National Party—



The CHAIR:  Senator McKim—




Senator McKIM:
  Oh, we've hit a nerve here now, haven't we!



The CHAIR:  please resume your seat. Senator Cameron on a point of order?




Senator Cameron:
  A point of order: we are dealing with an amendment to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Accelerated Depreciation for Small Business Entities) Bill 2018. It's not for me to argue that everyone should be on point every time in here but, come on, can we get this bill done. Senator McKim, basically what you should do is go back to Tasmania and see if you can get more votes. Stop trying to get them here.



The CHAIR:  On the point of order, Senator Cameron is quite correct. Senator McKim, you were absolutely focused on the amendment. You'd started to drift away. I was waiting for you to come back to the point before I drew your attention to the amendment.




Senator McKIM:
  Thank you, Chair. I appreciate your drawing the amendment to my attention. In continuing my contribution, I would draw the committee's attention to the fact that our amendment is actually all about reducing emissions, at least in part, as well as helping the bottom line of small business. Senator Cameron wrote the book on digressing from the topic at hand in this Senate, in my experience, so I'm very happy to take his counsel on that!


It is extremely disappointing that we're not going to get support for this amendment, because ultimately it would show leadership on climate action and it would help small businesses drive an investment into their operations which ultimately would help them bring their emissions profiles down and improve their bottom line. It would give the opportunity for every small business in this country to thrive and prosper to a greater degree than will be the case when this amendment fails.

"Brockman, Sen Slade",LP,2018-09-12,"



Senator BROCKMAN
 (Western Australia) (12:45):  I rise today to speak on a matter that has gained a lot of publicity, media coverage and political debate over the last five years, particularly from our political opponents—Labor, the Greens and their various supporters, including the unions, GetUp! and left-aligned think tanks—running an increasingly misleading campaign about the levels of inequality in Australia. For example, the ACTU's Change the Rules campaign is a pretty blatant and dishonest attempt to return to an ugly class-warfare mentality in this country. We see it in the rhetoric employed by those opposite, supported by highly dubious evidence and very misleading statistics.


Groups like the McKell Institute and the ACTU have released reports in recent times with highly misleading claims about the supposed 'crisis' of rising inequality in Australia. The McKell Institute report, for example, claims that 'inequality in Australia is at a 75-year high'. This number is arrived at using deeply flawed methodology, examining pre-tax income without accounting for the significant income redistribution that already occurs in Australia through our highly progressive tax system and our significant and very extensive welfare state. It is completely meaningless as an indicator of outcomes. This methodology completely ignores non-monetary transfers such as the provision of health care, education, infrastructure and other government services.


There have also been claims that our minimum wage is declining—something that is also demonstrably false. Since 1998, the minimum wage has increased by more than 20 per cent in real terms, and Australia has the second-highest minimum wage in the OECD. What about wealth inequality? There has been significant talk about rising wealth inequality in Australia, but the simple fact is that, for example, according to Credit Suisse, Australia has the third most equal distribution of wealth in the developed world, behind Japan and Belgium. I think it needs to be said: this is hardly a crisis.


The facts simply don't support the conclusion that inequality is on the rise in Australia. Statistics from 2015 show that 10 per cent of taxpayers pay 50 per cent of income tax in this country. In anyone's language, that is a highly redistributive economy. According to a KPMG report, 60 per cent of households pay no net income tax once transfers are accounted for. Sixty per cent of households pay no net income tax! If you ever wanted evidence of how highly redistributive modern Australia is, this is surely it. The fundamental problem with the Left's obsession with equality as an outcome in the first place is that government should always focus on allowing society to create wealth and allowing individuals to have opportunity, rather than mythologising on inequality.


I think it's always worth having a quick look back at recent history. Some personal recent history: my father—so one generation ago—rode a horse to school. He grew up on a farm. They made their own power and were not connected to the grid; it was 32 volt electricity. In fact, we were only connected to the grid in this century. When dad was young, it was a party-line telephone system. The idea of everyone having a mobile phone was from sci-fi fantasy land. Yet that's where we are today. None of these things are taken into account when the Left talks about income inequality.


On our side of the chamber, we believe in the creation of wealth for all and opportunities for all. We believe in reward for effort. We believe in letting hardworking Australians keep more of what they earn. We believe in growing the pie so that all Australians can live a better life. That's why we have legislated tax cuts for all Australians, coming into effect as early as next year.


In her final prime ministerial question time, the late Margaret Thatcher was asked about increasing inequality over her 11 years of office. She famously responded:


People on all levels of income are better off than they were in 1979. The hon. Gentleman is saying that he would rather that the poor were poorer, provided that the rich were less rich.


This is the fundamental flaw in the argument of those opposite. This government has implemented policies designed to create more wealth for everyone, not merely to redistribute it in a different way.


Again, if we look back in history, it is not that many hundreds of years ago in the majority of societies on the majority of this planet that the vast majority of people, 90 per cent of people, lived subsistence lives. They lived to grow enough to eat to continue to live. There was very little surplus generated and what surplus there was was taken by very few. How do you compare income equality in a society where an absolute monarch theoretically owns absolutely everything? Instead, people on the left want to focus on a very short span of history and want to focus on very narrow measures of equality that reveal very little about the way people actually live their lives.


Again, let's look at the record since 2013. More than one million jobs have been created and the vast majority of those jobs have been created by Australian businesses. It was not by government but by Australian businesses employing people, giving people an opportunity and giving income to families so that they can make more of their own lives. We have cut company tax for more than 3.2 million small businesses, employing more than 6.7 million Australians. The small businesses of Australia should never be forgotten when we are considering the policy framework under which we operate.


We have legislated, as I've said, tax relief for hardworking Australians. This is an historic reform that will see 94 per cent of Australians pay no more than 32c in the dollar in income tax. This is a massive win for working Australians, who deserve to keep more of what they earn. We have grown our export industries, inking trade agreements with China, Japan, South Korea, Peru and Indonesia, as well as taking a lead in the TPP-11 negotiations. We have invested a record amount in nation-building infrastructure: $75 billion. This is how this government is creating wealth for everyday Australians.


I remind all Australians that you can never tax your way to prosperity. It's absolutely impossible. It's time that we moved on from this class-warfare mentality. In fact, I thought that as a society we had moved on in the eighties, but it seems we are back there again.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (15:08):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance and the Public Service (Senator Cormann) to a question without notice asked by Senator Polley today relating to the Goods and Services Tax.


Today the report in TheMercury, my home state of Tasmania's local Hobart newspaper, really tells the whole story about the relationship between this federal government and the Tasmanian state government. For quite a while now, the Tasmanian federal Labor team have been saying that the federal Tasmanian Liberal representatives up here weren't doing enough to ensure that Tasmania would be able to get its fair share of GST. And the report that's in the paper today really shows that the team here is lacking in their ability to actually get any projects or funding for the state of Tasmania.


What followed today was a statement put out by Minister Gutwein, the Tasmanian Treasurer, that those weren't the words used. But he hasn't denied that there was some sort of robust discussion, nor has he denied that the former Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, had to step in and negotiate with the Tasmanian Treasurer and the Tasmanian Premier. What we've seen today with the statement from Minister Gutwein, the Tasmanian Treasurer, is that the best he can say about the GST deal is that, on face value, it is a good one for Tasmania. The deal was announced months ago, but Peter Gutwein apparently hasn't seen the detail.



Senator Cormann interjecting—




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  What is concerning, Senator Cormann, is the fact that we had a Treasurer—now the Prime Minister—with complete disdain for the state of Tasmania. We have Tasmanian Liberal representatives that haven't been able to push the case for Tasmania.


It's not only in the GST situation that we find this happening. Time and time again we've found that there isn't strong representation from the Tasmanian Liberal team up here. They're too busy playing games and too busy being involved in bringing down a Prime Minister. We know the head of the Tasmanian Liberal team was part of the show that started the destabilisation of Mr Turnbull and brought down Mr Turnbull's prime ministership. We know that. Senator Abetz knows that; he leads this team. He's too busy doing things like that—carrying grudges and bringing down a serving Prime Minister—instead of doing the job he's actually up here for.


And then the grubby tactics of yesterday, when he cast aspersions on women in the ALP. It was a disgrace. He may not like quotas, but there are other people that are in his party—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brown, please resume your seat. Senator Wong?




Senator Wong:
  Madam Deputy President, Senator Abetz has just called us the quota girls. I'm asking him to withdraw 'quota girls'. I think the time has passed for that kind of terminology.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Abetz, Senator Wong has asked you to withdraw. I ask you in the interests of debate and generosity to withdraw those remarks.




Senator Abetz:
  I categorically reject that that term is in any way unparliamentary according to all the standards, but I accept—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Abetz, I did not suggest it was unparliamentary—




Senator Abetz:
  If I can finish, Madam Deputy President?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Abetz, please resume your seat. I want to make sure that what I said was clearly understood. I did not imply it was unparliamentary. I did suggest, in the spirit of generosity, that you might withdraw it. Please resume.




Senator Abetz:
  Madam Deputy President, if you wouldn't have interrupted me, that was exactly where I was going, and I assume you would have known that that was where I was going. Accordingly, I withdraw.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Abetz. I was simply making clear that I had not suggested the comment that you made was unparliamentary.




Senator Abetz:
  On the point of order, Madam Deputy President, if I may?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Yes?




Senator Abetz:
  When somebody raises a point of order requesting something be withdrawn under the standing orders it is on the basis that it is unparliamentary. Therefore, for me to make that preamble to my withdrawal was highly appropriate, with great respect.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I think we will disagree on that, Senator Abetz. Senator Brown, please continue.




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  Thank you. What we saw in the report in theMercury today on the Prime Minister's behaviour was a slur on every Tasmanian. Quite frankly, the Prime Minister should apologise. We've had a discussion about whether they were the exact words used. That's really meaningless. What is completely apparent is the attitude of this Prime Minister towards Tasmania, and that is a problem for Tasmania. We know that the Tasmanian Premier and the Tasmanian Treasurer have an issue with this government through Prime Minister Morrison. It was there when he was the Treasurer. We now know it was there, and it will continue to be there unless our Liberal Tasmanian senators start standing up for Tasmania. They haven't done so. We've had cuts to hospitals, we've had cuts to schools, we've had—




Senator Abetz:
  False, false—

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania) (15:15):  The people of Tasmania have been exceptionally well served by the coalition government, especially in recent years. The track record speaks for itself: the irrigation schemes that are currently being built in Tasmania, the Midland Highway upgrade, the Hobart Airport upgrade, the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme for our exports and so the list goes on. The falsehood, and one has to assume now given the overwhelming public evidence, the deliberate falsehood of seeking to peddle that our schools and hospitals have been cut is simply unsustainable. The facts speak for themselves. There have been considerable increases in funding in both the health and education sectors. It is absolutely clear, and on the record, in each and every budget that the coalition has delivered over the past five years. And yet the Australian Labor Party will continue to come in here and go to the public seeking to peddle a tissue of lies to try to scare people. They did it successfully, I must confess, at the last election with their 'Mediscare' campaign. Completely false, completely untrue and one wonders how they sleep at night knowing that they have gained seats through the peddling of misinformation.


How unself-aware can a senator be when a Labor Senator, such as Senator Carol Brown, gets up and says that supposedly some of us are more concerned about other issues when all she had to do was look over her left shoulder and look at the demise of her Tasmanian Labor Senate colleague Senator Singh. And who controls the division of the Tasmanian Labor Party? None other than Senator Carol Brown and her friends. Good luck to her. That is the nature of politics. It is a tough game, but, please don't come in here and assert things when you yourself, Senator Brown, have been engaged in such machinations that have seen the demotion of Senator Lisa Singh.


That is what the Labor Party want me and the coalition to concentrate on, the petty politics. What we on this side are concentrating on is success for Tasmania, courtesy of the Tasmanian Liberal Senate team, the Tasmanian Liberal government and the commitment of the ministry to all things Tasmanian. That is why the GST deal that was gained for Tasmania will see the delivery of an extra $100-plus million to my home state. Unlike the Australian Labor Party leader, who goes to Western Australia and says, 'You have been dudded. We will give you more,' and then comes to Tasmania and asserts, 'I will give Tasmania just as much as ever before.' The GST isn't a magic puddling. If somebody gets more somebody else has to get less. That is where the numbers never stack up for the Australian Labor Party. That's why they always run deficits and that's why they always increase debt, because they do not have the capacity or the honesty to level with the Australian people and say, 'If somebody gets more money, it may well mean that somebody else gets less money.'


However, Treasurer Morrison and the finance minister were able to negotiate and develop a GST deal that, in fact, sees the state of Tasmania over $100 million better off. And somehow that is a failure on my part?


Well, if an extra $100 million for the state of Tasmania is a failure, I will wear that failure just as much as when we got the extra money for the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme, the Hobart airport, the irrigation scheme, the Midland Highway and the jobs and investment packages. If they are all failures, I will wear them as failures.


The great news is that, since we got into government, the unemployment rate has gone from 8.1 per cent to below six per cent. That is the good economic news. But even better than the economic news is the social news that there are now thousands of extra Tasmanians in gainful employment because of the policies of the federal and state Liberal governments, working together to ensure that that abysmal record of unemployment is wiped off the slate of Tasmania.

Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (15:20):  Today in question time there was, I would say, an almost deceitful attempt to get away from the truth in the minister's answers in regard to the questions we were asking on the GST issues. The Prime Minister's behaviour reported this morning is a slur on every Tasmanian, and Mr Morrison really should apologise. He's taking Tasmanians for granted. Just because he's got no federal members from there in the House of Representatives doesn't mean he should ignore us or treat us as any less. It certainly doesn't mean that he should be rude about it. Whether the actual potty-mouthed comments were said or not, he did say that we were a 'mendicant' state and he really should take that back. That is implying that we are just beggars. We have the right to make sure that the people of Tasmania are looked after, and the Liberal senators on that side of the chamber should be doing just that as well.


Mr Morrison is completely out of touch, and his smugness is going to be the downfall of him. Let me just say this: he is not listening to the people of Tasmania at all. He will end up without any House of Representatives members from Tasmania yet again at the next election. That's my prediction. The people of Tasmania don't like to be (a) insulted and (b) taken as mugs. In regard to the GST issue, Prime Minister Scott Morrison and the Tasmanian Treasurer, Peter Gutwein, clearly disagreed over the dud GST deal, and what it's exposed to us are great divisions in the Liberal Party. It's clear that Peter Gutwein believed the GST deal was defective in some way and that there was something not right with it, but what is also clear is that Premier Hodgman rolled over and signed up anyway. Today's Hobart Mercury newspaper reported:


MALCOLM Turnbull was forced to sideline Scott Morrison in critical GST negotiations after his then treasurer allegedly abused his Tasmanian counterpart Peter Gutwein in an expletive-laden tirade.


The Mercury understands the Tasmanian Liberals were still so concerned about Mr Morrison's attitude towards their state during negotiations that they asked their counterparts in Canberra to counsel Mr Morrison before he did media here following the deal being done.


This is an amazing assessment of Mr Morrison's shortcomings as Treasurer. It's a stark example of why he shouldn't be Prime Minister. We haven't actually heard why he should be Prime Minister. We haven't actually heard why Prime Minister Turnbull was rolled. We can't get any answers out of anyone on those things. As for Mr Morrison telling people to just get on with it, we are not going to just get on with it. We want some answers. We want to know why it all happened.


But while Mr Morrison might deny the language that he used, it's very clear, as I said, that his attitude to Tasmania and to Tasmanians is problematical. It's very problematical. It's notable that the Tasmanian Liberal Treasurer is, as I said, yet to deny the Prime Minister was sidelined from GST discussions because of his conduct. So Mr Gutwein hasn't come out and said, 'No, that didn't happen.' Mr Morrison is out of touch, he's smug and he's condescending. I don't think, in general, people like that. He might think he's being a leader, but most of us think he's just playing a bit of a game. He was the last man standing after many, many iterations through that week. And no-one voted for Mr Morrison or his illegitimate government.


We know that Tasmanians feel that the economy isn't working for them. They talk to us all the time. The people are worried about passing on a worse deal to their kids. This is the first generation where that has started to happen. In previous generations people have been able to pass on to their kids better deals than they had themselves. Well, this is no longer happening, under the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government. Mr Morrison and the Libs have spent five years cutting the essential services that working Tasmanians rely on while giving tax handouts to the top end of town. Let's look at just how much Mr Morrison actually cares about Tasmania. When he was the Treasurer he visited Tasmania once—just once. (Timeexpired)

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2018-09-12,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (15:25):  On the question of the GST, I am very proud to rise to contribute to this debate as a Victorian senator, because it is indeed Victoria that can stand very proud and tall as one of the states in the federation that has been a net contributor to the federation since Federation. In fact, casting my eyes around the chamber right now, I believe that I and Senator Hume and you, Mr President, and Senator Fifield are the only senators in the chamber at this very moment who can proudly say that they represent a state that has been a net contributor to the federation since Federation.


Senator Bilyk is most unkind to her fellow Tasmanians. On my recent trips to Tasmania for the by-election, to support the great Brett Whiteley for Tasmania's state election, what I observed from Tasmania—and I know Senator Cameron is a frequent and fond visitor to Tasmania also—is that Tasmania is booming. And it is no wonder that Tasmania is booming, under the twin leadership of a coalition government here in Canberra and the outstanding leadership of the Hodgman government in Tasmania. Tasmania's doing well because it's got a good state government that is focused on free enterprise, jobs and economic growth, not on environmental radicalism or locking up the state. Tasmania is doing well because it's got a federal government that is focused on the economy, jobs and prosperity and  a federal government that is supportive of Tasmania.


We have here in this chamber a very dedicated, very eloquent and very passionate team of Tasmanian coalition senators who work very hard every day to ensure that their state's interests are well protected. We have my friend Senator Duniam. We have Senator Abetz, who made a contribution to this debate earlier; Senator Bushby, our Chief Government Whip; Senator Colbeck, the only frontbencher from Tasmania; and of course our most recent new addition, Senator Martin, our new Nationals colleague from Tasmania. They are a strong, united team and they're effective at advocating for Tasmania. The evidence is clear for all to see—and not just in the new GST distribution, although that is a very important recent edition.


This debate seeks to impugn the integrity, the motives and the contribution of our Prime Minister. But it was of course our Prime Minister who, not that long ago, as Treasurer, devised a solution to the GST distribution problem that had eluded all previous governments. This is not a new problem, but it is a problem that this government and Prime Minister Morrison, as Treasurer, took head-on and addressed. And he addressed it in such a way that—yes—dealt with the very valid concerns of my Western Australian colleagues, who have been for years raising the problems of the GST distribution and the way in which their state has been disadvantaged. It effectively dealt with their concerns but did so without taking anything at all away from any other state.


I have a table here, published in the FinancialReview in July this year, which summarises the boost of the GST distribution pool by state out to 2026-27, the time period over which the solution is proposed. This is how each state fares under that solution: $351 million of net benefit to New South Wales; $425 million of benefit to Victoria; $518 million of benefit to Queensland; $3.3 billion of benefit to Western Australia; $257 million of benefit to South Australia; and $112 million of benefit to Tasmania. There is even $46 million of benefit going to the ACT, and there is $189 million of benefit going to the Northern Territory. So every state and every territory, from Tasmania to Western Australia included, will be better off under the GST distribution solution devised by our former Treasurer and now Prime Minister, Scott Morrison. He has been very unfairly maligned in this debate. 


Also unfairly maligned is the Tasmanian Liberal Senate team. Not only have they secured a strong GST deal for their state; they have secured a range of other generous supports for Tasmania, which, in the 2018-19 budget, amounted to $3.8 billion. That included, of course, the GST disbursements to the state of $2½ billion but also specific-purpose funding of $1.3 billion; record funding for schools of $446 million, which is an increase of $7.2 million since the last budget; and record infrastructure funding of $142 million, which is an increase of $27.3 million since the last budget. Tasmania is doing well and Australia is doing well under this Prime Minister.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2018-09-12,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (15:30):  The revelation today of a clear disagreement between the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, during his time as Treasurer, and the Tasmanian Treasurer, Peter Gutwein, over the dud GST deal for Tasmania has once again exposed the out-of-control divisions within the Liberal Party. We all saw that on display only a fortnight ago, but now, through a leak, we have again seen an incredible division between the Tasmanian Liberals at the state level and this new Prime Minister and the federal Liberals. 


What does this mean for the future of Tasmania? What does it mean when we have a Tasmanian government that does not get along with its federal counterparts and, in fact, when it does not get along with this Prime Minister? There are real concerns now about what this whole affair means for a number of Tasmania's vital services. What does it mean for the City Deal, what does it mean for Macquarie Point, what does it mean for essential services like our health and hospital crisis when we have a Prime Minister who has shown such contempt for Tasmania? All Tasmanians today would have woken up incredibly worried by the fact that we have, as leaked in TheMercury, a Prime Minister who has shown his complete contempt. 


If this dud deal that the state Liberals rolled over for was not bad enough, it's now clear we have a Prime Minister who does not care about Tasmania as a state. To allegedly refer to our state as 'mendicant' is just absolutely abhorrent. We all know that this refers to a telephone call that occurred between the now Prime Minister and the state Treasurer, Peter Gutwein. Prime Minister Morrison, who was then Treasurer, indicated that Tasmanians are, in effect, beggars—that we are, in effect, beggars. It is absolutely abhorrent for the Prime Minister of this country to refer to Tasmania as beggars. It tells us what this Prime Minister thinks of us, what he thinks of Tasmanians, behind closed doors. 


We know what he thinks of Tasmanians, because he has been to Tasmania only four times in the past 10 years, and one of those times was during the recent Braddon by-election—once in this term of government and in his time as Treasurer. I think that says it all. For the Prime Minister to refer to Tasmanians as beggars is deeply offensive. It also proves exactly what has always been suspected, which is that this GST deal was designed for Western Australia at the expense of Tasmania. No Tasmanian has ever been fooled by that. It has been a dud deal since day one; it has been a dud deal since then. But then again 'how dud?' we don't know, because the Treasurer of Tasmania himself has said that he has taken it on face value. He has taken this deal on face value—a deal that has an effect on Tasmania's bottom line, Tasmania's budget, and how we deliver our services. He said months ago that he still hadn't seen the detail.


There goes the relationship. That shows you how close the relationship is between the Tasmanian Treasurer and the then federal Treasurer, now Prime Minister. It does not bode well for the future of Tasmania under this state Liberal government, and it does not bode well for the future of Tasmania under this federal coalition government under Scott Morrison. The sooner there is an election in this country, the better. And the sooner we vote this joke of a government out of this country, the better—so that states like Tasmania can get a decent government that cares about all Australians, including Tasmanians; so that Tasmanians do get their fair share of the GST; so that we can be respected; and so that we can deliver the services that Tasmanians expect. The title 'beggar' used by this Prime Minister is absolutely offensive.

The Law Council and the Bar Association were provided with early drafts of the legislation in mid-July, so this new date for submissions would allow three months to review and make submissions, time rarely allowed for other legislation dealt with by this committee. People involved with the family law courts are almost universal in their condemnation of the delays and inefficiencies, and the consolidation of the courts is one step towards achieving a more efficient and better outcome and would be welcomed by those involved in the court system.

It is impacting on many Australians' lives and it has been held up because of being thrown between the Family Court and the circuit court. The government's proposal to actually meld the two together is going to help the Australian people. This is not about a consultation that's needed with the people in rural and regional areas. This is about the process of working with the courts' workings so that those judges are doing the work to alleviate the pressures on the courts with the cases. Cases now take about 2½ to three years before they're actually heard. Amalgamating the court system will mean that those judges who are sitting there—and one judge has only worked nine days in one year—will start doing the work for the people. So that's why it's imperative that this is done. It's not a matter of holding up consultation. The people want this to happen. So I won't be supporting this.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-09-12,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (16:35):  The failure of the opposition to make its immigration policy public is of grave concern given that most commentators predict a Labor landslide at the next federal election. Labor will say they have an immigration policy, but the ALP national platform gives no indication of the level or mix of migrants to be given permanent visas each year. Instead, there are motherhood statements like 'we celebrate immigration' and 'the miracle of multiculturalism'. There is no admission of the problems that have been caused by multiculturalism, which means these problems go unsolved.


Voters have a right to know what Labor and their partners, the Greens, will do in government with respect to the number of permanent visas to be issued under the skilled program, family reunions and humanitarian program. Labor have been coy about the immigration numbers because they know that if their base knew what they had in store for them they would not vote for them. Labor know commute times to work will double and access to hospitals and a good education will decrease if immigration rates continue, but they won't tell the voters the truth. Instead, Labor say immigration is good for the economy. But there is no evidence of that. It should be remembered that the economic miracle in Japan after World War II was achieved with no immigration at all. When Luke Foley, the Labor state leader in New South Wales, talked about 'white flight' he was quickly silenced, because there is no place in Labor for the truth.


In recent years, the coalition has set targets of around 220,000 permanent migrants a year, which is less than the 300,000-plus set by the Rudd government in 2013. To say Labor have been vague about their intentions in respect of immigration is an understatement. But we do know that anything Labor wants to do in respect of immigration will have to have the agreement of the Greens, because Labor needs the Greens to form government.


Today the Labor mayor of Liverpool City Council, in Western Sydney, called for a bigger Australia. She said the only questions to be resolved are how much bigger and how quickly we want to get there. Ms Waller went on to say that immigration has been 'great for our economy' and that 'cultural diversity is our strength'. She seems not to know that most conflicts in the world are rooted in diversity. We need to find a balance between cultural diversity and an obligation to commit to our values and political institutions which guarantee our freedoms and liberal democracy.


There are now significant geographical concentrations of overseas-born people in Sydney and Melbourne, which suggests the past patterns of integration will not continue. If the current settlement patterns persist, we will end up like Europe. We already have electorates, like Banks, Parramatta and Fowler, where the number of people born overseas far outweighs the number of people born in Australia. How does anyone expect these newcomers to integrate into Australia when most people around them were born overseas?


One Nation's immigration policy is clearly set out on the One Nation website. Our policy recognises that large-scale migration in a country which cannot reproduce itself is bound to change the culture and ethnic make-up of Australia. We cannot unscramble the egg but we can be honest and recognise that problems exist and they need to be solved, and solved now.


I view with grave concern the fact that Labor and the Greens are satisfied that mastery of English can be established by getting 12 questions right in a 20-question multiple-choice test. This standard is the lowest in the world for any comparable country, with the result that over one million people cannot speak English well or at all. This means a large number of people cannot participate in work or other aspects of our society. Labor and the Greens believe supporting low language standards for citizenship will win their candidates enough votes to deliver government. They do newcomers a disservice, because it is in the interests of migrants to master the language so they can fully engage in society. 


One Nation and the Greens see the future of Australia very differently. A recent survey found that the overwhelming majority of Greens voters do not take pride in the Australian way of life or believe that maintaining the Australian way of life and culture is important. Let me say that again. Seventy-five per cent of Greens voters said that maintaining the Australian way of life and culture is unimportant. That doesn't really surprise me. I see the way they vote in this chamber. They are so wrong. The Australian way of life is worth keeping and it is what I will fight for in this place. The Australian way of life is what attracts people to Australia. It is what Australians have fought for in war. It has been created by hard work and love of this country. The Australian way of life is the social glue that keeps us together. Social cohesion has been taken for granted by successive governments as, each year, they set immigration targets without a thought about the cumulative effects on society. 


Labor and the Greens gagged debate on my proposal in the Plebiscite (Future Migration Level) Bill 2018 to give Australians a say in the level of immigration at the next federal election. The last thing Labor wants is a reduced level of immigration because, as has been known since the days of Barry Jones, newcomers to Australia tend to vote Labor. The voices of minority groups are over-represented in the parliament because the major political parties take for granted the silent majority and pander to minorities, which can make the difference between winning and losing a seat in parliament. Labor says multiculturalism has been a miracle, but the truth is that multiculturalism has been a mix of success and failure. 


Don't get me wrong. There have been many successes and I applaud the hardworking Asian families. It is, however, time to deal with the failures of multiculturalism, which we see as culturally separate communities, because in these communities a shared sense of national identity is weak. In these circumstances, the identity is replaced by a religious or ethnic identity. Today we are seeing clear evidence of cultural separatism by some migrants. The Greens political party represents the rights of those culturally separate communities to remain separate, and Labor in government will be forced to bend to the Greens. 


Some migrants from the Middle East have formed culturally separate communities where they keep the language, custom and culture of their homeland in an attempt to recreate the villages of their birth. They reject our way of life and our values—but not our welfare system and not our free health system. Just take the train from Sydney to Bankstown, walk down the main street of Lakemba and nearby suburbs and count the number of bulk-billing medical practices. And look at the statistics for welfare payments by postcode. It is here that English is not spoken well or at all. Employment participation is low and welfare dependency is high. These communities are bad for social cohesion, bad for the economy and bad for national security because amongst this group are those who want to Islamise Australia. 


Federal politicians want to minimise the perception of national security problems arising from these communities, but you cannot ignore the spending by state and federal governments in respect of Islamic terrorism. Every major city has seen changes to its public spaces, with concrete bollards placed to impede an extremist from murdering people with a vehicle. Here in the parliament we agreed to spend $160 million to strengthen security because of extremism, and we know that is Islamic extremism. 


Let me be clear: I appreciate Australian Muslims are a diverse group, but a significant minority of Australian Muslims told the Scanlon survey that they don't feel Australian, they reject our way of life, our values and our institutions and they want to change Australia. I ask voters to look at the One Nation immigration policy, which is up on our website. The policy is well balanced and carefully thought through. I make no excuse for putting the interests of citizens first.

"Molan, Sen Jim",LP,2018-09-12,"



Senator MOLAN
 (New South Wales) (16:45):  It's a noble cause to try to find out what exactly the migration policy of the opposition is. What a good thing it would be to actually know it. I spent a good deal of 2011, 2012 and going into 2013 trying to figure out exactly what its policy was. At that time, all I could figure out was that it consisted of having very, very large committee meetings of 12 to 15 institutions and ministries trying to figure out how they could solve a problem which they in fact had created. The Australian people certainly deserve to know what the opposition policy is on migration.


At the moment we have a migration system which consists of skilled migrants. Roughly half of those are not skilled; they are families who have accompanied the skilled migrants into Australia. We have family reunion visas. We have a first-class humanitarian visa—18,750 people per year. And we have a very large temporary movement of people to Australia. Labor in its day, during the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd period, had two-thirds of the total migration numbers being due to family reunion and only one-third relating to an economic outcome. We have reversed that. That is a real achievement. Now we have two-thirds that are related to the good of this country through economics and one-third related to families. At any one time there are about two million people on temporary visas in this country—roughly 700,000 of them are New Zealanders, half a million of them are students, and we find we have about 300,000 tourists at any one time.


Educational visas are very, very important for us. They're important for education, but we certainly hope that the main aim of many of those educational visas is not a migration outcome. Education is important because it's the third-biggest export industry of this country. It brings in $31 billion—much more than beef, for example, or any of the other more popular and more considered export industries of this country. The 165,000 people who came to this country through skilled and family visas last year was down from 190,000 seven years ago. We remember that what were called 457 visas were being abused at the time of us taking government and the skills component had been degraded. Now the temporary skill shortage visa has re-established the skills part of that.


The coalition government does have a migration policy. It's committed to ensuring a stronger and more secure Australia for all Australians, and that's what we have done. Only this government has the right policies and plans to ensure that our borders remain secure and no more lives are lost at sea. Only we have that record in both controlling borders effectively and bringing people into this country for the good of this country. The coalition government is taking steps to reform our immigration system to modernise and focus on delivering the best possible outcome for all Australians. The Australian government has consistently said that people subject to regional processing arrangements will not be resettled in Australia—and this will not change.


Under Operation Sovereign Borders, we've taken back control of our borders from the people smugglers. The Australian government's resolve to combat maritime people smuggling has not changed. This government's immigration policy, unlike the opposition's, is very, very clear. Unlike those opposite, we're committed to ensuring a stronger and secure Australia for all Australians. The coalition government's policy includes investing a record $75 billion in infrastructure to manage those people and so those people who come to Australia can benefit from that. Over 10 years, that's in our nation's infrastructure to futureproof Australia's transport networks. This government is focused on building local communities, connecting the regions and our cities, relieving congestion and boosting productivity while creating local jobs. That is absolutely essential to balance a migration policy out.


Operation Sovereign Borders is something that I was involved in deeply. The coalition's Operation Sovereign Borders is a joint-agency, coordinated effort not just to turn back boats on the oceans but to disrupt people-smuggling activities across the region which resulted from those opposite losing total control of our borders. Operation Sovereign Borders has been successful in detecting, intercepting and stopping the boats. Our maritime surveillance and response capabilities have been reinforced with expanded aerial surveillance and on-water operations, and it is a credit to Customs, the public servants and the officials who have been involved in this. Thirty-three vessels have been intercepted at sea and 827 people have been returned to their country of departure or origin.


Labor is attributable for the deaths at sea and created the mess that this government has fixed. We keep on asking, and we keep on saying to ourselves, 'What exactly is the opposition's border policy?' We wonder who makes it. We look around and we wonder where this policy comes from. Does it come from Mr Shorten? Does it come from members in the Senate? The only thing that I can find really is that Ms Ged Kearney, for example, comes out with a degree of irrationality. But she is not on her own. She claims that what we do is racist dog whistling. She demonises us and vilifies a community. She says that what we are doing is solely for gain. She, very cleverly, redefines the criteria to accept asylum seekers—that is, from a place of conflict and found to be a refugee in another country. She says we can afford it and she says that we act against international agreements, which we do not. She sees the detention and the deterrent created by offshore processing as indefinite, which it is not, and punitive, which it is not. What she wants to do is to move the asylum seekers off and ensure that indefinite detention does not happen again.


Labor might say it believes in border control. It might say it believes in border control, but it really has absolutely no idea. The success of Operation Sovereign Borders was based on many things, but most importantly there were turnbacks, temporary protection visas and offshore processing. If we take any one of those away we will find it will all start again. We've seen this before, with former Prime Minister Rudd. He said he supported and would maintain border control. He did not. We did after 2013. He produced 1,200 dead bodies that we know of, 600 boats and 50,000 asylum seekers. We closed onshore detention centres, got children out of detention, saved vast amounts of money and controlled the borders. But about 30 Labor people at the last election declared that they didn't believe in regional processing centres and repeated that in their annual conference soon after that. Labor certainly calls people 'racist' for having this kind of policy. Those on the left always use those terms of abuse. This is a kind of John Setka, CFMEU approach; it is bullying and abusive.


Labor knows that it cannot win if it doesn't embrace what we have done so successfully as a migration policy. This makes Ms Ged Kearney's approach very, very interesting. Even Frank Brennan has generally agreed that what we did in Operation Sovereign Borders was good, but he would like to bring people back to Australia. We would certainly love to get people out of offshore processing centres. We would be very keen to do it.


I have not met one person in the government who wants to keep them there—not one single person. So we're working to get people off and we're doing that very, very successfully, and we will get people off. Critics say that it is politicians who put them there. They put them there—Labor put them there—and we got them off. If this MPI can in any way, shape or form force the opposition to come out with a straight-out different kind of migration policy, we and the Australian people would benefit greatly. (Timeexpired)

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (16:55):  Can I make it clear that Senator Hanson's MPI makes a claim that is patently untrue. She of course is supported by her ideological ally, Senator Molan, in making an assertion that the opposition has failed to make public its immigration policy. Senator Molan just told us that he spent an enormous amount of time trying to find our policy. For Senator Hanson's benefit and Senator Molan's benefit, may I draw to the Senate's attention the stated position of the Labor Party as outlined in our national platform? I've shown this to the Government Whip. I seek leave to table, from chapter 2, sections 79 and 92 on skilled migration, and, from chapter 9, sections 25 and 35 on multiculturalism.


Leave granted.




Senator KIM CARR:
  I know Senator Hanson is somewhat reluctant to deal with the facts. I know that she's somewhat reluctant to deal with the simple proposition that these are documents that have been on the public record for many, many years. But she could have consulted the positions put forward by our shadow minister on immigration, Mr Neumann, or by many, many other Labor spokespeople on these questions. Of course, these would be statements that would be able to inform, to educate, to enlighten—which is the last thing that Senator Hanson or Senator Molan would want to do. They're in the business of propagating ignorance, of propagating division and of propagating the most extraordinary disunity in this country. They're in the business of making sure that people peddle ignorance about what this country is and what has been the great strength of this country throughout the 20th century. It's only too easy to insinuate that somehow or other there are people here in this country who are illegitimate and to insinuate that people are in this country inappropriately when the facts are so different. It is too easy to peddle fear, to peddle xenophobia and to peddle misinformation.


The truth of the matter is simply this: the enormous prosperity and the rich social diversity of this country have been created because we have constructed a country which is unique throughout the world in building social cohesion, in building tolerance and in building aspirations for people throughout the world to be attracted to this country and to seek a better life in this country. And what's the benefit to this country? It's been the incredible wealth and prosperity of this nation. We know that we are a self-confident and proud nation because of the contribution of over 7½ million migrants since the Second World War.


One of the great achievements of Labor governments—under the foundations laid by John Curtin, under Ben Chifley, with the postwar reconstruction work, and under Arthur Calwell—was the development of a mass immigration program. We took people from all over the world and, as a consequence, this nation is so much the better for it. We are a country that should be proud of our achievements. We reinforced that great achievement with the Whitlam government, which ended the White Australia policy. And we have been stronger in our commitment to immigration throughout successive Labor governments.


I might add that this used to be a position that enjoyed a high level of bipartisanship in this country. I make the point that, in my state, which is now the fastest growing part of the country, we have seen the enormous prosperity that is as a result of that population growth. In Victoria, we are now seeing the state moving forward to the point where I understand that something like 40 per cent of Melbourne's population was born overseas. We have diversity in terms of our geographical spread, which demonstrates the capacity of our country to absorb people from all different walks of life and for them to work closely together to enjoy the prosperity that they bring to each other. This approach has been as a result of ensuring that we have proper regulation of our labour market programs, that we enjoy the proper protection of the law and that we enjoy a tolerant and compassionate approach to our social welfare programs, to our health programs and to our education programs. 


We have this dog whistle presented by the Right in Australian politics, saying, 'Well, of course, somehow or another these folks who might come from other parts of the world are illegitimate. They're a strain on our infrastructure,' instead of saying, 'These are the problems of politics, of resource allocation, of governments that have to make the decisions about the future of the country.' There are groups of people in this country who would like to turn Australian against Australian. It is not unique to our time. We have seen this throughout our history. We have seen it against the Irish. The first members of my family came to this country in 1817. They came as guests of the Right. They came and settled in the Hunter in New South Wales. They were the product of the Protestant ascendancy in Ireland. They were subject to the gross social inequalities that arose in the 19th century. My family have now married into a Jewish family. We know the great history of the Jewish community and how they came to this country, the circumstances under which they came and the discrimination they suffered. But we have also seen it with regard to eastern Europeans in this country—the abuse and intolerance that has been suffered by various groups from eastern Europe. Various Slavic groups were said to be undermining the national identity. We have seen this attitude against Muslims. We have seen it against Hindus. We have seen it against Sikhs. We have seen it against Buddhists. Now we are seeing it against Muslims again.


This is where it requires national leadership. It actually requires this parliament to stand up for national integrity. It requires all of us to stand firm against ignorance and intolerance. It requires this parliament to actually say no to intolerance and racial inequality. It requires us as a political system to say there are Australian values that are much bigger and much broader than any notion of trying to take advantage of one Australian being forced to work against another. That's what's so disappointing. There are sections in this country now, there are people in this country now, who are seeking to divide. Instead of dealing with the responsibilities of government and the responsibility of statecraft to ensure that the resources of this country are distributed properly and equally, we are, in fact, trying to divide, to encourage xenophobia, to encourage hatred, to encourage division and to undermine those great Australian values of equality and of a fair go. That's the tragedy of these propositions. 


So we're told, 'Well, the Labor Party doesn't have a position.' We do have a position. We stand firmly against fear and prejudice and ignorance. We stand against those who would suppress people's quest for equal rights. We demand in this country that people get a fair go and that they speak the truth when it comes to fundamental issues about race and ethnicity, about the state's responsibility, the Commonwealth's responsibility, to provide proper education and health services, proper opportunities. We certainly don't seek to undermine people's engagement in this country, whether it be through international education or whether it be about participation in this society more generally.


Senator Hanson is seeking to exploit that for very narrow political advantage. The long-term consequence is to put this country at profound disadvantage and to put the Australian people at profound disadvantage, and the politics of division inevitably comes back on those who promote it.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2018-09-12,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (17:05):  Labor's migration policy is pretty clear to me and pretty clear to the Australian Greens. I agree with a lot of what Senator Carr has just said. But, I will say to you, Mr President, that none of Senator Carr's fine words can be said to apply to the men, women and children that Labor put into offshore hellholes on Manus Island and Nauru and who have remained there for over five long years.


Right now, as we debate this, there is a suicidal girl on Nauru, a 12-year-old girl, who home affairs minister Peter Dutton is refusing permission to leave Nauru and be brought back to Australia. At 12 years old, she's tried to take her own life on multiple occasions, including by trying to set herself on fire. She is suffering post-traumatic stress disorder and a major depressive mental health condition. There is no doubt that her mental health problems have been caused because she's been locked up on Nauru for over five years, and deliberately denied hope, by the bipartisanship policy of cruelty that's held by the Labor and Liberal parties. This little girl needs treatment in Australia. Doctors are pleading for this girl's life. Thus far, their pleas and the pleas of her parents have fallen on deaf ears. Doctors say she will die unless she is removed from Nauru. This 12-year-old girl told a psychiatrist this: 'The only way to get out of here is suicide. It's better being dead than here.'


We know for a fact that immigration minister Peter Dutton could bring her here with the stroke of a pen, yet he has not done so. The fact he's not done so makes him guilty of child abuse. I'll say it again. Minister Dutton is a child abuser. He's not just guilty of abusing this 12-year-old girl but guilty of systemic child abuse over a period of years. Mark my words, if someone who was responsible for a 12-year-old child in Australia, a suicidal child, refused them proper medical care when they had the capacity to get it they would be charged with criminal offences and locked up for years. Minister Dutton is responsible for these children, and he has been since he took office as immigration minister. Decency and compassion demands that he acts, and he has consistently and repeatedly refused.


There are dozens of children on Nauru right now still suffering because of Minister Dutton's indifference, an indifference, I might add, that is mirrored by his mentor in torture, Prime Minister Scott Morrison. The hundreds of men, women and children—innocent people who've committed no offence under Australian law, who've acted entirely consistently with the refugee convention that Australia is a signatory to—have had their lives and their hopes systematically destroyed because of the zombie lock step between the ALP and the LNP on this bipartisan policy of cruelty. They've suffered for years because of decisions made in this building and in this chamber.


This cruelty, this child abuse, this systemic removal of hope, this deliberate regime of dehumanisation that we've seen cruelly cripple so many lives on Manus Island on Nauru—we've seen over 12 people die on Manus Island and Nauru; we've seen child sexual abuse; we've seen rapes; we've seen murders; we've seen the Papua New Guinean navy firing submachine guns and shotguns into people's bedrooms on Manus Island—it all has to stop. It has to stop now. We have the capacity to sort this issue out—everyone in this chamber—and those who continually refuse to do so need to take a long, long, hard look at themselves in the mirror.

 (New South Wales) (17:10):  Can I say, Senator McKim, that I do repudiate a lot of what you have to say, because, unlike you, who stand here and pontificate and come into this place and talk about—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Senator Fierravanti-Wells, direct your comments through the chair, please.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Thank you—what's happening on Nauru. Senator McKim, I've actually had the opportunity of visiting Nauru on a number of occasions. I've had the opportunity to talk to people. I've had the opportunity to see where the children go to school. I've had the opportunity to see the medical facilities. I've had the opportunity to see every part of Nauru. And I can tell you that part of the reason there is false hope on Nauru is that people like yourselves and advocates like you continually give people false hope.


The reality is, as we have made very clear—we have consistently said—that people who are subject to regional processing arrangements will not be resettled in Australia, and that will not change. But when you talk to people they say, 'Oh, but when we talk to people in Australia they tell us we just have to wait for a change.' Now, what does that change mean? That change means change of government, because it's people like you who are giving them false hope, and it's people like you who make them go into circumstances in which they have false hope. So you, Senator McKim, have to take some responsibility—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Fierravanti-Wells, direct your comments—



Senator McKim interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! A couple of things: Senator McKim, you were heard in total silence for your five-minute presentation, and I expect Senator Fierravanti-Wells to be heard in silence as well. However, Senator Fierravanti-Wells, you'll direct your comments through the chair, not directly at Senator McKim. Is that clear? Continue please.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. So, I have seen, for myself, firsthand. I have talked to people firsthand in Nauru. That's why I can stand here and say what I am saying today, that people like Senator McKim are giving people false hope. So, Senator McKim and those advocates like him have to bear some of the responsibility. Indeed, they have to bear most of the responsibility in this situation.


I want to focus on a number of things. The coalition's position in relation to immigration is very clear. We put in place policies to ensure that our borders remain secure and that no more lives will be lost at sea. Operation Sovereign Borders was successful. It didn't just turn the boats back on the oceans; it also disrupted the people-smuggling activities across our region, which resulted from those opposite losing control of our borders. Operation Sovereign Borders was successful in detecting, in intercepting and in stopping the boats. Australia's maritime, surveillance and response capabilities have been reinforced with expanded aerial surveillance and on-water patrols. Since Operation Sovereign Borders, 33 vessels have been intercepted at sea and 827 people returned to their country of departure or origin. When you look at the mess that those opposite left when they left government, their Greens-Labor alliance was responsible for a policy that resulted in deaths at sea. And we stopped that.


Those opposite probably don't want to remember when we had then opposition leader Kevin Rudd. Remember those press conferences that he used to do on a Sunday morning outside church, trying to convince us that he was really conservative and basically a Howard-lite? He promised us, 'Of course we'll turn back the boats.' That's what he promised us. That's what he was quoted as saying. As soon as he became Prime Minister, those opposite, Labor and their Greens alliance partners, changed their policy immediately. They completely dismantled the framework of the Howard government years. They changed program after program after program. They dismantled what we had done. And that is what they will do if they get into power again. They effectively dismantled that whole Howard-era framework.


So what then happened during the years that they were in government? Of course, they lost control of our borders. Therefore, in the end, we saw record numbers of people arriving on boats. Over 50,000 people arrived on over 800 boats. As I said, we had over 1,200 deaths at sea—and that's all that we know of. Under those opposite, there were over 8,000 children detained in immigration detention.


At the height of the policy failures of those opposite, in July 2013, there were over 10,000 people in detention, almost 2,000 of whom were children. Did we hear people like Senator McKim jumping up and down and complaining about that? No! Where were the complaints? Where were the shouts of complaint from the Greens? No, we didn't hear anything.


What we also saw happen was a $16 billion border-protection budget blowout. Under the Gillard government, three-quarters of a billion dollars was diverted from our overseas development assistance budget to pay for Labor's border protection blowouts, making the Gillard government the third-largest recipient of its own Australian overseas development program. The Labor government twice took $375 million from overseas development assistance funding and spent it on asylum-seeker detention in Australia. They let people smugglers have greater control, effectively, over our overseas development assistance budget than their own government.


What did this mean? This meant that overseas development assistance was cut to 25 developing countries, including very small island countries like Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands in the Pacific. Today we had Senator Di Natale going on about issues pertinent to the Pacific. Well, they weren't complaining when Labor was cutting overseas development assistance to the Pacific at that time.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Yes we were!




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Well, I didn't hear you very loudly—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, we didn't hear Senator McKim very loudly on that point. Of course, as we know, we have stopped the boats and stopped the deaths at sea. What is also very important in terms of our dealing with issues pertinent to immigration is the fact that it's important that we also stabilise situations to support people to remain in countries of first asylum and not take the perilous journeys in the first place. For example, in my former portfolio, we committed funding of $220 million over three years to ensure that our humanitarian partners could better support refugees and internally displaced communities as a result of the Syria conflict. Funding has been announced in recent times in relation to humanitarian and stabilisation assistance in Iraq.


From my experience with refugee resettlement and then in international development, I think that it is far, far better for us to be supporting people to remain close to their home country than uprooting them and bringing them thousands of kilometres away. I think, in the end, that is ultimately the best situation—that is, to assist people to go back to their country of origin when those countries are stabilised, because, I think, ultimately, it is not only what refugees themselves want; it is the most cost-effective solution for them and, obviously, for the Australian public.


As I said, this is an important debate to be had, because what is clear and what history has clearly shown us is what those opposite, the Labor-Greens alliance, would do—as, has been clearly said before, Labor owe their time in parliament to Greens preferences. Ultimately, what we will see, if those opposite have any opportunity to go back to the Treasury benches, is a dismantling, yet again, of the coalition's effective border protection policies.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (17:21):  This matter of public importance today is nothing but a shallow political attempt to mask over the attempts of the government to create fear and division in the Australian community for their political advantage. What is Senator Hanson's motivation in putting up this motion? Well, it's pretty clear to me. She might as well join the coalition. Is it part of one of the deals that she's cut with the government to secure her vote for legislation? Well, perhaps I think so. I would call on Senator Hanson, through you, Acting Deputy President Williams, to be more focused on this muppet show of a government rather than on Labor. Our approach to immigration is very clear. We have a very clear policy on asylum seekers, on people trafficking and on immigration. What we have coming from the other side, from the government, is nothing more than bubbles of populism and no real plan for our nation to manage these issues.


We all know that Australia is a country built on migration. We are rightfully very proud of all those who have come to Australia by choice. Some 7.5 million migrants since World War II have helped build the strong, vibrant and multicultural society that we all enjoy today. A recent poll found the majority of Australians, some 54 per cent, say Australia's openness to people from all over the world is essential to who we are as a nation. Australia's permanent migration is capped at some 190,000 people per year. There are real problems in our nation when it comes to infrastructure, energy and communications, but it is not migrants and immigration policy that are to blame for these issues. It is the failure of the government to properly invest in our cities and communities and to manage these issues.


In the upcoming federal election, one of the issues that's going to be front and centre is the fact that we have congestion and cities bursting at the seams. We have people with very long commutes. We have growing urban communities in new suburbs where we've got suburban corridors popping up without the infrastructure and community services that they need to thrive and survive as communities—without the planning for job creation, without the planning for their commute and without the appropriate investment in health, education and community services to meet their demands as a community.


So if Senator Hanson wants someone to blame she need look no further than the Morrison Liberal government, the same government Senator Hanson sides with some 90 per cent of the time that she votes in this chamber. These aren't the problems of migrants. These are problems that fall very squarely at the feet of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government. Their internal chaos is exacerbating these issues on the ground for the Australian people. You can see that in the energy debate. You can see that in our climate change debate. You can see that in the chaos they have created in our education investment debate. You can see that in cuts to Medicare and to our hospitals. You can also very much see that in the stagnant wages of Australians, unaffordable housing and clogged infrastructure.


We need policies to tackle housing affordability, build infrastructure in our cities and ensure that local workers get the first shot at local jobs. But what we have coming from those opposite is all talk and no action on any of these deep policy issues. We should be calling on the Prime Minister to release any migration or population policy in full rather than spruiking the half-baked ideas that have been coming out of his mouth in an attempt to appease his own internal divisions. We on this side believe that reforms to Australia's migration program should improve its integrity and make the visa system easier to understand. When the Liberals actually announce a policy, we will want to take that policy through our processes in the usual way to ensure proper scrutiny.


But what we have coming from the other side are, in fact, new reports showing that the Liberal government are issuing temporary work visas for occupations they'd previously slashed from the skilled occupation list. Seven hundred visas were granted for jobs that had been previously axed from the 457 program but then slipped back onto the list just six months after their highly publicised cut. What more proof do we need that the Liberals have botched their changes to temporary skilled migration and that they cannot be trusted with Australian jobs? What we have before us is a scandal. The Liberals refuse to address the growing number of people from overseas being given temporary work visas at the same time as slashing funding to our TAFE and further education sector. Their immigration policies are putting Australian workers at the back of the jobs queue. Too many Australians under this government are being put at the back of the jobs queue. The government are doing this by doing things like cracking down on 457 visas without consulting affected stakeholders. The subsequent changes and revisions to the skilled occupation list has sent waves of uncertainty and resulted in subsequent revisions to the skilled occupation list. This has meant the business, innovation and education sectors have all unfortunately been affected. This is how the government manage their migration policies.


There were reports of the Minister for Home Affairs' own departmental officials describing their minister's skilled migration changes as a dog's breakfast. When I look at Australia's immigration policy, I've seen who's in charge. I've been chairing the inquiry into Minister Dutton's dealings with au pairs. I've been looking at the issue of who is treated fairly and who is not treated fairly in the ministerial intervention process. I can say that there are thousands of people who request from the minister a ministerial intervention based on meeting the guidelines for compassionate grounds and who it is in the public interest of Australia to accept and he does not even open a file to look at their cases. But when it comes to taking a phone call through his office from a mate, who is a donor to the Liberal Party, that's the kind of immigration policy that we have in Australia today. That is what has motivated this government's approach to these issues.


Let's be clear here this afternoon, migrants contribute to our shared history of our nation, our way of life and our economy. Senator Hanson, just like the Liberals, is more focused on Labor than she is on the issues affecting the Australian people. I call on Senator Hanson to seek to blame the out of touch Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, who is more focused on his own job rather than helping everyday Australians.

Senator STORER
 (South Australia) (17:31):  I could not disagree more strongly with Senator Hanson. I'm not afraid to note publicly that Australia's population grew by four million to 24.4 million in the 11 years to 2016, and that 62 per cent of that growth was from overseas migration—as she challenged us in this place. More than that, I'm not afraid to say that Australia is a beacon of multiculturalism by global standards.


Immigration has proved a benefit to the prosperity of the nation and the wellbeing of its citizens. On that score, the data backs me up. Nor am I afraid to say that far from being a drain on our resources, many migrants with limited or no English have made significant contributions to the nation. Just look at the figures. A report commissioned by Treasury and the Department of Home Affairs found, for example, that in 2014-15 skilled migrants would make a lifetime net contribution to the budget of $6.9 billion. The report found that migration cushioned Australia from the shocks of the global financial crisis and that the current migration program would add up to one per cent to annual GDP growth between 2020 and 2050.


My home state of South Australia has suffered for years from a one-size-fits-all immigration policy. South Australia needs more people to ensure the future prosperity of the state and the wellbeing of its citizens. South Australia should not suffer, because poor planning has led to population pressures in Sydney and Melbourne.


A couple of years ago the Turnbull government tightened the terms of working visas. As a result, a South Australian Centre for Economic Studies report concluded that South Australian employers, particularly in regional areas, were not able to access employees with the skills that they require. At a time when the number of skilled visas issued for South Australia has dropped by nearly 25 per cent in just three years, I agree with Business SA that our state needs special status to attract workers to areas with staff shortages, and there is overwhelming community support. A Property Council survey found that 95 per cent of respondents in South Australia agreed.


I applaud efforts by the South Australian government to convince the Commonwealth to fast-track migrant applications for my home state. As a former Prime Minister used to say, Australia is the greatest multicultural nation on earth and so it should remain.

Senator ANNING
 (Queensland) (17:33):  There is no more vital question confronting the nation than the immigration problem. Who we allow to come to this country, their ethnicity, their culture, what language they speak and what they believe will define the nation that we will be in the future. What is not generally understood is that if our immigration program does not at least mirror current society then we will be an entirely different society in years to come. Yet, incredibly, neither previous Labor government policy nor current Liberal government policy appears to recognise this simple fact. Thanks to bipartisan support from both the Liberals and Labor for a non-discriminatory immigration program, the ethno-religious background of migrants, the key determinant of their ability to assimilate and integrate, is being ignored.


This MPI no doubt seeks to bemoan the fact that the opposition is yet to make public its immigration policy, but I don't see that as a problem at all. Given the hopeless, nation-destroying failures of past Labor and Liberal government immigration policies, including the rorting of student and 457 visas for backdoor immigration by hundreds of thousands of Third World immigrants looking to enjoy our welfare state, the opposition not yet making public its immigration policy is a wonderful opportunity. It is an established fact that ethno-religious diversity undermines social cohesion. So, instead of having an immigration policy that divides us and drives white flight from inner Melbourne and Western Sydney, I urge the Labor Party to embrace a new immigration direction that helps to unite us as a people. It's time for a plebiscite for the Australian people to decide who comes to this country. I urge the Labor Party to adopt this as their policy. I urge the Leader of the Opposition to move beyond middle-class virtue signalling and to embrace his inner Arthur Calwell and return Labor to its former glory as a champion of the European, Christian working class.

The


speech


read


as


follows—



The Australian Government is committed to addressing family violence and improving the protections offered through the family law system to those affected by violence and abuse. The Family Law Amendment (Family Violence and Cross-examination of Parties) Bill 2018 will ensure that appropriate protections are in place for victims of family violence during cross-examination in all family law proceedings.


Family violence is a serious and widespread problem that profoundly affects individuals, families and the communities in which they live. According to a report released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in February, one in six Australian women and one in sixteen Australian men have experienced physical and/or sexual violence by a current or previous partner, and one in four women and one in six men have experienced emotional abuse by a current or previous partner.


It is reassuring that direct cross-examination of victims of family violence occurs rarely in the family law courts. Recent research conducted by the Australian Institute of Family Studies found that direct cross‑examination in final hearings where there are allegations of family violence and one or both parties are self-represented, occurred in around 173 matters over two years, between 2015 and 2017. Despite the small numbers, the Government is introducing this legislation as a further demonstration of its commitment to protecting families affected by family violence. 



Background



This Bill implements the October 2016 recommendation of the Council of Australian Governments that perpetrators of family violence should be banned from directly cross-examining their victims in any family law or family violence proceedings. 


The Bill also responds directly to recommendations in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs 2017 report, Abetterfamilylawsystemtosupportandprotectthoseaffectedbyfamilyviolence, by introducing legislative amendments to ensure that victims of family violence are protected from being directly cross-examined by their alleged perpetrators. These amendments apply equally to parenting and property proceedings, thereby ensuring that appropriate safeguards for victims of family violence are applied in all types of family law proceedings. 




Key


objectives



The direct cross-examination of a victim of family violence by their alleged perpetrator can expose the victim to re-traumatisation and affect their ability to give clear and cogent evidence. The power dynamics underlying family violence can also make it difficult for victims to effectively cross-examine their alleged perpetrator.


Victims of family violence also cite the fear of being cross-examined directly by their alleged perpetrator as a significant factor in deciding to settle a matter, often on terms they consider to be unfavourable. This can place victims and children at increased risk of harm. 




Measures


in


the


Bill



The Bill will amend the Family Law Act to prohibit direct cross‑examination where there is an allegation of family violence between the parties to the proceeding, and:


either party has been convicted of, or is charged with, an offence involving violence, or a threat of violence, to the other party, or


a family violence order (other than an interim order) applies to both parties, or


an injunction under section 68B or 114 of the Family Law Act for the personal protection of either party is directed against the other party.


This automatic ban provides certainty for victims in these circumstances that they will not be directly cross-examined by their abuser.


Where the circumstances do not apply, the court retains discretion to make an order that direct cross-examination is prohibited in any proceeding where an allegation of family violence has been made.


Where direct cross‑examination is prohibited, the Bill requires that cross‑examination must be conducted by a legal representative.


In circumstances where allegations of family violence have been raised, but direct cross‑examination is not prohibited, the Bill requires that the court apply other appropriate protections. For example, the victim might appear via video-link from a safe room, or support persons or screens might be used. 


It is important to note that the measures in the Bill apply to both parties. That is, where the prohibition applies, a party's legal representative must undertake the cross-examination on their behalf, regardless of whether that party is the perpetrator or the victim. This ensures that the victim is given appropriate protection and support both when cross-examining the alleged perpetrator and when being cross-examined by the alleged perpetrator. 


This will help to ensure the provision of more cogent and reliable evidence to the court. It will strengthen the court's ability to protect victims of family violence and make decisions in the best interests of their children.




Legal


representation





As I've said, where the ban applies, parties will be required to engage a legal representative to conduct the cross-examination. It is intended that a party would obtain their own legal representation where possible, and that legal aid would be available where a party is unable to obtain private representation.


The Government is working with the family law courts and legal aid to determine appropriate processes and funding implications. These will be in place prior to the provisions being applied to matters before the courts. 




Procedural


fairness





The Government understands the importance of balancing the need to protect victims of family violence with the need to ensure procedural fairness for all parties in family law proceedings. Cross-examination is an important part of family law proceedings, allowing the evidence of each party to be tested, and assisting the court to make its findings. It is my view that this Bill strikes the right balance between protection and fairness. 




Review


of


the


provisions





Given the important role that cross-examination plays in testing evidence, and the aim of the amendments to reduce trauma to victims of family violence in family law proceedings, the Government proposes to comprehensively review the operation of the proposed amendments after the second anniversary of the legislation commencing.




Commencement


and


application


of


the


provisions





The Bill includes a maximum three month commencement delay, to ensure the family law courts can put appropriate procedural mechanisms in place. The amendments will then apply to cross‑examinations that occur six months after commencement, to ensure parties can obtain legal representation in time, and prevent any unnecessary delays to their court proceedings. 




Conclusion



This Bill will improve the justice system's ability to support vulnerable witnesses by requiring the use of appropriate protections in all family law proceedings where there is family violence. It is another example of this Government's continuing commitment to addressing domestic violence in Australia and to ensuring that the family law system protects victims of family violence.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (17:41):  I move:


That items 1 and 2 of Schedule 1 of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment (Hammerhead Shark) Regulations 2018, made under the GreatBarrierReefMarineParkAct1975, be disallowed [F2018L00191].


I find myself for the second time this month rising in the Senate to talk about marine protected areas in this country and about the need to take the strongest possible action around the conservation of our species, especially species that are listed as endangered or have conservation dependent listings. 


Only three weeks ago, sadly, this Senate passed this government's marine parks plan that halved green zones on the water protections that were put in place in 2012, by a Labor-Green government, after decades of hard work by thousands of Australians. We saw that shameful outcome. It's really got me in the gut that I've seen this happen in my time as a senator. I was involved in putting together marine protected areas well over a decade ago, before I became a senator, and to see that outcome in my time as a senator was very difficult for me. 


I find a situation has arisen where a scalloped hammerhead shark has recently been given a conservation dependent endangered listing in this country. A situation has arisen where laws are being changed by this government to allow a shark, another species that's endangered, to be fished. Not only is it an endangered species, but they want to change the laws to allow it to be fished in a marine protected area. You couldn't make this stuff up, seriously. If you can't protect an endangered species in a marine protected area, what can you do in this country? In a minute I will get to the reasons I think this is happening. 


I'll give the Senate a bit of background. I thank the great work of HSI and other environmental groups through their continual chipping away to get this species listed as endangered in this country. It's been listed overseas as endangered for some time, but thanks to our powerful fishing industry and their vested interests that have their way in this place we've only now managed to get it listed in Australia. We know that the population of this globally endangered scalloped hammerhead shark is rapidly declining. It's getting killed on baited drum lines, which we have around this country and which I've campaigned very hard for in my time as a senator to see removed, and this is only one of the many woes that this creature has. It's highly sought after in Asia for shark fin soup and its numbers have declined by up to 80 per cent in North Queensland, since the 1960s, largely due to commercial fishing. 


So let me make this statement and make it very clear: commercial fishing is the major threat facing the endangered scalloped hammerhead shark, and we are debating a disallowance motion to prevent the government actually reducing protections on the hammerhead shark. We are debating my disallowance motion, the Greens disallowance motion, to give the hammerhead shark added protection in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park—a marine park that I hope this whole country is behind and proud of.


This shark is also caught in recreation and commercial fisheries in gillnets and trawl nets, and as bycatch in the Queensland Shark Control Program. We had high hopes that it would get full endangered listing and therefore wouldn't be available to be caught. However, the Threatened Species Scientific Committee gave it a conservation dependent listing, which means it doesn't receive special protection from commercial fishing, except under active management plans at a state level and except in marine parks, like the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, where it does receive special protections because of the way the legislation is set up. But our previous environment minister, Mr Frydenberg, tabled the regulations we have before us today to remove the protection of this endangered scalloped hammerhead shark in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. What is the point of having marine protected areas if the government decides that, for a few commercial interests—and I understand it's only a few commercial fishing interests—they will change the law every time it suits their vested interests?


Why is this important? Well, we know our oceans face their greatest threat in history. We know our oceans right around the world have been plundered. We know that we're seeing up to 90 per cent of global fisheries either overfished or fully exploited. We've seen recently in this country scientists release peer reviewed reports in science journals that show the biomass of large pelagic fish in Australia has declined by 30 per cent, even under our fisheries management in the last 10 years. We've seen 1,400 scientists come out in support of the disallowance motion in this Senate, saying, 'Give our marine environment added protections.' We've seen a number of well-respected scientists come out and talk about the hammerhead shark, which we're discussing today, including James Cook University's Professor Colin Simpfendorfer, who I was pleased came to my Senator inquiry into warming oceans when I went to Northern Queensland.


We have a number of scientists who are openly saying that commercial fishing is the key threat to the hammerhead shark and that their populations have declined in Northern Queensland by up to 83 per cent since fishing. We've seen HSI, a group that I've worked with closely around shark nets and baited drum line programs, talk about the documentation we have before us, which, sadly, is very poor, around hammerhead shark catches and scalloped hammerhead shark catches. We know that 14,000 scallop hammerhead sharks have been reported as being killed in the Queensland Shark Control Program because of drum lines or shark nets. These sharks have very small mouths and very small teeth, and, as far as I'm aware, they aren't responsible for any attacks on human beings, yet they continue to be killed by nets and drum lines in places like the Great Barrier Reef. But that's an argument for another time; that's certainly a fight for another time. If the Senate disallows regulation 69 of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Regulations 1983 today, then we will see an impact on fishing in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park for the scalloped hammerhead shark.


I've spoken to the crossbench to try to get their support for this disallowance motion. I've sought legal advice. I've had the Parliamentary Library do research. I've spoken to scientists—and Senator Patrick, no doubt, will speak on his issues around this disallowance—and my understanding is that the hammerhead shark is also very vulnerable to bycatch, especially in gillnets. There are some statistics, although, as I mentioned earlier, the dataset is very poor. The Parliamentary Library, who went to all available sources, said that essentially the dataset is useless to work with. We don't really know. We do know that there's a large number of discards of hammerhead sharks. For every four hammerhead sharks that are caught, only one is kept; the others are discarded. I want to make this very clear to Senator Patrick: those discards are not bycatch; they are deliberate discards by fishermen.


I've spoken to stakeholders about why those sharks would be discarded, and their view is that the market for these sharks has declined significantly over time as the public has become more aware of the fact that these species increasingly are endangered and are listed globally as endangered species, and their consumption has been going down. So you can't say that for every one shark that's kept you're going to get four thrown in the water as bycatch. They are deliberate decisions and, I suspect, they are part of the shark finning market, which we know is highly targeted at the scalloped hammerhead shark. Some new regulations have been brought in by the Queensland government.


The implication of letting this disallowance go ahead and making it very difficult for the two commercial fishing operators to continue to catch scalloped hammerhead sharks is that they can't go outside the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to catch their excess quota, because their catch is limited outside the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park under these new rules and regulations. There is a potential side effect, and I acknowledge that they may decide to catch other hammerhead sharks in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, rather than the scalloped hammerhead shark. That is a potential side effect, and there may be some bycatch associated with that, but that's exactly what we want: we want less targeted fishing of hammerhead sharks and more targeted fishing of other species. That's actually what we're trying to achieve here.


It's also very unclear how bycatch of scalloped hammerhead sharks could be avoided if other hammerheads are caught. We know that as a fact. But there is no data at all about bycatch of scalloped hammerhead sharks or even other hammerhead sharks. We also know that enforcement and reporting are going to be a very important part of this disallowance if it gets up. It's going to be very important that we have robust reporting and enforcement regimes in place to make sure that we see the conservation of this endangered species.


So I'd like to pose the question that I raised earlier: why is the government introducing these regulations that I'm trying to disallow and that I hope the Senate disallows? Well, there are two commercial fishing interests left operating in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority area, under the authority's jurisdiction, that are using gillnets to target sharks. Environment groups, to their credit, have worked very closely with other fishers and have raised the money to buy out that fishing effort. Of course we would like to see an outcome whereby the existing fishers get bought out. I understand that they're amenable to that. I applaud the environment groups for thinking about the fishers and their communities and going to the extent that they have to get a win-win for both the fishing industry and conservation of these species. I understand that Senator Patrick has had some discussions with government about getting them to do this, and I look forward to hearing shortly about how successful that has been. That would be the ultimate outcome here: conserve a species in a marine protected area and get those fishers bought out, especially if they're amenable to a buyout. Certainly other fishing interests have been, because the environment groups have been able to raise the money to go ahead and do that.


Why is the government pushing ahead with this? If you believe its technical explanation, it's to get consistency of regulation across areas and to conform with Queensland state government regulations. To get consistency across areas—what does that mean?


The whole reason we have marine protected areas, the whole reason we set up the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, a marine protected area—the whole reason we went to those lengths—was to have a different set of rules and regulations for areas of high conservation value. That is why we have a marine park at the Great Barrier Reef, and that is why we have set up marine parks in other parts of this country. Obviously this government has acknowledged the need for those marine parks; however, it's extremely disappointing that, because they're representing a few commercial fishing interests in this place, they've halved those green zones right around this country, which has been a devastating outcome for the conservation movement. 


I hope that Labor, when they get elected, if they get into government—and I've had discussions with them and I've heard them say it publicly—will upgrade marine protected areas in this country. That's certainly something that I and thousands of other Australians are going to continue to work towards. But, at this time, it is so highly symbolic. The hammerhead shark is an endangered species everywhere around the planet. It has only just got a listing in Australia, and we're contemplating a new set of regulations to actually reduce protections for this endangered species in a marine protected area. You honestly couldn't make this stuff up. That's what this government are doing. That's what this is. There's nothing you can say about the fact that there needs to be consistency of regulations across areas. Seriously, this is what marine parks are set up to do: they're set up to provide conservation outcomes. They're set up to protect species, especially endangered species. 




Senator Colbeck:
  They're not fisheries management tools.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I'll take that interjection, Senator Colbeck. You can argue, back and forth, about whether they're fisheries management tools. You don't happen to believe that, but I would ask—



Senator Colbeck interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Order on my right!




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  why the government are trying to do this? Do you believe that it's because, somehow, they want consistency of regulations—



Senator Colbeck interjecting—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  This is a really important point that you might want to listen to, Senator Colbeck—or is it because the fishing industry and the fishers who are fishing in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park have been in this place, lobbying crossbenchers in recent days and recent weeks, saying that if this disallowance gets up it will devastate their industry and livelihood? That flies in the face of your saying this is not about fisheries management. This is exactly what this is about. This regulation is designed to help the fishing industry. So, that's fine. That's what the Liberal Party do. They're here to represent a few interests.



Senator Colbeck interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order on my right!




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I represent the tens of thousands of Australians who want to see integrity in our marine protected areas, who want to see a species extinction crisis in this country avoided. I represent the tens of thousands of Australians—in fact, the hundreds of thousands of Australians; there's nearly half a million on some lists amongst conservation groups—who care about marine protections, and this is something they are watching very closely. Do not sacrifice the integrity of a marine protected area and an endangered species for the interests of a few fishermen. We can actually make a stand here and send a very strong message that we do care about marine protected areas and we do care about conservation outcomes. If we look after our oceans, we will get spill-over effects from marine protected areas. We will get recovery in stocks and biomass. The evidence is clear. 




Senator Colbeck:
  No, it's not.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  It is. Professor Graham Edgar recently released a report, which has been published in Science—and I know it has been disputed by Senator Colbeck and other cronies in the fishing industry because it doesn't fit their mantra about the best managed fisheries in the world—that clearly says one-third of the biomass of large pelagic fish has been lost in the last ten years under this government's fisheries management. We know the culture in AFMA, from the Borthwick review. It doesn't look at the ecosystem impacts of fisheries. We have worked really hard to try and get this system changed over the years. 


I know that Professor Edgar, who released this report, has been attacked, by people in the fishing industry and vested interests, for speaking out. He showed very clearly in his study, through observations and modelling—not the pie in the sky stuff that Senator Colbeck represents—through actually physically measuring changes in species, that you can't ignore the loss of our marine species, especially our targeted commercial species, in these areas. His study showed that marine protected areas were the only places where we didn't get big losses in biomass—that they work.


Fourteen hundred scientists, who might disagree with a couple of Senator Colbeck's fishery scientists, came out and made a public statement about the disallowance. Those 1,400 scientists said very clearly: the evidence is in; marine protected areas work. So why make changes to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park for one species of endangered shark? Why go to the length of setting that precedent? That's why we have marine parks. That's why we have a process to get sharks like the scalloped hammerhead shark on an endangered species list. It will be a very bad precedent if these regulations get up. This is the fishing industry, the special interests in this place in the ear of the minister, getting what they want. It will not be a good outcome for them, in the end, if this species continues to decline in numbers, as everything suggests it will, and it will not be a good outcome for the Barrier Reef ecosystem. In fact, no-one's going to win if we keep going down this road. Let's make a stand today. Let's stand up for the Great Barrier Reef. Let's stand up for the scalloped hammerhead shark and the powerful example this sets for other marine species that are under pressure. It's hard enough as it is getting something listed in this country, without having to deal with the kind of crap we've got in front of us today.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:01):  If it comes to a question of who to believe in these issues, Greenpeace and Senator Whish-Wilson or the Threatened Species Scientific Committee, I will always go with the scientific committee. I've seen the Greens political party in action before. In fact, I remember a Senate committee that Senator Whish-Wilson chaired. After wanting to go for a taxpayer-funded snorkelling trip to the Barrier Reef, he called the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, who, contrary to the allegations of the Greens political party gave evidence every day, inconveniently for the Greens, that actually the waters in the northern Great Barrier Reef were one degree cooler than they had been the previous year.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  What a stunning revelation!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  It's the evidence given to a committee that you chaired, Senator Whish-Wilson. But of course you don't like it because it is an inconvenient truth. Don't worry about the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority; we will take the view of a politician, Senator Whish-Wilson.


I once employed, when I was the environment parliamentary secretary, a very able and committed young environmentalist who had previously worked for Greenpeace. I said, in conversation with her once, 'Why did you leave Greenpeace?' She said, 'I could not stand the lies and misrepresentation that these green groups put out.' That was because they worked on the basis that the means justifies the end. They'd just make up any story, any story at all, as long as it would attract a headline on the ABC, which is pretty easy to do. It didn't matter how inaccurate it was. That was the approach of Greenpeace and, from what I've seen through long experience in this chamber, it's the approach of the Greens political party as well.


The Threatened Species Scientific Committee found that the scalloped hammerhead shark could be eligible for the endangered list, but its clear recommendation was for Minister Frydenberg to list the species in the conservation dependent category, as that would provide the best outcome for the survival of this species. That was the recommendation of that scientific committee, but it doesn't accord with Senator Whish-Wilson's jaundiced view on this and other matters. Why did they recommend that? Because strong management actions agreed with the Northern Territory and Queensland governments for the species' protection and recovery could be implemented under law, including within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. That includes limiting the total annual catch of scalloped hammerhead to 200 tonnes or less. The committee said:


… management actions will remain in place while the species remains listed as Conservation Dependent.


It also said significantly improved monitoring and reporting would facilitate knowledge of the rates of recovery for the species and underpin the management reforms and future reviews of conservation dependent listing. That's the recommendation of the scientists, but Senator Whish-Wilson and his crazy mates from the Greens political party don't like the scientific evidence, so they make up their own.


I would have liked to have contributed a full 20 minutes on this, but I'm aware there are a lot of senators who would like to make a contribution. So, unlike Senator Whish-Wilson, I won't take the full 20 minutes. I'll attempt to leave some time for other senators who want to make a contribution. But, before I do allow colleagues to speak, by curtailing my remarks, I just want to read a couple of excerpts from a couple of pieces of correspondence which I've had from constituents of mine in Queensland. One's from David Caracciolo from Mackay Reef Fish Supplies, and I suspect many other senators have got this letter. He says: 'To all senators, I'm writing to make you aware of the false allegations by some green groups who are trying—and succeeding—to see the demise of all commercial fishing activity in Australian waters.' As a former fisheries minister, I happen to know that that is true. The Greens would like nothing more than to shut down all forestry and to shut down all fishing within Australian waters.




Senator Canavan:
  They still eat fish.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Yes, they still eat fish! So we could use imported fish from sources that are sometimes questionable—that's what the Greens want. But fortunately the majority in this place don't agree with them. This letter from Mr Caracciolo, who is a well-regarded, well-respected person in the Mackay area, says: 'The latest allegations are that the scalloped hammerhead shark is near extinction in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. These allegations are totally incorrect. The commercial sector does not target this species, so the managers will not see big catches reported in logs, but we do catch some when we are targeting other species that are incidental catches.' He goes on with some very compelling arguments which I don't have time to read in full, but I will come to the paragraph that is important to me as a representative of Queensland constituents. He says: 'There are lots of associated businesses along these coastal towns of Queensland that rely on these producers for supply of fresh seafood to sell to consumers who cannot catch their own fish and our tourists who come to these regions. I do hope this does not fall on deaf ears and you can see how wrong these motions are. There are a lot of livelihoods that you guys are holding in your decisions.' That's a sentiment that I think is mirrored by most people, not just those in the fishing industry, along the coast of Queensland who I represent.


The other letter I just want to very briefly mention is from Margaret Stevenson from Burnett Heads near Bundaberg in Queensland. She's the wife of a commercial fisherman. She's been involved in fisheries issues for 20 years. She was on the Queensland shark working group and is currently on the Queensland government's East Coast Inshore Fishery Working Group. She says: 'Whilst the hammerhead shark is supposed to be under threat in some parts of the world, when I was on the shark working committee we were told that the entire Australian take of these sharks is approximately one per cent of the world's take.' So clearly—and I say this with irony—this is a fish that is under threat! She goes on to say: 'They are extremely common in Queensland waters. In recent years our Queensland government has taken steps to control and reduce the commercial take to ensure that it does not increase in order to prevent our Queensland catch, less than one per cent of the world's take, impacting on world stocks.' Mrs Stevenson goes on to mention the importance of the fishing industry to a lot of communities along the Queensland coast and to the consumers of seafood who like to eat Australian seafood, rather than imported seafood. The science is with the way this government has dealt with matters. Clearly, there is no danger to the species whatsoever. It's properly managed. And this disallowance motion should be defeated.


Can I just conclude by making reference again to this book I've often referred to, a book put out by a lot of the mature, sensible conservation groups, entitled ABigBlueLegacy:theLiberalNationalTraditionofMarineConservation. I like to wave this around. Senator Whish-Wilson and the Greens hate it, because this book clearly demonstrates that the only political parties that have ever done anything for marine conservation in Australia are not the Greens or the Labor Party but the Liberal-National party coalition, and we will continue to do that.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-09-12,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (18:10):  Tonight this disallowance motion is one that Labor supports. It is against the proposed amendments to change the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act regulations to allow fishing for the scalloped hammerhead. We know that these are internationally recognised as endangered and under threat from fishing activity. We know that this issue before us today, in terms of the disallowance, should be supported because this government hasn't taken the time to find a solution that works for the fishing industry or, frankly, for the protection of a World Heritage area and this protected species.


We know that the marine park act applies stricter conditions to the fishing for species listed in any category of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, the list of threatened fauna, than applies in other areas managed by Australian governments. This is important to note because we expect a high standard of protection within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park—this act predates the EPBC Act—and because of the reef's conservation value and subsequent World Heritage protections. This is important to note because, again, it goes to the onus on us in the parliament to make sure that the reef and the species within it have the necessary protection they need. So we know that under this act targeted fishing for any species listed under any category in the EPBC Act of threatened fauna is simply not allowed. This is different to the EPBC Act itself, which allows for conservation dependent species to be fished within the provision of a management plan.


We know that in 2018 the Threatened Species Scientific Committee confirmed that scalloped hammerheads met the criteria for listing as endangered, but advised the Minister for the Environment to list them as conservation dependent under the EPBC Act, which allows fishing to continue in some waters. We know that the scientific committee required certain improvements to management of the species in order to support the listing category from jurisdictions around the country. They did not recommend amending the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park regulations to allow for targeted fishing of scalloped hammerhead sharks to continue in the marine park. The Threatened Species Scientific Committee did not recommend that. What they did recommend was a revision of the total allowable commercial catch limits for hammerheads, and that these limits should include discarded shark and catch by the Queensland Shark Control Program. They also recommended the landing of hammerhead sharks with fins naturally attached. The Threatened Species Scientific Committee considered this a critical element within management arrangements to maintain a conservation dependent listing. The absence of this policy, they said, could lead to a review of the listing category and a possible up-listing of this species to endangered.


So we have before us tonight in this disallowance a recognition that the federal government has failed in its responsibility to address fishery issues outlined in the GreatBarrierReefoutlookreport of 2014, where the targeting of top predators such as sharks is identified as a critical risk to the health of the reef. The Minister for the Environment has tabled amendments to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act regulations that would allow for the fishing of the scalloped hammerhead species within the marine park, despite its conservation dependent listing. So the motion before us tonight, which Labor supports, is against the proposed amendments to change the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act regulations to allow for the fishing of the scalloped hammerhead. They are, in fact, internationally recognised as endangered and under threat from fishing activity.


Despite the protestations from those opposite, we have received advice that says the numbers of scalloped hammerheads have declined by between 63 per cent and 80 per cent within the reef. They are more at risk of extinction than lions, cheetahs, polar bears and giant pandas. We support this disallowance motion because the government has not taken the time to find a solution that works for the fishing industry or for the adequate protection of a World Heritage area. This government simply wants to change the rules in our most precious of places—the Great Barrier Reef. They, tonight, want to weaken environmental protections. I stress: this is a World Heritage area of great value to Australia and also to the world.


Extractive industries are and should be subject to the very strictest of rules in World Heritage areas, and the Great Barrier Reef should be treated no differently. We know that the reef is under enormous pressure from this government, and this is all happening at a time when it wants to weaken regulations to allow an endangered species to be killed—not accidentally caught by a fisher and reported as something to be concerned about but sold on the market if caught. We understand on this side that sustainable fishing jobs are important. We want jobs in the reef to remain, but we will not compromise on standards that have been in place since the marine park was first established. Shark sightings of this very species are highly valuable to the tourism operators on the Great Barrier Reef. Did you know that shark diving, shark tourism, is worth some $25.5 million annually to Australia's regional economy, and that this kind of tourism is growing? We accept that standards in the reef, a World Heritage area, should be and are higher than other protected areas.


The government tonight is trying to present a case that the sharks caught will simply be wasted, because they can't be sold and industry will lose an income stream. Let's be clear: if a fishery relies on catching threatened species to make money, it's just delaying the inevitable. If they rely on funds from selling that threatened species, eventually there will be none left to catch. This revenue stream is simply on an inevitable decline. We have to stop it so that we can protect the species, or the revenue stream will end because the species is simply no longer there; it will be extinct. So the government's logic simply does not add up. It has presented a case but it has not tried to find a solution that protects the World Heritage values of the reef and marine park. There are options, and the government should be pursuing them.


If the government presented Labor with a plan to transition the industry, we would be happy to discuss it. If it made an effort to protect a species in a World Heritage area and brought the industry into discussion, we would also be up for that. Reform of the fishery in which scalloped hammerhead sharks are caught is certainly an option, as it's a high-risk fishery operating in a World Heritage area. The Queensland government, which manages the fishery in which scalloped hammerheads are caught, has said that they're committed to overall reform of the Queensland fisheries, as outlined in their sustainable fisheries strategy. The fishery in which these hammerheads are caught is a priority fishery for review by the Queensland government. So we have here a Queensland government that's taking positive steps. We'd like to see the Commonwealth Morrison government do more to help. What could you do? What kinds of time frames on regulations could be a solution?


You have options available to you. But, no; instead, what you do is sell out our environment. Whenever there's an opportunity to protect the environment, you choose its destruction. Whenever there's an opportunity to protect a species and do some work to find an answer, you take the easy option and you're completely missing in action.

"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-09-12,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (18:20):  Centre Alliance will not be supporting this disallowance motion, and it does so on the basis that the likely outcome of disallowing the legislation is that we'll see more hammerhead sharks being killed than if the regulation were to stand. The threatened species scientific community has determined that hammerhead sharks should be protected. The hammerhead shark is now conservation dependent. Queensland fishery management has been adjusted accordingly.


The question is: if we let the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park be a sanctuary for hammerheads, would it stop the catching of hammerheads; would it reduce the number of hammerheads caught? I spoke to all sides of the argument. I spoke to Humane Society International. I spoke to AFMA. I spoke to scientists. I spoke to fisheries. I spoke to Senator Whish-Wilson on a couple of occasions. The first point to appreciate is that these sharks are migratory. A sanctuary doesn't actually assist them. The second point to appreciate is that the catching of the hammerhead is largely incidental to other fishing. Certainly, in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, that's the case.


When sharks are caught in gillnets that are designed to catch other fish, they often die before they make it on board the fishing vessel or shortly thereafter, and they're returned overboard. That happens because of stress to the animal. Four out of five sharks die irrespective of whether they're thrown back. So you can ban the fishing of hammerheads in marine parks, but they'll still be caught in gillnets and will still die. But, in that instance, what will happen is they won't be taken back to shore and counted. More sharks could legally be caught outside the marine park. In fact, they could be targeted in other areas of Queensland outside the marine park. With the regulations in place, those sharks are retained on board, counted in the Queensland quota and are returned to shore where the scientific data that everyone agrees is lacking is then collected. If the regulation is disallowed, the sharks will still be caught, four in five sharks will die, but they won't be included in the Queensland quota and they won't be taken back to shore to allow scientific data to be collected.


Now we accept, as Labor has put, that there are many things that could be done for the betterment of the species, but unfortunately that's not on offer here. So, just focusing on the regulation that is before the Senate, it's our considered view, after talking to all sides of the argument, that the disallowance in this circumstance would result in a worse outcome for sharks, and therefore we can't support it.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (18:23):  I have just a few points to counter some of the discussion that has been around the chamber. I say to Labor: the Queensland Labor government actually supported this process. So to suggest that Labor's actions here in Canberra are supported by the Queensland Labor government is not true. They actually supported this process because, rather than this affecting just a couple of net fishers, as Senator Whish-Wilson indicated, this would affect hundreds of net fishers all up and down the Queensland coast.


Let's not be shy about this. Senator Whish-Wilson's motion is just about stopping fishing. That's all it's about. He's not interested in good fisheries management. He misrepresents terribly. He is not interested in good fisheries management. He quotes a piece of alleged science—I think is probably better to say—which is based on people going snorkelling in inshore waters and trying to correlate that to the impacts on our Commonwealth waters outside three kilometres. This is not science. This observational science that he talks of, that he quotes in support of his argument, is not science.



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator COLBECK:
  It's not science. And he also quotes, in an attempt to frighten the Australian people about global fish stocks, a number of 90 per cent of global fisheries that are overfished or fully exploited. That is actually the number, but what he fails to say is that 'fully exploited' means 'sustainably fished'—so, a complete and utter misrepresentation; a lie, in fact—




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  In your language it might be!




Senator COLBECK:
  No; in global fisheries management language. Senator Whish-Wilson simply cannot be trusted with the truth in this argument. All he wants to do, with Mr Tony Burke—I was going to say 'from the Greens', and he might as well be—from the Labor Party, is shut down fisheries management. That's what he wants to do. He neglects to say that the reason for the listing of scalloped hammerhead sharks as a conservation dependent species under Australia's EPBC Act follows a listing on appendix 2 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, CITES. The listing was due to poor fisheries management and the result of heavy overfishing in the Atlantic Ocean. That was the reason for the listing on CITES. Senator Whish-Wilson makes no comment about that in his remarks. He wants to give the impression that there's an issue here. This process will actually manage it. This will manage the fishery sustainably, and disallowance of this regulation will do nothing to protect or recover the species in the Atlantic or other populations.


This motion is about shutting down fisheries. Senator Whish-Wilson tries to cast aspersions on the overall fish stocks in Australian waters, yet the Australian Fisheries fish stocks reports since 2013 have consistently said that not one single fish stock that is Commonwealth managed is either overfished or subject to overfishing.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  They write their own science!




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator McCarthy
):  Order!




Senator COLBECK:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, for Senator Whish-Wilson to cast those sorts of aspersions on ABARES, who do these numbers, when he is quoting a report that's effectively a compilation of a group of people going snorkelling—



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator COLBECK:
  that's effectively what it is—as observational science in inshore waters and then trying to translate that to Commonwealth waters outside three kilometres, is, quite frankly, a disgrace. ABARES is recognised globally for its work around fisheries management. This motion, as I've said a couple of times, is simply about stopping people fishing. Our marine parks are not fisheries management tools. For us to have a continued, well-managed series of fish stocks in this country, we need to use all of the tools that we have together, in concert—



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator COLBECK:
  including marine parks, Senator Whish-Wilson. In fact, the coalition's record in the context of marine parks is a proud one. We are very proud to have put in place the best marine parks and one of the largest marine parks regimes in the world. The government, obviously, won't be supporting this disallowance motion. I urge other colleagues in the chamber not to support this disallowance motion, because it won't do anything to improve the stocks of hammerhead sharks. It will reduce the access to science in support of protecting the hammerhead sharks. This motion is all about stopping people fishing—that's all.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2018-09-12,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (17:41):  I move:


That items 1 and 2 of Schedule 1 of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment (Hammerhead Shark) Regulations 2018, made under the GreatBarrierReefMarineParkAct1975, be disallowed [F2018L00191].


I find myself for the second time this month rising in the Senate to talk about marine protected areas in this country and about the need to take the strongest possible action around the conservation of our species, especially species that are listed as endangered or have conservation dependent listings. 


Only three weeks ago, sadly, this Senate passed this government's marine parks plan that halved green zones on the water protections that were put in place in 2012, by a Labor-Green government, after decades of hard work by thousands of Australians. We saw that shameful outcome. It's really got me in the gut that I've seen this happen in my time as a senator. I was involved in putting together marine protected areas well over a decade ago, before I became a senator, and to see that outcome in my time as a senator was very difficult for me. 


I find a situation has arisen where a scalloped hammerhead shark has recently been given a conservation dependent endangered listing in this country. A situation has arisen where laws are being changed by this government to allow a shark, another species that's endangered, to be fished. Not only is it an endangered species, but they want to change the laws to allow it to be fished in a marine protected area. You couldn't make this stuff up, seriously. If you can't protect an endangered species in a marine protected area, what can you do in this country? In a minute I will get to the reasons I think this is happening. 


I'll give the Senate a bit of background. I thank the great work of HSI and other environmental groups through their continual chipping away to get this species listed as endangered in this country. It's been listed overseas as endangered for some time, but thanks to our powerful fishing industry and their vested interests that have their way in this place we've only now managed to get it listed in Australia. We know that the population of this globally endangered scalloped hammerhead shark is rapidly declining. It's getting killed on baited drum lines, which we have around this country and which I've campaigned very hard for in my time as a senator to see removed, and this is only one of the many woes that this creature has. It's highly sought after in Asia for shark fin soup and its numbers have declined by up to 80 per cent in North Queensland, since the 1960s, largely due to commercial fishing. 


So let me make this statement and make it very clear: commercial fishing is the major threat facing the endangered scalloped hammerhead shark, and we are debating a disallowance motion to prevent the government actually reducing protections on the hammerhead shark. We are debating my disallowance motion, the Greens disallowance motion, to give the hammerhead shark added protection in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park—a marine park that I hope this whole country is behind and proud of.


This shark is also caught in recreation and commercial fisheries in gillnets and trawl nets, and as bycatch in the Queensland Shark Control Program. We had high hopes that it would get full endangered listing and therefore wouldn't be available to be caught. However, the Threatened Species Scientific Committee gave it a conservation dependent listing, which means it doesn't receive special protection from commercial fishing, except under active management plans at a state level and except in marine parks, like the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, where it does receive special protections because of the way the legislation is set up. But our previous environment minister, Mr Frydenberg, tabled the regulations we have before us today to remove the protection of this endangered scalloped hammerhead shark in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. What is the point of having marine protected areas if the government decides that, for a few commercial interests—and I understand it's only a few commercial fishing interests—they will change the law every time it suits their vested interests?


Why is this important? Well, we know our oceans face their greatest threat in history. We know our oceans right around the world have been plundered. We know that we're seeing up to 90 per cent of global fisheries either overfished or fully exploited. We've seen recently in this country scientists release peer reviewed reports in science journals that show the biomass of large pelagic fish in Australia has declined by 30 per cent, even under our fisheries management in the last 10 years. We've seen 1,400 scientists come out in support of the disallowance motion in this Senate, saying, 'Give our marine environment added protections.' We've seen a number of well-respected scientists come out and talk about the hammerhead shark, which we're discussing today, including James Cook University's Professor Colin Simpfendorfer, who I was pleased came to my Senator inquiry into warming oceans when I went to Northern Queensland.


We have a number of scientists who are openly saying that commercial fishing is the key threat to the hammerhead shark and that their populations have declined in Northern Queensland by up to 83 per cent since fishing. We've seen HSI, a group that I've worked with closely around shark nets and baited drum line programs, talk about the documentation we have before us, which, sadly, is very poor, around hammerhead shark catches and scalloped hammerhead shark catches. We know that 14,000 scallop hammerhead sharks have been reported as being killed in the Queensland Shark Control Program because of drum lines or shark nets. These sharks have very small mouths and very small teeth, and, as far as I'm aware, they aren't responsible for any attacks on human beings, yet they continue to be killed by nets and drum lines in places like the Great Barrier Reef. But that's an argument for another time; that's certainly a fight for another time. If the Senate disallows regulation 69 of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Regulations 1983 today, then we will see an impact on fishing in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park for the scalloped hammerhead shark.


I've spoken to the crossbench to try to get their support for this disallowance motion. I've sought legal advice. I've had the Parliamentary Library do research. I've spoken to scientists—and Senator Patrick, no doubt, will speak on his issues around this disallowance—and my understanding is that the hammerhead shark is also very vulnerable to bycatch, especially in gillnets. There are some statistics, although, as I mentioned earlier, the dataset is very poor. The Parliamentary Library, who went to all available sources, said that essentially the dataset is useless to work with. We don't really know. We do know that there's a large number of discards of hammerhead sharks. For every four hammerhead sharks that are caught, only one is kept; the others are discarded. I want to make this very clear to Senator Patrick: those discards are not bycatch; they are deliberate discards by fishermen.


I've spoken to stakeholders about why those sharks would be discarded, and their view is that the market for these sharks has declined significantly over time as the public has become more aware of the fact that these species increasingly are endangered and are listed globally as endangered species, and their consumption has been going down. So you can't say that for every one shark that's kept you're going to get four thrown in the water as bycatch. They are deliberate decisions and, I suspect, they are part of the shark finning market, which we know is highly targeted at the scalloped hammerhead shark. Some new regulations have been brought in by the Queensland government.


The implication of letting this disallowance go ahead and making it very difficult for the two commercial fishing operators to continue to catch scalloped hammerhead sharks is that they can't go outside the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to catch their excess quota, because their catch is limited outside the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park under these new rules and regulations. There is a potential side effect, and I acknowledge that they may decide to catch other hammerhead sharks in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, rather than the scalloped hammerhead shark. That is a potential side effect, and there may be some bycatch associated with that, but that's exactly what we want: we want less targeted fishing of hammerhead sharks and more targeted fishing of other species. That's actually what we're trying to achieve here.


It's also very unclear how bycatch of scalloped hammerhead sharks could be avoided if other hammerheads are caught. We know that as a fact. But there is no data at all about bycatch of scalloped hammerhead sharks or even other hammerhead sharks. We also know that enforcement and reporting are going to be a very important part of this disallowance if it gets up. It's going to be very important that we have robust reporting and enforcement regimes in place to make sure that we see the conservation of this endangered species.


So I'd like to pose the question that I raised earlier: why is the government introducing these regulations that I'm trying to disallow and that I hope the Senate disallows? Well, there are two commercial fishing interests left operating in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority area, under the authority's jurisdiction, that are using gillnets to target sharks. Environment groups, to their credit, have worked very closely with other fishers and have raised the money to buy out that fishing effort. Of course we would like to see an outcome whereby the existing fishers get bought out. I understand that they're amenable to that. I applaud the environment groups for thinking about the fishers and their communities and going to the extent that they have to get a win-win for both the fishing industry and conservation of these species. I understand that Senator Patrick has had some discussions with government about getting them to do this, and I look forward to hearing shortly about how successful that has been. That would be the ultimate outcome here: conserve a species in a marine protected area and get those fishers bought out, especially if they're amenable to a buyout. Certainly other fishing interests have been, because the environment groups have been able to raise the money to go ahead and do that.


Why is the government pushing ahead with this? If you believe its technical explanation, it's to get consistency of regulation across areas and to conform with Queensland state government regulations. To get consistency across areas—what does that mean?


The whole reason we have marine protected areas, the whole reason we set up the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, a marine protected area—the whole reason we went to those lengths—was to have a different set of rules and regulations for areas of high conservation value. That is why we have a marine park at the Great Barrier Reef, and that is why we have set up marine parks in other parts of this country. Obviously this government has acknowledged the need for those marine parks; however, it's extremely disappointing that, because they're representing a few commercial fishing interests in this place, they've halved those green zones right around this country, which has been a devastating outcome for the conservation movement. 


I hope that Labor, when they get elected, if they get into government—and I've had discussions with them and I've heard them say it publicly—will upgrade marine protected areas in this country. That's certainly something that I and thousands of other Australians are going to continue to work towards. But, at this time, it is so highly symbolic. The hammerhead shark is an endangered species everywhere around the planet. It has only just got a listing in Australia, and we're contemplating a new set of regulations to actually reduce protections for this endangered species in a marine protected area. You honestly couldn't make this stuff up. That's what this government are doing. That's what this is. There's nothing you can say about the fact that there needs to be consistency of regulations across areas. Seriously, this is what marine parks are set up to do: they're set up to provide conservation outcomes. They're set up to protect species, especially endangered species. 




Senator Colbeck:
  They're not fisheries management tools.

):  Order on my right!




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  why the government are trying to do this? Do you believe that it's because, somehow, they want consistency of regulations—



Senator Colbeck interjecting—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  This is a really important point that you might want to listen to, Senator Colbeck—or is it because the fishing industry and the fishers who are fishing in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park have been in this place, lobbying crossbenchers in recent days and recent weeks, saying that if this disallowance gets up it will devastate their industry and livelihood? That flies in the face of your saying this is not about fisheries management. This is exactly what this is about. This regulation is designed to help the fishing industry. So, that's fine. That's what the Liberal Party do. They're here to represent a few interests.



Senator Colbeck interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order on my right!




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I represent the tens of thousands of Australians who want to see integrity in our marine protected areas, who want to see a species extinction crisis in this country avoided. I represent the tens of thousands of Australians—in fact, the hundreds of thousands of Australians; there's nearly half a million on some lists amongst conservation groups—who care about marine protections, and this is something they are watching very closely. Do not sacrifice the integrity of a marine protected area and an endangered species for the interests of a few fishermen. We can actually make a stand here and send a very strong message that we do care about marine protected areas and we do care about conservation outcomes. If we look after our oceans, we will get spill-over effects from marine protected areas. We will get recovery in stocks and biomass. The evidence is clear. 




Senator Colbeck:
  No, it's not.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  It is. Professor Graham Edgar recently released a report, which has been published in Science—and I know it has been disputed by Senator Colbeck and other cronies in the fishing industry because it doesn't fit their mantra about the best managed fisheries in the world—that clearly says one-third of the biomass of large pelagic fish has been lost in the last ten years under this government's fisheries management. We know the culture in AFMA, from the Borthwick review. It doesn't look at the ecosystem impacts of fisheries. We have worked really hard to try and get this system changed over the years. 


I know that Professor Edgar, who released this report, has been attacked, by people in the fishing industry and vested interests, for speaking out. He showed very clearly in his study, through observations and modelling—not the pie in the sky stuff that Senator Colbeck represents—through actually physically measuring changes in species, that you can't ignore the loss of our marine species, especially our targeted commercial species, in these areas. His study showed that marine protected areas were the only places where we didn't get big losses in biomass—that they work.


Fourteen hundred scientists, who might disagree with a couple of Senator Colbeck's fishery scientists, came out and made a public statement about the disallowance. Those 1,400 scientists said very clearly: the evidence is in; marine protected areas work. So why make changes to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park for one species of endangered shark? Why go to the length of setting that precedent? That's why we have marine parks. That's why we have a process to get sharks like the scalloped hammerhead shark on an endangered species list. It will be a very bad precedent if these regulations get up. This is the fishing industry, the special interests in this place in the ear of the minister, getting what they want. It will not be a good outcome for them, in the end, if this species continues to decline in numbers, as everything suggests it will, and it will not be a good outcome for the Barrier Reef ecosystem. In fact, no-one's going to win if we keep going down this road. Let's make a stand today. Let's stand up for the Great Barrier Reef. Let's stand up for the scalloped hammerhead shark and the powerful example this sets for other marine species that are under pressure. It's hard enough as it is getting something listed in this country, without having to deal with the kind of crap we've got in front of us today.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:01):  If it comes to a question of who to believe in these issues, Greenpeace and Senator Whish-Wilson or the Threatened Species Scientific Committee, I will always go with the scientific committee. I've seen the Greens political party in action before. In fact, I remember a Senate committee that Senator Whish-Wilson chaired. After wanting to go for a taxpayer-funded snorkelling trip to the Barrier Reef, he called the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, who, contrary to the allegations of the Greens political party gave evidence every day, inconveniently for the Greens, that actually the waters in the northern Great Barrier Reef were one degree cooler than they had been the previous year.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  What a stunning revelation!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  It's the evidence given to a committee that you chaired, Senator Whish-Wilson. But of course you don't like it because it is an inconvenient truth. Don't worry about the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority; we will take the view of a politician, Senator Whish-Wilson.


I once employed, when I was the environment parliamentary secretary, a very able and committed young environmentalist who had previously worked for Greenpeace. I said, in conversation with her once, 'Why did you leave Greenpeace?' She said, 'I could not stand the lies and misrepresentation that these green groups put out.' That was because they worked on the basis that the means justifies the end. They'd just make up any story, any story at all, as long as it would attract a headline on the ABC, which is pretty easy to do. It didn't matter how inaccurate it was. That was the approach of Greenpeace and, from what I've seen through long experience in this chamber, it's the approach of the Greens political party as well.


The Threatened Species Scientific Committee found that the scalloped hammerhead shark could be eligible for the endangered list, but its clear recommendation was for Minister Frydenberg to list the species in the conservation dependent category, as that would provide the best outcome for the survival of this species. That was the recommendation of that scientific committee, but it doesn't accord with Senator Whish-Wilson's jaundiced view on this and other matters. Why did they recommend that? Because strong management actions agreed with the Northern Territory and Queensland governments for the species' protection and recovery could be implemented under law, including within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. That includes limiting the total annual catch of scalloped hammerhead to 200 tonnes or less. The committee said:


… management actions will remain in place while the species remains listed as Conservation Dependent.


It also said significantly improved monitoring and reporting would facilitate knowledge of the rates of recovery for the species and underpin the management reforms and future reviews of conservation dependent listing. That's the recommendation of the scientists, but Senator Whish-Wilson and his crazy mates from the Greens political party don't like the scientific evidence, so they make up their own.


I would have liked to have contributed a full 20 minutes on this, but I'm aware there are a lot of senators who would like to make a contribution. So, unlike Senator Whish-Wilson, I won't take the full 20 minutes. I'll attempt to leave some time for other senators who want to make a contribution. But, before I do allow colleagues to speak, by curtailing my remarks, I just want to read a couple of excerpts from a couple of pieces of correspondence which I've had from constituents of mine in Queensland. One's from David Caracciolo from Mackay Reef Fish Supplies, and I suspect many other senators have got this letter. He says: 'To all senators, I'm writing to make you aware of the false allegations by some green groups who are trying—and succeeding—to see the demise of all commercial fishing activity in Australian waters.' As a former fisheries minister, I happen to know that that is true. The Greens would like nothing more than to shut down all forestry and to shut down all fishing within Australian waters.




Senator Canavan:
  They still eat fish.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Yes, they still eat fish! So we could use imported fish from sources that are sometimes questionable—that's what the Greens want. But fortunately the majority in this place don't agree with them. This letter from Mr Caracciolo, who is a well-regarded, well-respected person in the Mackay area, says: 'The latest allegations are that the scalloped hammerhead shark is near extinction in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. These allegations are totally incorrect. The commercial sector does not target this species, so the managers will not see big catches reported in logs, but we do catch some when we are targeting other species that are incidental catches.' He goes on with some very compelling arguments which I don't have time to read in full, but I will come to the paragraph that is important to me as a representative of Queensland constituents. He says: 'There are lots of associated businesses along these coastal towns of Queensland that rely on these producers for supply of fresh seafood to sell to consumers who cannot catch their own fish and our tourists who come to these regions. I do hope this does not fall on deaf ears and you can see how wrong these motions are. There are a lot of livelihoods that you guys are holding in your decisions.' That's a sentiment that I think is mirrored by most people, not just those in the fishing industry, along the coast of Queensland who I represent.


The other letter I just want to very briefly mention is from Margaret Stevenson from Burnett Heads near Bundaberg in Queensland. She's the wife of a commercial fisherman. She's been involved in fisheries issues for 20 years. She was on the Queensland shark working group and is currently on the Queensland government's East Coast Inshore Fishery Working Group. She says: 'Whilst the hammerhead shark is supposed to be under threat in some parts of the world, when I was on the shark working committee we were told that the entire Australian take of these sharks is approximately one per cent of the world's take.' So clearly—and I say this with irony—this is a fish that is under threat! She goes on to say: 'They are extremely common in Queensland waters. In recent years our Queensland government has taken steps to control and reduce the commercial take to ensure that it does not increase in order to prevent our Queensland catch, less than one per cent of the world's take, impacting on world stocks.' Mrs Stevenson goes on to mention the importance of the fishing industry to a lot of communities along the Queensland coast and to the consumers of seafood who like to eat Australian seafood, rather than imported seafood. The science is with the way this government has dealt with matters. Clearly, there is no danger to the species whatsoever. It's properly managed. And this disallowance motion should be defeated.


Can I just conclude by making reference again to this book I've often referred to, a book put out by a lot of the mature, sensible conservation groups, entitled ABigBlueLegacy:theLiberalNationalTraditionofMarineConservation. I like to wave this around. Senator Whish-Wilson and the Greens hate it, because this book clearly demonstrates that the only political parties that have ever done anything for marine conservation in Australia are not the Greens or the Labor Party but the Liberal-National party coalition, and we will continue to do that.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-09-12,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (18:10):  Tonight this disallowance motion is one that Labor supports. It is against the proposed amendments to change the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act regulations to allow fishing for the scalloped hammerhead. We know that these are internationally recognised as endangered and under threat from fishing activity. We know that this issue before us today, in terms of the disallowance, should be supported because this government hasn't taken the time to find a solution that works for the fishing industry or, frankly, for the protection of a World Heritage area and this protected species.


We know that the marine park act applies stricter conditions to the fishing for species listed in any category of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, the list of threatened fauna, than applies in other areas managed by Australian governments. This is important to note because we expect a high standard of protection within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park—this act predates the EPBC Act—and because of the reef's conservation value and subsequent World Heritage protections. This is important to note because, again, it goes to the onus on us in the parliament to make sure that the reef and the species within it have the necessary protection they need. So we know that under this act targeted fishing for any species listed under any category in the EPBC Act of threatened fauna is simply not allowed. This is different to the EPBC Act itself, which allows for conservation dependent species to be fished within the provision of a management plan.


We know that in 2018 the Threatened Species Scientific Committee confirmed that scalloped hammerheads met the criteria for listing as endangered, but advised the Minister for the Environment to list them as conservation dependent under the EPBC Act, which allows fishing to continue in some waters. We know that the scientific committee required certain improvements to management of the species in order to support the listing category from jurisdictions around the country. They did not recommend amending the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park regulations to allow for targeted fishing of scalloped hammerhead sharks to continue in the marine park. The Threatened Species Scientific Committee did not recommend that. What they did recommend was a revision of the total allowable commercial catch limits for hammerheads, and that these limits should include discarded shark and catch by the Queensland Shark Control Program. They also recommended the landing of hammerhead sharks with fins naturally attached. The Threatened Species Scientific Committee considered this a critical element within management arrangements to maintain a conservation dependent listing. The absence of this policy, they said, could lead to a review of the listing category and a possible up-listing of this species to endangered.


So we have before us tonight in this disallowance a recognition that the federal government has failed in its responsibility to address fishery issues outlined in the GreatBarrierReefoutlookreport of 2014, where the targeting of top predators such as sharks is identified as a critical risk to the health of the reef. The Minister for the Environment has tabled amendments to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act regulations that would allow for the fishing of the scalloped hammerhead species within the marine park, despite its conservation dependent listing. So the motion before us tonight, which Labor supports, is against the proposed amendments to change the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act regulations to allow for the fishing of the scalloped hammerhead. They are, in fact, internationally recognised as endangered and under threat from fishing activity.


Despite the protestations from those opposite, we have received advice that says the numbers of scalloped hammerheads have declined by between 63 per cent and 80 per cent within the reef. They are more at risk of extinction than lions, cheetahs, polar bears and giant pandas. We support this disallowance motion because the government has not taken the time to find a solution that works for the fishing industry or for the adequate protection of a World Heritage area. This government simply wants to change the rules in our most precious of places—the Great Barrier Reef. They, tonight, want to weaken environmental protections. I stress: this is a World Heritage area of great value to Australia and also to the world.


Extractive industries are and should be subject to the very strictest of rules in World Heritage areas, and the Great Barrier Reef should be treated no differently. We know that the reef is under enormous pressure from this government, and this is all happening at a time when it wants to weaken regulations to allow an endangered species to be killed—not accidentally caught by a fisher and reported as something to be concerned about but sold on the market if caught. We understand on this side that sustainable fishing jobs are important. We want jobs in the reef to remain, but we will not compromise on standards that have been in place since the marine park was first established. Shark sightings of this very species are highly valuable to the tourism operators on the Great Barrier Reef. Did you know that shark diving, shark tourism, is worth some $25.5 million annually to Australia's regional economy, and that this kind of tourism is growing? We accept that standards in the reef, a World Heritage area, should be and are higher than other protected areas.


The government tonight is trying to present a case that the sharks caught will simply be wasted, because they can't be sold and industry will lose an income stream. Let's be clear: if a fishery relies on catching threatened species to make money, it's just delaying the inevitable. If they rely on funds from selling that threatened species, eventually there will be none left to catch. This revenue stream is simply on an inevitable decline. We have to stop it so that we can protect the species, or the revenue stream will end because the species is simply no longer there; it will be extinct. So the government's logic simply does not add up. It has presented a case but it has not tried to find a solution that protects the World Heritage values of the reef and marine park. There are options, and the government should be pursuing them.


If the government presented Labor with a plan to transition the industry, we would be happy to discuss it. If it made an effort to protect a species in a World Heritage area and brought the industry into discussion, we would also be up for that. Reform of the fishery in which scalloped hammerhead sharks are caught is certainly an option, as it's a high-risk fishery operating in a World Heritage area. The Queensland government, which manages the fishery in which scalloped hammerheads are caught, has said that they're committed to overall reform of the Queensland fisheries, as outlined in their sustainable fisheries strategy. The fishery in which these hammerheads are caught is a priority fishery for review by the Queensland government. So we have here a Queensland government that's taking positive steps. We'd like to see the Commonwealth Morrison government do more to help. What could you do? What kinds of time frames on regulations could be a solution?


You have options available to you. But, no; instead, what you do is sell out our environment. Whenever there's an opportunity to protect the environment, you choose its destruction. Whenever there's an opportunity to protect a species and do some work to find an answer, you take the easy option and you're completely missing in action.

"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-09-12,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (18:20):  Centre Alliance will not be supporting this disallowance motion, and it does so on the basis that the likely outcome of disallowing the legislation is that we'll see more hammerhead sharks being killed than if the regulation were to stand. The threatened species scientific community has determined that hammerhead sharks should be protected. The hammerhead shark is now conservation dependent. Queensland fishery management has been adjusted accordingly.


The question is: if we let the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park be a sanctuary for hammerheads, would it stop the catching of hammerheads; would it reduce the number of hammerheads caught? I spoke to all sides of the argument. I spoke to Humane Society International. I spoke to AFMA. I spoke to scientists. I spoke to fisheries. I spoke to Senator Whish-Wilson on a couple of occasions. The first point to appreciate is that these sharks are migratory. A sanctuary doesn't actually assist them. The second point to appreciate is that the catching of the hammerhead is largely incidental to other fishing. Certainly, in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, that's the case.


When sharks are caught in gillnets that are designed to catch other fish, they often die before they make it on board the fishing vessel or shortly thereafter, and they're returned overboard. That happens because of stress to the animal. Four out of five sharks die irrespective of whether they're thrown back. So you can ban the fishing of hammerheads in marine parks, but they'll still be caught in gillnets and will still die. But, in that instance, what will happen is they won't be taken back to shore and counted. More sharks could legally be caught outside the marine park. In fact, they could be targeted in other areas of Queensland outside the marine park. With the regulations in place, those sharks are retained on board, counted in the Queensland quota and are returned to shore where the scientific data that everyone agrees is lacking is then collected. If the regulation is disallowed, the sharks will still be caught, four in five sharks will die, but they won't be included in the Queensland quota and they won't be taken back to shore to allow scientific data to be collected.


Now we accept, as Labor has put, that there are many things that could be done for the betterment of the species, but unfortunately that's not on offer here. So, just focusing on the regulation that is before the Senate, it's our considered view, after talking to all sides of the argument, that the disallowance in this circumstance would result in a worse outcome for sharks, and therefore we can't support it.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2018-09-12,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (18:23):  I have just a few points to counter some of the discussion that has been around the chamber. I say to Labor: the Queensland Labor government actually supported this process. So to suggest that Labor's actions here in Canberra are supported by the Queensland Labor government is not true. They actually supported this process because, rather than this affecting just a couple of net fishers, as Senator Whish-Wilson indicated, this would affect hundreds of net fishers all up and down the Queensland coast.


Let's not be shy about this. Senator Whish-Wilson's motion is just about stopping fishing. That's all it's about. He's not interested in good fisheries management. He misrepresents terribly. He is not interested in good fisheries management. He quotes a piece of alleged science—I think is probably better to say—which is based on people going snorkelling in inshore waters and trying to correlate that to the impacts on our Commonwealth waters outside three kilometres. This is not science. This observational science that he talks of, that he quotes in support of his argument, is not science.



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator COLBECK:
  It's not science. And he also quotes, in an attempt to frighten the Australian people about global fish stocks, a number of 90 per cent of global fisheries that are overfished or fully exploited. That is actually the number, but what he fails to say is that 'fully exploited' means 'sustainably fished'—so, a complete and utter misrepresentation; a lie, in fact—




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  In your language it might be!




Senator COLBECK:
  No; in global fisheries management language. Senator Whish-Wilson simply cannot be trusted with the truth in this argument. All he wants to do, with Mr Tony Burke—I was going to say 'from the Greens', and he might as well be—from the Labor Party, is shut down fisheries management. That's what he wants to do. He neglects to say that the reason for the listing of scalloped hammerhead sharks as a conservation dependent species under Australia's EPBC Act follows a listing on appendix 2 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, CITES. The listing was due to poor fisheries management and the result of heavy overfishing in the Atlantic Ocean. That was the reason for the listing on CITES. Senator Whish-Wilson makes no comment about that in his remarks. He wants to give the impression that there's an issue here. This process will actually manage it. This will manage the fishery sustainably, and disallowance of this regulation will do nothing to protect or recover the species in the Atlantic or other populations.


This motion is about shutting down fisheries. Senator Whish-Wilson tries to cast aspersions on the overall fish stocks in Australian waters, yet the Australian Fisheries fish stocks reports since 2013 have consistently said that not one single fish stock that is Commonwealth managed is either overfished or subject to overfishing.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  They write their own science!




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator McCarthy
):  Order!




Senator COLBECK:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, for Senator Whish-Wilson to cast those sorts of aspersions on ABARES, who do these numbers, when he is quoting a report that's effectively a compilation of a group of people going snorkelling—



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator COLBECK:
  that's effectively what it is—as observational science in inshore waters and then trying to translate that to Commonwealth waters outside three kilometres, is, quite frankly, a disgrace. ABARES is recognised globally for its work around fisheries management. This motion, as I've said a couple of times, is simply about stopping people fishing. Our marine parks are not fisheries management tools. For us to have a continued, well-managed series of fish stocks in this country, we need to use all of the tools that we have together, in concert—



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator COLBECK:
  including marine parks, Senator Whish-Wilson. In fact, the coalition's record in the context of marine parks is a proud one. We are very proud to have put in place the best marine parks and one of the largest marine parks regimes in the world. The government, obviously, won't be supporting this disallowance motion. I urge other colleagues in the chamber not to support this disallowance motion, because it won't do anything to improve the stocks of hammerhead sharks. It will reduce the access to science in support of protecting the hammerhead sharks. This motion is all about stopping people fishing—that's all.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that business of the Senate notice of motion No. 1 be agreed to.
