Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (12:32):  I rise to oppose the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 on behalf of the Labor Party. This is just another element of this government's antiworker agenda. It is another element of their anti-union agenda. This bill is a significant attack on Australia's working class. The bill is the product of the coalition's ideological hatred for collective bargaining and workplace rights. Decent bargaining rights, the capacity to increase wages and conditions, the right to be treated with dignity and respect when you clock on at work are threatened by this government and by this legislation. Even the International Monetary Fund has recognised that unions are the bulwark—the barrier—against increased inequality. Yet this mob do not care. They simply want to see the destruction of collective bargaining and union rights in this country.


The coalition has used a royal commission with politically generated terms of reference and a compliant royal commissioner to deliver recommendations that weaken collective bargaining and working people's rights. The royal commissioner, Dyson Heydon, was biased and demonstrated his determination to deliver the coalition government's agenda during the conduct of the commission. It is a sad and disappointing end to Royal Commissioner Heydon's public career. 


The party which gave us John Howard, Tony Abbott, Peter Reith and Work Choices can never be trusted. The party which gave us the 2014 budget, hacking away at welfare in this country, hacking away at support for families, hacking away at pensions—this is a government that cannot be trusted. The party which supported workers being unfairly dismissed cannot be trusted. This is the party which said: 'If you are a small company, you can unfairly dismiss someone. Unfair dismissal is okay.' This mob cannot be trusted on any of these issues. The party which wants to destroy penalty rates and annual leave loading cannot be trusted.


The party who lost 10 MPs as a result of a New South Wales ICAC inquiry—Liberal MPs were systematically breaking the law by accepting donations from developers—cannot be trusted. You never hear them talking about upholding the law anywhere else except in the building and construction industry. They are a law-free zone when it comes to every other area. The Liberal Party, whose MP was busted accepting illegal cash payments in a brown paper bag in the back seat of a building developer's Bentley in Newcastle, surely cannot be trusted.


The Turnbull government are a divided disgrace. They are a rabble who are disunited and at war with each other. The only things that bring them together are attacks on minority groups and the workers of this country. The only time you see them getting excited about anything is when they are attacking workers, attacking pensioners, attacking multiculturalism and attacking the rights of working people in this country. That is when they get excited. That is when they start jumping up and down. They do not get excited about anything else. They are certainly not excited about the current Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull. They are not very excited about him at all, and why would they be? What a disappointment that guy is.


The Turnbull government has ignored one of the biggest problems in the building and construction industry—that is, the non-payment of contractors, subcontractors and employees for work that they carry out. The recent Labor initiated inquiry into security of payments in the building and construction industry has been ignored by this government, even though the recommendations brought forward by Labor would commence a process to resolve the non-payment of $3 billion a year to hardworking Australians in the industry. The evidence before the committee was compelling that the non-payment for work carried out by workers, contractors and small businesses in the building and construction industry—not being paid for the work they had done—creates industrial disputes, under-resourced companies, declining productivity, unsafe workplaces, bankruptcies and suicides. We heard evidence of a Perth builder committing suicide. He had a successful business. One of the tier 1 contractors would not pay what they owed him and he committed suicide because of the stress. It was an outrageous proposition.


The coalition have had this report in their hands for months and they have done nothing about it. If you could solve that one problem in the industry, you would solve much of the industrial disputation as unions try to make sure that their members get paid and are not ripped off by pyramid contracting and by phoenix companies closing down one day and rebirthing the next day. They do nothing about it—absolutely nothing. All they want to do is hammer the trade union movement and try to diminish collective bargaining in the industry. 


The bills do nothing for what is recognised by the Labor Party and participants in the industry as a fundamental fault in the building and construction industry that needs to be resolved. It would be far more productive and it would be in the interests of the industry and its workforce if we were discussing legislation that provided security of payments in the industry rather than an ideological attack on workers through the proposed ABCC.


These bills and their predecessors have been discussed ad nauseam in the last few years. I have been involved in a number of inquiries that have exposed the lies being perpetrated by the coalition that these bills will increase productivity, reduce industrial disputation and usher in a new era of industrial calm in the industry. You only have to read some of the comments that have been made publicly in the last few weeks about the attacks on collective bargaining through the implementation of what is called the Building Industry Code.


A fundamental part of this bill is a code that has been established to determine how Australian workers are allowed to bargain with their employer, and how employers are allowed to bargain with their employees. I do not know of anything else like it anywhere in the world, yet in Australia under the coalition government, as an attack on collective bargaining, they are prepared to put in charge of determining whether companies and unions have been bargaining effectively a person who has never bargained in his life. He is an ex-Federal Police officer who worked with the Royal Ulster Constabulary and has been involved in all sorts of issues, but not bargaining. He knows nothing about it, and he has been given, under this bill, the opportunity to determine bargaining outcomes for workers. There has been lots of analysis done on the code, but the key findings in relation to the issues in the code are that it is highly objectionable as it contains restrictions on legitimate industrial relations practices that are lawful in every other country. No other country has a code like this in place. There is a booming construction industry out there, and that certainly undermines the government's justification for what is happening. The industry is booming, and that is under the laws without any changes. There is no need for this act that they would have.


The code adversely impacts the number of apprentices. Over 27 years as a full-time union official, I have negotiated many, many agreements over many years, and one of the things that my union, the metalworkers union, used to do was say, 'Let's negotiate with the boss to try and get some more apprentices on the job to give young kids a chance in the industry and an opportunity for an apprenticeship and a trade.' We wrote that into agreements all over the country, and we wrote into those agreements decent wages and decent conditions for the apprentices, because not only was that an investment in the future for the company but it actually increased the productivity and skill base for the industry in the future. Any of the crossbenchers that are here at the moment or listening in should understand that, if you back this in, you are denying unions and workers collectively the ability to negotiate to get more apprentices on the job and give young Australian workers an opportunity to get an apprenticeship and a trade. That is a key part of this legislation through the code, and you should understand what you are going to do if you back this in. You are taking opportunities away from young Australians, and that would be an absolute disgrace.


The code impacts more businesses and more workers in more harsh ways than ever before. It places more bureaucracy on businesses large and small, and it will dampen growth; there is no doubt about that. The code disproportionately impacts women, older workers and unions. Some of the commentary that has been out there recently is that, if this code comes in and the agreements that are out there—thousands of agreements across the industry—become noncompliant then what you are actually achieving is a bargaining round of a size you have never seen before for many years in this industry, because the unions will be entitled to go out, if the code and this bill determine that their agreements are no longer lawful, and bargain for new agreements. So there will be disruption across the industry, and that would be a disaster. That would be absolute stupidity from this government, and that is another reason why we should not put this bill in.


I spoke earlier about the head of the fair work building commission—the person who will probably head up the ABCC and the hero of the extreme Right in industrial relations—Mr Nigel Hadgkiss. This is a man who has never negotiated an industrial agreement in his life, but who will have control of the code under this government's proposal to dismantle collective bargaining in the industry. This is a man who has treated the Senate with absolute contempt. This is a man who is simply a puppet of the coalition. He was an appointee of Senator Abetz when Senator Abetz was the IR minister. Senator Abetz appointed this man because of his right-wing views. He has set about trying to ensure that he is not subject to accountability, as are other public servants and other heads of government business organisations. He has continually defied the estimates process and the call from this Senate itself to provide details of what he is doing and what he is spending money on.


This guy is really unfit for the job. If you agree with this bill, you will be putting in charge of this ABCC, with more powers than ever, someone who is entirely unsuited to the job of applying a fair, reasonable and unbiased approach to working people in the industry. The agency that he heads up has great power over working people. I just think it is terrible that he would not advise the Senate estimates committee on the issues that every other head of department and every other head of an agency do as a matter of course at estimates.


He reported in one of his annual reports that he had visited 50 companies and gone to 50 boardroom meetings. He expended public money to go to those boardroom meetings. When I asked in the estimates process, 'Who did you meet and what did you do?' he basically said, 'None of your business.' Well, it is the Senate's business. This guy has no understanding of his obligations as a public servant or of his obligations to the Parliament of Australia. He treats it with absolute contempt.


He said, 'I don't have a diary.' He could sit down and write a report and remember that he had met 50 companies in 50 boardrooms, but he could not tell us who they were, he could not tell us when he went there and he could not tell us who he met with because he claimed he does not keep a diary. It is just unbelievable for a senior officer of a government agency not to have a diary. In fact, I think it breaches a lot of Public Service requirements.


So this is the guy who sets about telling the Senate, 'I'm not telling you what I am spending money on.' We asked him, 'Who are you employing?' He employs a lot of former Federal Police officers and New South Wales and Victorian police officers in the agency, but he will not tell us what the make-up is so that the public, who pay the bills, can understand what is going on.


The worst part about this guy is that he sets about denying right of entry for union officials to sites to deal with health and safety issues. It was clear recently. On 25 November 2015 two Irish backpackers were employed on the Jaxon site in Bennett Street, East Perth: Gerry Bradley and Joe McDermott. They were out here on working holiday visas. They were sitting, having their morning tea, and they were crushed to death under a concrete block. I met the parents, the brother and sisters, and the partner, and it was tragic. Part of the problem was the union could not get on that site to deal with proper health and safety issues because of the fair work building commission bill. It will be even harder under the bill that is being proposed.


In Senate estimates they would not answer up-front; they took questions on notice. We finally got some facts back from them. What came out in Senate Estimates was that there were six Jaxon jobs in Perth at the time and the union had raised serious safety issues about Jaxon. It was confirmed that fair work building commission inspectors had visited three times the site where Gerry and Joe were killed. That was about keeping the unions off the job. There were 11 requests to the WorkSafe commission to attend Jaxon sites over two years. But what we do know is, if you are a construction worker in Perth and you have serious safety failures and you want them fixed, you are more likely to get a visit from a fair work building commission inspector helping the boss to keep the union off the job than you are to get a visit from the safety regulator.


The other day a 27-year-old German backpacker working on a Western Australian construction site fell 13 floors to her death. The site is run by notorious anti-union company Hanssen, whose managing director, Gerry Hanssen, is well known for his anti-union position. So it is absolutely essential that unions get access to look after the safety of workers on the site, whether they are backpackers, 457 visa workers, Australian workers or apprentice. There should be access to those sites. The systematic approach of keeping the unions off the site through Nigel Hadgkiss and his biased approach at Fair Work Building and Construction should be stopped.


But it is not just the Labor Party that is seeing that there are problems with this new bill. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, which has the job to oversight these bills, said that there are a number of examples where human rights are diminished under this bill, such as allowing officers into residential premises without a warrant. The fair work building commission has greater rights than the police force in terms of entering properties. The police force needs a warrant—not the fair work building commission. They do not need a warrant to enter residential premises. The bill trespasses on personal rights and liberties and reverses the onus of proof. This is a bad bill. This is bad legislation. It is based on a government wanting to reduce the rights and capacity of ordinary workers to get a decent living in this country, and it is all on the basis of looking after the big end of town and big business. You should reject this bill as bad legislation. It is a bad bill. (Time expired)

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2016-11-22,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (12:52):  I rise to speak on the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 and the Building and Construction Industry (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013. Today is another day under the Turnbull government and another day of brutal attacks on working people. Yesterday we saw in this parliament a debate on the registered organisations bill—a bill to damage unions, to tie them up in red tape, to make it difficult for them to do their work representing working people and for working people to collectively organise. 


What we are seeing today is a targeted attack on one particular group of workers: construction workers. The workers who don those fluoro jackets that are so popular with the likes of Mr Turnbull and many of his ministers. They use those fluoros when it is convenient. But, when it comes to ensuring that the workers who are building our hospitals, our homes, our schools and the infrastructure we need to drive this country are still alive at the end of the day and can come home, they are not interested. What they are interested in in driving forward with the ABCC legislation is, again, delivering for their corporate mates, for the people who have put them into office, for those who have given them millions and millions of dollars in donations. What is going on here is a very ugly story. If it were happening in another country, it would be called out and out corruption where a government comes into office and delivers for those who have, over the years, put millions of dollars into getting them elected, by weakening the laws to benefit the profit line of those companies.


This issue about the rights of construction workers is very important. I will come to it in more detail in a moment, but right now I want to deal with this issue of safety. We know that in the period the ABCC was operating—under the legislation that was in force previously—more people died, particularly young male workers whose families thought they would see them again, but they did not come home. It is absolutely sickening, really deeply sickening. The figures bear this out. In 2005, just before the ABCC came in, the number of fatalities on building sites had actually been dropping: it was around 3.51 per 100,000. By 2007 it had risen to 4.7 per 100,000. It has been well documented that the ABCC puts lives at risk. It puts lives at risk because it is harder for construction workers to organise and harder for the CFMEU to be active on building sites. We have heard the minister proudly denounce CFMEU officials for trying to get onto building sites. They are trying to get onto those building sites to ensure the sites are safe. That is why more people died when the ABCC was in operation. I congratulate the CFMEU for its activities in working to improve the working conditions and pay of construction workers and for the work that it does to ensure that the people who build our homes, our schools and our hospitals come home at the end of the day. We all go home, and they should have the right to. So what we need—



Senator Williams interjecting—




Senator RHIANNON:
  I am happy to take the interjection always, Senator Williams. Why is the government—you would know this from your background, Senator Williams—obsessed with bringing in this legislation? Why does it want to deliver for the companies that give them so much backing? This is not coming just from a position of an obsession with marketplace Thatcherite ideology.


There is a real aspect of self-interest for the Turnbull government. The self-interest I am referring to is in the political donations that it picks up. The Greens' Democracy For Sale project has just been expanded. It has identified that since 1998, which is when political donations started to be recorded. to 2015 the property development industry has donated $64 million. It comes from a range of companies, from property developers, construction companies and related companies. The bulk of that $64 million goes to the Liberal and National parties, so it is not surprising that Senator Williams interjects. These issues are getting a bit close to the bone when we start making the links between the money coming in and how the government delivers. How does it deliver? It is delivering right now with this ABCC legislation. It has delivered in other ways. We have seen it in state parliaments, where the coalition weaken planning laws.


In New South Wales we had a fine piece of legislation that was introduced off the back of the very impressive green ban movements and resident action groups that were all over Sydney and other urban areas in the 1970s. They had such a strong voice that when the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act was introduced into New South Wales in 1979 the Premier of New South Wales actually paid tribute to the green ban movement and the resident action groups and said a foundation of planning has to be consultation with the community. But what did we see? When the next Labor government, the Carr Labor government, came in, hand in hand with the Liberals and Nationals in New South Wales, every year there would be amendments to weaken that legislation. Who benefited? The developers. At the very same time we were seeing a weakening of the planning laws.


I do not know what deals went on with donors behind closed doors with regard to the last election, when the Turnbull government barely scraped in. From what I understand, the examples that Senator Cameron and I have spoken about with regard to the Newcastle incident, where paper bags of money from developers were handed over to some Liberal politicians, are not actually such a common way of buying favours these days. I refer senators to the High Court case I have spoken about before. But the trend now is that the culture of the major political parties is: how do we deliver for our donors? Rather than governing for the common good—the public good—they think, 'Well, what will make our donors happy?' All the people sitting on the government side know that, with the ABCC legislation, they will be getting slaps on the back. They will be favoured at all their cocktail parties. They will be the centre of attention if this legislation goes through, and in no way should it go through. It is damaging legislation not just for construction workers who might be injured or might die and whose families would grieve; it is damaging to the fabric of Australia.


Why go after the CFMEU? Why have the ABCC legislation come in? Yes, the CFMEU is a radical and militant union, it is well organised and it is out there winning good conditions and pay for its members. If you weaken that union, you start to weaken the union movement across the board. Again, it is another way for this government to deliver for its constituency, the big companies that it works with so closely.


So this is a piece of legislation that we have great concern about. Is it a coincidence that the for-profit sector that gave the most money to the coalition will benefit the most from the ABCC? We need to start asking that question. I will keep raising it, because we need to focus on what is actually going on here. The government's stubborn attempts to revive this legislation mean the attacks from the ABCC on construction workers are well documented, and they are worth reiterating.


First, I would just like to go through some of the myths that the government has peddled. The government claims that the ABCC will improve productivity. That is always a favourite, but it is false. Even the sham Heydon royal commission noted that studies did not provide credible evidence that the previous ABCC regimes increased productivity.


The government claims the ABCC is about criminality and corruption. Being in this place with the likes of Senator McKenzie, Senator Cash and Senator Abetz when he had the job, I say: seriously! So many of those examples that I gave were, I would say, trumped up. So many of them involved CFMEU delegates and officials doing their job. Again I will say that I am not excusing criminality. I am not letting them off the hook. We know that the laws are in place to deal with that. Yes, it is a rough and tumble industry and, yes, people swear on building sites, but what those representatives of the government have been going on about is so often people, including construction workers, out there to save lives and get some decent pay for these construction workers when they go home. They are actually doing their job.


The argument about criminality and corruption is another one that is not true. The ABCC has no power to investigate corruption or allegations of a criminal nature. You would think again, from listening to the representatives from the government, that the ship would turn around and now we would have this wonderful body that can get out there and investigate these shocking crimes like construction workers having stickers on their hats and maybe swearing on a picket line. But no. That is not what it is up to.


The government claims the ABCC will not breach civil liberties. Again, this is wrong. Workers will be forced to be silent about questioning. For those senators who are still thinking about what their position should be, I would really ask them to consider this aspect of the legislation we are debating here. Workers will be forced to be silent about questioning. That means they cannot talk to anybody. This is Australia in 2016, and we are debating a law in the federal parliament that might do that to workers in this country. To do it to anybody is wrong. Workers will no longer have the right to silence or protection from self-incrimination. People have fought for those legal rights, and our forebears in our parliaments have passed legislation to ensure that was the case, but we are on the cusp of unwinding that. And why? Because this government works so closely with construction companies and developers that it has moved totally away from what the public good means and what one should be doing when one comes into government.


The ABCC also reverses the onus of proof, forcing workers to prove that they are acting within the law—again, a huge change to how our legal system works, something that we all should be questioning and not accepting. The government claims that the ABCC will improve safety. I have shared with you some of the figures on that—figures showing something deeply alarming: that many people who go off and don their fluoro for real reasons do not come home, because it is a very, very dangerous industry. This is probably the worst of the lies, because we are dealing with people's lives—their families, their friends, the wellbeing of so many people—because when one person dies on a construction site, so many people suffer.


During the last version of the ABCC—and I want to go through this again, just to really emphasise these figures—deaths on construction sites increased, reaching a peak of 45 lives lost in 2007—one industry, 45 lives lost. Why were they lost? Often these are very young workers. They go on the job and the boss tells them to go and do things and they do not know what their rights are. They do not really want to challenge it when they are not too sure. They want to keep their jobs. And what ends up happening? As Senator Cameron described, a concrete slab falls on them. He told us about the tragedy in Perth, and I relayed a similar incident that happened in Queensland. It sounds like they actually saw the concrete slab coming towards them—just horrendous. Surely there is some humanity here on the government benches to consider this.


In 2013, after the ABCC was replaced, the number of deaths in one year dropped to 17. Still, that is 17 tragedies—many more, because all those people would have had loved ones who would still be grieving for them. But it was a vast improvement. The weeks since the Prime Minister's attempted power play, setting up the special sitting of parliament, have exposed that this government's supposed concern over corruption and wrongdoing within the construction industry really is farcical. It is a cover. As I said in the debate on registered organisations, the government cannot come in here and be honest about why it is introducing this. If it were honest, it would say, 'We've got to deliver for our constituency.' It cannot say that, so it comes up with deception after deception.


So, what do they do? They attack their political enemies—the enemies of their political donors, the union movement. I think many people are aware of the truth. I think when people hear what is actually going on they want people to be safe at work, and they are concerned about how this is playing out. It has been made even clearer by the government's refusing to support the Greens's call for a royal commission into the big banks and the financial sector—a sector in which we have heard time and time again of alleged misconduct. This white-collar crime has affected the lives of tens of thousands of victims. This is where we have this huge inconsistency in how this government operates. And I believe many people can join the dots, that they can see that inconsistency, that the government is harassing one section of the community for its own political self-interest and, where it should be putting its efforts, sidestepping its responsibility.


If the government were serious about tackling corruption and criminality it would get behind the Greens's call to set up a royal commission into the financial sector. It would get behind the Greens's call to get big money out of politics, and it would get behind the vast majority of Australians who are echoing the Greens's call for a national corruption watchdog. We need that so urgently to hold politicians and public servants to account. But time and time again it was resisted. We saw it voted down again last night. Again, disappointingly, Labor was there with the Liberals and the Nationals. It is time to sort this one out. It really has to happen. It becomes quite farcical that of all the jurisdictions in Australia we are the only ones that have not had a national ICAC. The fact that it is not even on the agenda with the Liberals and Nationals really does further expose their double standards when they bring forward legislation like the registered organisations legislation and this ABCC bill.


This bill to bring back the ABCC is a linchpin in the government's ongoing attack on unions. Why? Because unions look after workers. Trade unions were founded for that very purpose, for protecting the rights and interests of working people. When you start undermining unions it means that you are undermining the collective ability of workers to organise and to be able to improve wages and conditions. So, what is going on here is very fundamental. But it is not something new with conservative governments. Again, I outlined it in the speech last night on registered organisations. When we have a conservative government, one of the first things they do, from the penal powers of the Menzies era through to the Howard, Abbott and Turnbull governments—their core business—is get out there with their anti-union legislation and push it through by demonising unions, demonising workers and lying time and time again.


This bill would give workers in the construction industry fewer rights at work just because of the industry they work in. It would give them fewer rights at work than accused criminals and even accused terrorists. It is seriously extraordinary that it has got to that point. With this bill the government wants to set up a new secret police in the construction industry. Unfortunately I am running out of time, but the idea that Nigel Hadgkiss may rise again and be the head of this star chamber is deeply disturbing—a man so committed to delivering some of the most ugly outcomes for working people. Where this government has ended up is deeply troubling.


The government wants to go out at the end of this year and obviously head off to the next election with claims of Australia's improving productivity and cracking down on the wrongdoing of unions. You can see the headlines in The Australian and The Telegraph now. You can hear the speeches coming out of Minister Cash and Prime Minister Turnbull. The lines would already be written up—their great victory, standing up for ordinary people, for mums and dads, for productivity. But it is all built on a lie: not only will it damage working people themselves, but many will not come home. We know that the number of injuries and deaths will increase, which also damages the fabric of our life, or our society. This bill should be defeated.

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2016-11-22,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (13:12):  I rise today to speak on the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 and the Building and Construction Industry (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013. Our construction industry builds the offices, the apartments, the roads, the shopping centres, the hospitals, the universities, the schools, the airports and the other important infrastructure—vital infrastructure—that all Australians use and depend on daily. The construction industry is the third-largest industry in Australia, representing some eight per cent of our gross domestic product. Furthermore, the construction industry employs approximately 1.1 million Australians in one capacity or another. Indeed, there are more than 300,000 small businesses that fall within the parameters of the construction industry in Australia. Let us just recap those facts for a moment: eight per cent of gross domestic product, 1.1 million Australians employed and over 300,000 small businesses in operation. By any means, this is a substantial industry, and so important in the greater make-up of the Australian economy.


There is not a person in this place, no matter whether they choose to admit it or to feign ignorance, who is not aware of the toxic culture of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, or the CFMEU. We have seen this culture of intimidation, economic blackmail, violence and thuggery on TV screens, in print media and, for the most part, uncovered as part of the royal commission into the trade union movement. Commissioner Heydon—one of the finest legal minds in Australian history, I might add—described the deplorable union behaviour uncovered by this royal commission as 'only the tip of the iceberg'. The behaviour of unions, such as the CFMEU, is not isolated to their own operations. Rather, the effects of behaviour such as this flow on through the Australian economy, with devastating results.


As of October 2016 some 113 CFMEU officials are before the courts charged with more than 1,100 alleged contraventions of various Australian laws—an absolutely astounding figure. If we were to work that out as an average it would be 9.7 alleged contraventions per individual. The CFMEU must think that they are above the law. Do they? Is this what they think? They seem to believe that the law applies to all Australians but them. But it must be noted that these matters are before the courts and as they currently stand they are alleged. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that in recent years courts of various jurisdictions have imposed more than $8 million in fines as punishment for the CFMEU's callous disregard for Australian laws. So brazen is their attitude that one Federal Court Justice remarked that the CFMEU's record of noncompliance with the law is 'notorious' and their record 'ought to be an embarrassment to the trade union movement'. This seems to be an embarrassment that those opposite do not wish to acknowledge, but they should, because the rest of Australia certainly does.


While some may trivialise the unruly behaviour of some unions, it is incredibly dangerous to do so. The rate of industrial action in the construction sector is nine times higher at present than the average across all other industries in Australia—a truly staggering statistic. To further illustrate this point, it should be noted that two of every three days lost to an industrial dispute in this country are lost from within the construction industry. Because of this and the continuing behaviour of rogue unions, the taxpayer dollar is wasted. The taxpayer must pay more. It seems that those opposite are content with that. The building of vital infrastructure—of schools and hospitals—costs 30 per cent more owing directly to that industrial action on building sites.


The ABCC is the proven solution to ameliorate this situation. The proven solution in putting a stop to lawlessness and thuggery in the building industry is the ABCC. Let us look at some facts about the ABCC. Before the ABCC was initially introduced, the rate of industrial disputes in the construction industry was five times the average across all other industries. During the ABCC's operations, disputes fell to just two times the average. But, on average, since the ABCC's abolition, disputes have gone back up to five times the average across all other industries. Since the ABCC was abolished by Bill Shorten in 2012, the rate of disputes in the construction sector has increased by 40 per cent, whereas the rate of industrial disputes across all other industries has decreased by 33 per cent on average. When the ABCC was in force, productivity in the construction sector grew by 20 per cent, yet it now remains relatively stagnant.


This bill will restore the ABCC as the industry-specific regulator for the construction industry. It will restore penalties to their former level. It will retain the current compulsory evidence-gathering powers but remove the sunset clause, and these powers are held by other regulators, such as the ACCC, ASIC, the ATO, Centrelink and Medicare. This bill will introduce new measures to deal with unlawful picketing and the disruption of transport and supply to building sites, including those located offshore. It will remove the inability for the ABCC to enforce the law where private settlements occur. Otherwise, it would be like police having no power to prosecute a driver for running a red light and causing a crash if the driver reached a private settlement with the other driver. This bill will enable a strong building code to be made for government projects. This will help improve standards and create a fairer playing field for businesses in the industry.


Despite the misinformation spread by those opposite, the ABCC legislation does not amend any workplace safety law. It will in no way prevent safety issues from being raised or addressed by employers, by unions or by health and safety regulators. Senator Rhiannon's comments were incomprehensible. All the stats show that, under the ABCC, the number of deaths and accidents actually went down, that productivity increased, that the number of days lost to strikes also went down, and that the vast majority of workers reported being much happier in their construction workplaces. But, since Labor abolished it, lawlessness has gone up again and days lost from strikes have increased. This is taxpayer money for infrastructure projects that is being wasted.


I would like now to turn to one case study examined at length quite recently by the Menzies Research Centre in their report entitled Constructing a better future: restoring order and competition in the building industry. The example relates to the Wonthaggi desalination plant in my own home state of Victoria. The Menzies Research Centre reports that construction of the Wonthaggi desalination plant at Dalyston on the Bass Coast of Victoria was commissioned by John Brumby's Labor state government in July 2009 and completed in December 2012, a full year behind schedule. Plagued by cost blowouts, delays, waste and excessively high labour costs, Wonthaggi exemplified the very worst of public construction in Australia. When construction began in late 2009, it was expected to cost $3.1 billion, an estimate that was itself considerably above the cost of similar projects in Australia. The Kwinana desalination plant south of Perth, for instance, completed three years earlier, holds approximately 30 to 50 per cent of the capacity of the Wonthaggi desalination plant, but it was completed at a cost of $387 million, only 12.5 per cent of the cost of the Wonthaggi plant. The final price tag of the Victorian plant hit a staggering $5.7 billion.


An analysis by Independent Contractors Australia found that, had the Victorian plant been completed with broadly the same cost-effectiveness as the Perth plant, the project should have totalled no more than $2 billion. Labour costs were locked in at an extraordinary level under a greenfields bargaining agreement struck in 2009 between the head contractor Thiess Degremont, the AMWU, the AWU, the CEPU and the CFMEU. This agreement allowed for 26 rostered days off, 12 public holidays, a picnic day, and fixed long weekends that coincide with the RDOs. It included not only superannuation and long service leave, a 17½ per cent holiday loading and annual leave, but also termination pay of an extra couple of weeks, a redundancy allowance of $5.44 per hour, clothing allowance, spectacle allowance, and six-monthly pay increases totalling approximately $200 per week. An extraordinary element was a tax-free living-away-from-home allowance of $700 per week, or $36,400 annually. Wonthaggi is barely 75 minutes drive from the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. This was struck at a time when the going rate for living-away-from-home allowances in genuinely remote areas such as the Pilbara was $400 per week. Wages at the plant were reliably estimated to be 40 per cent—40 per cent!—higher than those found at desalination plants interstate, providing trade workers with $150,000 annual salaries before factoring in the generous conditions and allowances.


For instance, a carpenter under the agreement earned more than $200,000 in wages and benefits—roughly twice the income of a school principal. Worse still, under the terms of the agreement the only direction in which wages could move would be higher. The greenfields agreement covering the plant's construction contained a clause stating that Thiess could only engage contractors who applied wages and conditions no less favourable than the wages and conditions provided for in the agreement for similar or equivalent work. Now, the effect of this clause is to remove competition between subcontractors entirely from the tendering process.


The desalination agreement locked in considerably higher increases in remuneration than those under standard CFMEU industry EBAs. Wages increased in six-monthly increments of 2½ per cent over three years, a total of 15 per cent over three years. Under the standard EBA wages increased by a lesser amount, while allowances were linked to CPI.


A lack of transparency in the tendering process added to concerns. The winning bid from the AquaSure consortium, which included Degremont Australia, Macquarie Capital and Thiess, was in fact higher—higher!—than the losing bid from John Holland. Industrial relations commentator Robert Gottliebsen wrote that the Leighton subsidiary John Holland, which had not done the deal from hell with the unions, actually tendered a lower price for the desalination plant than Leighton's other construction subsidiary Theiss. But the Victorian government took the higher tender. It took the higher tender to look after its union mates who had secured this truly amazing deal from the Theiss-Leighton subsidiary. Leighton also gave some iron-clad price guarantees.


There is an enormous cultural difference between John Holland and Theiss, which gives the union what they want because they can add it on to the price, management style. Clearly, Thiess was awarded the project, at least in part, on the basis that it would assuage union demands and avoid disruptive industrial action. In turn, Thiess signed on to a clause that would ensure the terms of its 'peace at any price' deal were reflected in all contractors connected to the plant, negating any chance of competition. The cruel irony for Thiess and for the Victorian taxpayers is that despite such efforts, the project was fraught with strikes and other delays that ended up costing Thiess over $1 billion.


This is only one of many possible examples, but it is just as pertinent as the rest. To those opposite today I say that while Labor did not support its two million union members last night in voting against the registered organisations bill, there is still a chance to do so here. There is still a chance for you to do so today. These are your constituents; these are the people you represent. It is your responsibility to do right by them. Vote for this legislation. Vote for this legislation so that we can return the rule of law to our construction sector. Vote for this legislation to make our construction sites safer, to make our construction sites fairer and to make our construction sites free of coercion and free of intimidation and, so importantly, to improve competition in the construction industry—not just in Victoria but all over Australia.


Allow Australia to build the vital infrastructure it needs in a fair and cost-effective manner. This is the only way; it is the proven way to ensure that the Australian economy has the chance to flourish, to thrive and to prosper.

Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (13:29):  I, too, rise to speak on the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 and the Building and Construction Industry (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013, because, whilst a lot of people have talked about workplaces and costs and other things, it is not until you actually start putting it into the perspective of things that people consider to be important that you understand just how critical these issues are. Looking at the Defence budget, the defence white paper looks at the amount of investment that is going to go into infrastructure—we are talking civil works and building works—and if you look at the actual dollar figure over the next 10 years, for the first time we actually have a very clear picture, because of the way this white paper and the Integrated Investment Plan has been put together, of the actual amount that is going to be spent on infrastructure, and it is in the tens of billions of dollars. If you overlay that at the same time with various reports that have been made by external accounting companies, and also a recent report by the Menzies Research Centre, what you see is that the scale of the inefficiencies can be anything from around 10 per cent up towards 30 per cent. I am a conservative kind of guy so I will take the lower figure of that. But even if you take that 10 per cent figure, what you realise is that you can very quickly show that lawlessness on worksites stands to cost the Australian taxpayer, in the Defence portfolio, some billions of dollars.


If you consider that one of the most recent acquisitions for the Navy, the Romeo helicopter, which is considered to be one of the world's best submarine-hunting helicopters, was acquired at less than $2 billion, what you see is that Defence would have to be spending billions of dollars—so potentially another whole fleet of helicopters, which means a whole area of capability—unnecessarily, if the inefficiencies in our construction sector continue. So with MYEFO coming up, when we are looking, potentially, at the kind of budget issues such as the structural spending that has been locked in for a number of years now, and that we have sought in this place to undo, budget pressure is going to come on and that is going to impact on the money we want to spend on road infrastructure, on hospitals, on schools, or on our defence budget. It is inexcusable that we would expect the Australian public to be seeing a department of this government spending billions of dollars unnecessarily on infrastructure, when they could have the same infrastructure at a lower cost and return that money either to the Defence budget so that we could procure more capability we need, or, more likely, actually return that money to consolidated revenue so it could go into any number of other areas that Australians believe are important.


In South Australia, the state Labor government has commissioned a hospital that is reported by various people to be one of the world's most expensive buildings in terms of the dollar cost per square metre of the building. I note that it is still not open, well after its due date, and it may be quite a few months if not late next year before we finally see patients in there. But even that, the most expensive building in the world, is still cheaper than the money that Defence will have to spend unnecessarily on infrastructure works it is doing if the ABCC bill is not passed.


So, as people consider this bill what I would invite them to do is consider the fact that this bill is not going to impact on workplace safety. This bill is all about getting rid of the lawlessness on worksites that we see reported week after week in the media. We see union officials in court being charged with various offences, and we see the cost impacts. With those figures I talked about for the Menzies Research Centre, I took their lower estimate. If you took their upper estimate of around 30 per cent, and that is less than other estimates which are the artificially inflated costs for construction in Australia, then the Australian taxpayer will be unnecessarily spending between $7 billion and $8 billion on the Defence budget alone. Mr Acting Deputy President, you are reasonable man, and so I ask you how could we expect the Australian taxpayer to think that that was a good use of the money which we are stewarding on their behalf? Speaking for myself and for this side of the chamber, we cannot—it is indefensible. 


We cannot allow the lawlessness to continue on worksites. It creates the kind of inefficiencies that artificially bump up those prices so that people in our departments who are spending money on infrastructure have to spend unnecessary money. Sometimes people say to me, 'What do you mean by inefficiencies?' What are some of the examples when people talk about inefficiencies? Some of the stories that have been reported are things like concrete pours, where the pour starts and then somebody comes along and says, 'Stop the pour.' It could be there is a workplace condition which they do not believe has been met; or perhaps they are unhappy with the employer because he has not signed the agreement that gives them the leave they want. As you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, the media has recently been reporting agreements signed between some of the large construction companies and the CFMEU which give quite large pay rises and all kinds of additional leave. The critical thing is the action on the worksite. If you imagine the cost and the time of doing a large pour which is disrupted part way through such that it has to stop, you then have remedial works to extract that which has already been poured and redo all the formwork or to do additional engineering works to work out whether it is even possible to continue the pour at a later time. There is also the issue of concrete that is perhaps waiting in trucks just off the site and what happens to that. 


One simple act on one day on the worksite can set back a project weeks in time and tens of thousands of dollars in money. Those kinds of actions are pursued in an almost bloody-minded manner by some unions and then there are the illegal actions—the blockading, the bullying of people on worksites. All those sorts of things have an impact which can lead to five, 10 and up to 30 per cent inefficiency on our civil construction sites. As I say, when you look at something like the Defence budget, where we are finally restoring the funding for Defence and, for the first time ever, we are not just calculating the cost of buying the equipment over 10 years—that is an easy thing. People like to say, 'These many tanks or planes or ships will cost us whatever,' but that is not a real capability unless you have the infrastructure behind it—whether that is new runways or new hangers or new wharves that are required. It is all that infrastructure spending that Defence will be doing that is critical in building the Defence capability that we need to have. 


Why should the Australian taxpayer accept the fact that the votes of 30-odd people in this Senate could cost the country billions of dollars that it does not have to spend? How can that be justified? The Australian public quite rightly should be asking the question: why does the Defence department have to spend billions of dollars unnecessarily because of the decision of 30-odd people in the Senate chamber who decide to support, in this case, the CFMEU, which has been widely reported and acknowledged as one of the unions with the worst record of illegal activity and people who are before the courts as a result of that illegal activity and have complete disregard for the law? If there was a valid reason—if all of these things were actually changing the safety outcomes—there might be even part of the case. But, given the costs and the disruption and the fact that it is not having that effect, this is not about workplace safety. And there are lots of reports—longitudinal studies and reports about rates of accidents—that show that this change is not about safety. This change is about increasing the productivity and the lawful behaviour on work sites. 


Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, I would encourage you and people on your side of the chamber, as you go back and speak to your constituents at the end of this week and over the weekend, as you hear the calls for funding, whether it is in legal and community services, health, or road infrastructure, to think of the billions of dollars that your votes will constrain spending, in this case, by the defence department, completely unnecessarily. It should not be so. The nation entrusts the moneys that we raise through tax to us as parliamentarians and the executive government to spend wisely on their behalf. This is not a good use of that money, and it is not good to see billions of dollars spent unnecessarily. 


I conclude my contribution by drawing people's attention back to something they think is important. Everyone says: 'Great. We love to see you spending more on defence. It is great you are going be able to spend up to two per cent of GDP on defence. It is about time we did that.' But they may not understand that there are billions of dollars that have to go into infrastructure, tens of billions of dollars that we know we will be spending over the next 10 years and billions that are unnecessarily being wasted because of the illegal activity and inefficiency on worksites. I would ask those of you on the other side of the chamber to decide whether your 30-odd votes are actually in the national interests or whether they are purely in the interests of the union movement, as so many of you are here, I understand, because of their patronage and support.


At the end of the day, each of us is here predominantly in the national interest. If we are not here in the national interest, then we should be considering our positions. I will certainly be supporting this bill because it is in the national interest of this country to have safe but efficient and effective workplaces so that we can attract investment, create jobs and build a better nation not only for ourselves but, more importantly, for the generations to come.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2016-11-22,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (13:42):  What we have here is the Prime Minister's get-out-of-jail-free card. It is safe territory for the Prime Minister. He has clearly besieged at the moment. He is leading a party that is incredibly divided, and divided on all sorts of issues. But there is one thing that unites the Tories, and it is making sure that you do all you can to dump on the union movement—a bit of good old-fashioned union bashing! Nothing brings those disparate voices within the coalition closer together than a bit of good old-fashioned union bashing. 


Do you remember it was the reason we went to the double dissolution election? A lot of people have forgotten, because it was the legislation that dare not speak its name. It was the trigger for the double dissolution election—not a peep for the entire duration of that election campaign and not a peep for months afterwards. And so here we are, on the back of a late-night sitting last night, with legislation rammed through thanks to the support of the crossbench and people like Nick Xenophon who thought this legislation was so critical that after five months we had to sit until three in the morning to pass it. And here we are now, debating the abolition of the ABCC. 


When it comes to tackling corruption in this country, the government is not interested in tax manipulation or scandals. We have heard about lots of them within the banking and the financial sector. They are not interested in corruption within the Public Service. We have heard evidence of that, with many examples within state parliaments. The government seems only interested in tackling wrongdoing by its ideological foes—that is, when working people come together under the banner of the union movement. 


We have heard time and time again about the misconduct and conflicted incentives in the banking industry. That is actually having a material impact on the lives of ordinary people. This is actually ruining people's lives; it is eroding their life savings and it means that many of them, when they face injury or the death of a loved one, are unable to get the sort of support and assistance they believe that they paid for. And yet we have the government refusing to support the Greens' calls for a royal commission into the big banks and the financial sector. Instead, what they want to do is to make life easier for unscrupulous employers and harder for ordinary working people.


I will just say to them: if you are so concerned about the issue of widespread corruption, why not get behind the Greens' call for an anticorruption watchdog? It is something that would have the capacity to look right across different sectors within our economy, not just at employees and unions but at employers, and not just at the construction industry but right across the economy—including the work that we do here in this parliament. But instead of supporting the creation of a national anticorruption watchdog what we have is the government intent on coming together and uniting a party room that is incredibly divided and, of course, resorting to its get-out-of-jail-free card: a good old-fashioned bit of union bashing.


The question we have to ask ourselves is, 'How did we get here?' Of course, we still are not clear about where crossbenchers are and we are not clear about what amendments have been negotiated. We are not sure about the role of regulation through extensive legal coercion powers. It is, unfortunately, much like last night: a bit of a black box at the moment. And let us be clear about what we are trying to protect: we are here to protect ordinary working people coming together, looking to defend their rights at work. Remember that the trade unions were founded with the purpose of protecting the rights and interests of the workers that they represent. Unions are nothing other than a collection of workers organising to ensure that their rights are represented in what is often an unfair and unequal playing field.


We hear time and time again that when things go wrong in workplaces it is the unions that actually step up and help to look after those people affected within the workplace. And this is true within the building and construction industry. We know that construction workplaces are unsafe. We know that there are many people who do not return home after being injured at work, and we know that some of them come to very serious harm. We know that families are left grieving because of unsafe workplaces, and it is the role of the construction union to ensure safety within the workplace.


What this bill does is give workers in the construction industry fewer rights at work because of the industry they work in. We are just singling out one industry and saying, 'Because you work in that industry we're going to strip away some very basic rights and we're going to make your industry the target of laws that no other industry is subjected to.' With this bill the government wants to set up what is effectively a new secret police within the construction industry. They are going to have the right to take workers off site, to pull them in for questioning and to demand answers of them. They are not going to have the right to silence—a basic right afforded to common criminals. They will not be able to talk to others about the fact they have been pulled in for secret questioning.


And let's look at the justification. You would think that with laws this draconian and this extreme that, clearly, there must be widespread evidence of gross malfeasance. When you are going to use such a big sledgehammer, what is the justification? What is it? No-one is suggesting that there are not issues in the construction industry—of course there are. As I said, there are people injured and dying, tragically, on construction work sites every week. There are many workers coming in from overseas or who are being exploited, working on $10 or $12 an hour. The government could be working to stamp out sham contracting. Even the title of the bill, the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013, is confused and untargeted.


Let us remember this: when the Australian Building and Construction Commission existed, productivity in the construction industry flatlined. Once the commission was abolished, we saw productivity increase. Again, let us look at what the experience was when the Australian Building and Construction Commission was established under a previous government. We saw that productivity was flat and, when the commission was abolished, we saw a significant increase in productivity. What kind of wider economic effect is the government seriously expecting from this legislation? What is going to be the impact of this legislation? The answer is 'none'. If past experience tells us anything, it is that this bill is not about productivity. It is not about corruption. It is not about anything other than a targeted, ideological attack on the opposition. This parliament should not be so narrow and so petty that, as the centrepiece of the government's legislative agenda, it chooses to confront an issue like this. If this is the peak, if this is at the centre of the government's legislative agenda, then this is going to be a period of government with a clear lack of any coherent vision, a period of government that will be unproductive and a period of government that ignores the challenges that face us as a nation.


We could focus on the great challenges that lie ahead of us: catastrophic climate change and the role that Australia could be playing in bringing down our emissions, creating jobs and investment in those regional communities who so desperately need them and creating international investment around the renewable energy sector. We could recognise that we have huge challenges when it comes to addressing the structural problems within the budget. We have a revenue crisis, but we have an opportunity to be able to pay for the services and the foundations of a decent society through ending the rorts of negative gearing and capital gains tax, ending multinational tax avoidance and ensuring that we do not provide tax cuts to the wealthiest Australians—instead raising revenue from those people who can afford it most. Instead of dealing with those challenges, we have a government with no agenda, no plan and no vision, looking to unite a divided party room over a piece of legislation that strips away basic rights for ordinary working people.


The Australian Greens will oppose this legislation. We will ensure that we do whatever we can to strengthen the rights of people at work, rather than to weaken them.

Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (13:52):  Four letters triggered a double dissolution and a federal election on 2 July—though the government hardly mentioned those four letters, ABCC, during the marathon election campaign. I will give this bill its official name: the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013. It is from 2013—that is more than three years of gestation. There have been thousands of words on both sides over the months and over the years—union bashing and union championing—and I do not intend to go back through it all. But I will make several points and refer to amendments that I have put to the government to improve the bill and to allay some of the opposition's fears—I hope. My comments reflect what I repeated during the auditors and whistleblower amendments yesterday: I am pro worker and anti corruption.


In reaching my position on this bill and the proffered amendments, I have spent a lot of time with ministers, shadow ministers, union officials—including the CFMEU, several times—and other senators. I will be voting for the amended bill, if the planned amendments pass in this chamber. If the bill is not properly amended, I am not afraid to vote it down. In my discussions with government ministers and the opposition, I have concentrated on several areas. I want to deal with them, but not in any order of priority or importance.


One major area is the protection of sub-contractors—the subbies. Too often, they are left holding the bag. Confected disputes over supposedly shoddy work or missed completion deadlines can see money—earned money—going from A to B but not getting to C. Sometimes it is a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul in a stalling tactic which might otherwise see a boss guilty of trading while insolvent. A fast-track tribunal hearing with the disputed money held in trust is good idea and a possible solution, I believe. So I agree with Senator Cameron when he said earlier today that we must improve payment protection for the subcontractors. I also agree with him that we need incentives to encourage employers to take on more apprentices. 


Another issue that has cropped up regularly in recent weeks is retrospectivity. A number of big companies that have signed five-year EBAs in recent times have expressed concerns that they could in future be locked out of government contracts. Of course, the other argument is that these bills have been around for a couple of years and so everybody on either side of the industry, contractors and the unions, are very well aware of all the details. With this and other pieces of legislation I do not like retrospective legislation of any kind, but maybe six months could be the buffer. So, with question time coming up, that is where I stand, and I will say, like last night, that with the auditors and the whistleblower amendments I got here to this position without making any deals with either side.

Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Chief Government Whip in the Senate) (13:56):  I rise also to make a contribution on these bills—the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 and the Building and Construction Industry (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013. As you would be fully aware, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, the construction industry is vital to Australia's economy. It contributes to employment, productivity and to just about any aspect of the economy that you care to think of. The construction industry is vital and at the heart of it. It builds the offices, apartments, roads, shopping centres, hospitals, universities, schools, airports and other infrastructure that every single Australian uses every single day. In that sense, it is also Australia's third-largest industry, which highlights the significance of the construction industry to the economy. It contributes eight per cent to gross domestic product. I mentioned also that it employs people. In fact it employs nearly 1.1 million Australians. There are more than 300,000 small businesses in the building industry. They can be from sole trader plumbers and electricians up to very, very large companies that are involved in construction, employing many hundreds and in some cases thousands of Australians.


But there is a big problem with the construction industry in Australia as it stands today. There is a toxic culture in the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, which causes this big problem in the construction industry. This big problem creates issues that flow right through the economy, and that undermines the positive effect that the construction industry has on the Australian economy that I was referring to before.


As at October 2016, just last month, there were 113 CFMEU officials before the courts for more than 1,100 suspected contraventions. In recent years, the courts have imposed more than $8 million in fines on the CFMEU's lawbreaking. In the words of a Federal Court judge, the CFMEU's record of noncompliance with the law is 'notorious', and their record 'ought to be an embarrassment to the trade union movement.'


I would have thought that every single member of the trade union movement who is a member because they want to do the right thing by the workers and ensure that workers' rights are appropriately protected and looked after would consider those quotes by that judge, and the other evidence that backs up the big problem I am talking about, abhorrent. They would also reject those problems that we see, as demonstrated by the findings about the CFMEU and other unions.


How does this play out? What costs does this impose on our economy? Currently around two out of three working days lost from industrial disputes are in the construction industry. Given that that the construction industry represents about eight per cent of our GDP, the fact that 66 per cent— (Time expired)

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (12:32):  I rise to oppose the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 on behalf of the Labor Party. This is just another element of this government's antiworker agenda. It is another element of their anti-union agenda. This bill is a significant attack on Australia's working class. The bill is the product of the coalition's ideological hatred for collective bargaining and workplace rights. Decent bargaining rights, the capacity to increase wages and conditions, the right to be treated with dignity and respect when you clock on at work are threatened by this government and by this legislation. Even the International Monetary Fund has recognised that unions are the bulwark—the barrier—against increased inequality. Yet this mob do not care. They simply want to see the destruction of collective bargaining and union rights in this country.


The coalition has used a royal commission with politically generated terms of reference and a compliant royal commissioner to deliver recommendations that weaken collective bargaining and working people's rights. The royal commissioner, Dyson Heydon, was biased and demonstrated his determination to deliver the coalition government's agenda during the conduct of the commission. It is a sad and disappointing end to Royal Commissioner Heydon's public career. 


The party which gave us John Howard, Tony Abbott, Peter Reith and Work Choices can never be trusted. The party which gave us the 2014 budget, hacking away at welfare in this country, hacking away at support for families, hacking away at pensions—this is a government that cannot be trusted. The party which supported workers being unfairly dismissed cannot be trusted. This is the party which said: 'If you are a small company, you can unfairly dismiss someone. Unfair dismissal is okay.' This mob cannot be trusted on any of these issues. The party which wants to destroy penalty rates and annual leave loading cannot be trusted.


The party who lost 10 MPs as a result of a New South Wales ICAC inquiry—Liberal MPs were systematically breaking the law by accepting donations from developers—cannot be trusted. You never hear them talking about upholding the law anywhere else except in the building and construction industry. They are a law-free zone when it comes to every other area. The Liberal Party, whose MP was busted accepting illegal cash payments in a brown paper bag in the back seat of a building developer's Bentley in Newcastle, surely cannot be trusted.


The Turnbull government are a divided disgrace. They are a rabble who are disunited and at war with each other. The only things that bring them together are attacks on minority groups and the workers of this country. The only time you see them getting excited about anything is when they are attacking workers, attacking pensioners, attacking multiculturalism and attacking the rights of working people in this country. That is when they get excited. That is when they start jumping up and down. They do not get excited about anything else. They are certainly not excited about the current Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull. They are not very excited about him at all, and why would they be? What a disappointment that guy is.


The Turnbull government has ignored one of the biggest problems in the building and construction industry—that is, the non-payment of contractors, subcontractors and employees for work that they carry out. The recent Labor initiated inquiry into security of payments in the building and construction industry has been ignored by this government, even though the recommendations brought forward by Labor would commence a process to resolve the non-payment of $3 billion a year to hardworking Australians in the industry. The evidence before the committee was compelling that the non-payment for work carried out by workers, contractors and small businesses in the building and construction industry—not being paid for the work they had done—creates industrial disputes, under-resourced companies, declining productivity, unsafe workplaces, bankruptcies and suicides. We heard evidence of a Perth builder committing suicide. He had a successful business. One of the tier 1 contractors would not pay what they owed him and he committed suicide because of the stress. It was an outrageous proposition.


The coalition have had this report in their hands for months and they have done nothing about it. If you could solve that one problem in the industry, you would solve much of the industrial disputation as unions try to make sure that their members get paid and are not ripped off by pyramid contracting and by phoenix companies closing down one day and rebirthing the next day. They do nothing about it—absolutely nothing. All they want to do is hammer the trade union movement and try to diminish collective bargaining in the industry. 


The bills do nothing for what is recognised by the Labor Party and participants in the industry as a fundamental fault in the building and construction industry that needs to be resolved. It would be far more productive and it would be in the interests of the industry and its workforce if we were discussing legislation that provided security of payments in the industry rather than an ideological attack on workers through the proposed ABCC.


These bills and their predecessors have been discussed ad nauseam in the last few years. I have been involved in a number of inquiries that have exposed the lies being perpetrated by the coalition that these bills will increase productivity, reduce industrial disputation and usher in a new era of industrial calm in the industry. You only have to read some of the comments that have been made publicly in the last few weeks about the attacks on collective bargaining through the implementation of what is called the Building Industry Code.


A fundamental part of this bill is a code that has been established to determine how Australian workers are allowed to bargain with their employer, and how employers are allowed to bargain with their employees. I do not know of anything else like it anywhere in the world, yet in Australia under the coalition government, as an attack on collective bargaining, they are prepared to put in charge of determining whether companies and unions have been bargaining effectively a person who has never bargained in his life. He is an ex-Federal Police officer who worked with the Royal Ulster Constabulary and has been involved in all sorts of issues, but not bargaining. He knows nothing about it, and he has been given, under this bill, the opportunity to determine bargaining outcomes for workers. There has been lots of analysis done on the code, but the key findings in relation to the issues in the code are that it is highly objectionable as it contains restrictions on legitimate industrial relations practices that are lawful in every other country. No other country has a code like this in place. There is a booming construction industry out there, and that certainly undermines the government's justification for what is happening. The industry is booming, and that is under the laws without any changes. There is no need for this act that they would have.


The code adversely impacts the number of apprentices. Over 27 years as a full-time union official, I have negotiated many, many agreements over many years, and one of the things that my union, the metalworkers union, used to do was say, 'Let's negotiate with the boss to try and get some more apprentices on the job to give young kids a chance in the industry and an opportunity for an apprenticeship and a trade.' We wrote that into agreements all over the country, and we wrote into those agreements decent wages and decent conditions for the apprentices, because not only was that an investment in the future for the company but it actually increased the productivity and skill base for the industry in the future. Any of the crossbenchers that are here at the moment or listening in should understand that, if you back this in, you are denying unions and workers collectively the ability to negotiate to get more apprentices on the job and give young Australian workers an opportunity to get an apprenticeship and a trade. That is a key part of this legislation through the code, and you should understand what you are going to do if you back this in. You are taking opportunities away from young Australians, and that would be an absolute disgrace.


The code impacts more businesses and more workers in more harsh ways than ever before. It places more bureaucracy on businesses large and small, and it will dampen growth; there is no doubt about that. The code disproportionately impacts women, older workers and unions. Some of the commentary that has been out there recently is that, if this code comes in and the agreements that are out there—thousands of agreements across the industry—become noncompliant then what you are actually achieving is a bargaining round of a size you have never seen before for many years in this industry, because the unions will be entitled to go out, if the code and this bill determine that their agreements are no longer lawful, and bargain for new agreements. So there will be disruption across the industry, and that would be a disaster. That would be absolute stupidity from this government, and that is another reason why we should not put this bill in.


I spoke earlier about the head of the fair work building commission—the person who will probably head up the ABCC and the hero of the extreme Right in industrial relations—Mr Nigel Hadgkiss. This is a man who has never negotiated an industrial agreement in his life, but who will have control of the code under this government's proposal to dismantle collective bargaining in the industry. This is a man who has treated the Senate with absolute contempt. This is a man who is simply a puppet of the coalition. He was an appointee of Senator Abetz when Senator Abetz was the IR minister. Senator Abetz appointed this man because of his right-wing views. He has set about trying to ensure that he is not subject to accountability, as are other public servants and other heads of government business organisations. He has continually defied the estimates process and the call from this Senate itself to provide details of what he is doing and what he is spending money on.


This guy is really unfit for the job. If you agree with this bill, you will be putting in charge of this ABCC, with more powers than ever, someone who is entirely unsuited to the job of applying a fair, reasonable and unbiased approach to working people in the industry. The agency that he heads up has great power over working people. I just think it is terrible that he would not advise the Senate estimates committee on the issues that every other head of department and every other head of an agency do as a matter of course at estimates.


He reported in one of his annual reports that he had visited 50 companies and gone to 50 boardroom meetings. He expended public money to go to those boardroom meetings. When I asked in the estimates process, 'Who did you meet and what did you do?' he basically said, 'None of your business.' Well, it is the Senate's business. This guy has no understanding of his obligations as a public servant or of his obligations to the Parliament of Australia. He treats it with absolute contempt.


He said, 'I don't have a diary.' He could sit down and write a report and remember that he had met 50 companies in 50 boardrooms, but he could not tell us who they were, he could not tell us when he went there and he could not tell us who he met with because he claimed he does not keep a diary. It is just unbelievable for a senior officer of a government agency not to have a diary. In fact, I think it breaches a lot of Public Service requirements.


So this is the guy who sets about telling the Senate, 'I'm not telling you what I am spending money on.' We asked him, 'Who are you employing?' He employs a lot of former Federal Police officers and New South Wales and Victorian police officers in the agency, but he will not tell us what the make-up is so that the public, who pay the bills, can understand what is going on.


The worst part about this guy is that he sets about denying right of entry for union officials to sites to deal with health and safety issues. It was clear recently. On 25 November 2015 two Irish backpackers were employed on the Jaxon site in Bennett Street, East Perth: Gerry Bradley and Joe McDermott. They were out here on working holiday visas. They were sitting, having their morning tea, and they were crushed to death under a concrete block. I met the parents, the brother and sisters, and the partner, and it was tragic. Part of the problem was the union could not get on that site to deal with proper health and safety issues because of the fair work building commission bill. It will be even harder under the bill that is being proposed.


In Senate estimates they would not answer up-front; they took questions on notice. We finally got some facts back from them. What came out in Senate Estimates was that there were six Jaxon jobs in Perth at the time and the union had raised serious safety issues about Jaxon. It was confirmed that fair work building commission inspectors had visited three times the site where Gerry and Joe were killed. That was about keeping the unions off the job. There were 11 requests to the WorkSafe commission to attend Jaxon sites over two years. But what we do know is, if you are a construction worker in Perth and you have serious safety failures and you want them fixed, you are more likely to get a visit from a fair work building commission inspector helping the boss to keep the union off the job than you are to get a visit from the safety regulator.


The other day a 27-year-old German backpacker working on a Western Australian construction site fell 13 floors to her death. The site is run by notorious anti-union company Hanssen, whose managing director, Gerry Hanssen, is well known for his anti-union position. So it is absolutely essential that unions get access to look after the safety of workers on the site, whether they are backpackers, 457 visa workers, Australian workers or apprentice. There should be access to those sites. The systematic approach of keeping the unions off the site through Nigel Hadgkiss and his biased approach at Fair Work Building and Construction should be stopped.


But it is not just the Labor Party that is seeing that there are problems with this new bill. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, which has the job to oversight these bills, said that there are a number of examples where human rights are diminished under this bill, such as allowing officers into residential premises without a warrant. The fair work building commission has greater rights than the police force in terms of entering properties. The police force needs a warrant—not the fair work building commission. They do not need a warrant to enter residential premises. The bill trespasses on personal rights and liberties and reverses the onus of proof. This is a bad bill. This is bad legislation. It is based on a government wanting to reduce the rights and capacity of ordinary workers to get a decent living in this country, and it is all on the basis of looking after the big end of town and big business. You should reject this bill as bad legislation. It is a bad bill. (Time expired)

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2016-11-22,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (12:52):  I rise to speak on the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 and the Building and Construction Industry (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013. Today is another day under the Turnbull government and another day of brutal attacks on working people. Yesterday we saw in this parliament a debate on the registered organisations bill—a bill to damage unions, to tie them up in red tape, to make it difficult for them to do their work representing working people and for working people to collectively organise. 


What we are seeing today is a targeted attack on one particular group of workers: construction workers. The workers who don those fluoro jackets that are so popular with the likes of Mr Turnbull and many of his ministers. They use those fluoros when it is convenient. But, when it comes to ensuring that the workers who are building our hospitals, our homes, our schools and the infrastructure we need to drive this country are still alive at the end of the day and can come home, they are not interested. What they are interested in in driving forward with the ABCC legislation is, again, delivering for their corporate mates, for the people who have put them into office, for those who have given them millions and millions of dollars in donations. What is going on here is a very ugly story. If it were happening in another country, it would be called out and out corruption where a government comes into office and delivers for those who have, over the years, put millions of dollars into getting them elected, by weakening the laws to benefit the profit line of those companies.


This issue about the rights of construction workers is very important. I will come to it in more detail in a moment, but right now I want to deal with this issue of safety. We know that in the period the ABCC was operating—under the legislation that was in force previously—more people died, particularly young male workers whose families thought they would see them again, but they did not come home. It is absolutely sickening, really deeply sickening. The figures bear this out. In 2005, just before the ABCC came in, the number of fatalities on building sites had actually been dropping: it was around 3.51 per 100,000. By 2007 it had risen to 4.7 per 100,000. It has been well documented that the ABCC puts lives at risk. It puts lives at risk because it is harder for construction workers to organise and harder for the CFMEU to be active on building sites. We have heard the minister proudly denounce CFMEU officials for trying to get onto building sites. They are trying to get onto those building sites to ensure the sites are safe. That is why more people died when the ABCC was in operation. I congratulate the CFMEU for its activities in working to improve the working conditions and pay of construction workers and for the work that it does to ensure that the people who build our homes, our schools and our hospitals come home at the end of the day. We all go home, and they should have the right to. So what we need—



Senator Williams interjecting—




Senator RHIANNON:
  I am happy to take the interjection always, Senator Williams. Why is the government—you would know this from your background, Senator Williams—obsessed with bringing in this legislation? Why does it want to deliver for the companies that give them so much backing? This is not coming just from a position of an obsession with marketplace Thatcherite ideology.


There is a real aspect of self-interest for the Turnbull government. The self-interest I am referring to is in the political donations that it picks up. The Greens' Democracy For Sale project has just been expanded. It has identified that since 1998, which is when political donations started to be recorded. to 2015 the property development industry has donated $64 million. It comes from a range of companies, from property developers, construction companies and related companies. The bulk of that $64 million goes to the Liberal and National parties, so it is not surprising that Senator Williams interjects. These issues are getting a bit close to the bone when we start making the links between the money coming in and how the government delivers. How does it deliver? It is delivering right now with this ABCC legislation. It has delivered in other ways. We have seen it in state parliaments, where the coalition weaken planning laws.


In New South Wales we had a fine piece of legislation that was introduced off the back of the very impressive green ban movements and resident action groups that were all over Sydney and other urban areas in the 1970s. They had such a strong voice that when the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act was introduced into New South Wales in 1979 the Premier of New South Wales actually paid tribute to the green ban movement and the resident action groups and said a foundation of planning has to be consultation with the community. But what did we see? When the next Labor government, the Carr Labor government, came in, hand in hand with the Liberals and Nationals in New South Wales, every year there would be amendments to weaken that legislation. Who benefited? The developers. At the very same time we were seeing a weakening of the planning laws.


I do not know what deals went on with donors behind closed doors with regard to the last election, when the Turnbull government barely scraped in. From what I understand, the examples that Senator Cameron and I have spoken about with regard to the Newcastle incident, where paper bags of money from developers were handed over to some Liberal politicians, are not actually such a common way of buying favours these days. I refer senators to the High Court case I have spoken about before. But the trend now is that the culture of the major political parties is: how do we deliver for our donors? Rather than governing for the common good—the public good—they think, 'Well, what will make our donors happy?' All the people sitting on the government side know that, with the ABCC legislation, they will be getting slaps on the back. They will be favoured at all their cocktail parties. They will be the centre of attention if this legislation goes through, and in no way should it go through. It is damaging legislation not just for construction workers who might be injured or might die and whose families would grieve; it is damaging to the fabric of Australia.


Why go after the CFMEU? Why have the ABCC legislation come in? Yes, the CFMEU is a radical and militant union, it is well organised and it is out there winning good conditions and pay for its members. If you weaken that union, you start to weaken the union movement across the board. Again, it is another way for this government to deliver for its constituency, the big companies that it works with so closely.


So this is a piece of legislation that we have great concern about. Is it a coincidence that the for-profit sector that gave the most money to the coalition will benefit the most from the ABCC? We need to start asking that question. I will keep raising it, because we need to focus on what is actually going on here. The government's stubborn attempts to revive this legislation mean the attacks from the ABCC on construction workers are well documented, and they are worth reiterating.


First, I would just like to go through some of the myths that the government has peddled. The government claims that the ABCC will improve productivity. That is always a favourite, but it is false. Even the sham Heydon royal commission noted that studies did not provide credible evidence that the previous ABCC regimes increased productivity.


The government claims the ABCC is about criminality and corruption. Being in this place with the likes of Senator McKenzie, Senator Cash and Senator Abetz when he had the job, I say: seriously! So many of those examples that I gave were, I would say, trumped up. So many of them involved CFMEU delegates and officials doing their job. Again I will say that I am not excusing criminality. I am not letting them off the hook. We know that the laws are in place to deal with that. Yes, it is a rough and tumble industry and, yes, people swear on building sites, but what those representatives of the government have been going on about is so often people, including construction workers, out there to save lives and get some decent pay for these construction workers when they go home. They are actually doing their job.


The argument about criminality and corruption is another one that is not true. The ABCC has no power to investigate corruption or allegations of a criminal nature. You would think again, from listening to the representatives from the government, that the ship would turn around and now we would have this wonderful body that can get out there and investigate these shocking crimes like construction workers having stickers on their hats and maybe swearing on a picket line. But no. That is not what it is up to.


The government claims the ABCC will not breach civil liberties. Again, this is wrong. Workers will be forced to be silent about questioning. For those senators who are still thinking about what their position should be, I would really ask them to consider this aspect of the legislation we are debating here. Workers will be forced to be silent about questioning. That means they cannot talk to anybody. This is Australia in 2016, and we are debating a law in the federal parliament that might do that to workers in this country. To do it to anybody is wrong. Workers will no longer have the right to silence or protection from self-incrimination. People have fought for those legal rights, and our forebears in our parliaments have passed legislation to ensure that was the case, but we are on the cusp of unwinding that. And why? Because this government works so closely with construction companies and developers that it has moved totally away from what the public good means and what one should be doing when one comes into government.


The ABCC also reverses the onus of proof, forcing workers to prove that they are acting within the law—again, a huge change to how our legal system works, something that we all should be questioning and not accepting. The government claims that the ABCC will improve safety. I have shared with you some of the figures on that—figures showing something deeply alarming: that many people who go off and don their fluoro for real reasons do not come home, because it is a very, very dangerous industry. This is probably the worst of the lies, because we are dealing with people's lives—their families, their friends, the wellbeing of so many people—because when one person dies on a construction site, so many people suffer.


During the last version of the ABCC—and I want to go through this again, just to really emphasise these figures—deaths on construction sites increased, reaching a peak of 45 lives lost in 2007—one industry, 45 lives lost. Why were they lost? Often these are very young workers. They go on the job and the boss tells them to go and do things and they do not know what their rights are. They do not really want to challenge it when they are not too sure. They want to keep their jobs. And what ends up happening? As Senator Cameron described, a concrete slab falls on them. He told us about the tragedy in Perth, and I relayed a similar incident that happened in Queensland. It sounds like they actually saw the concrete slab coming towards them—just horrendous. Surely there is some humanity here on the government benches to consider this.


In 2013, after the ABCC was replaced, the number of deaths in one year dropped to 17. Still, that is 17 tragedies—many more, because all those people would have had loved ones who would still be grieving for them. But it was a vast improvement. The weeks since the Prime Minister's attempted power play, setting up the special sitting of parliament, have exposed that this government's supposed concern over corruption and wrongdoing within the construction industry really is farcical. It is a cover. As I said in the debate on registered organisations, the government cannot come in here and be honest about why it is introducing this. If it were honest, it would say, 'We've got to deliver for our constituency.' It cannot say that, so it comes up with deception after deception.


So, what do they do? They attack their political enemies—the enemies of their political donors, the union movement. I think many people are aware of the truth. I think when people hear what is actually going on they want people to be safe at work, and they are concerned about how this is playing out. It has been made even clearer by the government's refusing to support the Greens's call for a royal commission into the big banks and the financial sector—a sector in which we have heard time and time again of alleged misconduct. This white-collar crime has affected the lives of tens of thousands of victims. This is where we have this huge inconsistency in how this government operates. And I believe many people can join the dots, that they can see that inconsistency, that the government is harassing one section of the community for its own political self-interest and, where it should be putting its efforts, sidestepping its responsibility.


If the government were serious about tackling corruption and criminality it would get behind the Greens's call to set up a royal commission into the financial sector. It would get behind the Greens's call to get big money out of politics, and it would get behind the vast majority of Australians who are echoing the Greens's call for a national corruption watchdog. We need that so urgently to hold politicians and public servants to account. But time and time again it was resisted. We saw it voted down again last night. Again, disappointingly, Labor was there with the Liberals and the Nationals. It is time to sort this one out. It really has to happen. It becomes quite farcical that of all the jurisdictions in Australia we are the only ones that have not had a national ICAC. The fact that it is not even on the agenda with the Liberals and Nationals really does further expose their double standards when they bring forward legislation like the registered organisations legislation and this ABCC bill.


This bill to bring back the ABCC is a linchpin in the government's ongoing attack on unions. Why? Because unions look after workers. Trade unions were founded for that very purpose, for protecting the rights and interests of working people. When you start undermining unions it means that you are undermining the collective ability of workers to organise and to be able to improve wages and conditions. So, what is going on here is very fundamental. But it is not something new with conservative governments. Again, I outlined it in the speech last night on registered organisations. When we have a conservative government, one of the first things they do, from the penal powers of the Menzies era through to the Howard, Abbott and Turnbull governments—their core business—is get out there with their anti-union legislation and push it through by demonising unions, demonising workers and lying time and time again.


This bill would give workers in the construction industry fewer rights at work just because of the industry they work in. It would give them fewer rights at work than accused criminals and even accused terrorists. It is seriously extraordinary that it has got to that point. With this bill the government wants to set up a new secret police in the construction industry. Unfortunately I am running out of time, but the idea that Nigel Hadgkiss may rise again and be the head of this star chamber is deeply disturbing—a man so committed to delivering some of the most ugly outcomes for working people. Where this government has ended up is deeply troubling.


The government wants to go out at the end of this year and obviously head off to the next election with claims of Australia's improving productivity and cracking down on the wrongdoing of unions. You can see the headlines in The Australian and The Telegraph now. You can hear the speeches coming out of Minister Cash and Prime Minister Turnbull. The lines would already be written up—their great victory, standing up for ordinary people, for mums and dads, for productivity. But it is all built on a lie: not only will it damage working people themselves, but many will not come home. We know that the number of injuries and deaths will increase, which also damages the fabric of our life, or our society. This bill should be defeated.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2,speech
"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2016-11-22,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (13:12):  I rise today to speak on the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 and the Building and Construction Industry (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013. Our construction industry builds the offices, the apartments, the roads, the shopping centres, the hospitals, the universities, the schools, the airports and the other important infrastructure—vital infrastructure—that all Australians use and depend on daily. The construction industry is the third-largest industry in Australia, representing some eight per cent of our gross domestic product. Furthermore, the construction industry employs approximately 1.1 million Australians in one capacity or another. Indeed, there are more than 300,000 small businesses that fall within the parameters of the construction industry in Australia. Let us just recap those facts for a moment: eight per cent of gross domestic product, 1.1 million Australians employed and over 300,000 small businesses in operation. By any means, this is a substantial industry, and so important in the greater make-up of the Australian economy.


There is not a person in this place, no matter whether they choose to admit it or to feign ignorance, who is not aware of the toxic culture of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, or the CFMEU. We have seen this culture of intimidation, economic blackmail, violence and thuggery on TV screens, in print media and, for the most part, uncovered as part of the royal commission into the trade union movement. Commissioner Heydon—one of the finest legal minds in Australian history, I might add—described the deplorable union behaviour uncovered by this royal commission as 'only the tip of the iceberg'. The behaviour of unions, such as the CFMEU, is not isolated to their own operations. Rather, the effects of behaviour such as this flow on through the Australian economy, with devastating results.


As of October 2016 some 113 CFMEU officials are before the courts charged with more than 1,100 alleged contraventions of various Australian laws—an absolutely astounding figure. If we were to work that out as an average it would be 9.7 alleged contraventions per individual. The CFMEU must think that they are above the law. Do they? Is this what they think? They seem to believe that the law applies to all Australians but them. But it must be noted that these matters are before the courts and as they currently stand they are alleged. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that in recent years courts of various jurisdictions have imposed more than $8 million in fines as punishment for the CFMEU's callous disregard for Australian laws. So brazen is their attitude that one Federal Court Justice remarked that the CFMEU's record of noncompliance with the law is 'notorious' and their record 'ought to be an embarrassment to the trade union movement'. This seems to be an embarrassment that those opposite do not wish to acknowledge, but they should, because the rest of Australia certainly does.


While some may trivialise the unruly behaviour of some unions, it is incredibly dangerous to do so. The rate of industrial action in the construction sector is nine times higher at present than the average across all other industries in Australia—a truly staggering statistic. To further illustrate this point, it should be noted that two of every three days lost to an industrial dispute in this country are lost from within the construction industry. Because of this and the continuing behaviour of rogue unions, the taxpayer dollar is wasted. The taxpayer must pay more. It seems that those opposite are content with that. The building of vital infrastructure—of schools and hospitals—costs 30 per cent more owing directly to that industrial action on building sites.


The ABCC is the proven solution to ameliorate this situation. The proven solution in putting a stop to lawlessness and thuggery in the building industry is the ABCC. Let us look at some facts about the ABCC. Before the ABCC was initially introduced, the rate of industrial disputes in the construction industry was five times the average across all other industries. During the ABCC's operations, disputes fell to just two times the average. But, on average, since the ABCC's abolition, disputes have gone back up to five times the average across all other industries. Since the ABCC was abolished by Bill Shorten in 2012, the rate of disputes in the construction sector has increased by 40 per cent, whereas the rate of industrial disputes across all other industries has decreased by 33 per cent on average. When the ABCC was in force, productivity in the construction sector grew by 20 per cent, yet it now remains relatively stagnant.


This bill will restore the ABCC as the industry-specific regulator for the construction industry. It will restore penalties to their former level. It will retain the current compulsory evidence-gathering powers but remove the sunset clause, and these powers are held by other regulators, such as the ACCC, ASIC, the ATO, Centrelink and Medicare. This bill will introduce new measures to deal with unlawful picketing and the disruption of transport and supply to building sites, including those located offshore. It will remove the inability for the ABCC to enforce the law where private settlements occur. Otherwise, it would be like police having no power to prosecute a driver for running a red light and causing a crash if the driver reached a private settlement with the other driver. This bill will enable a strong building code to be made for government projects. This will help improve standards and create a fairer playing field for businesses in the industry.


Despite the misinformation spread by those opposite, the ABCC legislation does not amend any workplace safety law. It will in no way prevent safety issues from being raised or addressed by employers, by unions or by health and safety regulators. Senator Rhiannon's comments were incomprehensible. All the stats show that, under the ABCC, the number of deaths and accidents actually went down, that productivity increased, that the number of days lost to strikes also went down, and that the vast majority of workers reported being much happier in their construction workplaces. But, since Labor abolished it, lawlessness has gone up again and days lost from strikes have increased. This is taxpayer money for infrastructure projects that is being wasted.


I would like now to turn to one case study examined at length quite recently by the Menzies Research Centre in their report entitled Constructing a better future: restoring order and competition in the building industry. The example relates to the Wonthaggi desalination plant in my own home state of Victoria. The Menzies Research Centre reports that construction of the Wonthaggi desalination plant at Dalyston on the Bass Coast of Victoria was commissioned by John Brumby's Labor state government in July 2009 and completed in December 2012, a full year behind schedule. Plagued by cost blowouts, delays, waste and excessively high labour costs, Wonthaggi exemplified the very worst of public construction in Australia. When construction began in late 2009, it was expected to cost $3.1 billion, an estimate that was itself considerably above the cost of similar projects in Australia. The Kwinana desalination plant south of Perth, for instance, completed three years earlier, holds approximately 30 to 50 per cent of the capacity of the Wonthaggi desalination plant, but it was completed at a cost of $387 million, only 12.5 per cent of the cost of the Wonthaggi plant. The final price tag of the Victorian plant hit a staggering $5.7 billion.


An analysis by Independent Contractors Australia found that, had the Victorian plant been completed with broadly the same cost-effectiveness as the Perth plant, the project should have totalled no more than $2 billion. Labour costs were locked in at an extraordinary level under a greenfields bargaining agreement struck in 2009 between the head contractor Thiess Degremont, the AMWU, the AWU, the CEPU and the CFMEU. This agreement allowed for 26 rostered days off, 12 public holidays, a picnic day, and fixed long weekends that coincide with the RDOs. It included not only superannuation and long service leave, a 17½ per cent holiday loading and annual leave, but also termination pay of an extra couple of weeks, a redundancy allowance of $5.44 per hour, clothing allowance, spectacle allowance, and six-monthly pay increases totalling approximately $200 per week. An extraordinary element was a tax-free living-away-from-home allowance of $700 per week, or $36,400 annually. Wonthaggi is barely 75 minutes drive from the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. This was struck at a time when the going rate for living-away-from-home allowances in genuinely remote areas such as the Pilbara was $400 per week. Wages at the plant were reliably estimated to be 40 per cent—40 per cent!—higher than those found at desalination plants interstate, providing trade workers with $150,000 annual salaries before factoring in the generous conditions and allowances.


For instance, a carpenter under the agreement earned more than $200,000 in wages and benefits—roughly twice the income of a school principal. Worse still, under the terms of the agreement the only direction in which wages could move would be higher. The greenfields agreement covering the plant's construction contained a clause stating that Thiess could only engage contractors who applied wages and conditions no less favourable than the wages and conditions provided for in the agreement for similar or equivalent work. Now, the effect of this clause is to remove competition between subcontractors entirely from the tendering process.


The desalination agreement locked in considerably higher increases in remuneration than those under standard CFMEU industry EBAs. Wages increased in six-monthly increments of 2½ per cent over three years, a total of 15 per cent over three years. Under the standard EBA wages increased by a lesser amount, while allowances were linked to CPI.


A lack of transparency in the tendering process added to concerns. The winning bid from the AquaSure consortium, which included Degremont Australia, Macquarie Capital and Thiess, was in fact higher—higher!—than the losing bid from John Holland. Industrial relations commentator Robert Gottliebsen wrote that the Leighton subsidiary John Holland, which had not done the deal from hell with the unions, actually tendered a lower price for the desalination plant than Leighton's other construction subsidiary Theiss. But the Victorian government took the higher tender. It took the higher tender to look after its union mates who had secured this truly amazing deal from the Theiss-Leighton subsidiary. Leighton also gave some iron-clad price guarantees.


There is an enormous cultural difference between John Holland and Theiss, which gives the union what they want because they can add it on to the price, management style. Clearly, Thiess was awarded the project, at least in part, on the basis that it would assuage union demands and avoid disruptive industrial action. In turn, Thiess signed on to a clause that would ensure the terms of its 'peace at any price' deal were reflected in all contractors connected to the plant, negating any chance of competition. The cruel irony for Thiess and for the Victorian taxpayers is that despite such efforts, the project was fraught with strikes and other delays that ended up costing Thiess over $1 billion.


This is only one of many possible examples, but it is just as pertinent as the rest. To those opposite today I say that while Labor did not support its two million union members last night in voting against the registered organisations bill, there is still a chance to do so here. There is still a chance for you to do so today. These are your constituents; these are the people you represent. It is your responsibility to do right by them. Vote for this legislation. Vote for this legislation so that we can return the rule of law to our construction sector. Vote for this legislation to make our construction sites safer, to make our construction sites fairer and to make our construction sites free of coercion and free of intimidation and, so importantly, to improve competition in the construction industry—not just in Victoria but all over Australia.


Allow Australia to build the vital infrastructure it needs in a fair and cost-effective manner. This is the only way; it is the proven way to ensure that the Australian economy has the chance to flourish, to thrive and to prosper.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2016-11-22,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (13:29):  I, too, rise to speak on the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 and the Building and Construction Industry (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013, because, whilst a lot of people have talked about workplaces and costs and other things, it is not until you actually start putting it into the perspective of things that people consider to be important that you understand just how critical these issues are. Looking at the Defence budget, the defence white paper looks at the amount of investment that is going to go into infrastructure—we are talking civil works and building works—and if you look at the actual dollar figure over the next 10 years, for the first time we actually have a very clear picture, because of the way this white paper and the Integrated Investment Plan has been put together, of the actual amount that is going to be spent on infrastructure, and it is in the tens of billions of dollars. If you overlay that at the same time with various reports that have been made by external accounting companies, and also a recent report by the Menzies Research Centre, what you see is that the scale of the inefficiencies can be anything from around 10 per cent up towards 30 per cent. I am a conservative kind of guy so I will take the lower figure of that. But even if you take that 10 per cent figure, what you realise is that you can very quickly show that lawlessness on worksites stands to cost the Australian taxpayer, in the Defence portfolio, some billions of dollars.


If you consider that one of the most recent acquisitions for the Navy, the Romeo helicopter, which is considered to be one of the world's best submarine-hunting helicopters, was acquired at less than $2 billion, what you see is that Defence would have to be spending billions of dollars—so potentially another whole fleet of helicopters, which means a whole area of capability—unnecessarily, if the inefficiencies in our construction sector continue. So with MYEFO coming up, when we are looking, potentially, at the kind of budget issues such as the structural spending that has been locked in for a number of years now, and that we have sought in this place to undo, budget pressure is going to come on and that is going to impact on the money we want to spend on road infrastructure, on hospitals, on schools, or on our defence budget. It is inexcusable that we would expect the Australian public to be seeing a department of this government spending billions of dollars unnecessarily on infrastructure, when they could have the same infrastructure at a lower cost and return that money either to the Defence budget so that we could procure more capability we need, or, more likely, actually return that money to consolidated revenue so it could go into any number of other areas that Australians believe are important.


In South Australia, the state Labor government has commissioned a hospital that is reported by various people to be one of the world's most expensive buildings in terms of the dollar cost per square metre of the building. I note that it is still not open, well after its due date, and it may be quite a few months if not late next year before we finally see patients in there. But even that, the most expensive building in the world, is still cheaper than the money that Defence will have to spend unnecessarily on infrastructure works it is doing if the ABCC bill is not passed.


So, as people consider this bill what I would invite them to do is consider the fact that this bill is not going to impact on workplace safety. This bill is all about getting rid of the lawlessness on worksites that we see reported week after week in the media. We see union officials in court being charged with various offences, and we see the cost impacts. With those figures I talked about for the Menzies Research Centre, I took their lower estimate. If you took their upper estimate of around 30 per cent, and that is less than other estimates which are the artificially inflated costs for construction in Australia, then the Australian taxpayer will be unnecessarily spending between $7 billion and $8 billion on the Defence budget alone. Mr Acting Deputy President, you are reasonable man, and so I ask you how could we expect the Australian taxpayer to think that that was a good use of the money which we are stewarding on their behalf? Speaking for myself and for this side of the chamber, we cannot—it is indefensible. 


We cannot allow the lawlessness to continue on worksites. It creates the kind of inefficiencies that artificially bump up those prices so that people in our departments who are spending money on infrastructure have to spend unnecessary money. Sometimes people say to me, 'What do you mean by inefficiencies?' What are some of the examples when people talk about inefficiencies? Some of the stories that have been reported are things like concrete pours, where the pour starts and then somebody comes along and says, 'Stop the pour.' It could be there is a workplace condition which they do not believe has been met; or perhaps they are unhappy with the employer because he has not signed the agreement that gives them the leave they want. As you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, the media has recently been reporting agreements signed between some of the large construction companies and the CFMEU which give quite large pay rises and all kinds of additional leave. The critical thing is the action on the worksite. If you imagine the cost and the time of doing a large pour which is disrupted part way through such that it has to stop, you then have remedial works to extract that which has already been poured and redo all the formwork or to do additional engineering works to work out whether it is even possible to continue the pour at a later time. There is also the issue of concrete that is perhaps waiting in trucks just off the site and what happens to that. 


One simple act on one day on the worksite can set back a project weeks in time and tens of thousands of dollars in money. Those kinds of actions are pursued in an almost bloody-minded manner by some unions and then there are the illegal actions—the blockading, the bullying of people on worksites. All those sorts of things have an impact which can lead to five, 10 and up to 30 per cent inefficiency on our civil construction sites. As I say, when you look at something like the Defence budget, where we are finally restoring the funding for Defence and, for the first time ever, we are not just calculating the cost of buying the equipment over 10 years—that is an easy thing. People like to say, 'These many tanks or planes or ships will cost us whatever,' but that is not a real capability unless you have the infrastructure behind it—whether that is new runways or new hangers or new wharves that are required. It is all that infrastructure spending that Defence will be doing that is critical in building the Defence capability that we need to have. 


Why should the Australian taxpayer accept the fact that the votes of 30-odd people in this Senate could cost the country billions of dollars that it does not have to spend? How can that be justified? The Australian public quite rightly should be asking the question: why does the Defence department have to spend billions of dollars unnecessarily because of the decision of 30-odd people in the Senate chamber who decide to support, in this case, the CFMEU, which has been widely reported and acknowledged as one of the unions with the worst record of illegal activity and people who are before the courts as a result of that illegal activity and have complete disregard for the law? If there was a valid reason—if all of these things were actually changing the safety outcomes—there might be even part of the case. But, given the costs and the disruption and the fact that it is not having that effect, this is not about workplace safety. And there are lots of reports—longitudinal studies and reports about rates of accidents—that show that this change is not about safety. This change is about increasing the productivity and the lawful behaviour on work sites. 


Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, I would encourage you and people on your side of the chamber, as you go back and speak to your constituents at the end of this week and over the weekend, as you hear the calls for funding, whether it is in legal and community services, health, or road infrastructure, to think of the billions of dollars that your votes will constrain spending, in this case, by the defence department, completely unnecessarily. It should not be so. The nation entrusts the moneys that we raise through tax to us as parliamentarians and the executive government to spend wisely on their behalf. This is not a good use of that money, and it is not good to see billions of dollars spent unnecessarily. 


I conclude my contribution by drawing people's attention back to something they think is important. Everyone says: 'Great. We love to see you spending more on defence. It is great you are going be able to spend up to two per cent of GDP on defence. It is about time we did that.' But they may not understand that there are billions of dollars that have to go into infrastructure, tens of billions of dollars that we know we will be spending over the next 10 years and billions that are unnecessarily being wasted because of the illegal activity and inefficiency on worksites. I would ask those of you on the other side of the chamber to decide whether your 30-odd votes are actually in the national interests or whether they are purely in the interests of the union movement, as so many of you are here, I understand, because of their patronage and support.


At the end of the day, each of us is here predominantly in the national interest. If we are not here in the national interest, then we should be considering our positions. I will certainly be supporting this bill because it is in the national interest of this country to have safe but efficient and effective workplaces so that we can attract investment, create jobs and build a better nation not only for ourselves but, more importantly, for the generations to come.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2016-11-22,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (13:42):  What we have here is the Prime Minister's get-out-of-jail-free card. It is safe territory for the Prime Minister. He has clearly besieged at the moment. He is leading a party that is incredibly divided, and divided on all sorts of issues. But there is one thing that unites the Tories, and it is making sure that you do all you can to dump on the union movement—a bit of good old-fashioned union bashing! Nothing brings those disparate voices within the coalition closer together than a bit of good old-fashioned union bashing. 


Do you remember it was the reason we went to the double dissolution election? A lot of people have forgotten, because it was the legislation that dare not speak its name. It was the trigger for the double dissolution election—not a peep for the entire duration of that election campaign and not a peep for months afterwards. And so here we are, on the back of a late-night sitting last night, with legislation rammed through thanks to the support of the crossbench and people like Nick Xenophon who thought this legislation was so critical that after five months we had to sit until three in the morning to pass it. And here we are now, debating the abolition of the ABCC. 


When it comes to tackling corruption in this country, the government is not interested in tax manipulation or scandals. We have heard about lots of them within the banking and the financial sector. They are not interested in corruption within the Public Service. We have heard evidence of that, with many examples within state parliaments. The government seems only interested in tackling wrongdoing by its ideological foes—that is, when working people come together under the banner of the union movement. 


We have heard time and time again about the misconduct and conflicted incentives in the banking industry. That is actually having a material impact on the lives of ordinary people. This is actually ruining people's lives; it is eroding their life savings and it means that many of them, when they face injury or the death of a loved one, are unable to get the sort of support and assistance they believe that they paid for. And yet we have the government refusing to support the Greens' calls for a royal commission into the big banks and the financial sector. Instead, what they want to do is to make life easier for unscrupulous employers and harder for ordinary working people.


I will just say to them: if you are so concerned about the issue of widespread corruption, why not get behind the Greens' call for an anticorruption watchdog? It is something that would have the capacity to look right across different sectors within our economy, not just at employees and unions but at employers, and not just at the construction industry but right across the economy—including the work that we do here in this parliament. But instead of supporting the creation of a national anticorruption watchdog what we have is the government intent on coming together and uniting a party room that is incredibly divided and, of course, resorting to its get-out-of-jail-free card: a good old-fashioned bit of union bashing.


The question we have to ask ourselves is, 'How did we get here?' Of course, we still are not clear about where crossbenchers are and we are not clear about what amendments have been negotiated. We are not sure about the role of regulation through extensive legal coercion powers. It is, unfortunately, much like last night: a bit of a black box at the moment. And let us be clear about what we are trying to protect: we are here to protect ordinary working people coming together, looking to defend their rights at work. Remember that the trade unions were founded with the purpose of protecting the rights and interests of the workers that they represent. Unions are nothing other than a collection of workers organising to ensure that their rights are represented in what is often an unfair and unequal playing field.


We hear time and time again that when things go wrong in workplaces it is the unions that actually step up and help to look after those people affected within the workplace. And this is true within the building and construction industry. We know that construction workplaces are unsafe. We know that there are many people who do not return home after being injured at work, and we know that some of them come to very serious harm. We know that families are left grieving because of unsafe workplaces, and it is the role of the construction union to ensure safety within the workplace.


What this bill does is give workers in the construction industry fewer rights at work because of the industry they work in. We are just singling out one industry and saying, 'Because you work in that industry we're going to strip away some very basic rights and we're going to make your industry the target of laws that no other industry is subjected to.' With this bill the government wants to set up what is effectively a new secret police within the construction industry. They are going to have the right to take workers off site, to pull them in for questioning and to demand answers of them. They are not going to have the right to silence—a basic right afforded to common criminals. They will not be able to talk to others about the fact they have been pulled in for secret questioning.


And let's look at the justification. You would think that with laws this draconian and this extreme that, clearly, there must be widespread evidence of gross malfeasance. When you are going to use such a big sledgehammer, what is the justification? What is it? No-one is suggesting that there are not issues in the construction industry—of course there are. As I said, there are people injured and dying, tragically, on construction work sites every week. There are many workers coming in from overseas or who are being exploited, working on $10 or $12 an hour. The government could be working to stamp out sham contracting. Even the title of the bill, the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013, is confused and untargeted.


Let us remember this: when the Australian Building and Construction Commission existed, productivity in the construction industry flatlined. Once the commission was abolished, we saw productivity increase. Again, let us look at what the experience was when the Australian Building and Construction Commission was established under a previous government. We saw that productivity was flat and, when the commission was abolished, we saw a significant increase in productivity. What kind of wider economic effect is the government seriously expecting from this legislation? What is going to be the impact of this legislation? The answer is 'none'. If past experience tells us anything, it is that this bill is not about productivity. It is not about corruption. It is not about anything other than a targeted, ideological attack on the opposition. This parliament should not be so narrow and so petty that, as the centrepiece of the government's legislative agenda, it chooses to confront an issue like this. If this is the peak, if this is at the centre of the government's legislative agenda, then this is going to be a period of government with a clear lack of any coherent vision, a period of government that will be unproductive and a period of government that ignores the challenges that face us as a nation.


We could focus on the great challenges that lie ahead of us: catastrophic climate change and the role that Australia could be playing in bringing down our emissions, creating jobs and investment in those regional communities who so desperately need them and creating international investment around the renewable energy sector. We could recognise that we have huge challenges when it comes to addressing the structural problems within the budget. We have a revenue crisis, but we have an opportunity to be able to pay for the services and the foundations of a decent society through ending the rorts of negative gearing and capital gains tax, ending multinational tax avoidance and ensuring that we do not provide tax cuts to the wealthiest Australians—instead raising revenue from those people who can afford it most. Instead of dealing with those challenges, we have a government with no agenda, no plan and no vision, looking to unite a divided party room over a piece of legislation that strips away basic rights for ordinary working people.


The Australian Greens will oppose this legislation. We will ensure that we do whatever we can to strengthen the rights of people at work, rather than to weaken them.

Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (13:52):  Four letters triggered a double dissolution and a federal election on 2 July—though the government hardly mentioned those four letters, ABCC, during the marathon election campaign. I will give this bill its official name: the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013. It is from 2013—that is more than three years of gestation. There have been thousands of words on both sides over the months and over the years—union bashing and union championing—and I do not intend to go back through it all. But I will make several points and refer to amendments that I have put to the government to improve the bill and to allay some of the opposition's fears—I hope. My comments reflect what I repeated during the auditors and whistleblower amendments yesterday: I am pro worker and anti corruption.


In reaching my position on this bill and the proffered amendments, I have spent a lot of time with ministers, shadow ministers, union officials—including the CFMEU, several times—and other senators. I will be voting for the amended bill, if the planned amendments pass in this chamber. If the bill is not properly amended, I am not afraid to vote it down. In my discussions with government ministers and the opposition, I have concentrated on several areas. I want to deal with them, but not in any order of priority or importance.


One major area is the protection of sub-contractors—the subbies. Too often, they are left holding the bag. Confected disputes over supposedly shoddy work or missed completion deadlines can see money—earned money—going from A to B but not getting to C. Sometimes it is a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul in a stalling tactic which might otherwise see a boss guilty of trading while insolvent. A fast-track tribunal hearing with the disputed money held in trust is good idea and a possible solution, I believe. So I agree with Senator Cameron when he said earlier today that we must improve payment protection for the subcontractors. I also agree with him that we need incentives to encourage employers to take on more apprentices. 


Another issue that has cropped up regularly in recent weeks is retrospectivity. A number of big companies that have signed five-year EBAs in recent times have expressed concerns that they could in future be locked out of government contracts. Of course, the other argument is that these bills have been around for a couple of years and so everybody on either side of the industry, contractors and the unions, are very well aware of all the details. With this and other pieces of legislation I do not like retrospective legislation of any kind, but maybe six months could be the buffer. So, with question time coming up, that is where I stand, and I will say, like last night, that with the auditors and the whistleblower amendments I got here to this position without making any deals with either side.

Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Chief Government Whip in the Senate) (13:56):  I rise also to make a contribution on these bills—the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 and the Building and Construction Industry (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013. As you would be fully aware, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, the construction industry is vital to Australia's economy. It contributes to employment, productivity and to just about any aspect of the economy that you care to think of. The construction industry is vital and at the heart of it. It builds the offices, apartments, roads, shopping centres, hospitals, universities, schools, airports and other infrastructure that every single Australian uses every single day. In that sense, it is also Australia's third-largest industry, which highlights the significance of the construction industry to the economy. It contributes eight per cent to gross domestic product. I mentioned also that it employs people. In fact it employs nearly 1.1 million Australians. There are more than 300,000 small businesses in the building industry. They can be from sole trader plumbers and electricians up to very, very large companies that are involved in construction, employing many hundreds and in some cases thousands of Australians.


But there is a big problem with the construction industry in Australia as it stands today. There is a toxic culture in the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, which causes this big problem in the construction industry. This big problem creates issues that flow right through the economy, and that undermines the positive effect that the construction industry has on the Australian economy that I was referring to before.


As at October 2016, just last month, there were 113 CFMEU officials before the courts for more than 1,100 suspected contraventions. In recent years, the courts have imposed more than $8 million in fines on the CFMEU's lawbreaking. In the words of a Federal Court judge, the CFMEU's record of noncompliance with the law is 'notorious', and their record 'ought to be an embarrassment to the trade union movement.'


I would have thought that every single member of the trade union movement who is a member because they want to do the right thing by the workers and ensure that workers' rights are appropriately protected and looked after would consider those quotes by that judge, and the other evidence that backs up the big problem I am talking about, abhorrent. They would also reject those problems that we see, as demonstrated by the findings about the CFMEU and other unions.


How does this play out? What costs does this impose on our economy? Currently around two out of three working days lost from industrial disputes are in the construction industry. Given that that the construction industry represents about eight per cent of our GDP, the fact that 66 per cent— (Time expired)

The government will be implementing the Basin Plan consistent with how the Basin Plan was written and agreed to by members of the Labor Party. It will be implemented. In that agreement it states that we will not do anything, we will not produce—



Opposition senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  On a point of order, Senator Farrell.




Senator Farrell:
  President, it was a very simple question to the minister. Does he agree with the Deputy Prime Minister that the implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in full is impossible? That is the question.



The PRESIDENT:  I think we need to be a bit fairer to the minister and allow him a bit more time to answer the question. The minister was certainly on topic.




Senator CANAVAN:
  As I was saying, we will be implementing the Basin Plan, and we will be implementing it in the fashion that was agreed to between states and territories and the former government. In that agreement it is very relevant to note that, on the issue of whether additional water will be delivered under that agreement, under clause 717 it says that the efficiency contributions to the proposed adjustments must achieve neutral or improved socioeconomic outcomes compared with the outcomes under benchmark conditions, and that is what we will be implementing.


There is obviously an issue at the moment. There was an issue under discussion about whether that additional water can be delivered consistent with this condition that was agreed to by the former government. There are different views at the moment, as I understand it, between states and territories on this issue. There are different views between governments of states and territories of different political parties on this issue, but we are committed as a government to ensure that we deliver a balanced Murray-Darling Basin Plan and that we deliver a Basin Plan that delivers environmental outcomes, that delivers on economic and social outcomes and that delivers a triple bottom line, because we all want to achieve things for the environment, but we must do so in a way which does not pull the economic rug out of communities that produce our food, that put our protein on our tables and that produce jobs in regional areas. All of these things must be balanced, and we are committed to doing that while we implement the Basin Plan.

Those words were used, and the South Australian Premier has not, that I have seen yet, condemned that behaviour. He has walked past that behaviour. He is not condemning it. That is what I would call 'contemptible behaviour'. That behaviour should be condemned, but it is not being by the South Australian Premier. He should come out and admonish his minister about it, but he came out and excused it on ABC radio the other day. That is inexcusable. That should be condemned.

Senator Wong:
  South Australians should move to where the water is—is that the government's position?




Senator CANAVAN:
  The former government—I think Senator Wong might have had something to do with it—was buying water willy-nilly all over the place, with no consideration of the impact on basin communities. They were paying out $300 million to Johnny Kahlbetzer and more than $20 million to buy Toorale Station without even considering the impact on these basin communities.


That was not how the Basin Plan was meant to be implemented. The Basin Plan was meant to be implemented in a way which balanced economic, social and environmental considerations. That is not the approach of the former government, but it is the approach of this government. That is what we are committed to doing. We are committed to doing that with the states and territories.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (14:07):  I thank Senator Paterson for his question. It is a fact that Australia and Australians simply cannot afford the lawlessness which we continue to see in the building and construction sector. It is the third-largest industry in Australia, and we must do everything we can to ensure that it continues to prosper and grow. Across Australia there are approximately one million Australians who are employed in this vital industry, the building and construction sector. But for them to do their jobs effectively, we as policy makers need to ensure that their work environment is a cooperative and productive one.


It is a fact borne out by Federal Court decision after Federal Court decision that when you go to work in the building and construction industry it would appear that the rule of law does not apply. Why is it that when any other Australian goes to work on a daily basis they have to comply with the rule of law that applies in their workplace, and if they do not they know that there are consequences for doing that? There are approximately 300,000 small businesses in this vital industry. They need a system. They need policy makers in this place to ensure that they have a system that is free from bullying and standover tactics that they are currently subjected to.


I am also concerned that the CFMEU's toxic culture is turning away females from this industry. It is a fact that women make up just 11 per cent of construction industry workers—a percentage that has declined over the last 30 years.




Senator Cameron:
  What's turning women away from you lot?



The PRESIDENT:  Order on my left!





Senator CASH:
  There are currently in excess of 100 CFMEU officials that are before the court. There is a deficiency in the law and it is up to us to rectify it. (Time expired)

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (14:09):  Unfortunately, yes, I can, and, of course, it is those opposite. Over the last 20 years the Australian Labor Party has received approximately $14 million from the CFMEU. In addition to that, we have recently witnessed a video showing how the CFMEU are buying up the Labor Party and demanding outcomes for themselves. To quote a senior CFMEU official who appeared in the video, who said: 


… what we're actually going to do is take ownership and ­responsibility of the ALP … We're getting influence in the ALP and that's how we're going to get in there. We're not going to wait for the politicians to come and do it for us …


…   …   …


We're not going to just ask them to do it, we're going to go in there and demand they do it …


The CFMEU has a hold over the Labor Party and that is to the detriment of the building and construction industry in Australia.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (14:11):  As I said, the construction industry in Australia is our third largest employer. Over a million Australians rely on this vital industry each and every day for their job. The fact of the matter is: if there is a problem in the construction industry, it is a problem that affects all Australians. If you look at the rate of industrial action in the construction sector, it is currently nine times higher than the average across all other industries. That fact costs our entire economy. It is estimated that important infrastructure, such as schools, roads and hospitals, cost taxpayers up to 30 per cent more because of the number of working days lost through industrial action at building sites. There is a clear problem, and as policy makers we need to address it.

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:05):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Resources and Northern Australia (Senator Canavan) and the Attorney‑General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by Senators Farrell, Chisholm, Moore and Sterle today.


You may recall, Deputy President, that I asked Minister Canavan a very simple question. I asked him: did he agree with the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Barnaby Joyce, that the implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan was impossible? When I did not get an answer to that, I took a point of order. When I took the point of order, regrettably, the President let the minister continue with his answer and we never found out the answer to that question. It was a very simple question, very straightforward, and it should have had a straightforward answer—yes or no. We never got an answer to it.


I can only conclude from the fact that we did not get a straight answer that it is the view of the minister that he agrees with Deputy Prime Minister Joyce that it is impossible to deliver on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. That is a terrible outcome, not only for the people in South Australia, where I come from, but for all Australians. It was one of the crowning achievements of the Gillard government that they got the Murray-Darling Basin Plan through the parliament—through the lower house and through the Senate—and it got with the cooperation of all of the states, because that is what was required to get the legislation through. That was a crowning achievement because of the years and years of drought that affected south-eastern Australia and the desperate state that we found the Murray-Darling Basin in when we came into government. Something needed to be done about it.


Of course, John Howard did attempt to do something about it. Senator Brandis will recall this. I know he has such a good relationship with former Prime Minister Howard.




Senator Brandis:
  We were great friends.




Senator FARRELL:
  You may be now. You were not back then, as I recall, Senator Brandis. Prime Minister Howard gave $10 billion to the then minister, Minister Turnbull, to fix the problem. But of course he could not fix it. He did not have the skills to fix it.



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator FARRELL:
  Well, let's be clear about this. We got the Murray-Darling Basin Plan through—Senator Wong, Tony Burke and I, as the Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water at the time. We got this plan through the parliament. What is happening now is that this government is on the cusp of ripping up the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.


Okay, there has been a little bit of rain in the system, but the whole point of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is not to deal with circumstances when there is rain. The whole point of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is to deal with the droughts and the dreadful circumstances, particularly in South Australia, that happened to the communities along the Murray-Darling Basin.


What we need to do is to have a strong Prime Minister in this country. We need a strong—



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator FARRELL:
  I can see you are agreeing with me, Senator Brandis, because you know what I am saying is true. You know that this is not a strong Prime Minister. He is a weak Prime Minister. He has caved in once again to the Nationals. He has caved in on so many occasions and he is caving in on this one. He is failing to pull the Deputy Prime Minister into line. He is failing to pull him into line and the consequences could be catastrophic for the great Murray-Darling Basin. If this Prime Minister does not restore some of his authority and say to the Deputy Prime Minister—



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator FARRELL:
  Well, it is starting to look that way—he does not have any authority, I am afraid to say. It is starting to look like he has no authority and he is unable to do what he needs to do. He has to pull the Deputy Prime Minister into line. He has to come in and back the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, and he has to do it quickly. (Time expired)

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (15:10):  When I heard Senator Farrell get up earlier, I thought to myself, 'My conscience, it's getting to sound a little bit like Christmas!' Imagine Senator Farrell giving us the opportunity to talk about the failure of the Gillard-Rudd-Gillard governments when it came to the Murray-Darling Basin! In a moment I am going to address myself to Queensland's Senator Chisholm, through you, Madam Deputy President. I saw ex-Senator Mark Furner in the gallery earlier. What a shame he is not still there, because probably one of the only opportunities for the failed Labor government in Queensland would be to give Mark Furner a go in the leadership.


But let me go back to the Murray-Darling Basin before Senator Farrell, in his embarrassment, leaves the chamber. This is the organisation, if you recall, under the so-called brilliance of the then Gillard government, with Minister Wong at the time having the control of the purse strings—more regrettably for the Australian taxpayer as we watched national debt and deficit go through the roof. This was the Minister Wong who paid, as I understand it, some $300 million of taxpayers' money to the Kahlbetzer family, an agribusiness family on the Gwydir River for water rights. And do you want to know what, Madam Deputy President? There were no links from the Gwydir River to the Murray-Darling system! The $300 million was wasted! Squandered!


But do we think that was bad enough? No, Senator Wong, then Minister Wong, was just warming up. Then we go to the Tooralie Station at Bourke. We all know the poetry about the back of Bourke. Well, unfortunately, neither Senator Wong nor any of her advisers went out to the back of Bourke to have a look at Tooralie Station, because they paid—if you do not mind!—a cool $24 million of taxpayers' money for that station, plus the cattle. I am not sure how much they paid for the cattle. But, once again, do you want to know, Madam Deputy President, about that expenditure of $24 million for water to go into the Murray-Darling? The thing was that not only did they not go out there they did not even have a look at the map, because once again there was no link to the Murray-Darling Basin system.


So what did we find the other night in Adelaide, in advance, purely in accordance with this absolutely magnificent Gillard government plan for the Murray-Darling Basin? There is a process called sustainable diversion limits, which within the Gillard plan—probably not a bad one—was the fact that if there were likely to be any situation in which federal, state and territory ministers and others might have to review the plan at any time, there should be what is called consultation. Isn't that amazing? Consultation!


The consultation process as I understand it—and I am sure there will be a South Australian in the chamber in a few moments who can confirm this—started out with a letter from the minister with responsibility in the federal government: the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister Joyce. He wrote to the South Australian water minister, Mr Ian Hunter. In his letter to Mr Hunter he said, 'Look, what we want to do is to sit down and have a discussion—South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria and the federal government—about this matter.'


So Barnaby, being the good communicator he is, followed his letter up, just in case Minister Hunter had been too busy to read it. He followed it up personally with a phone call. So when they met last Thursday night, what do you think Minister Joyce was met with? He was met with a mouthful of the most vile abuse from Minister Hunter. The words that I heard were 'threw a tantrum'. He abused not only federal counterparts but also state counterparts and staff from all jurisdictions—including his own—in the middle of a public restaurant in Adelaide. What a great way to respond to the communication!


What happened then? Of course, we have this wonderful Premier in South Australia—the bloke who cannot control his ministers and cannot keep the lights on. The only way he organises and controls a budget in South Australia is to take GST money from Western Australia. Premier Weatherill does not even have the wherewithal to actually discipline Minister Hunter.


If this is an example of the Gillard government's Murray-Darling Basin and if this is an example of the capacity of the water minister from South Australia to be able to communicate on issues of relationship, it is little wonder that South Australia cannot keep the lights on. It is little wonder that the Premier of that particular state is so incompetent that he not only cannot do his own job but cannot discipline his ministers. At the end of the day the Murray-Darling Basin is not the better for his interaction.

Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (15:16):  This has been a sorry 48 hours for Senator Brandis on top of a sorry five months since the election, in what has been a pretty sad political career. Added to his litany of catastrophes since the election—let's have a look at what they are. There is the disgraceful dispute with the former Solicitor-General; the sneakiness surrounding the government's relationship with former Senator Bob Day, which is now referred to the High Court; the embarrassment of having to refer a second senator to the High Court; and then we have the Attorney-General's latest effort, entirely of his own making. This is not to mention the treatment of Gillian Triggs and also the confusion around Social Justice Commissioner Mick Gooda with regard to the Don Dale inquiry.


What this has done is really show up the splits in the Liberal Nationals in Queensland. What caused this? Let's go to the quotes from Senator Brandis from Sunday. When asked, 'How is Tim Nicholls going?' he said: 'Um, well they're not very good … I'd say that the State Opposition is very, very mediocre'. Then, when talking about compulsory preferential voting, he goes on to say:


Yes they are … which somewhat attacks the raison d'etre of the merger of the Liberal Party and National Party. I think there might be a revisiting of things as a result of compulsory preferential voting.


So what we have seen is a full-glare spotlight put on the splits in the LNP in Queensland.


This was reinforced in spectacular fashion only last night when it came to the debate and the vote around the Adler shotgun, with the Nationals splitting and voting in opposition to the Prime Minister's motion. This is all happening under the leadership in this chamber of Senator Brandis. It is hardly surprising that you see these splits when they are being led by this person who is responsible for such catastrophes.


What we saw in question time today was a further example of the split between Senator Canavan, a National Party senator here in this chamber, and Senator Brandis. These are the two most senior Senate contributors from Queensland in open conflict in this chamber. The LNP in Queensland is not a happy place, and this federal LNP government is not a happy place either. We know that because we have heard out of the National Party room that under Mr Turnbull this government is focused on 'issues that very few people in the real world are worried about', which Senator Canavan accepted in question time today. In the same meeting of the Nats the PM was also referred to as 'out of touch'. I could not agree more. The PM is completely out of touch, but his entire government is out of touch as well.


Coming back to Queensland and this LNP merger, this was an absolute sham marriage from the beginning. I used to be a party official in Queensland when this merger took place. We always knew it was just going to be a matter of time before this busted up. It was a marriage of convenience that was always going to end in tears, but the divorce has been sped up because of the arrogance of the Prime Minister and because of the ineptitude of the government leader in the Senate, George Brandis.


The poor leadership we are seeing from them at the federal level has also manifested itself in Queensland under the leadership of Tim Nicholls. I would have to agree with Senator Brandis: his leadership in Queensland is very, very mediocre; that is absolutely true. But it is what we have come to expect of the LNP, not only in Queensland but around the country, in this regard.


What we saw with that merger back in 2008 was the fact that the Nationals in Queensland were really going down the tube. They had not won an election in their own right since 1986, and they realised that the only way they could try to get back to power was to try to arrange themselves with the Liberal Party. But what that actually meant in Queensland was that it was a National Party takeover of the Liberals. So, that was a Nationals-led takeover, and they are the ones who are running Queensland, and that is why Senator Brandis has such problems in regard to controlling the LNP in Queensland.


We know, and we saw today, that there is open conflict amongst the LNP in Queensland. This is only going to grow, and the people who are at risk of this are the Prime Minister and Senator Brandis. (Time expired)

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (15:21):  I too rise today to take note of answers given by this side of the chamber to questions asked by that side of the chamber, particularly in relation to a question asked by Senator Farrell in relation to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and comments of recent days. Firstly, it is a beat-up. The Australian government—the federal government, the Turnbull-Joyce coalition government—stands by the delivery of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in full. We have never said anything to the contrary, and we stand by that today. Much of the comment that has been going on around this particular subject seems to have been driven by a communication that occurred between Minister Joyce and Minister Hunter, the South Australian water minister, and it seems to have been a desire of the South Australian government to beat this up into something that it was not. What has actually been happening here is that we are seeing the South Australian public, the river system and the potential implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan put in jeopardy by a government that is prepared to play politics instead of sitting down at the table and discussing the real facts and the issues that are on the table before us.


Firstly, the 450 gigalitres of so-called up water, to which Premier Weatherill and Mr Hunter seem to have themselves so terribly exercised about, was water that was negotiated when Minister Burke was the environment minister in this place. The act says that an additional 450 gigalitres must be recovered through efficiency improvements which have neutral or improved social and economic impacts. That is, we need voluntary participation by irrigators and we need states to agree to the measures that will go into the delivery of this water. Now, nobody is saying that we are moving away from the 450 gigalitres. What we are saying is that it is becoming increasingly obvious that there will be some challenges in being able to deliver this water under the current terms of the methods and measures by which we can return it that are not going to possibly and probably have consequential detrimental impacts to the river communities, not just in the upstream states but also in South Australia, in the Riverland, in the community in which I live.


What Barnaby Joyce is seeking to do and what I am seeking to do is to sit down and have a constructive conversation about ways in which we can deliver the plan in full, as per the legislation, without having catastrophic negative impacts on our colleagues who are irrigators along the entire Murray-Darling Basin system. I think that is an entirely reasonable thing for the federal government to be doing. But we also need to remember that no change can be made to the plan unless all the jurisdictions agree, and that includes South Australia. Premier Weatherill and Minister Hunter know full well that no changes can be made to this plan without their approval. They know they hold the trump card there, yet they are quite happy to jeopardise the implementation of this plan by playing politics, poking the upstream states bare to see what is going to happen, just for some political gains at home. This is irresponsible behaviour.


So, I would say to Premier Weatherill and to Minister Hunter that we need to sit down and have a conversation, because there are two paths we can follow here. We can follow a path of mature, responsible, adult debate about how we are going to implement the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in full but without causing detrimental impact to our irrigation communities that supply so much support for the economy of Australia. Or we can embark on a path of mutual destruction where we destroy the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. South Australia will ultimately be the largest loser from the Murray-Darling Basin Plan not proceeding because South Australia currently stands to be the greatest winner if the plan proceeds as currently legislated.


I also draw attention to comments today about the 70 gigalitres in the northern basin review that has been reported by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. That is all that has happened. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority has put this on the table as what they would refer to as the northern basin adjustment mechanism solution, much the same way as we have agreed to an adjustment mechanism in the southern basin to make sure that we deliver our environmental outcomes by using other measures so that we are taking the least amount of water out of productive use. But that does not mean to say that we will shy away from delivering environmental outcomes such as keeping the mouth of the Murray open nine years out of 10 and making sure that the wetlands and floodplains are getting water periodically.


What we have seen from the South Australian government is nothing more than a beat-up that is currently jeopardising our ability to negotiate an outcome for the benefit of all of our basin states and all our basin communities and, ultimately, given the economic value of this plan, the whole of Australia.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (15:26):  I have to respond to some things that both Senator Ruston and the former government senator talked about in this debate when they used the word 'consultation' and said that this government consults. It does not matter whether we talk about the Abbott government or now the Malcolm Turnbull government; they do not know the meaning of the word 'consultation'.


I would also just like to place on record that I actually wholeheartedly agree with Senator Brandis's comments when it comes to describing the Queensland LNP. Yes, it is on the record that I support him, because they are mediocre. But I think it is important, too, for Senator Brandis to reflect on his comments about his colleagues and have a look in the mirror, because his reputation in this place has been soiled continuously since the election of the Abbott government.


It does not matter if you reflect back on the time when he was Minister for the Arts. There is no doubt he will go down as the worst arts minister in this country's history. That is pretty hard, actually, because the arts, I would think, would be a very interesting but not overly challenging portfolio responsibility. But he cut $100 million out of the arts budget. He also put his own personal touch on where that money should go.


But there is more. There is a lot more. According to what I have read in the media and have heard in the chatter around this place—and most of the time it is pretty accurate—there is not anyone in the government who actually wants to stand by Senator Brandis because his reputation goes before him. We all remember the $16,000 bookcase that he had put in his office here in Parliament House—$16,000 for a bookcase! He was not like the rest of us who make do with the fabulous furniture that is provided to us in our suites here in Canberra. We know he has a love of books. That is not a bad thing. In fact, it is quite a good thing. But he was a bit arrogant at the very least when minister at the table in Senate estimates. While other senators were asking questions of the witnesses when he was there at the table representing the government, he would just read. He would float off in his own little world and read. That is the arrogance of this man.


But we also know that he is very, very good at attacking those people who do not have the same opportunities to defend themselves in this place. We know he is a poor example of an A-G. In fact, I think most of us on this side would say that he is unfit for that office after the way he dealt with the second-leading legal adviser in this country. It was absolutely appalling. We can all reflect on the treatment Ms Triggs has received from Senator Brandis with his responsibilities both in this chamber and at Senate estimates. Then there is also the issue around 18C and his view that everyone in this country has the right to be a bigot. As a mother, I have to say that that really is not the sort of thing I have taught my daughters.


But we also know that on many occasions he has misled this place in regard to the dealings he had with the issue around the second-highest legal adviser of this country. We know that he has not been forthright with the comments there. As always, he has his own take on everything.


I would have thought that somebody who would be considered to be less than mediocre would be the last person in this place to attack his own colleagues. But I actually believe and support what he said, because I think it is fairly obvious from the Nationals senators who failed to come into this place and support the Prime Minister and the Australian community by banning the Adler. For people like the senator and myself, who are from Tasmania, this has a very strong personal relationship. After all, we are from the state of Tasmania and we all remember the tragedy at Port Arthur. So, for a Nationals senator and a member of the cabinet— (Time expired)

Senator POLLEY:
  Labor remains concerned about the ongoing sustainability of the Aged Care Funding Instrument. There is tremendous instability and uncertainty around aged care funding under the Turnbull Liberal government, just as there is with everything under this government. This instability means nobody can have confidence that older Australians will have access to the care they need. Labor has consistently supported the sector in its call for an immediate independent review and reform of the Aged Care Funding Instrument. This remains our commitment as the only path to a sustainable, transparent and predictable residential aged care funding model. We call on those concerned to show they are serious about the care of older Australians and back Labor's move for a full independent review into aged care funding that can deliver a sustainable future funding model.

Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (17:20):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency, AHPRA, and the National Boards annual report 2015-16, reporting on the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme, is a very important report. In general, strong results and the smooth running of the registration renewal process for all 14 regulated professions have been achieved. Amazingly, the number of online renewals reached a new high of 98 per cent. That is a very, very good figure. A risk assessment tool developed and trialled in Victoria, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory as part of the notifications process is helping bring in these good results.


I make the point that there is a new initiative to release quarterly performance reports to increase transparency and accountability. There has been continued improvement in the experience of complaints, either when making or being the subject of a complaint. This included redrafted communication materials to make letters more conversational and less formal, and web content that is more user-friendly. A national campaign to increase awareness of the scheme was undertaken, including social media channels, news media and major health publications. 


Of 6,125 practitioners audited across the 14 professions, 93 per cent were found to be in full compliance. That is a pretty good result, 93 per cent of practitioners found to be in full compliance. While it is a decrease of three per cent from 2014-15, less than one per cent of all audited practitioners were formally cautioned—the same as last year. 


Some statistics as at 30 June 2015 are that 657,621 health practitioners in 14 professions were registered in Australia. This is an increase of over 20,000 since last year in the number of practitioners registered. There was an increase in all professions, except nursing and midwifery, and in all jurisdictions. It is very concerning that there has been no increase in nursing. I remember some years back we did an inquiry into the number of nurses in Australia; by 2025, I think it is, we are going to be short of nurses to the tune of 109,000. With the ageing population progressing, of course, the percentage of elderly people who need care will increase. It is concerning to me that the numbers of nurses are not growing as quickly as they should, and I hope that improves in the years to come. There were 153,710 students studying to be health practitioners. 


There was a 19.7 per cent increase in notifications lodged, and 1.5 per cent of all practitioners were subject to notifications. There was an increase of 166 per cent in statutory offence complaints received, which include complaints about unlawful advertising and unlawful use of protected titles. Complaints about advertising accounted for 75 per cent of all offence complaints, and 57 per cent of these complaints related to chiropractic services.


This is a very important report, and I bring it to the attention of the Senate. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

 document
 read as follows—





Australian Government response to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade report: Review of the Defence Annual Report 2013-14





November 2016





Recommendation 1 



The Committee recommends that the Jobs Families Project be further developed to incorporate accurate assessments of both qualifications and experience that are required for a given role. The Committee further recommends that, in its implementation of the First Principles Review, the Department of Defence develop its strategic planning and appointment process to ensure employees have task-specific competence for their role, and that opportunities are actively created for personnel to obtain this relevant experience.




Government response 





Agree.



The Defence Australian Public Service Job Families Project was completed with the establishment of 20 job families and over 2,100 occupation profiles. The evolution of job families is now part of business as usual. Development of the Defence Strategic Workforce Plan is progressing, which will include consideration of the Australian Public Service workforce. The Defence Strategic Workforce Plan will inform job family workforce plans that will drive workforce management including recruitment, learning and development, performance and talent management.


In preparation for the job family workforce plans, occupation profiles are being reviewed and amended to reflect changing Defence business and to identify key capabilities, key technical and core knowledge and skills, and other requirements such as qualifications and licenses.


Skills censuses of Australian Public Service staff are to be conducted during 2016 as part of the Defence census, which will enable assessment of individuals' capabilities against those of the occupation that they are engaged in. This information will provide significant input to workforce plans and subsequent initiatives including learning and development.


The Defence census and workforce planning will be part of a regular business planning cycle enabling Defence to monitor progress and adjust plans to address areas of workforce risk. This work is being undertaken, reported and regularly reviewed as an element of the Workforce Work Stream of the First Principles Review.




Recommendation 2



The Committee recommends that the Department of Defence collate and periodically publish figures on the effect of Project Suakin, including statistics on:


the breakdown of personnel in each service category;


Australian Defence Force critical categories;


re-engagement by service and sector including assessment of industry skills captured; and


quantification of the benefits of personnel retention.




Government response



In close consultation with the Services, Project Suakin (Suakin) has established a comprehensive evaluation framework based on a broad range of quantitative and qualitative data. The framework has been designed to measure the effectiveness of the Total Workforce Model in generating and sustaining Defence capability, and specifically determining the extent to which the benefits identified in the original case for change and subsequent design activity have been realised. This data would be reported externally via the Defence Annual Report.


With respect to the various components of Recommendation 2:


1st dot point: Agree.


2nd dot point: Agree in principle.


3rd dot point: Agree in principle.


 4th dot point: Agree in principle.








Recommendation dot point









Response








1. The breakdown of personnel in each service category




 




This metric will be measured through data obtained in the Human Resources Data Warehouse (through PMKeyS/Defence One).


Data will be refreshed on a monthly basis in the Human Resources Metric System.


The first batch of data will be available approximately two months after the Total Workforce Model is enabled in Defence's Human Resources system (PMKeyS).






2. Australian Defence Force critical categories




 




The measurement of Australian Defence Force critical categories is an existing metric in the Human Resources Metric System, and Suakin does not propose changing the way in which critical categories are measured.


Suakin is proposing an additional method of analysing the data by enabling a cross-reference to the relevant Service Category that these members are in.


The publication of statistical data regarding Australian Defence Force critical categories will be done in a way which prevents disclosure of points of fragility in Australian Defence Force capabilities.






3. Re-engagement by service and sector including assessment of industry


skills captured




 




It is not practical to collect and validate quantitative data to support the recommendation as it is worded, however, Defence will collate and publish information about transfers between service categories and the application of service option D (an arrangement whereby a member's skills and experience are shared between Defence and an industry partner).






4. Quantification of the benefits of personnel retention




 




The Total Workforce Model evaluation approach is designed to assess whether the outcomes intended by the implementation of the Total Workforce Model have been realised and have, as a consequence, contributed to the generation and sustainment of Defence capability. With the strategic goal of enabling Defence capability in mind, the framework is structured around the optimisation of the personnel and organisation fundamental inputs to capability.


A number of quantitative and qualitative measures have been developed that inform the achievement of effects a Total Workforce Model will generate.


One of these effects is ""sustainment of capability by attracting and retaining the right people"". There are many Defence and single Service initiatives currently underway that influence a number of these metrics and that the Total Workforce Model will not be the sole contributor to the outcomes realised.












Recommendation 3



The Committee recommends that the Department of Defence develop more innovative ways to recruit, especially in the science, technology and engineering fields. The Committee further recommends that the Department, together with the Service Chiefs, utilise the following initiatives to better attract people with science, engineering and technical skills:


engagement with secondary schools at the Year 10 level such as visits, placements and work experience;


the Australian Defence Force Gap Year; and


Defence University Sponsorship.




Government response 





Agree.



Defence agrees that further attention to attracting personnel in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields is required and intends to build on existing programs. Defence notes the recommendations of the Committee and advises the work to date in this area is as follows:


Engagement with secondary schools at the Year 10 level. Defence Force Recruiting's workforce includes a large cohort of serving Australian Defence Force members who operate in Careers Promotions Teams, conducting a range of local recruiting events, which enable Defence Force Recruiting to engage with prospective recruits with specific science, technology, engineering and mathematics skills. These events include school visits, career expos, information sessions and targeted experiences to attract suitable candidates. They also include familiarisation tours to Defence establishments to view training, undertake military presentations and engage with key staff and cadets.


The number of events conducted in financial year 2014-15 was 4,107, with 2,610 conducted thus far in 2015-16, across Australia. Recruiting events are conducted at high schools, TAFEs and universities to targeted audiences (16-24 year old men and women) studying science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects.


Career advisers from universities, high schools and private practices are given the opportunity to enhance their knowledge of the career pathways available in the Australian Defence Force through science, technology and engineering programs.


Three Specialist Recruiting Teams—one each for health, engineering and technical trades, with the last one focused on universities and TAFEs and the first two specifically focused on promotion of the Defence University Sponsorships to undergraduates.


Defence also recognised the attraction science, technology, engineering and mathematics has within the culturally and linguistically diverse communities and has incorporated this engagement as a critical element of the recruiting culturally and linguistically diverse strategy.


Examples of current events and discussions include support of the Society of Automotive Engineers' Formula' student design competition, discussions with the Engineering Faculty at Sydney University to formalise engagement with student societies in 2016, presentation to high school students at Royal Australian Air Force Base Richmond supported by Honeywell Engineering, and a Defence University Sponsorship campaign conducted at Garden Island.


 Defence Force Recruiting notes that Australian Defence Force Gap Year was re-introduced in 2015 and will continue as a key component of the Australian Defence Force engaging young Australians.


Defence implements a range of strategies to attract young women studying culturally and linguistically diverse to the Australian Public Service through high school awareness programs, graduate entry level programs and university sponsorships. Such strategies include:


o collaboration with the Australian Business and Community Network through its Influence-Her program for high performing Year 10 female students studying culturally and linguistically diverse to improve awareness of technical careers for women in the Defence Australian Public Service;


o implementation of a dedicated science and technology recruitment and development stream in 2016 for Defence Australian Public Service graduates, to attract and train high performing university students for careers in research and innovation in Defence Science and Technology and for technical roles in the Defence Intelligence Agencies; and


o sponsored university study through the Undergraduate Scholarship Program for Female Students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics at the Australian National University, the University of New South Wales and the University of Adelaide; and the Defence Civilian Undergraduate Sponsorship for engineering students to study for free through the University of New South Wales, Canberra, currently comprising 13 students, seven of whom are female.




Recommendation 4



The Committee recommends that, whilst maintaining physical standards, the Department of Defence ensure the standards are fit for purpose and exercise flexibility on a case-by-case basis.




Government response 





Agree in principle.



Defence continues to explore ways to enhance and increase the participation of diverse groups in the Australian Defence Force while recognising the unique nature of Australian Defence Force requirements, sometimes under strict parameters.


The aim of the physical employment standards is to identify appropriate physical tests for entry and continued employment in employment categories in order to select personnel best suited for the demands of that employment group. As a second order effect this may reduce injuries, with a consequent increase in personnel availability for operations and training and reduction in costs of health care and compensation.


The physical employment standards for combat roles recently opened to women were reviewed to ensure they are scientifically based, occupationally relevant and do not discriminate based on age or gender. The physical employment standards will be reviewed annually to ensure the assessments still meet the requirements of each employment category. These standards apply a fit for purpose methodology, therefore Defence agrees with the recommendation that the physical standards are fit for purpose.


Defence will apply flexibility with the physical employment standards on a case-by-case basis for specific medical circumstances only. All personnel will be required to pass the physical employment standards in order to be fully qualified in their specific employment group.




Recommendation 5



The Committee recommends that the Departments of Defence and Veterans' Affairs report the progress and results of their mental health programs, including the Longitudinal Australian Defence Force Study Evaluating Resilience.




Government response 





Agree.



There are a range of mental health programs which are conducted jointly and separately by Defence and the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA). The Departments will report on the progress and results of these mental health programs through the following reporting mechanisms.




Defence programs., Defence provides a comprehensive range of mental health programs that are available across the career lifespan of a member from enlistment through to operational deployment through to transition from the military. These include programs which are designed to: increase mental health awareness; provide skill-based training to Defence personnel on the management of mental health in Defence; provide clinical up-skilling to Defence health professionals on the assessment and treatment of mental health conditions; and the delivery of mental health and psychology services to Australian Defence Force members. The progress of these initiatives are reported against the Australian Defence Force Mental Health and Wellbeing Action Plan and in the Joint Health Command Annual Review.


In addition to the above, progress against mental health research projects are reported to the relevant approving ethical review bodies and results are disseminated through specifically designed communication strategies. For example, a comprehensive communication strategy will be developed for the final Longitudinal Australian Defence Force Study Evaluating Resilience report and actioned upon receipt and acceptance of the report by the Commonwealth.




Joint programs.

Since 2013, Defence and DVA have operated under a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the Cooperative Delivery of Care and Support to Eligible persons. Collaborative projects are managed under the MoU, with Defence and DVA maintaining a strong joint approach to mental health programs and research including the Transition and Wellbeing Research Programme, Defence referrals of Australian Defence Force personnel to the Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service (VVCS) for counselling, and the development of a range of e-mental health smart phone applications. The progress and results of these programs are reported to the Defence / Department of Veterans' Affairs Executive Committee as well as other relevant groups such as the Department of Veterans' Affairs Research Board or the Joint Health Command and VVCS Agreement for Services Steering Committee. Progress and results of joint programs are also reported against the Australian Defence Force Mental Health and Wellbeing Action Plan and in the Joint Health Command Annual Review where relevant.


The Government also notes that Defence and DVA already provide annual reports to Parliament and are accountable to Parliament, including through the Budget estimates process, for supplying any reasonable request for information.




DVA programs.

DVA purchases and provides a range of mental health services for its clients: online mental health information and support through the At Ease mental health portal at


www.at-ease.dva.gov.au, GP services, psychologist and social work services, psychiatric services, pharmaceuticals, posttraumatic stress disorder programs, and hospital services for those who need it. VVCS also provides counselling and group programs to veterans, peacekeepers and eligible family members. VVCS is a specialised, free and confidential Australia-wide service and may be contacted 24 hours a day by calling 1800 011 046. DVA can pay for certain mental health treatment whatever the cause (whether or not the condition is related to service), and the conditions covered are PTSD, anxiety, depression, alcohol use disorder and substance-use disorder. From July 2016, eligibility for these non-liability mental health arrangements is available to anyone who has had permanent service in the ADF, no matter what the service or how long.


The Government has committed to an annual Ministerial statement to Parliament on key issues impacting upon the veteran community and the performance of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This will be a transparent process which will measure the performance of the Department and increase accountability to the veteran community. Tackling the mental health challenges for veterans and their families is a pillar of the Government's plan for veterans' affairs and will feature in this annual Ministerial statement.


The Government announced on 11 August 2016 that the National Mental Health Commission in conjunction with clinical experts and a reference group comprised of current and former members of Defence, will analyse the effectiveness of existing suicide and self-harm prevention services.




Recommendation 6



The Committee recommends that the Department of Defence develop methods to collect and collate data on the On Base Advisory Service to measure its effectiveness.




Government response 





Agree in principle.



The On Base Advisory Service is administered by the Department of Veterans' Affairs with the support of Defence. On Base Advisory Service activity data is reported to the Defence Links Steering Committee, a joint Defence and Department of Veterans' Affairs committee. The Department of Veterans' Affairs is in the process of refining the On Base Advisory Service performance framework. This work will enable the Defence Links Steering Committee to more effectively monitor the performance and effectiveness of the On Base Advisory Service.




Recommendation 7



The Committee recommends the reporting to Parliament on the Joint Strike Fighter Program be more comprehensive and equivalent to that made available to the United States Congress.



Government response




Disagree.



As a partner in the United States led global F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program, Australia gains insight into the Program through a range of mechanisms and forums. While we are a partner with a level of influence, the United States leads the F-35 Program and is directly responsible for the conduct of the global F-35 Program.


In the United States context, the delivery of the Joint Strike Fighter capability attracts a high level of scrutiny as the largest global Defence acquisition project to date. Reports by the Director Operational Test and Evaluation and United States Government Audit Office are produced by organisations independent of the United States F-35 Joint Program Office and are made publicly available. Defence analyses these US reports and includes specifics as it relates to the Australian JSF Program.


As part of the Major Projects Review, the Australian National Audit Office conducts an annual audit and report of the Australian Joint Strike Fighter Program. This report is equivalent to the reports produced by the United States organisations. In addition, Defence reports to Government annually on the status of the F-35 Program and regularly provides evidence to Senate Estimates and the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. The Joint Strike Fighter Division of the Capability Acquisition and Sustainment Group is also required to provide annual advice to the Australian Government as an update on the Australian Joint Strike Fighter Program, including specific briefings on the more classified elements of the Program.


Defence believes the current level of reporting of all major programs, including the Australian Joint Strike Fighter Program, closely mirrors United States congressional reporting, with some exceptions like the Director Operational Test and Evaluation report which has no equivalent organisation or report in the Australian context.




Recommendation 8



The Committee recommends that, to aid transparency and accuracy, the Department of Defence record and periodically report the quantum of unfunded liabilities held by Defence, including:


where the unfunded liability occurred;


how the unfunded liabilities were created; and, where relevant


factors and decisions that led to funding being reallocated.


The Committee does not expect this reporting to form part of Defence's annual financial statements. 



Government response





Disagree.



Defence's actual and contingent liabilities, as defined by Australian Accounting Standards, are accounted for and disclosed in the annual financial statements. Underinvestment in Defence capabilities is considered in the preparation of the annual financial statements when identifying whether assets may be impaired in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards.


The Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board notes that an essential characteristic of a liability is that an entity has a present obligation. A decision by management to acquire assets in the future does not, of itself, give rise to a present obligation.


As part of the White Paper process Defence has rebalanced the funding assigned to Defence in the budget and over the forward estimates against the Government's future requirements. This rebalance has allocated funding to Defence capability, including major capital equipment, facilities and infrastructure, and information and communication technologies. This rebalance has been rigorously cost assured by external assessors. Any future variations to the funded commitments in the White Paper will be considered through the mechanisms developed in accordance with the recommendations of the First Principles Review. As such, any additional commitment will be managed transparently in an enterprise-wide approach across the Defence portfolio, with in-year commitments managed by the Enterprise Business Committee, and future commitments managed by the Investment Committee. Any changes in planned expenditure across Defence programmes which may result in unfunded capabilities will subsequently be detailed in the Portfolio Statements which are open to scrutiny through the Senate Estimate Committee process.




Recommendation 9



The Committee recommends that the Defence Annual Reports include appropriately detailed information on the Fuel Services Branch, in particular the progress of fuel farm remediation and remaining work to be done. The Committee further recommends that the Department of Defence actively explore options to engage and collaborate with industry on fuel management and security.




Government response 





Agree in principle.



Future Defence Annual Reports will provide more detail on the reform of the Defence Fuel Supply Chain and initiatives to enhance its operational resilience.


The establishment of the Fuel Services Branch in early 2015 was a key recommendation of the Wraith Review (commissioned by the Secretary of Defence in late 2013) to support the appointment of Commander Joint Logistics as Head of Defence Fuel Supply Chain, creating a single point of accountability for the on-time and in-full delivery of fuel to meet the needs of capability managers. This replaced a fragmented and dysfunctional management structure that did not have clear roles or lines of responsibility.


Throughout 2015, Fuel Services Branch focused on remediating the issues identified by the Wraith Review as being of greatest concern, notably the asset integrity of Defence fuel installations, working relationships between facility operators and maintenance contractors, safe work practices, staff training, and capital estate management for existing and new fuel infrastructure. An extensive Hazard Risk Assessment program commenced in mid-2014 to identify key risks and issues across the primary Defence fuel installations, leading to these now being managed in a more coordinated and structured way with key stakeholders across Defence. The Hazard Risk Assessment program has also assisted in focussing specialist fuel engineering expertise on the asset integrity of the Defence Fuel Supply Chain, which will be further assisted by the design and development of a centralised Defence Fuel Supply Chain Engineering Management System during 2016. The Hazard Risk Assessment program will be completed by 30 June 2016.


Commander Joint Logistics promulgated the Defence Fuel Supply Chain Strategic Plan 2015-2022 internally on the Fuel Services Branch intranet site in November 2015. The Plan sets out the key strategic goals for Defence to develop end-to-end management within the Defence Fuel Supply Chain and also to optimise the safe, effective and efficient delivery of fuel to meet capability. A complementary Defence Fuel Supply Chain Operational Plan for 2015-16 has also been promulgated internally that will address all of the key recommendations of the Wraith Review.


Key to both the Defence Fuel Supply Chain strategic and operational plans is the roll out of the Defence Fuel Management System during 2016 and 2017. The Defence Fuel Management System will provide a comprehensive and integrated system for identifying and managing all Defence Fuel Supply Chain related risks. It describes what controls are to be implemented for Defence Fuel Supply Chain functions and minimum requirements related to those controls. System level requirements also describe key roles and responsibilities for each function (aligned to the Defence Fuel Supply Chain organisation) and related performance measurement and evaluation requirements.


The Defence Fuel Management System is designed so far as possible to operate seamlessly with whole-of-Defence, Joint Logistic Command and single Service safety and environmental management systems. It seeks to contextualise the requirements of those systems into one set of documents focussed exclusively on Defence Fuel Supply Chain related activities and operations. An important element within the Defence Fuel Management System is performance monitoring and governance, which is being designed to provide a multi-layered and robust performance monitoring and governance framework to ensure risk control performance is monitored at all levels.


Chief of Defence Force in July 2014 and seeks to identify opportunities for greater industry participation through reduced costs of ownership, reduced enterprise risk and rationalisation of certain military-specific fuels in favour of commercial grade products. The Fuel Network Review is focusing on bulk fuels only and is due to be completed by December 2016.




Recommendation 10



The Committee recommends that the Department of Defence, in partnership with Defence Housing Australia, prepare an effective consultation and communication framework with the community for use in ongoing and future redevelopments.




Government response 





Agree.



Defence Housing Australia has a strong record of establishing and maintaining relationships with the communities in which Defence Housing Australia developments are constructed. In addition, Defence Housing Australia continues to review its practices to ensure they are tailored to meet the specific needs of each development.


Defence Housing Australia aims to make information about development projects publicly available wherever possible, in line with the requirements of the applicable local council or authority. Community engagement can occur in various forms, from listening to the community in the early stages of planning through to keeping local residents and community groups informed as the project advances. Community engagement is conducted in line with Defence Housing Australia process instructions for Development Marketing and Defence Housing Australia Development Marketing Community Engagement guidelines.


Defence Housing Australia has well practiced and successful procedures in place to engage with the community and stakeholders regarding its developments. These involve communication strategies such as letter drops, internet sites, newsletters and community meetings. Consultation with the community is broad and feedback is considered as part of the planning process for every development.


The ways in which Defence Housing Australia consults and communicates with the community for developments, as per Defence Housing Australia Development Marketing Community Engagement guidelines, are shown as follows:

Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (17:47):  In respect of the government response to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on its inquiry into the review of the Defence annual report 2013-14, I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I am pleased to see this response. It is a response to an inquiry that was conducted some time ago. The inquiry was post that annual report being delivered. With the fluxion of time, and an election in between, clearly the response had taken some time to come. But I am pleased, as I read through it, to see a number of the recommendations agreed with. There are a couple that are not that I would like to comment on.


For a start, recommendation 1 goes to the skill sets, the competence and the experience of people in Defence. The recommendation was: 


… the Job Families Project be further developed to incorporate accurate assessments of both qualifications and experience that are required for a given role. 


This is important. If you look at other safety-critical areas, such as the oil and gas industry, they normally work on quite a strict matrix of both qualification and experience before somebody is delegated a certain level of authority to make decisions.


What we have seen too often in the past is that, where Defence feels it has been constrained by the posting cycle, or by the people who are available, whether they are in uniform or the Public Service, people are put into a role even if their qualifications or experience are not necessarily the most appropriate or, in some cases, I would argue, even adequate for that role. Over a number of inquiries, I have been making the point that, whether we are talking about somebody who is a contract negotiator, somebody who is working in a force development area or somebody who is engaging with industry, the competencies required for the role—that mix of qualification and experience—should be clearly defined.


The concern I have had with the Job Families Project in the past is that, for example, if you needed neurosurgery done, the job family for the person that would do that is somebody in the health stream of Army, somebody who is qualified and senior enough to be a surgeon. So the Job Families Project identifies such a person. They are available, so they get posted. But if the person happens to be an orthopaedic surgeon—they are still in the medical family and they still have that level of training with good qualifications—the actual task-specific competence may not be there for the job you want. Neurosurgery should not be done by an orthopaedic surgeon. It is a very simple example.


Defence has some areas where it does this well. In aerospace engineering, for example, the regulator—the Directorate General Technical Airworthiness—will look at the person whom the Chief of Army, Navy or Air Force wants to post into a position and will assess their qualifications and experience and say what level of authority they will delegate to them. Within that airworthiness framework, Defence has a model that works well, but across many areas we see people posted into positions where they do not actually have the requisite experience to do those roles. I welcome the fact that Defence has agreed to this recommendation, or has looked to further involve the Job Families Project so that they actually do an audit of the qualifications and experience that any given role might need so that they can identify the gaps and help those people achieve the goals.


There is also a link with this recommendation in the Defence Industry Policy Statement and the first principles reviewwhich look at the kinds of programmatic capabilities that Defence requires. Again, I will come back to aerospace engineering, because it is one that I think is a good example to work with. For many decades Australia has had that quite robust system of taking graduates from university, training them in aerospace engineering or in structures or systems engineering and giving them hands-on experiences with maintained aircraft, and then they get posted to various parts of the organisation, whether they are maintaining or procuring equipment—being that classic smart buyer of equipment. What we are seeing as we have more and more of our aircraft purchased off the shelf is that the cost case that is often used to justify buying something off the shelf is that a lot of the design support network and the through-life engineering support is done by the providing country. If we buy something from the United States then either the US Navy or Air Force or the original equipment manufacturer will provide that engineering. What that means is that we have less opportunity for graduates here to actually get their hands dirty, so to speak, and get the competence—the experience as well as their qualification to do the role.


So, one of the things that I see that the Defence Industry Policy Statement leads to is that it has this concept of industry skills being a fundamental input to capabilities. The service chief now has the opportunity to look at these skill sets that are required and look at their workforces—not only uniformed but also including the Australian public servants and including industry people. Whether they are contracted, is in the services, or whether they are contracted into a defence organisation, for the workforce they are looking at, the spread of competence covers all three of those areas. So, for something like aerospace engineering, if we do not have the opportunity—because for things like the Joint Strike Fighter or the Super Hornet all that work is done overseas—if we want to have people who are competent to actually be in our technical airworthiness areas in the future and in our procurement areas and to be the smart providers, we have to look for other opportunities to give them that hands-on experience. In the past, with a program like the PC-9 replacement, we would see that as a training aircraft with no operational need to have all the back-of-house functions to support it, so we probably would have gone out to seek a power by the hour arrangement where somebody else would provide the aircraft on the flight line, ready to fly.


But the thinking of the first principles review and the Defence Industry Policy Statement is that if this is the most cost-effective way for Defence to develop its future workforce of aerospace engineers then perhaps we should actually look at taking this training platform and doing a certain amount of that design support engineering—that continuing airworthiness work—here in Australia so that we can take young graduates who have their degree and give them practical hands-on experience so that when we need people at that more senior level to interface with the US Navy, the US Air Force, British forces or the manufacturers we have people with the requisite level of competence to engage and be that smart buyer or that smart maintainer of our equipment. There is a fair bit in that one recommendation and I am pleased to see that the government has picked that up. We will look to develop that further as the Defence Industry Policy Statement is implemented.


That also goes to recommendation 3, which looks at ways to increase STEM—science, technology, engineering and mathematics—engagement of young people. Increasingly, and it has probably ever been thus, we need to get lower down into the schools, at the year 9 and 10 type levels. This is so that when young people are making decisions about the subjects they will choose they will have a vision of what the job might entail, of the opportunities that working in an engineering type field might present to them, so that the subject choices they make at that mid-high school level are not limiting their options if they want to go on and pursue that technical type of stream. I am very pleased to see the government agree to support that.


Recommendation 7 is around the Joint Strike Fighter and a more comprehensive evaluation of project status. I have raised, in the past, the point about the conspiracy of optimism in how many Defence projects are reported to the parliament and that this has led to false expectation about the time frame and level of capability that will be delivered. Where there is any doubt or concern about the progress, through the manufacturing, testing or certification, that should be made abundantly clear in reporting opportunities, whether that be through ANAO reports, the annual report or reports on major projects.


In the past it is been disturbing to see summaries of really significant projects, like the Joint Strike Fighter, have an almost one paragraph 'It's all good, Guv' type story, when you read in open sourced American literature, through things like their Operational Test and Evaluation program, that there are significant concerns about the rate of progress.


I believe that whilst Defence, in their response, have indicated the US is the predominant builder of the aircraft and therefore it is their role to highlight if there are deficiencies in the program, our reporting should at least acknowledge and link or point to the American reporting. That is so the casual or interested reader, here, will realise it is not all an optimistic view and that perhaps there are other things they need to consider. (Time expired)

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2016-11-22,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (17:57):  It is my pleasure to comment on the Australian government response to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade report into the review of the Defence annual report 2013-14. In so doing, I acknowledge the role of Senator Fawcett in his capacity as chair of that review committee.


The committee resolved, in that report, to focus on five principal areas: firstly, the First Principles Review; secondly, matters pertaining to personnel; thirdly, mental health; fourthly, capability development and major projects; and fifthly, Defence support. During that period 2013-14, July to June, the ADF was involved in three whole-of-government operations: Operation Sovereign Borders, which is highly successful and continuing, Operation Southern Indian Ocean and Operation Bring Them Home. During that period, the Defence Force completed two operations. It is a little while ago now but think back to operation New South Wales bushfires and Operation Philippines Assist. Both benefited enormously from the professionalism in the involvement, the speed and the rapid deployment of Australian Defence Force personnel.


During that time the Department of Defence commenced major organisational change with the release of the First Principles Review, the abolition of the Defence Materiel Organisation and its replacement with the creation of the new Capability Acquisition and Sustainment Group. It was a very busy period during that era.


The first principles review has been mentioned by the previous speaker. Personnel matters were a major element of the committee's review, forming some of the recommendations about which I will speak. Matters covered included Project Suakin, addressing itself to the question of the Total Workforce Model, developed by the Chief of the Defence Force and his colleagues; recruitment and employment of women; cultural reform; and military justice. In the space of mental health, areas examined included mental resilience, particularly at the stage of recruitment into the Defence Force; the culture towards mental health in the ADF; and the work being undertaken—we see a continuation of it now—with personnel transitioning out of the services. It is gratifying to see that the work we are doing at the moment in the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee is picking up and continuing to look at these very areas. 


The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade report quite correctly recognised and appreciated the work undertaken by Defence and the Department of Veterans Affairs, acknowledging the importance of the collaboration between the two departments in addressing mental health conditions, which are all too relevant, all too important and require the very highest level of attention by the Senate itself. I am pleased that the report acknowledged the dedication and commitment of the men and women of the Australian Defence Force and commended them on the outstanding service that they provide to the nation. One should never forget the wider and extended Defence family. When a person is serving, whether they be deployed here in Australia or overseas, we know only too acutely the role of the extended family—the parents, grandparents, siblings and others—and the contribution they make.


I am delighted, in speaking to the Australian government's response to the report, to confirm the commitment of the Turnbull government to Australia's long-term security and economic prosperity as they relate particularly to the roles undertaken by our defence industry and Defence personnel. The review of the Defence annual report has been welcomed. As Senator Fawcett was discussing previously, the review made 10 recommendations, which I intend, if time permits, to address briefly, particularly the one or two that my colleague did not have the opportunity to comment upon. 


I do want to emphasise the financial commitment the Turnbull government is making to ensure the long-term security of the country and the viability of the Defence Force. We know—it is picked up in the review and the government's response—that the government is acutely aware that Defence must be prepared for a more uncertain operating environment in the future, and that of course has been highlighted only over the last few days. We know that we have both state and nonstate actors who now have access to a range of cheaper, more precise and capable weapons systems. We know that sophisticated cyberthreats continue to evolve. Of course, my own particular area is in biosecurity and the capacity of terrorists and others to use relatively cheap organisms for devastating impact, not only within our shores but in other areas we would seek to have some involvement in in terms of protection. We know the Defence Force does operate and will continue to operate in congested environments, where the adversary is not easily identified and of course has the capacity to move quickly from tension to conflict and back again. We have seen evidence of that in the past; we are seeing more evidence of it now.


What is very pleasing is that so much of the review—the comments in it, the recommendations made in it by the committee chaired by Senator Fawcett—has now found its way into policy and procedures which we are seeing being played out. For example, the Turnbull government has increased defence spending by $30 billion over the next decade so that we will move back to a level of defence spending of two per cent of GDP, which is in stark contrast, regrettably, to the last Labor government, where, in terms of GDP expenditure on defence, we were down at levels not seen since 1938, assisted by the slashing of some $18 billion from the defence budget. The white paper prepared at that time, but not really ever announced or released to any extent, was left shattered.


I had the privilege earlier this year, and the company of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence, to be at ADFA for the release of the white paper, the 2016 document that will form the basis of Defence Force activities going into the future. At the same time, the wisdom of Defence Minister Payne was evident in ensuring that the defence industry paper was released on the same day, emphasising the integral need and role of Australian industry in delivering on what will be the commitments for defence into the future. The white paper, of course, is now so readily accepted and so readily understood. Along with that, the defence industry paper is working with the white paper to deliver for the Australian community and for the Defence Force.


Central to this whole project is the concept of continuous naval shipbuilding, which will secure Australian naval shipbuilding capacity right out for the next 30 to 40 years, not just providing employment for Australians in manufacturing and construction, but providing an ongoing and integral role for Australian industry in the whole-of-life example for the vessels—we all well know of the dozen Future Submarines that will be constructed, with the oversight of DCNS, in Adelaide; the Future Frigate Program; the future offshore patrol vessels; and indeed the Pacific Patrol Vessels, which are already under construction. In observing the Australian government's response to this particular review, I am pleased to report on the strong commitment of the government in terms of personnel, management, funding and whole-of-life for our defence forces.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2016-11-22,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:07):  I, too, would like to commence my contribution to the discussion of the government response to the review of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade of the Defence annual report 2013-14 by congratulating the chairman, Senator Fawcett, on the work he is currently doing and the work he did in relation to this particular review. I note with some interest that four senators are intending to speak on this particular report, from the government side at least, and all four of us—Senator Cash, Senator McKenzie, Senator Fawcett and I—are actually members of the joint standing committee and were involved in the preparation of this review of the Defence annual report 2013-14. The report was tabled some time ago. Since then the government has responded to the report and in the time available to me I want to address just a couple of the recommendations and the government's response to them.


Those of us involved in and around our defence service personnel understand the importance of mental health programs. Indeed, we do understand that active service in the military forces of any country, since time immemorial almost, does have an impact on the mental health of many of the participants in combat and combat operations. I am based in Townsville, in North Queensland, the home of Australia's largest army base, Lavarack Barracks. From Lavarack, almost since its inception in pre-Vietnam war days, troops from Townsville have gone overseas to be engaged in active combat situations. They return, and very often in the community we see the results of the difficulties experienced by serving members of the Defence Force coming back from those engagements. 


One of the recommendations of the committee, recommendation 5, was that the Department of Defence and the Department of Veterans' Affairs report progress and results on their mental health programs, including the longitudinal Australian Defence Force study Evaluating Resilience. The committee went through this issue at some length and made that recommendation. The government's response to that recommendation has been that the government agrees. In its agreement, the government says this in its response:


There are a range of mental health programs which are conducted jointly and separately by Defence and the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA). The Departments will report on the progress and results of these mental health programs through the following reporting mechanisms.


Then the response by the government goes through those. They include Defence programs, joint programs and DVA programs. The government's response indicates how that happens in each case. In relation to Defence programs:


Defence provides a comprehensive range of mental health programs that are available across the career lifespan of a member from enlistment through to operational deployment through to transition from the military. These include programs which are designed to: increase mental health awareness; provide skill-based training to Defence personnel on the management of mental health in Defence; provide clinical up-skilling to Defence health professionals on the assessment and treatment of mental health conditions; and the delivery of mental health and psychology services to Australian Defence Force members. The progress of these initiatives are reported against the Australian Defence Force Mental Health and Wellbeing Action Plan and in the Joint Health Command Annual Review.


In addition to the above, progress against mental health research projects are reported to the relevant approving ethical review bodies and results are disseminated through specifically designed communication strategies.


I thank the government for its comprehensive response to that recommendation dealing with Defence programs. In relation to joint programs, the response says:


Since 2013, Defence and DVA have operated under a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the Cooperative Delivery of Care and Support to Eligible persons. Collaborative projects are managed under the MoU, with Defence and DVA maintaining a strong joint approach to mental health programs and research including the Transition and Wellbeing Research Programme, Defence referrals of Australian Defence Force personnel to the Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service (VVCS) for counselling, and the development of a range of e-mental health smart phone applications—


That is an innovation which will become more and more useful as the years roll on—


The progress and results of these programs are reported to the Defence / Department of Veterans' Affairs Executive Committee as well as other relevant groups such as the Department of Veterans' Affairs Research Board or the Joint Health Command and VVCS Agreement for Services Steering Committee. Progress and results of joint programs are also reported against the Australian Defence Force Mental Health and Wellbeing Action Plan—


that I mentioned previously.


In addition to that, as the government's response shows, the Department of Veterans' Affairs also purchases and provides a range of mental health services for its clients. Online mental health information and support through the At Ease mental health portal is also available. There are GP services, psychologist services, social work services, psychiatric services, pharmaceuticals, post-traumatic stress disorder programs and hospital services for those who need them. This program also provides counselling and group programs to veterans, peacekeepers and eligible family members. Of course, family members are an important element of these programs in the understanding of the issues faced by some of our returning and even current Defence Force members.


There are 24-hours-a-day phone lines to help with any problems that might need addressing at all hours of the day and night. DVA can also pay for certain mental health treatments, whatever the cause—whether or not the condition is related to service—and conditions covered by PTSD, anxiety, depression, alcohol-use disorder and substance-use disorder. From July this year, eligibility for these non-liability mental health arrangements will be available to anyone who has had permanent service in the ADF, no matter what the service or for how long.


The government indicates in its response as well that it is committed to an annual ministerial statement to parliament on key issues impacting upon the veteran community and the performance of the Department of Veterans' Affairs.


I have just mentioned elements of this response at length because it does show that the government, indeed, as it should, on behalf of all Australians, does whatever it can to assist those who have served their country but who may be suffering some sort of mental health issue. Sometimes in this chamber we hear about those things, but we do not often hear about the extent of the provisions that the government has developed to do everything possible to address some of these issues. I am delighted that it has done so. As I say, as a nation that is grateful for the work that our service personnel have done, they should expect nothing less and neither does the nation.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2016-11-22,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (18:17):  I rise to speak to the review of the government's response to the Defence annual review. The Turnbull government is committed to ensuring Australia's long-term security and economic prosperity. I welcome the review of the Defence annual report 2013-14 by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I know I am not the only one. We have heard from Senators Macdonald, Back and Fawcett about our government's commitment to the security of our nation and additionally to ensuring that we procure as much as possible from our local market, developing those skills and providing jobs and growth right across our nation as a result of our focus on our defence capability.


I particularly welcome the recommendations, and later in my contribution I will go through those recommendations in more detail. As detailed in the 2016 Defence white paper, the government has a comprehensive, long-term plan to ensure we have more a potent, agile and innovative Australian Defence Force capable of achieving Australia's strategic objectives.


I have just left a briefing from some of the larger international players in our defence industry here in Australia. They are quite buoyant. They are excited about the opportunities provided by the government's Defence white paper and the jobs and growth that it will provide not just in capital cities and not just in South Australia, as welcome as that is, but right across our nation.


In the few minutes available to me, I will go into more detail around our ability and capacity as a nation of federal and state governments working together to build those science, technology, engineering and mathematics skills so that we have a workforce that is able to meet the demand that will be coming, growing and sustained over coming decades as a result of our government's commitment and investment in defence industry. Our commitment is based on the government's detailed assessment of Australia's strategic outlook to 2035. It is the most comprehensive defence white paper ever and it, for the first time, properly aligns strategy, capability and resources to make the Australian Defence Force more capable, agile and potent.


We are acutely aware that Defence must be prepared for a more uncertain operating environment. State and nonstate actors will have access to a range of cheaper, more precise and more capable weapon systems. Sophisticated cyber threats will continue to evolve, and the Australian Defence Force will often operate in congested environments where the adversary is not easily identifiable and contingencies move quickly from tension to conflict. Through the government's white paper, Defence will have highly capable and flexible forces. Our government has increased defence spending by $29.9 billion over the next decade, as we deliver on our commitment to increase spending to two per cent of GDP. Also, we are not just going to be throwing the money out with a lack of accountability and transparency; we are going to track this over time, which is a welcome change.


The 2016 budget delivers on the government's commitment to ensuring our long-term security and economic prosperity. Through the implementation of the first principles review, the Turnbull government is delivering on our 2013 election commitment to ensure that Defence is appropriately structured and organised and has the right business practices in place to support the Australian Defence Force in the 21st century.


It was only last week that I was joined by the Minister for Defence Industry, Minister Pyne, in my home state of Victoria at Victoria Barracks to see the first 10 Hawkei vehicles handed over to the Defence Force. The Hawkei is a responsive vehicle, a high-protection vehicle, that builds on the design perspectives and research from the famous Bushmaster vehicle, which has taken the world by storm. The Bushmaster has protected Australian soldiers in theatres—particularly in the Middle East—but it is exported to other nations and it is an incredibly useful piece of equipment in the defence arsenal.


The Hawkei protected vehicle is produced in Bendigo, in the heart of regional Victoria, and as a result of Thales Australia winning that contract 170 jobs have been able to be retained and maintained locally, in the Bendigo region. This vehicle is Australian-designed—a world class design—and we are hoping not only that we can have our own soldiers using the vehicles in theatres right across the world but also that this vehicle—as it is world class and world leading in the type of technology it employs and in its design—will be a vehicle we can export to other nations. I know Thales is working very, very hard on that.


In terms of sustainment of the vehicle over time, 30 jobs will be created, primarily in Queensland. What is unique about the vehicle is that, while it had to have the high level of protection that you get from the Bushmaster, it had to be very light. You had to be able to lift this vehicle up with a Chinook and cart it wherever you needed it, which provided some challenges in trying to marry that personnel protection aspect, which makes it very heavy, with the light weight so that it can be moved around and give that agility and capability to our defence forces. Defence signed a $1.3 billion contract with Thales Australia last October to produce 1,100 Hawkei vehicles with more than 1,000 companion trailers. It was very, very exciting to be with the minister at Victoria Barracks last week to actually see those vehicles and get to sit in them.


I want to briefly touch on the recommendations from the review. Senator Fawcett went into some detail on the 10 recommendations. The government has agreed to a number of them. Having just now come out of the briefing with the Defence primes about the types of skills we need and the level of engagement they are having with Australia universities, in niche areas, to build collaboration, and hopefully commercialisation, of that research over time, it is very exciting. Recommendation 3—that Defence develops 'more innovative ways to recruit, especially in the science, technology and engineering fields'—goes to the very heart of our government's agenda around ensuring that Australia is ready, capable and excited about an economy based on science. I remember that in his speech at the Prime Minister's science awards last year the Prime Minister said that science was going to be at the very heart of our nation's economy. It is true, and it must be so in the 21st century. So I am very proud of our government for pursuing a range of initiatives in this place to ensure that that becomes a reality.


In terms of recommendation 3, which I just read out, the government agrees around a number of initiatives to better attract people with science, engineering and technical skills into the defence field. I heard it directly from the Prime Minister that we need to be getting into secondary schools. We need to be saying to those young people that defence holds an exciting future for them and they just need to get involved in these subjects. So, recommendation 3 includes more engagement with secondary schools, at the year 10 level, such as visits, placements and work experience; ensuring that the Australian Defence Force gap year is promoted; and the implementation of a Defence university scholarship.


Defence agrees that further attention is required to attract personnel in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields, and to build on these existing programs. The review notes the work that was done. I suggest to senators who are interested in this area to go to page 4 of the government response, where there is quite a detailed outline of the initiatives undertaken and where Defence can actually build greater collaboration. One of the implementation strategies was around attracting young culturally and linguistically diverse women to the APS through high school awareness programs, graduate entry-level programs, and university scholarships. 


I am very proud to be part of a government that is investing in defence and in projects that will ensure supply chain jobs. Coming from Victoria, with its automotive industry closures, this is exciting news for our state.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion moved by Senator Fawcett in relation to the Defence annual report be agreed to.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (17:46): I present the government's response to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on its inquiry into the review of the Defence annual report 2013-14. I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The

 read as follows—





Australian Government response to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade report: Review of the Defence Annual Report 2013-14





November 2016





Recommendation 1 



The Committee recommends that the Jobs Families Project be further developed to incorporate accurate assessments of both qualifications and experience that are required for a given role. The Committee further recommends that, in its implementation of the First Principles Review, the Department of Defence develop its strategic planning and appointment process to ensure employees have task-specific competence for their role, and that opportunities are actively created for personnel to obtain this relevant experience.




Government response 





Agree.



The Defence Australian Public Service Job Families Project was completed with the establishment of 20 job families and over 2,100 occupation profiles. The evolution of job families is now part of business as usual. Development of the Defence Strategic Workforce Plan is progressing, which will include consideration of the Australian Public Service workforce. The Defence Strategic Workforce Plan will inform job family workforce plans that will drive workforce management including recruitment, learning and development, performance and talent management.


In preparation for the job family workforce plans, occupation profiles are being reviewed and amended to reflect changing Defence business and to identify key capabilities, key technical and core knowledge and skills, and other requirements such as qualifications and licenses.


Skills censuses of Australian Public Service staff are to be conducted during 2016 as part of the Defence census, which will enable assessment of individuals' capabilities against those of the occupation that they are engaged in. This information will provide significant input to workforce plans and subsequent initiatives including learning and development.


The Defence census and workforce planning will be part of a regular business planning cycle enabling Defence to monitor progress and adjust plans to address areas of workforce risk. This work is being undertaken, reported and regularly reviewed as an element of the Workforce Work Stream of the First Principles Review.




Recommendation 2



The Committee recommends that the Department of Defence collate and periodically publish figures on the effect of Project Suakin, including statistics on:


the breakdown of personnel in each service category;


Australian Defence Force critical categories;


re-engagement by service and sector including assessment of industry skills captured; and


quantification of the benefits of personnel retention.




Government response



In close consultation with the Services, Project Suakin (Suakin) has established a comprehensive evaluation framework based on a broad range of quantitative and qualitative data. The framework has been designed to measure the effectiveness of the Total Workforce Model in generating and sustaining Defence capability, and specifically determining the extent to which the benefits identified in the original case for change and subsequent design activity have been realised. This data would be reported externally via the Defence Annual Report.


With respect to the various components of Recommendation 2:


1st dot point: Agree.


2nd dot point: Agree in principle.


3rd dot point: Agree in principle.


 4th dot point: Agree in principle.








Recommendation dot point









Response








1. The breakdown of personnel in each service category




 




This metric will be measured through data obtained in the Human Resources Data Warehouse (through PMKeyS/Defence One).


Data will be refreshed on a monthly basis in the Human Resources Metric System.


The first batch of data will be available approximately two months after the Total Workforce Model is enabled in Defence's Human Resources system (PMKeyS).






2. Australian Defence Force critical categories




 




The measurement of Australian Defence Force critical categories is an existing metric in the Human Resources Metric System, and Suakin does not propose changing the way in which critical categories are measured.


Suakin is proposing an additional method of analysing the data by enabling a cross-reference to the relevant Service Category that these members are in.


The publication of statistical data regarding Australian Defence Force critical categories will be done in a way which prevents disclosure of points of fragility in Australian Defence Force capabilities.






3. Re-engagement by service and sector including assessment of industry


skills captured




 




It is not practical to collect and validate quantitative data to support the recommendation as it is worded, however, Defence will collate and publish information about transfers between service categories and the application of service option D (an arrangement whereby a member's skills and experience are shared between Defence and an industry partner).






4. Quantification of the benefits of personnel retention




 




The Total Workforce Model evaluation approach is designed to assess whether the outcomes intended by the implementation of the Total Workforce Model have been realised and have, as a consequence, contributed to the generation and sustainment of Defence capability. With the strategic goal of enabling Defence capability in mind, the framework is structured around the optimisation of the personnel and organisation fundamental inputs to capability.


A number of quantitative and qualitative measures have been developed that inform the achievement of effects a Total Workforce Model will generate.


One of these effects is ""sustainment of capability by attracting and retaining the right people"". There are many Defence and single Service initiatives currently underway that influence a number of these metrics and that the Total Workforce Model will not be the sole contributor to the outcomes realised.












Recommendation 3



The Committee recommends that the Department of Defence develop more innovative ways to recruit, especially in the science, technology and engineering fields. The Committee further recommends that the Department, together with the Service Chiefs, utilise the following initiatives to better attract people with science, engineering and technical skills:


engagement with secondary schools at the Year 10 level such as visits, placements and work experience;


the Australian Defence Force Gap Year; and


Defence University Sponsorship.

Agree.



Defence agrees that further attention to attracting personnel in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields is required and intends to build on existing programs. Defence notes the recommendations of the Committee and advises the work to date in this area is as follows:


Engagement with secondary schools at the Year 10 level. Defence Force Recruiting's workforce includes a large cohort of serving Australian Defence Force members who operate in Careers Promotions Teams, conducting a range of local recruiting events, which enable Defence Force Recruiting to engage with prospective recruits with specific science, technology, engineering and mathematics skills. These events include school visits, career expos, information sessions and targeted experiences to attract suitable candidates. They also include familiarisation tours to Defence establishments to view training, undertake military presentations and engage with key staff and cadets.


The number of events conducted in financial year 2014-15 was 4,107, with 2,610 conducted thus far in 2015-16, across Australia. Recruiting events are conducted at high schools, TAFEs and universities to targeted audiences (16-24 year old men and women) studying science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects.


Career advisers from universities, high schools and private practices are given the opportunity to enhance their knowledge of the career pathways available in the Australian Defence Force through science, technology and engineering programs.


Three Specialist Recruiting Teams—one each for health, engineering and technical trades, with the last one focused on universities and TAFEs and the first two specifically focused on promotion of the Defence University Sponsorships to undergraduates.


Defence also recognised the attraction science, technology, engineering and mathematics has within the culturally and linguistically diverse communities and has incorporated this engagement as a critical element of the recruiting culturally and linguistically diverse strategy.


Examples of current events and discussions include support of the Society of Automotive Engineers' Formula' student design competition, discussions with the Engineering Faculty at Sydney University to formalise engagement with student societies in 2016, presentation to high school students at Royal Australian Air Force Base Richmond supported by Honeywell Engineering, and a Defence University Sponsorship campaign conducted at Garden Island.


 Defence Force Recruiting notes that Australian Defence Force Gap Year was re-introduced in 2015 and will continue as a key component of the Australian Defence Force engaging young Australians.


Defence implements a range of strategies to attract young women studying culturally and linguistically diverse to the Australian Public Service through high school awareness programs, graduate entry level programs and university sponsorships. Such strategies include:


o collaboration with the Australian Business and Community Network through its Influence-Her program for high performing Year 10 female students studying culturally and linguistically diverse to improve awareness of technical careers for women in the Defence Australian Public Service;


o implementation of a dedicated science and technology recruitment and development stream in 2016 for Defence Australian Public Service graduates, to attract and train high performing university students for careers in research and innovation in Defence Science and Technology and for technical roles in the Defence Intelligence Agencies; and


o sponsored university study through the Undergraduate Scholarship Program for Female Students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics at the Australian National University, the University of New South Wales and the University of Adelaide; and the Defence Civilian Undergraduate Sponsorship for engineering students to study for free through the University of New South Wales, Canberra, currently comprising 13 students, seven of whom are female.




Recommendation 4



The Committee recommends that, whilst maintaining physical standards, the Department of Defence ensure the standards are fit for purpose and exercise flexibility on a case-by-case basis.




Government response 





Agree in principle.



Defence continues to explore ways to enhance and increase the participation of diverse groups in the Australian Defence Force while recognising the unique nature of Australian Defence Force requirements, sometimes under strict parameters.


The aim of the physical employment standards is to identify appropriate physical tests for entry and continued employment in employment categories in order to select personnel best suited for the demands of that employment group. As a second order effect this may reduce injuries, with a consequent increase in personnel availability for operations and training and reduction in costs of health care and compensation.


The physical employment standards for combat roles recently opened to women were reviewed to ensure they are scientifically based, occupationally relevant and do not discriminate based on age or gender. The physical employment standards will be reviewed annually to ensure the assessments still meet the requirements of each employment category. These standards apply a fit for purpose methodology, therefore Defence agrees with the recommendation that the physical standards are fit for purpose.


Defence will apply flexibility with the physical employment standards on a case-by-case basis for specific medical circumstances only. All personnel will be required to pass the physical employment standards in order to be fully qualified in their specific employment group.




Recommendation 5



The Committee recommends that the Departments of Defence and Veterans' Affairs report the progress and results of their mental health programs, including the Longitudinal Australian Defence Force Study Evaluating Resilience.




Government response 





Agree.



There are a range of mental health programs which are conducted jointly and separately by Defence and the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA). The Departments will report on the progress and results of these mental health programs through the following reporting mechanisms.




Defence programs., Defence provides a comprehensive range of mental health programs that are available across the career lifespan of a member from enlistment through to operational deployment through to transition from the military. These include programs which are designed to: increase mental health awareness; provide skill-based training to Defence personnel on the management of mental health in Defence; provide clinical up-skilling to Defence health professionals on the assessment and treatment of mental health conditions; and the delivery of mental health and psychology services to Australian Defence Force members. The progress of these initiatives are reported against the Australian Defence Force Mental Health and Wellbeing Action Plan and in the Joint Health Command Annual Review.


In addition to the above, progress against mental health research projects are reported to the relevant approving ethical review bodies and results are disseminated through specifically designed communication strategies. For example, a comprehensive communication strategy will be developed for the final Longitudinal Australian Defence Force Study Evaluating Resilience report and actioned upon receipt and acceptance of the report by the Commonwealth.




Joint programs.

Since 2013, Defence and DVA have operated under a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the Cooperative Delivery of Care and Support to Eligible persons. Collaborative projects are managed under the MoU, with Defence and DVA maintaining a strong joint approach to mental health programs and research including the Transition and Wellbeing Research Programme, Defence referrals of Australian Defence Force personnel to the Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service (VVCS) for counselling, and the development of a range of e-mental health smart phone applications. The progress and results of these programs are reported to the Defence / Department of Veterans' Affairs Executive Committee as well as other relevant groups such as the Department of Veterans' Affairs Research Board or the Joint Health Command and VVCS Agreement for Services Steering Committee. Progress and results of joint programs are also reported against the Australian Defence Force Mental Health and Wellbeing Action Plan and in the Joint Health Command Annual Review where relevant.


The Government also notes that Defence and DVA already provide annual reports to Parliament and are accountable to Parliament, including through the Budget estimates process, for supplying any reasonable request for information.




DVA programs.

DVA purchases and provides a range of mental health services for its clients: online mental health information and support through the At Ease mental health portal at


www.at-ease.dva.gov.au, GP services, psychologist and social work services, psychiatric services, pharmaceuticals, posttraumatic stress disorder programs, and hospital services for those who need it. VVCS also provides counselling and group programs to veterans, peacekeepers and eligible family members. VVCS is a specialised, free and confidential Australia-wide service and may be contacted 24 hours a day by calling 1800 011 046. DVA can pay for certain mental health treatment whatever the cause (whether or not the condition is related to service), and the conditions covered are PTSD, anxiety, depression, alcohol use disorder and substance-use disorder. From July 2016, eligibility for these non-liability mental health arrangements is available to anyone who has had permanent service in the ADF, no matter what the service or how long.


The Government has committed to an annual Ministerial statement to Parliament on key issues impacting upon the veteran community and the performance of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This will be a transparent process which will measure the performance of the Department and increase accountability to the veteran community. Tackling the mental health challenges for veterans and their families is a pillar of the Government's plan for veterans' affairs and will feature in this annual Ministerial statement.


The Government announced on 11 August 2016 that the National Mental Health Commission in conjunction with clinical experts and a reference group comprised of current and former members of Defence, will analyse the effectiveness of existing suicide and self-harm prevention services.




Recommendation 6



The Committee recommends that the Department of Defence develop methods to collect and collate data on the On Base Advisory Service to measure its effectiveness.




Government response 





Agree in principle.



The On Base Advisory Service is administered by the Department of Veterans' Affairs with the support of Defence. On Base Advisory Service activity data is reported to the Defence Links Steering Committee, a joint Defence and Department of Veterans' Affairs committee. The Department of Veterans' Affairs is in the process of refining the On Base Advisory Service performance framework. This work will enable the Defence Links Steering Committee to more effectively monitor the performance and effectiveness of the On Base Advisory Service.




Recommendation 7



The Committee recommends the reporting to Parliament on the Joint Strike Fighter Program be more comprehensive and equivalent to that made available to the United States Congress.



Government response




Disagree.



As a partner in the United States led global F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program, Australia gains insight into the Program through a range of mechanisms and forums. While we are a partner with a level of influence, the United States leads the F-35 Program and is directly responsible for the conduct of the global F-35 Program.


In the United States context, the delivery of the Joint Strike Fighter capability attracts a high level of scrutiny as the largest global Defence acquisition project to date. Reports by the Director Operational Test and Evaluation and United States Government Audit Office are produced by organisations independent of the United States F-35 Joint Program Office and are made publicly available. Defence analyses these US reports and includes specifics as it relates to the Australian JSF Program.


As part of the Major Projects Review, the Australian National Audit Office conducts an annual audit and report of the Australian Joint Strike Fighter Program. This report is equivalent to the reports produced by the United States organisations. In addition, Defence reports to Government annually on the status of the F-35 Program and regularly provides evidence to Senate Estimates and the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. The Joint Strike Fighter Division of the Capability Acquisition and Sustainment Group is also required to provide annual advice to the Australian Government as an update on the Australian Joint Strike Fighter Program, including specific briefings on the more classified elements of the Program.


Defence believes the current level of reporting of all major programs, including the Australian Joint Strike Fighter Program, closely mirrors United States congressional reporting, with some exceptions like the Director Operational Test and Evaluation report which has no equivalent organisation or report in the Australian context.




Recommendation 8



The Committee recommends that, to aid transparency and accuracy, the Department of Defence record and periodically report the quantum of unfunded liabilities held by Defence, including:


where the unfunded liability occurred;


how the unfunded liabilities were created; and, where relevant


factors and decisions that led to funding being reallocated.


The Committee does not expect this reporting to form part of Defence's annual financial statements. 



Government response





Disagree.



Defence's actual and contingent liabilities, as defined by Australian Accounting Standards, are accounted for and disclosed in the annual financial statements. Underinvestment in Defence capabilities is considered in the preparation of the annual financial statements when identifying whether assets may be impaired in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards.


The Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board notes that an essential characteristic of a liability is that an entity has a present obligation. A decision by management to acquire assets in the future does not, of itself, give rise to a present obligation.


As part of the White Paper process Defence has rebalanced the funding assigned to Defence in the budget and over the forward estimates against the Government's future requirements. This rebalance has allocated funding to Defence capability, including major capital equipment, facilities and infrastructure, and information and communication technologies. This rebalance has been rigorously cost assured by external assessors. Any future variations to the funded commitments in the White Paper will be considered through the mechanisms developed in accordance with the recommendations of the First Principles Review. As such, any additional commitment will be managed transparently in an enterprise-wide approach across the Defence portfolio, with in-year commitments managed by the Enterprise Business Committee, and future commitments managed by the Investment Committee. Any changes in planned expenditure across Defence programmes which may result in unfunded capabilities will subsequently be detailed in the Portfolio Statements which are open to scrutiny through the Senate Estimate Committee process.




Recommendation 9



The Committee recommends that the Defence Annual Reports include appropriately detailed information on the Fuel Services Branch, in particular the progress of fuel farm remediation and remaining work to be done. The Committee further recommends that the Department of Defence actively explore options to engage and collaborate with industry on fuel management and security.




Government response 





Agree in principle.



Future Defence Annual Reports will provide more detail on the reform of the Defence Fuel Supply Chain and initiatives to enhance its operational resilience.


The establishment of the Fuel Services Branch in early 2015 was a key recommendation of the Wraith Review (commissioned by the Secretary of Defence in late 2013) to support the appointment of Commander Joint Logistics as Head of Defence Fuel Supply Chain, creating a single point of accountability for the on-time and in-full delivery of fuel to meet the needs of capability managers. This replaced a fragmented and dysfunctional management structure that did not have clear roles or lines of responsibility.


Throughout 2015, Fuel Services Branch focused on remediating the issues identified by the Wraith Review as being of greatest concern, notably the asset integrity of Defence fuel installations, working relationships between facility operators and maintenance contractors, safe work practices, staff training, and capital estate management for existing and new fuel infrastructure. An extensive Hazard Risk Assessment program commenced in mid-2014 to identify key risks and issues across the primary Defence fuel installations, leading to these now being managed in a more coordinated and structured way with key stakeholders across Defence. The Hazard Risk Assessment program has also assisted in focussing specialist fuel engineering expertise on the asset integrity of the Defence Fuel Supply Chain, which will be further assisted by the design and development of a centralised Defence Fuel Supply Chain Engineering Management System during 2016. The Hazard Risk Assessment program will be completed by 30 June 2016.


Commander Joint Logistics promulgated the Defence Fuel Supply Chain Strategic Plan 2015-2022 internally on the Fuel Services Branch intranet site in November 2015. The Plan sets out the key strategic goals for Defence to develop end-to-end management within the Defence Fuel Supply Chain and also to optimise the safe, effective and efficient delivery of fuel to meet capability. A complementary Defence Fuel Supply Chain Operational Plan for 2015-16 has also been promulgated internally that will address all of the key recommendations of the Wraith Review.


Key to both the Defence Fuel Supply Chain strategic and operational plans is the roll out of the Defence Fuel Management System during 2016 and 2017. The Defence Fuel Management System will provide a comprehensive and integrated system for identifying and managing all Defence Fuel Supply Chain related risks. It describes what controls are to be implemented for Defence Fuel Supply Chain functions and minimum requirements related to those controls. System level requirements also describe key roles and responsibilities for each function (aligned to the Defence Fuel Supply Chain organisation) and related performance measurement and evaluation requirements.


The Defence Fuel Management System is designed so far as possible to operate seamlessly with whole-of-Defence, Joint Logistic Command and single Service safety and environmental management systems. It seeks to contextualise the requirements of those systems into one set of documents focussed exclusively on Defence Fuel Supply Chain related activities and operations. An important element within the Defence Fuel Management System is performance monitoring and governance, which is being designed to provide a multi-layered and robust performance monitoring and governance framework to ensure risk control performance is monitored at all levels.


Chief of Defence Force in July 2014 and seeks to identify opportunities for greater industry participation through reduced costs of ownership, reduced enterprise risk and rationalisation of certain military-specific fuels in favour of commercial grade products. The Fuel Network Review is focusing on bulk fuels only and is due to be completed by December 2016.




Recommendation 10



The Committee recommends that the Department of Defence, in partnership with Defence Housing Australia, prepare an effective consultation and communication framework with the community for use in ongoing and future redevelopments.




Government response 





Agree.



Defence Housing Australia has a strong record of establishing and maintaining relationships with the communities in which Defence Housing Australia developments are constructed. In addition, Defence Housing Australia continues to review its practices to ensure they are tailored to meet the specific needs of each development.


Defence Housing Australia aims to make information about development projects publicly available wherever possible, in line with the requirements of the applicable local council or authority. Community engagement can occur in various forms, from listening to the community in the early stages of planning through to keeping local residents and community groups informed as the project advances. Community engagement is conducted in line with Defence Housing Australia process instructions for Development Marketing and Defence Housing Australia Development Marketing Community Engagement guidelines.


Defence Housing Australia has well practiced and successful procedures in place to engage with the community and stakeholders regarding its developments. These involve communication strategies such as letter drops, internet sites, newsletters and community meetings. Consultation with the community is broad and feedback is considered as part of the planning process for every development.


The ways in which Defence Housing Australia consults and communicates with the community for developments, as per Defence Housing Australia Development Marketing Community Engagement guidelines, are shown as follows:

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Government Response to Report</title>,COMMITTEES,18,2,speech
"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2016-11-22,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (17:47):  In respect of the government response to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on its inquiry into the review of the Defence annual report 2013-14, I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I am pleased to see this response. It is a response to an inquiry that was conducted some time ago. The inquiry was post that annual report being delivered. With the fluxion of time, and an election in between, clearly the response had taken some time to come. But I am pleased, as I read through it, to see a number of the recommendations agreed with. There are a couple that are not that I would like to comment on.


For a start, recommendation 1 goes to the skill sets, the competence and the experience of people in Defence. The recommendation was: 


… the Job Families Project be further developed to incorporate accurate assessments of both qualifications and experience that are required for a given role. 


This is important. If you look at other safety-critical areas, such as the oil and gas industry, they normally work on quite a strict matrix of both qualification and experience before somebody is delegated a certain level of authority to make decisions.


What we have seen too often in the past is that, where Defence feels it has been constrained by the posting cycle, or by the people who are available, whether they are in uniform or the Public Service, people are put into a role even if their qualifications or experience are not necessarily the most appropriate or, in some cases, I would argue, even adequate for that role. Over a number of inquiries, I have been making the point that, whether we are talking about somebody who is a contract negotiator, somebody who is working in a force development area or somebody who is engaging with industry, the competencies required for the role—that mix of qualification and experience—should be clearly defined.


The concern I have had with the Job Families Project in the past is that, for example, if you needed neurosurgery done, the job family for the person that would do that is somebody in the health stream of Army, somebody who is qualified and senior enough to be a surgeon. So the Job Families Project identifies such a person. They are available, so they get posted. But if the person happens to be an orthopaedic surgeon—they are still in the medical family and they still have that level of training with good qualifications—the actual task-specific competence may not be there for the job you want. Neurosurgery should not be done by an orthopaedic surgeon. It is a very simple example.


Defence has some areas where it does this well. In aerospace engineering, for example, the regulator—the Directorate General Technical Airworthiness—will look at the person whom the Chief of Army, Navy or Air Force wants to post into a position and will assess their qualifications and experience and say what level of authority they will delegate to them. Within that airworthiness framework, Defence has a model that works well, but across many areas we see people posted into positions where they do not actually have the requisite experience to do those roles. I welcome the fact that Defence has agreed to this recommendation, or has looked to further involve the Job Families Project so that they actually do an audit of the qualifications and experience that any given role might need so that they can identify the gaps and help those people achieve the goals.


There is also a link with this recommendation in the Defence Industry Policy Statement and the first principles reviewwhich look at the kinds of programmatic capabilities that Defence requires. Again, I will come back to aerospace engineering, because it is one that I think is a good example to work with. For many decades Australia has had that quite robust system of taking graduates from university, training them in aerospace engineering or in structures or systems engineering and giving them hands-on experiences with maintained aircraft, and then they get posted to various parts of the organisation, whether they are maintaining or procuring equipment—being that classic smart buyer of equipment. What we are seeing as we have more and more of our aircraft purchased off the shelf is that the cost case that is often used to justify buying something off the shelf is that a lot of the design support network and the through-life engineering support is done by the providing country. If we buy something from the United States then either the US Navy or Air Force or the original equipment manufacturer will provide that engineering. What that means is that we have less opportunity for graduates here to actually get their hands dirty, so to speak, and get the competence—the experience as well as their qualification to do the role.


So, one of the things that I see that the Defence Industry Policy Statement leads to is that it has this concept of industry skills being a fundamental input to capabilities. The service chief now has the opportunity to look at these skill sets that are required and look at their workforces—not only uniformed but also including the Australian public servants and including industry people. Whether they are contracted, is in the services, or whether they are contracted into a defence organisation, for the workforce they are looking at, the spread of competence covers all three of those areas. So, for something like aerospace engineering, if we do not have the opportunity—because for things like the Joint Strike Fighter or the Super Hornet all that work is done overseas—if we want to have people who are competent to actually be in our technical airworthiness areas in the future and in our procurement areas and to be the smart providers, we have to look for other opportunities to give them that hands-on experience. In the past, with a program like the PC-9 replacement, we would see that as a training aircraft with no operational need to have all the back-of-house functions to support it, so we probably would have gone out to seek a power by the hour arrangement where somebody else would provide the aircraft on the flight line, ready to fly.


But the thinking of the first principles review and the Defence Industry Policy Statement is that if this is the most cost-effective way for Defence to develop its future workforce of aerospace engineers then perhaps we should actually look at taking this training platform and doing a certain amount of that design support engineering—that continuing airworthiness work—here in Australia so that we can take young graduates who have their degree and give them practical hands-on experience so that when we need people at that more senior level to interface with the US Navy, the US Air Force, British forces or the manufacturers we have people with the requisite level of competence to engage and be that smart buyer or that smart maintainer of our equipment. There is a fair bit in that one recommendation and I am pleased to see that the government has picked that up. We will look to develop that further as the Defence Industry Policy Statement is implemented.


That also goes to recommendation 3, which looks at ways to increase STEM—science, technology, engineering and mathematics—engagement of young people. Increasingly, and it has probably ever been thus, we need to get lower down into the schools, at the year 9 and 10 type levels. This is so that when young people are making decisions about the subjects they will choose they will have a vision of what the job might entail, of the opportunities that working in an engineering type field might present to them, so that the subject choices they make at that mid-high school level are not limiting their options if they want to go on and pursue that technical type of stream. I am very pleased to see the government agree to support that.


Recommendation 7 is around the Joint Strike Fighter and a more comprehensive evaluation of project status. I have raised, in the past, the point about the conspiracy of optimism in how many Defence projects are reported to the parliament and that this has led to false expectation about the time frame and level of capability that will be delivered. Where there is any doubt or concern about the progress, through the manufacturing, testing or certification, that should be made abundantly clear in reporting opportunities, whether that be through ANAO reports, the annual report or reports on major projects.


In the past it is been disturbing to see summaries of really significant projects, like the Joint Strike Fighter, have an almost one paragraph 'It's all good, Guv' type story, when you read in open sourced American literature, through things like their Operational Test and Evaluation program, that there are significant concerns about the rate of progress.


I believe that whilst Defence, in their response, have indicated the US is the predominant builder of the aircraft and therefore it is their role to highlight if there are deficiencies in the program, our reporting should at least acknowledge and link or point to the American reporting. That is so the casual or interested reader, here, will realise it is not all an optimistic view and that perhaps there are other things they need to consider. (Time expired)

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Government Response to Report</title>,COMMITTEES,18,2,speech
"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2016-11-22,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (17:57):  It is my pleasure to comment on the Australian government response to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade report into the review of the Defence annual report 2013-14. In so doing, I acknowledge the role of Senator Fawcett in his capacity as chair of that review committee.


The committee resolved, in that report, to focus on five principal areas: firstly, the First Principles Review; secondly, matters pertaining to personnel; thirdly, mental health; fourthly, capability development and major projects; and fifthly, Defence support. During that period 2013-14, July to June, the ADF was involved in three whole-of-government operations: Operation Sovereign Borders, which is highly successful and continuing, Operation Southern Indian Ocean and Operation Bring Them Home. During that period, the Defence Force completed two operations. It is a little while ago now but think back to operation New South Wales bushfires and Operation Philippines Assist. Both benefited enormously from the professionalism in the involvement, the speed and the rapid deployment of Australian Defence Force personnel.


During that time the Department of Defence commenced major organisational change with the release of the First Principles Review, the abolition of the Defence Materiel Organisation and its replacement with the creation of the new Capability Acquisition and Sustainment Group. It was a very busy period during that era.


The first principles review has been mentioned by the previous speaker. Personnel matters were a major element of the committee's review, forming some of the recommendations about which I will speak. Matters covered included Project Suakin, addressing itself to the question of the Total Workforce Model, developed by the Chief of the Defence Force and his colleagues; recruitment and employment of women; cultural reform; and military justice. In the space of mental health, areas examined included mental resilience, particularly at the stage of recruitment into the Defence Force; the culture towards mental health in the ADF; and the work being undertaken—we see a continuation of it now—with personnel transitioning out of the services. It is gratifying to see that the work we are doing at the moment in the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee is picking up and continuing to look at these very areas. 


The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade report quite correctly recognised and appreciated the work undertaken by Defence and the Department of Veterans Affairs, acknowledging the importance of the collaboration between the two departments in addressing mental health conditions, which are all too relevant, all too important and require the very highest level of attention by the Senate itself. I am pleased that the report acknowledged the dedication and commitment of the men and women of the Australian Defence Force and commended them on the outstanding service that they provide to the nation. One should never forget the wider and extended Defence family. When a person is serving, whether they be deployed here in Australia or overseas, we know only too acutely the role of the extended family—the parents, grandparents, siblings and others—and the contribution they make.


I am delighted, in speaking to the Australian government's response to the report, to confirm the commitment of the Turnbull government to Australia's long-term security and economic prosperity as they relate particularly to the roles undertaken by our defence industry and Defence personnel. The review of the Defence annual report has been welcomed. As Senator Fawcett was discussing previously, the review made 10 recommendations, which I intend, if time permits, to address briefly, particularly the one or two that my colleague did not have the opportunity to comment upon. 


I do want to emphasise the financial commitment the Turnbull government is making to ensure the long-term security of the country and the viability of the Defence Force. We know—it is picked up in the review and the government's response—that the government is acutely aware that Defence must be prepared for a more uncertain operating environment in the future, and that of course has been highlighted only over the last few days. We know that we have both state and nonstate actors who now have access to a range of cheaper, more precise and capable weapons systems. We know that sophisticated cyberthreats continue to evolve. Of course, my own particular area is in biosecurity and the capacity of terrorists and others to use relatively cheap organisms for devastating impact, not only within our shores but in other areas we would seek to have some involvement in in terms of protection. We know the Defence Force does operate and will continue to operate in congested environments, where the adversary is not easily identified and of course has the capacity to move quickly from tension to conflict and back again. We have seen evidence of that in the past; we are seeing more evidence of it now.


What is very pleasing is that so much of the review—the comments in it, the recommendations made in it by the committee chaired by Senator Fawcett—has now found its way into policy and procedures which we are seeing being played out. For example, the Turnbull government has increased defence spending by $30 billion over the next decade so that we will move back to a level of defence spending of two per cent of GDP, which is in stark contrast, regrettably, to the last Labor government, where, in terms of GDP expenditure on defence, we were down at levels not seen since 1938, assisted by the slashing of some $18 billion from the defence budget. The white paper prepared at that time, but not really ever announced or released to any extent, was left shattered.


I had the privilege earlier this year, and the company of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence, to be at ADFA for the release of the white paper, the 2016 document that will form the basis of Defence Force activities going into the future. At the same time, the wisdom of Defence Minister Payne was evident in ensuring that the defence industry paper was released on the same day, emphasising the integral need and role of Australian industry in delivering on what will be the commitments for defence into the future. The white paper, of course, is now so readily accepted and so readily understood. Along with that, the defence industry paper is working with the white paper to deliver for the Australian community and for the Defence Force.


Central to this whole project is the concept of continuous naval shipbuilding, which will secure Australian naval shipbuilding capacity right out for the next 30 to 40 years, not just providing employment for Australians in manufacturing and construction, but providing an ongoing and integral role for Australian industry in the whole-of-life example for the vessels—we all well know of the dozen Future Submarines that will be constructed, with the oversight of DCNS, in Adelaide; the Future Frigate Program; the future offshore patrol vessels; and indeed the Pacific Patrol Vessels, which are already under construction. In observing the Australian government's response to this particular review, I am pleased to report on the strong commitment of the government in terms of personnel, management, funding and whole-of-life for our defence forces.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2016-11-22,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:07):  I, too, would like to commence my contribution to the discussion of the government response to the review of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade of the Defence annual report 2013-14 by congratulating the chairman, Senator Fawcett, on the work he is currently doing and the work he did in relation to this particular review. I note with some interest that four senators are intending to speak on this particular report, from the government side at least, and all four of us—Senator Cash, Senator McKenzie, Senator Fawcett and I—are actually members of the joint standing committee and were involved in the preparation of this review of the Defence annual report 2013-14. The report was tabled some time ago. Since then the government has responded to the report and in the time available to me I want to address just a couple of the recommendations and the government's response to them.


Those of us involved in and around our defence service personnel understand the importance of mental health programs. Indeed, we do understand that active service in the military forces of any country, since time immemorial almost, does have an impact on the mental health of many of the participants in combat and combat operations. I am based in Townsville, in North Queensland, the home of Australia's largest army base, Lavarack Barracks. From Lavarack, almost since its inception in pre-Vietnam war days, troops from Townsville have gone overseas to be engaged in active combat situations. They return, and very often in the community we see the results of the difficulties experienced by serving members of the Defence Force coming back from those engagements. 


One of the recommendations of the committee, recommendation 5, was that the Department of Defence and the Department of Veterans' Affairs report progress and results on their mental health programs, including the longitudinal Australian Defence Force study Evaluating Resilience. The committee went through this issue at some length and made that recommendation. The government's response to that recommendation has been that the government agrees. In its agreement, the government says this in its response:


There are a range of mental health programs which are conducted jointly and separately by Defence and the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA). The Departments will report on the progress and results of these mental health programs through the following reporting mechanisms.


Then the response by the government goes through those. They include Defence programs, joint programs and DVA programs. The government's response indicates how that happens in each case. In relation to Defence programs:


Defence provides a comprehensive range of mental health programs that are available across the career lifespan of a member from enlistment through to operational deployment through to transition from the military. These include programs which are designed to: increase mental health awareness; provide skill-based training to Defence personnel on the management of mental health in Defence; provide clinical up-skilling to Defence health professionals on the assessment and treatment of mental health conditions; and the delivery of mental health and psychology services to Australian Defence Force members. The progress of these initiatives are reported against the Australian Defence Force Mental Health and Wellbeing Action Plan and in the Joint Health Command Annual Review.


In addition to the above, progress against mental health research projects are reported to the relevant approving ethical review bodies and results are disseminated through specifically designed communication strategies.


I thank the government for its comprehensive response to that recommendation dealing with Defence programs. In relation to joint programs, the response says:


Since 2013, Defence and DVA have operated under a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the Cooperative Delivery of Care and Support to Eligible persons. Collaborative projects are managed under the MoU, with Defence and DVA maintaining a strong joint approach to mental health programs and research including the Transition and Wellbeing Research Programme, Defence referrals of Australian Defence Force personnel to the Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service (VVCS) for counselling, and the development of a range of e-mental health smart phone applications—


That is an innovation which will become more and more useful as the years roll on—


The progress and results of these programs are reported to the Defence / Department of Veterans' Affairs Executive Committee as well as other relevant groups such as the Department of Veterans' Affairs Research Board or the Joint Health Command and VVCS Agreement for Services Steering Committee. Progress and results of joint programs are also reported against the Australian Defence Force Mental Health and Wellbeing Action Plan—


that I mentioned previously.


In addition to that, as the government's response shows, the Department of Veterans' Affairs also purchases and provides a range of mental health services for its clients. Online mental health information and support through the At Ease mental health portal is also available. There are GP services, psychologist services, social work services, psychiatric services, pharmaceuticals, post-traumatic stress disorder programs and hospital services for those who need them. This program also provides counselling and group programs to veterans, peacekeepers and eligible family members. Of course, family members are an important element of these programs in the understanding of the issues faced by some of our returning and even current Defence Force members.


There are 24-hours-a-day phone lines to help with any problems that might need addressing at all hours of the day and night. DVA can also pay for certain mental health treatments, whatever the cause—whether or not the condition is related to service—and conditions covered by PTSD, anxiety, depression, alcohol-use disorder and substance-use disorder. From July this year, eligibility for these non-liability mental health arrangements will be available to anyone who has had permanent service in the ADF, no matter what the service or for how long.


The government indicates in its response as well that it is committed to an annual ministerial statement to parliament on key issues impacting upon the veteran community and the performance of the Department of Veterans' Affairs.


I have just mentioned elements of this response at length because it does show that the government, indeed, as it should, on behalf of all Australians, does whatever it can to assist those who have served their country but who may be suffering some sort of mental health issue. Sometimes in this chamber we hear about those things, but we do not often hear about the extent of the provisions that the government has developed to do everything possible to address some of these issues. I am delighted that it has done so. As I say, as a nation that is grateful for the work that our service personnel have done, they should expect nothing less and neither does the nation.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2016-11-22,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (18:17):  I rise to speak to the review of the government's response to the Defence annual review. The Turnbull government is committed to ensuring Australia's long-term security and economic prosperity. I welcome the review of the Defence annual report 2013-14 by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I know I am not the only one. We have heard from Senators Macdonald, Back and Fawcett about our government's commitment to the security of our nation and additionally to ensuring that we procure as much as possible from our local market, developing those skills and providing jobs and growth right across our nation as a result of our focus on our defence capability.


I particularly welcome the recommendations, and later in my contribution I will go through those recommendations in more detail. As detailed in the 2016 Defence white paper, the government has a comprehensive, long-term plan to ensure we have more a potent, agile and innovative Australian Defence Force capable of achieving Australia's strategic objectives.


I have just left a briefing from some of the larger international players in our defence industry here in Australia. They are quite buoyant. They are excited about the opportunities provided by the government's Defence white paper and the jobs and growth that it will provide not just in capital cities and not just in South Australia, as welcome as that is, but right across our nation.


In the few minutes available to me, I will go into more detail around our ability and capacity as a nation of federal and state governments working together to build those science, technology, engineering and mathematics skills so that we have a workforce that is able to meet the demand that will be coming, growing and sustained over coming decades as a result of our government's commitment and investment in defence industry. Our commitment is based on the government's detailed assessment of Australia's strategic outlook to 2035. It is the most comprehensive defence white paper ever and it, for the first time, properly aligns strategy, capability and resources to make the Australian Defence Force more capable, agile and potent.


We are acutely aware that Defence must be prepared for a more uncertain operating environment. State and nonstate actors will have access to a range of cheaper, more precise and more capable weapon systems. Sophisticated cyber threats will continue to evolve, and the Australian Defence Force will often operate in congested environments where the adversary is not easily identifiable and contingencies move quickly from tension to conflict. Through the government's white paper, Defence will have highly capable and flexible forces. Our government has increased defence spending by $29.9 billion over the next decade, as we deliver on our commitment to increase spending to two per cent of GDP. Also, we are not just going to be throwing the money out with a lack of accountability and transparency; we are going to track this over time, which is a welcome change.


The 2016 budget delivers on the government's commitment to ensuring our long-term security and economic prosperity. Through the implementation of the first principles review, the Turnbull government is delivering on our 2013 election commitment to ensure that Defence is appropriately structured and organised and has the right business practices in place to support the Australian Defence Force in the 21st century.


It was only last week that I was joined by the Minister for Defence Industry, Minister Pyne, in my home state of Victoria at Victoria Barracks to see the first 10 Hawkei vehicles handed over to the Defence Force. The Hawkei is a responsive vehicle, a high-protection vehicle, that builds on the design perspectives and research from the famous Bushmaster vehicle, which has taken the world by storm. The Bushmaster has protected Australian soldiers in theatres—particularly in the Middle East—but it is exported to other nations and it is an incredibly useful piece of equipment in the defence arsenal.


The Hawkei protected vehicle is produced in Bendigo, in the heart of regional Victoria, and as a result of Thales Australia winning that contract 170 jobs have been able to be retained and maintained locally, in the Bendigo region. This vehicle is Australian-designed—a world class design—and we are hoping not only that we can have our own soldiers using the vehicles in theatres right across the world but also that this vehicle—as it is world class and world leading in the type of technology it employs and in its design—will be a vehicle we can export to other nations. I know Thales is working very, very hard on that.


In terms of sustainment of the vehicle over time, 30 jobs will be created, primarily in Queensland. What is unique about the vehicle is that, while it had to have the high level of protection that you get from the Bushmaster, it had to be very light. You had to be able to lift this vehicle up with a Chinook and cart it wherever you needed it, which provided some challenges in trying to marry that personnel protection aspect, which makes it very heavy, with the light weight so that it can be moved around and give that agility and capability to our defence forces. Defence signed a $1.3 billion contract with Thales Australia last October to produce 1,100 Hawkei vehicles with more than 1,000 companion trailers. It was very, very exciting to be with the minister at Victoria Barracks last week to actually see those vehicles and get to sit in them.


I want to briefly touch on the recommendations from the review. Senator Fawcett went into some detail on the 10 recommendations. The government has agreed to a number of them. Having just now come out of the briefing with the Defence primes about the types of skills we need and the level of engagement they are having with Australia universities, in niche areas, to build collaboration, and hopefully commercialisation, of that research over time, it is very exciting. Recommendation 3—that Defence develops 'more innovative ways to recruit, especially in the science, technology and engineering fields'—goes to the very heart of our government's agenda around ensuring that Australia is ready, capable and excited about an economy based on science. I remember that in his speech at the Prime Minister's science awards last year the Prime Minister said that science was going to be at the very heart of our nation's economy. It is true, and it must be so in the 21st century. So I am very proud of our government for pursuing a range of initiatives in this place to ensure that that becomes a reality.


In terms of recommendation 3, which I just read out, the government agrees around a number of initiatives to better attract people with science, engineering and technical skills into the defence field. I heard it directly from the Prime Minister that we need to be getting into secondary schools. We need to be saying to those young people that defence holds an exciting future for them and they just need to get involved in these subjects. So, recommendation 3 includes more engagement with secondary schools, at the year 10 level, such as visits, placements and work experience; ensuring that the Australian Defence Force gap year is promoted; and the implementation of a Defence university scholarship.


Defence agrees that further attention is required to attract personnel in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields, and to build on these existing programs. The review notes the work that was done. I suggest to senators who are interested in this area to go to page 4 of the government response, where there is quite a detailed outline of the initiatives undertaken and where Defence can actually build greater collaboration. One of the implementation strategies was around attracting young culturally and linguistically diverse women to the APS through high school awareness programs, graduate entry-level programs, and university scholarships. 


I am very proud to be part of a government that is investing in defence and in projects that will ensure supply chain jobs. Coming from Victoria, with its automotive industry closures, this is exciting news for our state.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion moved by Senator Fawcett in relation to the Defence annual report be agreed to.

Leave granted.




The speeches read as follows—



CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT (EXPANDED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2016


The Customs Tariff Amendment (Expanded Information Technology Agreement Implementation and other measures) Bill 2016 implements commitments made in the 2016‑17 Budget to reduce customs duty on certain information technology products.


This Bill contains amendments to the Customs Tariff Act1995 to reduce the customs duty on certain information technology products to Free. These reductions will occur incrementally over time, commencing on 1 January 2017. 


The customs duty for the majority of products included in this Bill, including printing ink and certain types of equipment used in the manufacture of printed circuits, will become Free on 1 July 2019. A small number of products, including certain types of audio speakers, will become Free on 1 July 2021.


Australia is a net importer of information technology products. The progressive elimination of customs duty on certain information technology products will benefit Australian industries and consumers through lower costs.


SOCIAL SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FAMILY ASSISTANCE ALIGNMENT AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2016


This Bill introduces amendments to align the time period for income reconciliation for certain Family Tax Benefit recipients for the 2012‑13, 2013-14 and 2014-15 financial years and to correct an unintended consequence generated by the Youth Allowance Rate Calculator. 


Specifically, amendments will be made to the date of effect provisions to clarify longstanding administrative practices in relation to the payment of arrears of family tax benefit. In effect, the amendments will ensure it is clear that an individual cannot be paid Family Tax Benefit supplements and top-ups where they notified that they were not required to lodge an income tax return more than one year after the end of the relevant income year. 


These amendments ensure consistency with the equivalent timeframe currently applying to families who were required to lodge a tax return for the 2012‑13, 2013-14 and 2014-15 financial years.


These amendments strengthen existing provisions to ensure that their interpretation is beyond doubt. There will be no material effect on Family Tax Benefit recipients for these years given the one year timeframe has been in effect since the 2012-13 year and has been communicated to recipients clearly since this time.


One year is considered a reasonable amount of time for families to notify Centrelink that they are not required to lodge and/or provide details of types of income not included in a tax return in order for reconciliation of their Family Tax Benefit entitlement to occur. 


These amendments will ensure that full effect is given to the original 2013 Realignment of Time Period for Income Reconciliation Budget measure and that the intent of the family assistance programme is met, which is to deliver financial assistance to families to help with the cost of raising children when it is needed. 


The Bill also includes contingent amendments to remove reference to Family Tax Benefit supplements in the event they are phased out as part of the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Family Payments Structural Reform Bill and Participation Measures) Bill 2016, designed to improve the sustainability of the family payments system.


The Bill also introduces amendments to correct an unintended consequence of amendments that were made in Part 3 of Schedule 1 of the Social Services Legislation Amendment (More Generous Means Testing for Youth Payments) Act 2015 to the Youth Allowance Rate Calculator in section 1067G of the Social Security Act 1991. 


It is intended that the rate calculator produce a fortnightly rate. Currently there is an inconsistency in that step 1 of the rate calculator is expressed as an annual amount while subsequent steps are expressed as fortnightly amounts. The result is that comparing the outcome of the subsequent steps from the calculation in step 1 does not generally provide the correct threshold test outcome, and in most cases will result in a harsh outcome. 


The error occurred because of introducing complex maintenance income rules from A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999 (which are predicated on annual amounts) to the Social Security Act 1991 (where payments are based on fortnightly amounts). The change that is proposed amends step 1 in the rate calculator to reduce the figure to a fortnightly amount consistent with the original intent of the changes as announced by the Government in the 2015-16 Budget.


This amendment ensures that the aim to align the parental means testing arrangements for youth allowance more closely with those for Family Tax Benefit Part A will be met.


VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (BUDGET & OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2016


The Government is pleased to present legislation that will give effect to three Veterans' Affairs' 2016-17 Budget measures. 


This government continues to honour its strong commitment to veterans and the veteran community by recognising the unique nature of military service.


The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget & Other Measures) Bill 2016 contains three important measures to support veterans. It:


expands access to non-liability health care


enables interim incapacity payments to be paid at 100% of Normal Earnings, and


 aligns the cut-off age for incapacity payments to ""pension age""


Non-Liability Health Care


Expanding access to Non-Liability Health Care is a very important component of mental health treatment for current and former members of the Australian Defence Force (ADF). In the 2016‑17 Budget, this Government committed $37.9 million to extend eligibility for Non-Liability Health Care to all current and former permanent members of the ADF for five mental health conditions:


post-traumatic stress disorder


anxiety


depression


alcohol use disorder, and


substance use disorder


In addition to expanding the range of conditions for which Non‑Liability Health Care may be provided, accessing this treatment has also become easier: 


firstly, a veteran can simply telephone or email the Department of Veterans' Affairs and ask for treatment – there is no need to lodge a formal application


secondly, there is no longer the requirement for a person to have had either three years' continuous full-time service or operational service to be eligible for Non‑Liability Health Care – just one day of continuous full‑time service means a person can access this treatment


thirdly, there is no need for a formal diagnosis at the time of requesting treatment.


The treatment is known as Non-Liability Health Care because it need not be linked to a condition arising from the service of the eligible person. Further, it is completely separate from any claim for compensation. 


Non-Liability Health Care is available via a legislative instrument made under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. This has been in place since 1 July 2016 and I am encouraged by reports from the Department of Veterans' Affairs that there has been a marked increase in the number of requests for Non‑Liability Health Care between July – September 2016. This is to be strongly encouraged and I urge any ADF members in need of mental health treatment to get in contact with the Department of Veterans' Affairs.


Interim Incapacity Payments


In the 2016‑17 Budget, this Government committed $0.2 million for this measure. It will allow interim incapacity payments to be paid to former ADF members immediately upon discharge at a level that matches their regular salary.


This is important because, currently, when a member discharges from the ADF there can be a period of time - sometimes several months – before incapacity payment amounts can be determined while superannuation entitlements are finalised.


Some members can experience financial hardship during this period. These amendments will enable veterans to receive their pre-discharge salary during this period and the Department of Veterans' Affairs will make an adjustment to a person's incapacity payments after the superannuation component has been finalised.


Align cut-off age for incapacity payments to pension age


The Government committed $5.5 million to this measure in the 2016-17 Budget to improve support for veterans by increasing the incapacity cut-off age to align with age pension eligibility. 


The amendments will enable veterans to continue to receive incapacity payments up until they become eligible for the age pension. Approximately 120 veterans per annum will benefit from this change.


Currently, payment of incapacity entitlements under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 (MRCA) ceases when an employee reaches 65 years of age or, if the injury occurred on or after the age of 63, after a maximum of 104 weeks of incapacity entitlements have been received.


However, the legislation needs to be amended to keep pace with the scheduled age pension increases, otherwise injured veterans may be without adequate means of financial support upon reaching 65 years of age once the age pension eligibility changes take effect.


These amendments align the cut-off age for incapacity payments to ""pension age"" as defined in the Social Security Act 1991. Rather than defining a set age, this approach means incapacity payment cut-off will remain in alignment with age pension eligibility age into the future.




Conclusion



This Bill will support our veterans in real and tangible ways from increasing access to vital mental health treatment, to better financial support for ADF members transitioning to civilian life and ensuring access to incapacity entitlements through to pension age.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (18:40):  This disallowance before us today in this place is a matter of great gravity. In May this year the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, tabled the Legal Services Amendment (Solicitor-General Opinions) Direction 2016 in this place. The direction meant that no-one could refer a question of law to the Solicitor-General without the consent of the Attorney-General—not his most senior ministers, not even the Prime Minister. That was the intent of the legal services direction which the Attorney-General implemented. It was an extraordinary act, an act that put at risk the integrity of our legal system, and, indeed, I think, the integrity of this parliament. We have seen in this direction the undermining of the separation of government and the independence of our legal system. It is clear to us that Senator Brandis implemented the legal services direction in an attempt to undermine the independence of a statutory officer, the Solicitor-General, and he then went on to mislead the parliament about his conduct. The Attorney-General of our nation—the most senior law officer of our nation—did not comply with his obligation to consult on this matter.


After the damning inquiry into the legal services amendment direction, Senator Brandis went about to withdraw his direction. He did so in accordance with the recommendations of the committee report, I guess to avoid the embarrassment of having it disallowed in this chamber. And while I am pleased with the fact that Senator Brandis has complied with the recommendations of the committee report, the way he went about it in a somewhat sneaky manner without telling anybody demonstrates again his disregard for consultation, as he has never sort to explain his actions to this place. Despite the fact that the legal services direction has been withdrawn, it is critically important that this matter still be disallowed by the Senate, because the Senate must express its view and opinion on the matter of law at the heart of this matter, in terms of how opinions are sought from the Solicitor-General, so that it cannot happen again. It is why this disallowance is proceeding today.


If you look at the very problematic things about the legal services direction as it was tabled, there are some very significant issues with it that really demonstrate the Attorney-General's poor judgement. I refer to some of the evidence that Gavan Griffith QC gave to our committee. He was, in fact, the Solicitor-General for some 14 years from 1984 to 1997 under both Labor and Liberal governments. He construed the direction was in fact ultra vires and of no effect as a lawful direction in terms of its capacity to direct the Solicitor-General. Notwithstanding this, the intent of the direction is to withhold the Solicitor-General from being able to provide advice. Again, the direction is wrong on the basis of law.


Notwithstanding the fact that the direction is wrong on the basis of law, both Gavan Griffith and Ms Appleby talked to the committee about the chilling effect of this direction in creating roadblocks to appropriate, authoritative, welcome or unwelcome advice from the peak level of the second law officer, who, within the Commonwealth, is the leading counsel to the Commonwealth. In other words, it would keep government departments and agencies from seeking the proper advice through the proper channels of government.


Gavan Griffiths went on to say that one of the effects of the legal services direction is that it creates a propensity for government to shop around for advice. Indeed, this is what our current Attorney-General has done on a number of significant matters. This has also been highlighted in evidence to our committee. Gavan Griffiths gave some examples of that.


Lastly, the particularly problematic nature of this legal services direction and why it must be disallowed is that it highlights how the differences between the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General should not be resolved during their continued incumbency by what Gavan Griffiths calls:


… inappropriate and destructive legislative or administrative measures being imposed which have the effect of destroying the independent office of SG—


that is, the Solicitor-General. These are incredibly important reasons as to why this place must look to supporting this disallowance so that the practice of the Attorney-General can no longer continue to pollute the way in which advice is sought from the Solicitor-General.


I want to highlight some other issues to do with the conduct of the Attorney-General when it comes to this disallowance. The failure of the Attorney-General to consult the Solicitor-General is one of the reasons why the incredibly problematic and wrong nature of the legal services direction was never brought to the attention of this place. It was never highlighted. That meant that the problems with the legal services direction never saw the light of day until it was implemented, which is an incredibly damning thing. The Attorney-General's conduct and his failure to meet his obligation to consult is why we have found ourselves in this place discussing this, as it would have been pointed out that the legal services direction is wrong in law and unimplementable.


But these kinds of actions are entirely consistent with a great many other issues with recent actions of our Attorney-General. We have a claim from the Attorney-General that he consulted the Solicitor-General. It is a blatant falsehood. This consultation never, ever occurred. Indeed, the Attorney-General made what are very clearly false and misleading statements to this place. For the statement that the Attorney-General had consulted the Solicitor-General to be true, the Attorney-General would at a minimum have needed to advise the Solicitor-General of his intention to introduce a new instrument and provide him with the opportunity to comment on its content. At no stage did the Attorney-General do this. Indeed, the only person who Senator Brandis consulted with in large part, it appears, was himself.


Senator Brandis has been caught out on this issue—and not for the first time—breaching one of the most fundamental requirements of our democratic system of government, and that is the principle of ministerial accountability to the parliament. He failed in this instance and in many other instances to meet the fundamental obligations of his office as our nation's Attorney-General—the protection of the independence of our courts and senior statutory office holders and the promotion of proper standards of conduct and the very basic fundamentals of ethical standards and integrity. You can see in this statement that I made that when you reflect on proper conduct he has failed to consult and he has undermined the rule of law in his relationship with this very important statutory office. And he continues to deceive and mislead this place.


He displays, I think, a glittering indifference to the truth of this matter. It is a very serious matter and one that the government and the Senate must also take very seriously. The Senate cannot and should not accept what Senator Brandis has put forward as an explanation. He has failed to meet his most basic responsibilities time and time again, and I think he is behaving in a way that demonstrates complete arrogance and disrespect for this place.


We should not allow this to happen again. Again, that brings me specifically to this disallowance motion. While the direction has indeed been withdrawn, it is important that we prevent this from happening again. It is important that we prevent this from happening again, because the Attorney-General has form on this matter. We know that he tried to interfere with the practice of the independence of the Solicitor-General and we must ensure that this cannot happen again.


While we cannot trust Senator Brandis to act with integrity on this issue, we therefore must take precautions to ensure that the integrity and the independence of our legal system is not further undermined by his actions. He does not have a great track record on these issues, and I would like to remind us of Senator Brandis's other poor pieces of judgement.


This is not the first time we have seen sneaky and misleading tactics from the Attorney-General. I will only have time today to outline just a few of them. Recently, the Attorney-General misled the Senate by claiming that Australia had the highest rate of economic growth of any G20 nation. This was indeed a falsehood. He claimed to have consulted the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Justice Commissioner, Mick Gooda, before establishing the Don Dale royal commission, when no such consultation had occurred. He failed to consult the Solicitor-General about amendments to citizenship legislation concerning foreign fighters, then claimed publicly that he had consulted—yet again another falsehood: a glittering indifference to the truth. He is also refusing to answer important questions about this conduct.


He refused to answer questions in this place about his appointment of a Liberal donor and lawyer for a family member to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Again, I think this is disgraceful. He has breached cabinet rules by disclosing publicly the contents of confidential cabinet debate on national security legislation.


In estimates in May this year Senator Brandis gave evidence that his correspondence with the Lindt Cafe siege terrorist, Man Monis, had been provided to the Thawley-Comley review. He and foreign minister, Julie Bishop, followed up on this, saying that the review had assessed the Attorney's handling of that correspondence and found it did not give rise to any adverse findings. But, senators and Madam Acting Deputy President—guess what? This is another untruth from the Attorney-General. The review had never assessed that correspondence from Senator Brandis because Senator Brandis had not even provided that review with his correspondence. Can you believe it? Unfortunately, I can.


In 2002, Senator Brandis claimed that the Navy was in possession of statements which proved that an asylum seeker aboard an Indonesian vessel, the Sinar Bontang had tried to strangle his daughter. He claimed that statements were made by the crew of the Navy vessel HMAS Arunta, which intercepted the Indonesian vessel. However, what we know is that maritime commander Rear Admiral Geoff Smith later discredited Senator Brandis's claims, saying that no such statements existed. This did not stop Senator Brandis from peddling this story in the press gallery to get a front page in The Australian—again, a glittering indifference to the truth from Senator Brandis.


Senator Brandis, our Attorney-General, has also been interfering in police investigations. He has attempted to interfere in the conduct of an investigation into the Health Services Union. This included calling the New South Wales Attorney-General to pressure him into having the DPP investigate the matter and calling the New South Wales police minister to pressure him into having the police investigate and charge people as well. He also arranged for the New South Wales police minister to call and apply pressure to the police commissioner. All of those people should and have been properly prosecuted. However, it is not the place of our Attorney-General to interfere in those matters in terms of them needing to be politically independent police and investigative matters.


We also have examples of prejudice against international court cases. We know that in 2013 Senator Brandis, our Attorney-General, authorised an ASIO raid on the offices of a lawyer representing East Timor, and this happened just days before an arbitration with Australia in relation to a dispute over oil and gas reserves in the Timor Sea was due to commence at the International Court of Justice. The International Court of Justice subsequently ordered Australia to stop spying on East Timor and seal all the documents that had been seized in the raid to avoid prejudice to the arbitration. At the time, shadow Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus said that the international court orders damaged Australia's international reputation and were the direct result of Senator Brandis's inept handling of this matter.


It is these kinds of interfering acts that truly demonstrate why we cannot allow the prospect of another legal services direction to arise. We have here an Attorney-General who is completely out of touch with the standards that are expected from him in this role. He has misled the Senate and acted, I believe, without integrity. He has displayed a glittering indifference to the truth, not only on this matter but on a great many other important matters. He has demonstrated over and over again that he is not fit to hold his high office. It is mind blowing to me, and unacceptable, that Senator Brandis has been allowed to remain in his position. However, that is not the matter before us today. The matter before us is the disallowance, and I commend the disallowance to the Senate.

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (18:58):  I too rise to speak about this disallowance motion on the Legal Services Amendment (Solicitor-General Opinions) Direction 2016. As I said previously in this place, I think the inquiry that was conducted into this matter and the majority report shames all of us in this chamber. Despite what those opposite have now said, I think the facts are very simple. This inquiry was established by Labor and the Greens to king-hit the Attorney-General. Instead, they knocked out the Solicitor-General. After the Solicitor-General unexpectedly fessed up in the hearing that he had breached the caretaker conventions and had a secret conversation with the shadow Attorney-General—and very likely in the process, I believe, communicated privileged information to the shadow Attorney-General during an election campaign during the caretaker period—the Solicitor-General had no choice but to resign when he did. As a barrister, he must have known it was a breach of professional conduct and professional ethics to have an ex parte discussion and breach client privilege so egregiously. Consequently, as Solicitor-General, a key legal adviser to this government, it would be impossible for any future minister—either the Attorney-General or the Prime Minister or any other minister or even the Governor-General—to have confidence in him any more if he was so willing to breach his professional and ethical duties.


The shadow Attorney-General, a previous Attorney-General and a barrister himself, knew far better than to contact the Solicitor-General during caretaker period. The Solicitor-General certainly knew better than to take the shadow Attorney-General's call and divulge the detail about advice he had given, and his opinion on that advice he had given, the Attorney-General. 


Any objective analysis of the Solicitor-General's testimony will find it absolutely riddled with contradictions and, quite frankly, highly unwarranted hubris. I am not surprised that he did not want to answer a single one of my questions on notice—and not a single question—but it was not unreasonable of me to ask these questions. There were 34—not 120—questions very carefully crafted by myself that were explicitly linked to his testimony and in particular his bombshell revelations that he had so secretly and carelessly breached caretaker conventions. I ask all in this place: since when has it been discretionary for any witness in any inquiry to flatly refuse to answer any of question of any senator in this place? The excuse he gave was that 'There were too many questions' or 'I sort of kind of answered some of them so, hey, I'm not going to answer any of your questions at all.' If I had been in his position and had breached caretaker conventions I do not think I would have wanted to answer any senator's questions on that. But that is not the point. 


Those opposite, as well as the Labor and Greens members of this inquiry know full well that is not the point. They set up this inquiry, as I said, to king-hit the Attorney-General and instead they knocked out the Solicitor-General. That is their bag, their shame and their disgrace that they have done this. 


So two issues should be of great concern to all in this place about the conduct of those opposite and of the Solicitor-General. First of all, as I have said, the contempt the Solicitor-General of this nation showed not just myself but to every senator in this place by refusing to answer any question on notice that flowed directly from the surprise testimony. I am sure none of the Greens or the Labor MPs would have had any idea that he was about to drop the bombshell that he did—that he had breached caretaker conventions and, I argue, had provided privileged information to the shadow Attorney-General. That is the first thing, but the second thing, which should be a great concern to all in this chamber, is the actions of those opposite on this committee. That the committee accepted the Solicitor-General's refusal to answer a single question on notice that flowed directly and very clearly from his bombshell evidence at that inquiry. The majority members' decision is a shocking precedent to set for all future Senate committee inquiries. What? Somebody does not care to give evidence because it is a little bit uncomfortable and so they just tell the committee, 'Na, I don't really feel like answering because it's going to make me look bad.' That is an appalling precedent for this place. As I said, I understand why the majority of committee members did not want these questions answered by the Solicitor-General clearly and that was to protect the shadow Attorney-General from further scrutiny and to protect the Solicitor-General. 


Well, too late; it was too late when the shadow Attorney-General had that discussion with the Solicitor-General and when the Solicitor-General failed to disclose that conversation to the secretary of the Attorney-General's Department or to the Attorney-General himself. That horse had well and truly already bolted. It was too late when Labor and Green committee members failed to do any due diligence with the shadow Attorney-General about whether there might be any little surprises that the Solicitor-General may have for them in this inquiry.


The intention of this inquiry was also very clear when, at the beginning of the hearing with the Solicitor-General and the Attorney-General, the coalition members moved that it be heard in camera to preserve the dignity of both the Attorney-General and the Office of the Solicitor-General. Had we gone in camera, their intent of turning it into a political horse trial—pony show, whatever—would have failed.




Senator Bilyk:
  What exactly are you saying?




Senator REYNOLDS:
  It was a long night, last night! It was a very long night. Into a show trial. I think that is what I was trying to say.




Senator McKim:
  A show pony!




Senator REYNOLDS:
  A show pony. Thank you very much, Senator McKim. Instead of having it heard in camera, where this bombshell advice would have been heard, they turned it into this show trial. Labor did what they do best. They shot the Solicitor-General by mistake. And what do they do when they go onto the political ropes? They defend by attack. And the facts be dammed. Not only did they ignore the facts that we heard clearly and that are clearly there for anybody to see—through the Hansard transcripts of this hearing, and through the dissenting report—they shot the Solicitor-General and went on the attack. Facts be dammed. Then we had the chair of the committee, when presenting the committee report, come in here and quote extensively from Alice in Wonderland. As if that was not enough, she then quoted from 'Humpty Dumpty'. No amount of 'Humpty Dumpty' or recitations of Alice in Wonderland can hide the facts. Any member of the public or the media can go online and into Hansard and have a look at the facts.


The facts are these. On 13—that is, 13—occasions from June 2015 to October 2016 the Attorney-General and the secretary of the Attorney-General's Department consulted—discussed, reviewed, whatever you like to call it—with the Solicitor-General. You might call a meeting a 'discussion' but that is consultation. There is absolutely no doubt that consultation occurred. By my counting—this is all on the public record—there were 13 occasions of consultation between the parties. This fact—again, it is on the public record—was conclusively confirmed by the secretary himself of the Attorney-General's Department. He confirmed that this consultation had occurred, and it was the consultation that was legally required to be held.


What occurred during the inquiry was the comprehensive unravelling of Mr Gleeson, arising from the admissions he made of inappropriate conduct. Not only did he disclose that he had had this highly inappropriate contact with the shadow Attorney-General during caretaker provisions, on advice he had given the Attorney-General, but also he disclosed on the public record information regarding advice he had also provided to the government—not just to the government but to the Prime Minister and to the Australian Government Solicitor. He may have shadow-boxed around whether he still considered himself a barrister, but he still uses the post-nominal SC and is providing advice to this government. On any review of professional political standards for barristers, he breached those guidelines. The Solicitor-General of this country did so not once, not twice, not three times but at least four times, by my count, to this inquiry. He breached his professional obligations.


In Mr Gleeson's submission to the inquiry which, again, is on the public record, he released confidential emails with the classification of 'protected'. Even the most junior of public servants knows that you do not release protected documents in that way. From any ordinary legal practitioner, whether a barrister or a solicitor, such behaviour may well constitute professional misconduct. However, the Solicitor-General told the committee—again, on the public record—'Under the Law Officers Act, I do not practice as a barrister.' Really? 


Further, the Solicitor-General was asked whether he agreed with the assertion by former Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus QC that the Solicitor-General is 'just a barrister'. So this is former Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus QC saying that the Solicitor-General is 'just a barrister'. The Solicitor-General refuted that; he said, no, that was not the case. But, despite that, he still happily uses the postnominal SC.


In the Solicitor-General's correspondence to the committee, the Solicitor-General engaged in what he called 'voluntary cooperation' with the committee. In other words, he was not compelled to give any evidence, nor was he compelled to produce any documents. But, despite this, he appears to have produced documents, answered questions—and neglected to claim legal privilege in respect of certain information—without first consulting the government, his clients. 


The Solicitor-General also confirmed in his evidence to the committee that—as I have talked about—he accepted a phone call from shadow Attorney-General Mr Mark Dreyfus during the caretaker period, some time in June 2016. He could not recall exactly when it was because, apparently, as a Solicitor-General of this country and as a barrister, he does not keep notes. I find that quite extraordinary. He must be the only barrister in Australia who does not keep detailed notes, particularly of conversations he has with the shadow Attorney-General of this country.


So what did he tell the committee about why he took the call? You would have thought that any Public Servant, if they had had a call from a shadow minister, would have said, 'I'm sorry. I can't take your call. Ring the secretary of the department. Ring the Attorney-General or another minister.' Instead, he said this to the committee: 'It was my duty to tell Mr Dreyfus what I did.' And, if you want to check, it is on page 11 of the Hansard. 



Then a bit later, on page 16 of the Hansard, he then agreed that it was not actually within his role or duty to consult with the shadow Attorney-General. And he said this—again, anyone can check this on page 16 of the Hansard.


The appropriate course in the caretaker period was for the secretary of the Attorney-General's Department and the Attorney-General to refer to the shadow Attorney-General that matter. 


Well, that was hardly a revelation—but, again, quite contradictory to his first statement. 


Following these revelations—and actually having a look at a lot of the inconsistencies in the Solicitor-General's testimony—I provided questions on notice to Mr Gleeson to address these and many others inconsistencies. I very carefully referenced every single question to the testimony he gave on that day in Hansard. And I very clearly gave him the opportunity to expand on that new information that he had provided at the hearing. Again, it is a common practice for all senators in this place to ask questions on notice when you get new information in an inquiry. 


Unfortunately—and again, as I said, I think this gives great shame or should at least be cause for concern for all in this chamber—when the Solicitor-General came back and said, 'Well, I'm not really going to answer any of these questions. I sort of kind of answered some of them. There are too many questions. It's all a bit of a bother really', what did the chair of the committee say? The chair said:


The committee has resolved it will not insist upon answers, given that many of the questions—


'many', not all—


cover ground that has been discussed … and as a result of the large number of questions which were asked.


Since when—34 questions—is it up for the committee chair and the majority on the committee to tell another senator that there are too many questions or that some of them have been answered so, 'Hey, we won't get them to answer any of the questions'? It is absolutely inexcusable and outrageous to exclude the Solicitor-General and to give him a leave pass from answering any questions.


As I said, if I were the Solicitor-General and one of you had put those questions to me, I would not have wanted to answer them either, because they are really hard questions. But that is no excuse for a committee of this place to not insist on some or all of the questions being answered in at least some way. Mr Gleeson, as the former Solicitor-General, is accountable, like we all are in this place. He is a public official, he is a member of the executive government and he is paid by the Australian taxpayer. 


This has set a very dangerous precedent. If followed more widely, it could result in questions being vetted by any committee, any committee chair, and it could result in those being questioned simply choosing not to answer because, 'Well, there's already a large amount of questions and I kind of don't want to answer them,' or 'They're really going to put me in a bad light, so I don't think I'm going to answer the questions today.' Again, that is completely and utterly outrageous.


The absent chair of this committee sat there and told us at great length in this very chamber that Humpty Dumpty may have sat on the wall—but I have to say that, at the hand of Labor, it was the Solicitor-General who fell off the wall. All of us in this place deserve much, much better than this. To those listening to this broadcast who have an interest in this: please go and search Hansard and have a look at the transcripts of exactly what was said; have a look at the majority report and all the fabulous stories about Humpty Dumpty and Alice in Wonderland. But also have a look at the dissenting report and at the attachments and at the facts contained in there. I challenge any Australian to make their own mind up. 


There were 13 lots of contact between them. The whole idea that this directive is somehow trying to undermine the Solicitor-General is completely and utterly false. I would ask any journalist or any member of the public who is listening to go and have a look at section 12 of the Law Officers Act, which the Solicitor-General quoted a lot. It says that advice has to go through the Attorney-General. This great conspiracy of a directive was no such thing. Section 12 is a very short section of the act which provides the Solicitor-General with guidance on his role—his advisory role and his counsel role. Under the act, his advisory role is very clearly at the direction of the Attorney-General of this country. This great conspiracy was developed by those opposite to try to king hit the Attorney-General—you misfired and you knocked out the Solicitor-General. Doing that should be a cause of some great shame to you all, because there was no conspiracy. The Law Officers Act is very clear. The directive is almost word for word with the Law Officers Act. Shame on you.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (19:18):  The Australian Greens will be supporting this disallowance motion for a range of reasons, primarily because the legal services direction is contrary to the rule of law in that it seeks to set the Attorney-General up as a gatekeeper to the Solicitor-General and because the Attorney-General misled the Senate in the material he provided to this chamber with respect to the legal services direction. It is worth pointing out that the Attorney-General is a serial misleader of the Commonwealth parliament. He misleads on every day that he is asked about migration matters in this place when he claims that not one person has died at sea under Operation Sovereign Borders, when he cannot possibly make that claim. He misleads when he claims that no children are currently in detention, when in fact there are children in detention on Nauru as we have this debate today. Of course, he misleads the Senate when he claims to have consulted with the Solicitor-General on the legal services direction, when in fact the Solicitor-General himself made it very clear in his evidence to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee that he had not been consulted. So this is an Attorney-General who is renowned for his appalling failures and lapses of judgement, and this legal services direction constitutes yet another appalling failure of judgement.


Debate interrupted.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (18:40):  This disallowance before us today in this place is a matter of great gravity. In May this year the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, tabled the Legal Services Amendment (Solicitor-General Opinions) Direction 2016 in this place. The direction meant that no-one could refer a question of law to the Solicitor-General without the consent of the Attorney-General—not his most senior ministers, not even the Prime Minister. That was the intent of the legal services direction which the Attorney-General implemented. It was an extraordinary act, an act that put at risk the integrity of our legal system, and, indeed, I think, the integrity of this parliament. We have seen in this direction the undermining of the separation of government and the independence of our legal system. It is clear to us that Senator Brandis implemented the legal services direction in an attempt to undermine the independence of a statutory officer, the Solicitor-General, and he then went on to mislead the parliament about his conduct. The Attorney-General of our nation—the most senior law officer of our nation—did not comply with his obligation to consult on this matter.


After the damning inquiry into the legal services amendment direction, Senator Brandis went about to withdraw his direction. He did so in accordance with the recommendations of the committee report, I guess to avoid the embarrassment of having it disallowed in this chamber. And while I am pleased with the fact that Senator Brandis has complied with the recommendations of the committee report, the way he went about it in a somewhat sneaky manner without telling anybody demonstrates again his disregard for consultation, as he has never sort to explain his actions to this place. Despite the fact that the legal services direction has been withdrawn, it is critically important that this matter still be disallowed by the Senate, because the Senate must express its view and opinion on the matter of law at the heart of this matter, in terms of how opinions are sought from the Solicitor-General, so that it cannot happen again. It is why this disallowance is proceeding today.


If you look at the very problematic things about the legal services direction as it was tabled, there are some very significant issues with it that really demonstrate the Attorney-General's poor judgement. I refer to some of the evidence that Gavan Griffith QC gave to our committee. He was, in fact, the Solicitor-General for some 14 years from 1984 to 1997 under both Labor and Liberal governments. He construed the direction was in fact ultra vires and of no effect as a lawful direction in terms of its capacity to direct the Solicitor-General. Notwithstanding this, the intent of the direction is to withhold the Solicitor-General from being able to provide advice. Again, the direction is wrong on the basis of law.


Notwithstanding the fact that the direction is wrong on the basis of law, both Gavan Griffith and Ms Appleby talked to the committee about the chilling effect of this direction in creating roadblocks to appropriate, authoritative, welcome or unwelcome advice from the peak level of the second law officer, who, within the Commonwealth, is the leading counsel to the Commonwealth. In other words, it would keep government departments and agencies from seeking the proper advice through the proper channels of government.


Gavan Griffiths went on to say that one of the effects of the legal services direction is that it creates a propensity for government to shop around for advice. Indeed, this is what our current Attorney-General has done on a number of significant matters. This has also been highlighted in evidence to our committee. Gavan Griffiths gave some examples of that.


Lastly, the particularly problematic nature of this legal services direction and why it must be disallowed is that it highlights how the differences between the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General should not be resolved during their continued incumbency by what Gavan Griffiths calls:


… inappropriate and destructive legislative or administrative measures being imposed which have the effect of destroying the independent office of SG—


that is, the Solicitor-General. These are incredibly important reasons as to why this place must look to supporting this disallowance so that the practice of the Attorney-General can no longer continue to pollute the way in which advice is sought from the Solicitor-General.


I want to highlight some other issues to do with the conduct of the Attorney-General when it comes to this disallowance. The failure of the Attorney-General to consult the Solicitor-General is one of the reasons why the incredibly problematic and wrong nature of the legal services direction was never brought to the attention of this place. It was never highlighted. That meant that the problems with the legal services direction never saw the light of day until it was implemented, which is an incredibly damning thing. The Attorney-General's conduct and his failure to meet his obligation to consult is why we have found ourselves in this place discussing this, as it would have been pointed out that the legal services direction is wrong in law and unimplementable.


But these kinds of actions are entirely consistent with a great many other issues with recent actions of our Attorney-General. We have a claim from the Attorney-General that he consulted the Solicitor-General. It is a blatant falsehood. This consultation never, ever occurred. Indeed, the Attorney-General made what are very clearly false and misleading statements to this place. For the statement that the Attorney-General had consulted the Solicitor-General to be true, the Attorney-General would at a minimum have needed to advise the Solicitor-General of his intention to introduce a new instrument and provide him with the opportunity to comment on its content. At no stage did the Attorney-General do this. Indeed, the only person who Senator Brandis consulted with in large part, it appears, was himself.


Senator Brandis has been caught out on this issue—and not for the first time—breaching one of the most fundamental requirements of our democratic system of government, and that is the principle of ministerial accountability to the parliament. He failed in this instance and in many other instances to meet the fundamental obligations of his office as our nation's Attorney-General—the protection of the independence of our courts and senior statutory office holders and the promotion of proper standards of conduct and the very basic fundamentals of ethical standards and integrity. You can see in this statement that I made that when you reflect on proper conduct he has failed to consult and he has undermined the rule of law in his relationship with this very important statutory office. And he continues to deceive and mislead this place.


He displays, I think, a glittering indifference to the truth of this matter. It is a very serious matter and one that the government and the Senate must also take very seriously. The Senate cannot and should not accept what Senator Brandis has put forward as an explanation. He has failed to meet his most basic responsibilities time and time again, and I think he is behaving in a way that demonstrates complete arrogance and disrespect for this place.


We should not allow this to happen again. Again, that brings me specifically to this disallowance motion. While the direction has indeed been withdrawn, it is important that we prevent this from happening again. It is important that we prevent this from happening again, because the Attorney-General has form on this matter. We know that he tried to interfere with the practice of the independence of the Solicitor-General and we must ensure that this cannot happen again.


While we cannot trust Senator Brandis to act with integrity on this issue, we therefore must take precautions to ensure that the integrity and the independence of our legal system is not further undermined by his actions. He does not have a great track record on these issues, and I would like to remind us of Senator Brandis's other poor pieces of judgement.


This is not the first time we have seen sneaky and misleading tactics from the Attorney-General. I will only have time today to outline just a few of them. Recently, the Attorney-General misled the Senate by claiming that Australia had the highest rate of economic growth of any G20 nation. This was indeed a falsehood. He claimed to have consulted the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Justice Commissioner, Mick Gooda, before establishing the Don Dale royal commission, when no such consultation had occurred. He failed to consult the Solicitor-General about amendments to citizenship legislation concerning foreign fighters, then claimed publicly that he had consulted—yet again another falsehood: a glittering indifference to the truth. He is also refusing to answer important questions about this conduct.


He refused to answer questions in this place about his appointment of a Liberal donor and lawyer for a family member to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Again, I think this is disgraceful. He has breached cabinet rules by disclosing publicly the contents of confidential cabinet debate on national security legislation.


In estimates in May this year Senator Brandis gave evidence that his correspondence with the Lindt Cafe siege terrorist, Man Monis, had been provided to the Thawley-Comley review. He and foreign minister, Julie Bishop, followed up on this, saying that the review had assessed the Attorney's handling of that correspondence and found it did not give rise to any adverse findings. But, senators and Madam Acting Deputy President—guess what? This is another untruth from the Attorney-General. The review had never assessed that correspondence from Senator Brandis because Senator Brandis had not even provided that review with his correspondence. Can you believe it? Unfortunately, I can.


In 2002, Senator Brandis claimed that the Navy was in possession of statements which proved that an asylum seeker aboard an Indonesian vessel, the Sinar Bontang had tried to strangle his daughter. He claimed that statements were made by the crew of the Navy vessel HMAS Arunta, which intercepted the Indonesian vessel. However, what we know is that maritime commander Rear Admiral Geoff Smith later discredited Senator Brandis's claims, saying that no such statements existed. This did not stop Senator Brandis from peddling this story in the press gallery to get a front page in The Australian—again, a glittering indifference to the truth from Senator Brandis.


Senator Brandis, our Attorney-General, has also been interfering in police investigations. He has attempted to interfere in the conduct of an investigation into the Health Services Union. This included calling the New South Wales Attorney-General to pressure him into having the DPP investigate the matter and calling the New South Wales police minister to pressure him into having the police investigate and charge people as well. He also arranged for the New South Wales police minister to call and apply pressure to the police commissioner. All of those people should and have been properly prosecuted. However, it is not the place of our Attorney-General to interfere in those matters in terms of them needing to be politically independent police and investigative matters.


We also have examples of prejudice against international court cases. We know that in 2013 Senator Brandis, our Attorney-General, authorised an ASIO raid on the offices of a lawyer representing East Timor, and this happened just days before an arbitration with Australia in relation to a dispute over oil and gas reserves in the Timor Sea was due to commence at the International Court of Justice. The International Court of Justice subsequently ordered Australia to stop spying on East Timor and seal all the documents that had been seized in the raid to avoid prejudice to the arbitration. At the time, shadow Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus said that the international court orders damaged Australia's international reputation and were the direct result of Senator Brandis's inept handling of this matter.


It is these kinds of interfering acts that truly demonstrate why we cannot allow the prospect of another legal services direction to arise. We have here an Attorney-General who is completely out of touch with the standards that are expected from him in this role. He has misled the Senate and acted, I believe, without integrity. He has displayed a glittering indifference to the truth, not only on this matter but on a great many other important matters. He has demonstrated over and over again that he is not fit to hold his high office. It is mind blowing to me, and unacceptable, that Senator Brandis has been allowed to remain in his position. However, that is not the matter before us today. The matter before us is the disallowance, and I commend the disallowance to the Senate.

The excuse he gave was that 'There were too many questions' or 'I sort of kind of answered some of them so, hey, I'm not going to answer any of your questions at all.' If I had been in his position and had breached caretaker conventions I do not think I would have wanted to answer any senator's questions on that. But that is not the point. 


Those opposite, as well as the Labor and Greens members of this inquiry know full well that is not the point.

The majority members' decision is a shocking precedent to set for all future Senate committee inquiries. What? Somebody does not care to give evidence because it is a little bit uncomfortable and so they just tell the committee, 'Na, I don't really feel like answering because it's going to make me look bad.' That is an appalling precedent for this place. As I said, I understand why the majority of committee members did not want these questions answered by the Solicitor-General clearly and that was to protect the shadow Attorney-General from further scrutiny and to protect the Solicitor-General. 


Well, too late; it was too late when the shadow Attorney-General had that discussion with the Solicitor-General and when the Solicitor-General failed to disclose that conversation to the secretary of the Attorney-General's Department or to the Attorney-General himself.

  A show pony. Thank you very much, Senator McKim. Instead of having it heard in camera, where this bombshell advice would have been heard, they turned it into this show trial. Labor did what they do best. They shot the Solicitor-General by mistake. And what do they do when they go onto the political ropes? They defend by attack. And the facts be dammed. Not only did they ignore the facts that we heard clearly and that are clearly there for anybody to see—through the Hansard transcripts of this hearing, and through the dissenting report—they shot the Solicitor-General and went on the attack. Facts be dammed. Then we had the chair of the committee, when presenting the committee report, come in here and quote extensively from Alice in Wonderland. As if that was not enough, she then quoted from 'Humpty Dumpty'. No amount of 'Humpty Dumpty' or recitations of Alice in Wonderland can hide the facts. Any member of the public or the media can go online and into Hansard and have a look at the facts.


The facts are these. On 13—that is, 13—occasions from June 2015 to October 2016 the Attorney-General and the secretary of the Attorney-General's Department consulted—discussed, reviewed, whatever you like to call it—with the Solicitor-General. You might call a meeting a 'discussion' but that is consultation. There is absolutely no doubt that consultation occurred. By my counting—this is all on the public record—there were 13 occasions of consultation between the parties. This fact—again, it is on the public record—was conclusively confirmed by the secretary himself of the Attorney-General's Department. He confirmed that this consultation had occurred, and it was the consultation that was legally required to be held.


What occurred during the inquiry was the comprehensive unravelling of Mr Gleeson, arising from the admissions he made of inappropriate conduct. Not only did he disclose that he had had this highly inappropriate contact with the shadow Attorney-General during caretaker provisions, on advice he had given the Attorney-General, but also he disclosed on the public record information regarding advice he had also provided to the government—not just to the government but to the Prime Minister and to the Australian Government Solicitor. He may have shadow-boxed around whether he still considered himself a barrister, but he still uses the post-nominal SC and is providing advice to this government. On any review of professional political standards for barristers, he breached those guidelines. The Solicitor-General of this country did so not once, not twice, not three times but at least four times, by my count, to this inquiry. He breached his professional obligations.


In Mr Gleeson's submission to the inquiry which, again, is on the public record, he released confidential emails with the classification of 'protected'. Even the most junior of public servants knows that you do not release protected documents in that way. From any ordinary legal practitioner, whether a barrister or a solicitor, such behaviour may well constitute professional misconduct. However, the Solicitor-General told the committee—again, on the public record—'Under the Law Officers Act, I do not practice as a barrister.' Really? 


Further, the Solicitor-General was asked whether he agreed with the assertion by former Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus QC that the Solicitor-General is 'just a barrister'. So this is former Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus QC saying that the Solicitor-General is 'just a barrister'. The Solicitor-General refuted that; he said, no, that was not the case. But, despite that, he still happily uses the postnominal SC.


In the Solicitor-General's correspondence to the committee, the Solicitor-General engaged in what he called 'voluntary cooperation' with the committee. In other words, he was not compelled to give any evidence, nor was he compelled to produce any documents. But, despite this, he appears to have produced documents, answered questions—and neglected to claim legal privilege in respect of certain information—without first consulting the government, his clients. 


The Solicitor-General also confirmed in his evidence to the committee that—as I have talked about—he accepted a phone call from shadow Attorney-General Mr Mark Dreyfus during the caretaker period, some time in June 2016. He could not recall exactly when it was because, apparently, as a Solicitor-General of this country and as a barrister, he does not keep notes. I find that quite extraordinary. He must be the only barrister in Australia who does not keep detailed notes, particularly of conversations he has with the shadow Attorney-General of this country.


So what did he tell the committee about why he took the call? You would have thought that any Public Servant, if they had had a call from a shadow minister, would have said, 'I'm sorry. I can't take your call. Ring the secretary of the department. Ring the Attorney-General or another minister.' Instead, he said this to the committee: 'It was my duty to tell Mr Dreyfus what I did.' And, if you want to check, it is on page 11 of the Hansard. 



Then a bit later, on page 16 of the Hansard, he then agreed that it was not actually within his role or duty to consult with the shadow Attorney-General. And he said this—again, anyone can check this on page 16 of the Hansard.


The appropriate course in the caretaker period was for the secretary of the Attorney-General's Department and the Attorney-General to refer to the shadow Attorney-General that matter. 


Well, that was hardly a revelation—but, again, quite contradictory to his first statement. 


Following these revelations—and actually having a look at a lot of the inconsistencies in the Solicitor-General's testimony—I provided questions on notice to Mr Gleeson to address these and many others inconsistencies. I very carefully referenced every single question to the testimony he gave on that day in Hansard. And I very clearly gave him the opportunity to expand on that new information that he had provided at the hearing. Again, it is a common practice for all senators in this place to ask questions on notice when you get new information in an inquiry. 


Unfortunately—and again, as I said, I think this gives great shame or should at least be cause for concern for all in this chamber—when the Solicitor-General came back and said, 'Well, I'm not really going to answer any of these questions. I sort of kind of answered some of them. There are too many questions. It's all a bit of a bother really', what did the chair of the committee say? The chair said:


The committee has resolved it will not insist upon answers, given that many of the questions—


'many', not all—


cover ground that has been discussed … and as a result of the large number of questions which were asked.


Since when—34 questions—is it up for the committee chair and the majority on the committee to tell another senator that there are too many questions or that some of them have been answered so, 'Hey, we won't get them to answer any of the questions'? It is absolutely inexcusable and outrageous to exclude the Solicitor-General and to give him a leave pass from answering any questions.


As I said, if I were the Solicitor-General and one of you had put those questions to me, I would not have wanted to answer them either, because they are really hard questions. But that is no excuse for a committee of this place to not insist on some or all of the questions being answered in at least some way. Mr Gleeson, as the former Solicitor-General, is accountable, like we all are in this place. He is a public official, he is a member of the executive government and he is paid by the Australian taxpayer. 


This has set a very dangerous precedent. If followed more widely, it could result in questions being vetted by any committee, any committee chair, and it could result in those being questioned simply choosing not to answer because, 'Well, there's already a large amount of questions and I kind of don't want to answer them,' or 'They're really going to put me in a bad light, so I don't think I'm going to answer the questions today.' Again, that is completely and utterly outrageous.


The absent chair of this committee sat there and told us at great length in this very chamber that Humpty Dumpty may have sat on the wall—but I have to say that, at the hand of Labor, it was the Solicitor-General who fell off the wall. All of us in this place deserve much, much better than this. To those listening to this broadcast who have an interest in this: please go and search Hansard and have a look at the transcripts of exactly what was said; have a look at the majority report and all the fabulous stories about Humpty Dumpty and Alice in Wonderland. But also have a look at the dissenting report and at the attachments and at the facts contained in there. I challenge any Australian to make their own mind up. 


There were 13 lots of contact between them. The whole idea that this directive is somehow trying to undermine the Solicitor-General is completely and utterly false. I would ask any journalist or any member of the public who is listening to go and have a look at section 12 of the Law Officers Act, which the Solicitor-General quoted a lot. It says that advice has to go through the Attorney-General. This great conspiracy of a directive was no such thing. Section 12 is a very short section of the act which provides the Solicitor-General with guidance on his role—his advisory role and his counsel role. Under the act, his advisory role is very clearly at the direction of the Attorney-General of this country. This great conspiracy was developed by those opposite to try to king hit the Attorney-General—you misfired and you knocked out the Solicitor-General. Doing that should be a cause of some great shame to you all, because there was no conspiracy. The Law Officers Act is very clear. The directive is almost word for word with the Law Officers Act. Shame on you.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2016-11-22,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (19:18):  The Australian Greens will be supporting this disallowance motion for a range of reasons, primarily because the legal services direction is contrary to the rule of law in that it seeks to set the Attorney-General up as a gatekeeper to the Solicitor-General and because the Attorney-General misled the Senate in the material he provided to this chamber with respect to the legal services direction. It is worth pointing out that the Attorney-General is a serial misleader of the Commonwealth parliament. He misleads on every day that he is asked about migration matters in this place when he claims that not one person has died at sea under Operation Sovereign Borders, when he cannot possibly make that claim. He misleads when he claims that no children are currently in detention, when in fact there are children in detention on Nauru as we have this debate today. Of course, he misleads the Senate when he claims to have consulted with the Solicitor-General on the legal services direction, when in fact the Solicitor-General himself made it very clear in his evidence to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee that he had not been consulted. So this is an Attorney-General who is renowned for his appalling failures and lapses of judgement, and this legal services direction constitutes yet another appalling failure of judgement.


Debate interrupted.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2016-11-22,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (19:20):  I rise to speak about a fine elderly man called Ted Mulligan. Recently my wife, Nancy, and I were honoured to attend the 100th birthday celebrations of this Guyra legend. Ted Mulligan is a fifth-generation Australian and the last surviving member of his generation of Mulligans. As one of the seven children of Edward and Mary Mulligan, Ted grew up on the family property, Glenore, just west of Guyra, and was initially schooled on the adjoining property Hillsdale before heading off to Guyra Convent and Armidale De La Salle schools.


After leaving school, Ted worked on his parent's sheep and cattle property. He also grew peas and trapped rabbits. He and his brothers trapped around 10,000 rabbits in a two-year period. At the age of 20, he joined the 12th Light Horse Regiment, becoming a member of the Armidale Troop and then transferring to the Guyra Troop after it formed. Ted's horse was chosen out of 700 horses to carry the Governor-General on an inspection of the Northern NSW Troop. After enlisting in the Army, he saw active service in New Guinea and the South Pacific and received 10 bravery and service medals. Post-war, he purchased the property Ellerslie, which adjoins the family farm Glenore, and he married Iris Cox in 1948. They were to spend all their working life on Ellerslie.


Ted provided a school for his children and the children from neighbouring properties, and he and Iris also provided meals and accommodation for teachers at the school. He was a driving force behind the establishment of school bus runs in the 1960s to take children to school in Guyra.


He loved horses and cricket, and a great social outing for the family was always the pony club events. In fact, he helped form the Guyra Pony Club in 1958 and, if some children other than his own did not have a horse, Ted would provide one. At the age of 98 he was still regularly riding 10 miles a day, often with his great mate Doug Faint. 


His other sporting love was cricket—and the Australian team could do with a bit of the Mulligan resilience at the moment! Ted captained the Glenore team, and just about every member was a Mulligan. In one game, the whole 11 in the team were Mulligans. He represented Guyra and Northern Tablelands. He was a very handy bat and played on into his 60s. He gave back to the sport as a selector, an official and a team manager and he was the instigator of Guyra's first turf cricket wicket.


Any country community depends on volunteers and people putting their shoulder to the wheel. Ted Mulligan has done more than his fair share, and I will now list some of the organisations he has been involved with in different capacities. He has been a member of the Guyra Show Society for just a little while—80 years! He has been involved with the Sydney and Brisbane shows. He has been involved with Guyra Pony Club for 58 years. I think he was one of the instigators that got the club going. He has been involved with the Zone 13 Pony Club Association and the Australian Stock Horse Society. He joined the Australian Light Horse Association in 1937 and was one of six chosen to represent the association at the dedication of a memorial to Australian soldiers at Beersheba in Israel in 2008. He has been involved with Guyra Polocrosse Club, Guyra and Northern Tablelands Cricket, and Guyra RSL Sub Branch for 70 years, in a number of active roles. At the age of 100, Ted remains a patron of six organisations.


His service has not gone unnoticed. He was awarded an OAM in 2006, Guyra Citizen of the Year in 2008 and the NSW Seniors Week Local Achievement Award in 2014. Ted has his faith and is a staunch supporter of the St Mary of the Angels School and the Catholic Church in Guyra. The day following his birthday celebration, Ted received a papal blessing. 


What makes the Ted Mulligan story so compelling is this: just two years ago, at the age of 98, he was hit by a car and received injuries that resulted in a slow recovery. Back scans revealed not only damage to his vertebrae but also lymphoma, a type of cancer. In typical fashion, Ted fought back and has achieved complete remission. Ted's specialist wrote in a medical journal that, at 98, Ted may be amongst the oldest patients worldwide to be successfully treated for an aggressive lymphoma.


I was truly humbled to be in the presence of Ted Mulligan, his lovely wife, Iris, and the extended Mulligan family. Ted and Iris raised six children. Times would have been tough, and those were the days where you caught as much food as you purchased. I suspect that whilst Ted appreciates the recognition that he has received, his reward has been seeing his family and his town and district prosper. He is truly a great Australian, and I was glad to present the key to Guyra to him with Hans Hietbrink in recent times.


Ted Mulligan: you are a legend and we wish you all the best!
