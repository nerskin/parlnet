"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-03-20,"—I would like to speak to this motion. It is important to be clear what is actually being proposed here. The government is seeking to extend sitting hours tonight, on a Wednesday, beyond our normal 7.20 p.m. finishing time—to go through to midnight, with the adjournment starting at 11.20 p.m. The Democrats have already expressed a number of times our disappointment at the fact that this government has put forward so few sitting days for the parliament, and for the Senate in particular. We have the smallest number of sitting days in a non-election year for about 40 years. 
From the Democrats' point of view, given the increasing workload that the Senate has in our primary role of assessing legislation—not to mention delegated legislation: regulations and the like—to be required to assess so many pieces of legislation in such a small number of sitting days is almost guaranteeing inadequate examination of very important issues. Whilst I will not expand on it in this debate, there is a bill in relation to migration issues that is obviously part of the government's agenda for these extended hours. The bill is very significant, it has only just appeared, and the government is trying to railroad it through this week. These extensions of sitting hours at virtually no notice are basically a mechanism for trying to railroad legislation through without adequate scrutiny.
Some of the bills and issues that we will be considering have been around for a while through the previous parliament, and to that extent there may be an argument for debating them and passing them reasonably quickly. But it is a great breaching of the Senate's responsibilities if we enable significant new pieces of legislation that have only just appeared to be debated at very short notice without proper scrutiny. It is very poor practice for the Senate to be agreeing to extend sitting hours through to midnight—following on from the extension of sitting hours yesterday—solely because the government will not provide enough sitting days for us to consider legislation. 
Instead of having a proper examination of the issues, we are basically having legislation by exhaustion, through until midnight, night after night. The government is trying to push through bills that have not been around for a sufficient length of time for proper consideration. It makes it impossible for there to be adequate time lines for committees to inquire into bills. Either we examine them, consider them and report this week or we put them off for nearly two months. As the Senate would be aware, but others may not, after this week we are not back here until 14 May, and then only for three sitting days. Then we are not back again until the second last week of June. It is a ridiculous scenario. There is an inadequate time line and an inadequate number of sitting days to properly consider legislation. 
Let the Democrats emphasise that it is not just a matter of us as legislators having adequate time to consider legislation; it is a matter of whether the public as a whole have the opportunity to be aware of what is going on and to provide their input into significant pieces of legislation. The ability for this government to put through matters before the public are even aware that they are up for debate, let alone aware that they have been debated and passed, is greatly increased every time the Senate agrees to motions like these, which allow bills to be debated, considered and passed in the late hours, night after night, particularly when legislation is being introduced at very short notice.
From the Democrats' point of view, it is a combination of poor legislative practice plus poor accountability and poor transparency from the public point of view. The Democrats believe that this is an inappropriate motion and an inappropriate practice for us to be getting into. The Democrats would prefer motions to increase the number of sitting days. If we could have a sitting week or an extra couple of sitting weeks in April, that would be a much more responsible way of dealing with these issues and would be much less likely to impugn the reputation of parliament by rushing through significant matters without proper consideration and without the opportunity for public awareness in relation to them.
So it is a motion the Democrats are strongly opposed to. We do not think it is a desirable way to operate. I indicate that we would be supportive if the government were to move for extra sitting weeks to do this properly rather than have midnight sittings at very short notice. That would be the preferred way to go. But to simply have a government putting up the smallest number of sitting days in a non-election year for decades and then forcing us to extend to midnight night after night because they do not have enough time to get their legislation considered is just shoddy practice. It is very poor.
I should emphasise that this is not a matter of trying to delay legislation inappropriately. I do recognise and acknowledge the comments that Senator Ian Campbell has made from time to time about the difficulty of the timetable and the difficulty of the government getting through its business. I believe that, so far, the Democrats' responsibility cannot be challenged in relation to the consideration of legislation. Even when we have been opposed to particular bills, we have not inappropriately or irresponsibly chewed up government business time just for the sake of it. We obviously will use what mechanisms we have available to us to get proper scrutiny of legislation, but we are sympathetic to the fact that there is a lot of legislation that the government and Senator Campbell in particular have the responsibility of trying to get through in the time available. We are sympathetic to trying to use that time responsibly and getting a balance between adequate consideration and adequate debate and actually getting through the business. I believe we have been responsible in relation to that, but if this is going to be a common approach— providing inadequate time and then extending the hours at short notice and having midnight sittings—it gets harder to be cooperative. From the Democrats' point of view, it appears the government is acting in less than good faith if it provides inadequate sitting days and then just tries to extend the sitting hours to compensate, particularly when it uses that to try to get through legislation that has not had proper scrutiny— legislation that it introduces one week and it tries to have it passed through the whole parliament the next week. The arguments then put forward by people such as the Manager of Government Business have less substance. I am very sympathetic to the arguments he puts but only when the government actually acts responsibly from its side of the bargain. If it is going to try to railroad legislation through without proper scrutiny, it is much less appropriate for the Democrats and other senators to cooperate with that agenda.
I emphasise that the Democrats will be cooperative in trying to ensure that the government business is got through in a reasonable time, but we will not be supportive of processes that prevent proper scrutiny of important legislation or that enable railroading of important legislation through parliament in the dead of night without proper transparency and accountability. We are willing to be cooperative and responsible where possible but, as everyone says, these are issues that apply from all sides. We have already seen one example in this sitting fortnight of an attempt to try to slip a bill through without adequate committee examination. We will probably be revisiting that later today. The more that happens the harder it is for the Democrats, and I think all of us, to be cooperative in this approach. Despite the fact that we oppose this, as an indication that we are not being unreasonable and chewing up time, I will not continue my remarks now, I will not speak for my full time, but I think it is important to highlight what is happening here and the dangerous consequences that are occurring. This is an important chamber. It is the last—
—Bastion.
—bastion—thank you; I was going to use another word but that will do—the final hurdle, if you like, that stops complete power for the executive. If we allow this chamber to not operate in an effective way, then we are just rolling over and letting the executive get complete power, and that would be an abrogation of our responsibility and a weakening of the fundamental underpinnings of our entire system of democracy. So it is a serious matter and one that we need to note when motions like this are moved. I am assuming the government would not be moving this if they did not have support, so it will not surprise me when it gets through. But I do think that the concerns that the Democrats have on a broader process base need to be made, because I think it is a serious issue.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,1,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2002-03-20,"—At the outset, I indicate that the opposition will support the government's motion, but we do so with a great deal of misgiving. Senator Bartlett has outlined many of the reasons why this is an unsatisfactory set of circumstances. We have a situation where, since the election, parliament will have sat for a grand total of four weeks, yet we are now being asked to not sit again for seven weeks—until the time of the budget. At some point you have to say that this government is beginning to believe its own rhetoric. It is beginning to believe that just because it won an election it does not have to face scrutiny, it does not have to face accountability. If we have a continuation of this practice—and I can only agree with you, Senator Bartlett—we will be faced with a fundamental corrupting of the parliamentary process. We are having less and less opportunity to scrutinise the executive. I can understand why this government does not want any scrutiny of its behaviour, of its conduct, because we have seen a fundamental undermining in the recent six months of institutions such as the Defence Force. We have seen the humiliation that Admiral Barrie was forced to go through, the humiliation that this government has just subjected Justice Kirby to—though, at the end of the day, the humiliation was its own—and the lack of process and lack of scrutiny that has brought humiliation upon the office of the Governor-General. Now we are seeing the executive moving on to try to humiliate the processes of parliament.
Part of the reason the government has got into this mess is what happened prior to the last election, when the parliament did not sit—when the Senate's processes, those vital Senate estimates committees, did not sit from June of last year until February this year, when they sat for a few days. The lack of scrutiny allowed the government to perpetrate a series of falsehoods, a series of issues that the Australian public was fundamentally misled on. That is why it is important that the Senate operate as the final check and balance—or bastion, as Senator Bartlett said—in a democratic society. If parliament had sat, we would not have seen the defence department misused as it was before the election. If parliament had sat, we would have got to the bottom of whether the photographs were really true, because parliament affords an opportunity to ask questions like, `Were those photos doctored before Peter Reith put them out? Did they have the dates removed from them?' And the answer would have been very quickly achieved that, yes, Peter Reith and his office removed the dates and the captions. It would have taken one question in question time. It would have taken one question at a Senate estimates. 
I understand why this government does not want us to have greater scrutiny. It does not want to have more question times; it wants to try and abuse the processes so that it does not have to face the scrutiny of senators. We would then not be able to get more details on the $5 billion loss that this government has inflicted on the Australian people because Peter Costello, the Treasurer, fell asleep at the roulette wheel. We would not have this information that we got recently, if it were not for the parliamentary processes. We would not have been able to make this government accountable on all those sorts of issues. We would not have discovered that Peter Costello—
—Mr Costello, Senator.
—Sorry, Madam President. We would not have discovered that Mr Costello received a report every year which detailed the size of the losses. He wants to stand up now and say, `I did not know anything about it. It is not my fault.' But it was Treasury officials, through the parliamentary process, that revealed that Mr Costello received Treasury's annual report that contained a table in it which listed the size of the losses. It was also revealed through the parliamentary and Senate processes that Mr Costello received advice from independent, expert analysts about how to conduct the portfolio. They recommended that he split the portfolio to reduce the risk of the size of the losses—
—Madam President, I rise on a point of order. We are debating the extension of sitting hours. I think Senator Conroy seems to be straying from the subject. I wonder when he will return to what we are talking about.
—It is ranging very widely from the topic, Senator Conroy.
—I appreciate that you are not taking the point of order, Madam President. Senator Calvert, this is about the democratic process, the abuse of it being undertaken, and the government's arrogance in believing it does not have to face the scrutiny of the Australian public, the Australian parliament and this chamber. It is an arrogance—
—We are giving you more time.
—Thank you, Senator Watson, I will take that interjection, because what this government should be doing is holding more sitting days. That is what this government should be doing, not forcing ridiculous sitting hours, not coming to the opposition, as it has done in the other place, saying, `This bill on the ASIO package and the border defence package is so incredibly important you have to pass it in 24 hours!' That is not an acceptable parliamentary process. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Crean, has written to the Prime Minister and told him to stop abusing the process, that this is parliament and it is not good enough to say, `It took us six months to write some legislation about terrorism and extending ASIO's powers. We have had six months to work on it; you have got 24 hours.' That is not good enough. It shows that this government has a disdain for parliament. It shows that this executive is not interested in scrutiny; it would rather try to ram through its legislation without appropriate checks and balances. That is what is at stake here. 
Even though Labor is supporting this amendment, because we have to have an orderly process, we want to put on the record—like Mr Crean put on the record last week—that it is not good enough to try and ram legislation through parliament. This parliament, this Senate, has a role and it should be treated accordingly. Yes, Labor is supporting this and, yes, at times legislation is urgent and does need to be rushed through, but explain to this chamber, government ministers and senators, why it is that it took you six months to prepare legislation, which on 12 September you said was incredibly urgent. You took six months to prepare it, then you run it into the parliament and say to the opposition and the other minor parties, `You have got to pass this in 24 hours.' That is not good enough. It is increasingly the pattern because this government does not want to expose the fact that the Pacific solution has collapsed. It does not want to tell Australians that when the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, said before the election that none of the people on Tampa `over my dead body' will ever set foot on Australian soil, that it is slipping through a piece of legislation this week which is about bringing the people from Nauru onto Australian soil.
That is why parliamentary scrutiny is important; that is why this debate is important; that is why it is wide ranging, Senator Calvert and Senator Watson. This government told the Australian people before the election that not one of those people on Tampa, not one of those people picked up offshore, would set foot on Australian soil—`Over my dead body', Mr Howard told the Australian public. This government said that not one person would set foot on Australian soil, and yet what is it doing? It is coming crawling back into parliament, trying to rush this through so that Australians will not know they were misled before the election. The Pacific solution is no solution, and those refugees that failed the United Nations refugee tests are coming to Australia. There is a brand-new shiny detention centre being built on Christmas Island just to accommodate them, and when that is overflowing they will be put in some of the other centres.
That is why scrutiny is important and that is why, Labor believes, the government does not want to have more sitting days and weeks: that would mean more scrutiny and more question times and would expose the government to the sort of detailed forensic examination that would show that what it said it would do before the election is not what it is doing after the election. That is why it is important for the parliament to sit, and that is why Senator Bartlett's concerns are valid. Even though we are supporting this motion, we do it with a great deal of discomfort: I assure Senator Bartlett of that. We are deeply unhappy that this government is getting away with abusing the processes, ensuring that we are not able to properly examine legislation. Those are all valid points. It is not to say that, every time we all want to sit for as many days and weeks as we want, it is possible, but we are sitting a record low number of days—it is now four weeks until the May budget. I am willing to bet that, if you went away and counted the number of question times the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, attended after he introduced the controversial roster which was so attacked by this government when it was in opposition, you would find that he actually attended more question times in that six months than Mr Howard will have attended—
—You are now straying somewhat from the motion before the chamber, Senator Conroy.
—Thank you, Madam President, I have almost completed my remarks. I am willing to bet that Mr Keating probably attended more parliamentary question times on his reduced roster than Mr Howard is attending in this six months. And I am not surprised, because this government has a lot it wants to hide; it has a lot that it does not want the parliament and the Australian public to know about.
So, yes, we will cooperate for the orderly management of the Senate, because in the end you have to cooperate. But do not think we are satisfied. Mr Crean has put on record his frustration at this government's abuse of the House of Representatives, and on behalf of the opposition I want to put on record the fact that we are deeply uncomfortable with the way that this government is forcing through legislation with a lack of scrutiny. I would ask that the government consider its position in the future and not force the Senate to sit ridiculous hours because it cannot manage its time, saying, `We have urgent bills that must go through'; I would ask that it have some consideration for the Australian public, at the end of the day, who deserve a parliament that is rigorous and examines legislation.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,1,1,speech
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2002-03-20,"—I will not take up much of the Senate's time. I just want to put a couple of things on the record in respect of the opposition's position in relation to this. I also echo the opposition's understanding of Senator Bartlett's comments, and I will not retraverse the issues covered by Senator Conroy, other than to reiterate statements that I made in the Senate last week: this is, in fact, an incredibly small number of sitting days for a post-election program. In the entire year, there are only 61 days for the Senate to sit, and that does not contrast particularly favourably with other post-election sitting periods. For example, in 1997 the Senate sat for 82 days, and in 1999 the Senate sat for 79 days; this year we only have 61 sitting days. Clearly, in anybody's book, that would be seen to be completely inadequate.
We are supporting the proposition, to be helpful and assist, as of course we always do, but I just want to highlight to the government and those who may be listening that the opposition thus far in an ordinary sitting fortnight has agreed to additional sitting hours last Tuesday night and also last Thursday night into the early hours of Friday morning, including a guillotine in relation to the RFA legislation. We sat last night; we will be sitting tonight and, potentially, on Friday, depending on how things pan out. So we are being extremely cooperative. This is more directed towards government members in the other place: we do not want to hear criticism about the Senate being obstructive. I think we have gone out of our way to assist in this respect. From the opposition's perspective, I would also put on record that we would have appreciated a leaders and whips meeting to have a look at the agenda. This is something the government may want to take on board. Perhaps that could have occurred earlier in the week. There are attempts to organise that today in respect of the remainder of the week's program. That really sums up our position. We are supporting this, but we are doing so with the caveats that I have outlined.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,1,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2002-03-20,"—In response to the remarks by various senators, I would simply like to point out that there has been agreement that the Senate will sit tonight. The government is utilising the sitting days to consider what we consider high priority legislation in the time available, and we appreciate the cooperation of senators in dealing with this legislation.
Question agreed to.
—I would like to have my opposition to the motion recorded.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,1,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-20,"—I oppose this move because the Migration Legislation Amendment (Transitional Movement) Bill 2002 is being dumped on the Senate without adequate opportunity to look at the ramifications of it. It is a classic case of why we should be sitting more. This is another one of those bills that potentially removes the rights of people who are refugees or asylum seekers in this country and it has not been adequately explained by the government. There is a great deal of confusion about the provisions of this bill, but the wording of it does point to a further clampdown on the rights of people who may be in Australia and certainly to the suspension of their legal rights. I do not think that we should be dealing with this in a peremptory fashion. I believe this legislation should be coming on in the budget session so that there is due time for the parliament and people in the community who are concerned about these matters—and there are a large number of people in the community and potentially from outside of Australia who are interested in the matter—to consider this legislation with much more diligence than would be allowed if the cut-off motion were applied here.
I would also add, as a matter of general principle, that the cut-off motion came largely at the instigation of former Greens WA Senator Christabel Chamarette so that the Senate could consult with the community and make sure that pieces of legislation just like this one were adequately considered before they were debated and that they could not be dumped at the end of a session on the Senate for fast-tracking. This is a classic case of where the cut-off motion should be applied. It is not a matter of whether one supports or opposes the bill; it is a matter of getting clarification and consulting with the community groups that are involved. I note that the bill effectively suspends the legal rights of people who have been brought to this country. It makes the whole of Australia an exclusion zone as far as those legal rights are concerned. I, for one, want to investigate that further. I want the opportunity to be able, on behalf of the Australian Greens, to consult with the community groups that will be interested in this. This motion suspends the ability to do that, and I am not going to support it.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,3,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-03-20,"—The Democrats strongly oppose this motion relating to the Migration Legislation Amendment (Transitional Movement) Bill 2002. It is again worth outlining the background to this particular issue and the way that cut-off motions work for the sake of those listening as well as for senators in the chamber, who I am sure are listening as well. I should correct Senator Brown who may not be aware of the broader, older history of this. I certainly acknowledge the role of Senator Chamarette in updating, or modifying, the way the cut-off motion works but initially it was an initiative of the Democrats and my Queensland predecessor Senator Michael Macklin back in the 1980s. Senator Brown is correct that the principle is basically a mechanism to ensure that there is proper scrutiny.
As is often said in relation to these motions—Senator Ray often puts it very well and is quite effective at explaining the rationale in relation to decisions such as these—the Senate quite regularly moves motions to exempt bills from the cut-off. Indeed, there is another motion following on from this to exempt 12 other bills from the cut-off, which the Democrats will be supporting. But the very fact that the government has moved a separate motion relating to this migration bill emphasises that it is a specific, controversial and special bill. Even without debating the content of it, which I am sure we will have an opportunity to do probably later on today, the process firstly needs to be made clear in terms of what is happening.
The Migration Legislation Amendment (Transitional Movement) Bill 2002 was introduced into the House of Representatives and the whole parliament only last Wednesday, so it has been in the public arena for less than seven days. Its provisions and what it attempts to do have certainly not been debated, flagged or foreshadowed by the government in any way, so it really is a measure that has come out of the blue. The bill was only introduced into this chamber this morning. There was an attempt last week to try and railroad the bill to and back from a Senate committee before people were even aware that it existed, and the government is now trying to push the bill through this week—today and tomorrow—without the opportunity for proper examination of it. 
It is no secret, and if people are not aware now they certainly soon will be, that I and the Democrats have great concerns about this bill. But more broadly, in the context of this motion, there is also a matter of some confusion about how the bill will operate in practice and what it will mean not just in the next couple of months but in the long term. If you are making dramatic changes, and this is another dramatic change to the legislation, the least you can do is have a proper look at it and make sure you know what you are doing to the processes and legal entitlements for asylum seekers and what the consequences will be.
I would have thought that the government, or at least the Labor Party, might have learned their lesson last year in the lead-up to the election when they allowed all those bills to go through without proper scrutiny. We actually had a bill debated in here and guillotined through while it was still before a legislation committee for examination—that was the absurdity of that situation. And we will have the same thing happen again if the Labor Party cooperates on a bill that has not been properly examined—one that again deals with modifying the so-called Pacific solution and that again deals with removing legal rights for asylum seekers—and allows it to be railroaded through without any proper opportunity to examine the consequences.
Let us forget about the principle for a moment; let us look at what is actually going to happen and what the consequences will be. Apart from what is contained in the bill that has just been introduced, the government is negotiating at the moment to put forward amendments to the bill. They have not been put forward yet; they were not circulated, as I understand it, when the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry introduced the bill. We are considering a motion to allow debate on this bill when none of us knows what the final version of the bill will be, because there are still very significant amendments to be brought forward that we have not seen yet which have potentially enormous consequences in the long term. Those amendments are still being finalised, and nobody knows what their wording is. Yet we are expected to allow that process to take place and to enable the Senate to pass that piece of legislation—legislation that is not even in its final form yet—by tomorrow.
It baffles me. Leaving aside the politics of it, the ideology and the different policy approaches, I cannot comprehend why the Labor Party is cooperating with this railroading by the government of yet another significant, major piece of migration amendment legislation that will again dramatically impact on the legal rights of asylum seekers. Surely, the least we could do is to have a proper look at it and actually get some feedback about what it is going to mean, not just from legal advocates in Australia but from an international perspective. It is an international issue. Apart from the impact that it will have on individual asylum seekers, it is going to have an international impact. 
Let it be emphasised that when Australia, as it has been doing, changes the way it deals with asylum seekers who arrive on its shores, those changes are noticed by the whole world. Because it is an issue that every country wrestles with as to how best to deal with it, when we make a significant, unprecedented change to the treatment of asylum seekers and to the legal processes for dealing with them, other countries look at that. They say, `That is what Australia is doing.' We are making these changes that will have international ramifications without even knowing what we are doing—and, quite frankly, we do not know what we are doing in relation to this legislation; none of us does. It does not matter whether you support the so-called Pacific solution and the government's approach; the least we can do as a chamber is to know what we are doing whilst we allow that to happen. 
This is a classic textbook case of why the cut-off provision exists and why standing order 111 exists: to prevent government from pushing legislation through without adequate scrutiny if it is felt to be sufficiently significant. As I said before, there are another 12 bills that the Democrats will not oppose being exempted from this standing order because they are simple bills, they are mechanical bills such as appropriation bills, they are ones that have already had adequate scrutiny, they have been foreshadowed for a while or they are ones that we think are not of sufficient importance to require greater scrutiny. 
Clearly, the Democrats' view—and I cannot understand why it is not other people's view—is that this migration bill does require greater scrutiny. I find it breathtaking that the Senate would even contemplate allowing such a major bill to be waved through with barely a chance to examine what is in it. I have grave concerns about what is in it, but I am quite happy also to acknowledge that I am not fully across all the detail of how it will work in practice. 
As I have said, there are amendments that have not even seen the light of day yet; I am fortunate enough to have some understanding of what they are likely to address. From that understanding, I know that they are amendments which propose a significant change to what the tasks of the Refugee Review Tribunal will be. There are issues in relation to both of those amendments, neither of which have appeared yet, that need to be properly examined. The operations of the Refugee Review Tribunal are regularly examined in detail by Senate estimates committees, which look at how it can operate more effectively. It has a big workload. We are not even able to examine what the amendments will mean just in terms of the mechanical operation of that tribunal. 
If we give it the extra responsibilities that are likely to occur with these amendments that have not appeared yet, there are basic machinery issues such as what it will mean for the workload of that tribunal. Will it need more staff? Will it need more money? Will it mean longer processing times? The exploration of those machinery matters is fundamental, let alone the policy aspects, although they are important as well. By supporting the government's motion, we will be opening up the ability of the government to prevent that scrutiny, to prevent those basic questions from being asked. When we get to the stage of considering the legislation, I will talk more broadly about the concerns that I have with that bill, and the counterproductive aspects for the government in relation to these sorts of approaches. 
As I was saying in regard to the previous motion, I have a lot of sympathy when Senator Ian Campbell, in his capacity as the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, expresses concern about the difficulty of being able to get all of the government's program through in the available time. The consequence of exempting bills like this from the cut-off and preventing proper scrutiny—preventing it from having decent consideration by a committee, preventing senators from being able to seek advice from experts in the field—is that the only avenue and forum available to us is in this chamber, in the Committee of the Whole, when the debate on the bill occurs, and we have to ask all of those questions of the minister in the chamber. It takes up an enormous amount of time to ask those questions that could be asked separately at committee hearings or by way of briefings, in private meetings or by seeking advice. You do not have the chance to do that, so you have to do it in the chamber, which means that it takes up an enormous amount of time.
The very idea that Senator Ian Campbell and government ministers put forward is undermined because, by doing this, it will mean that more Senate time will be chewed up on legislation than would otherwise happen. You are making it harder to get through all the business. There are any number of reasons why this is a particularly bad procedure that the government is trying to do and which, I assume, the Labor Party—they will speak for themselves shortly—will support. I cannot believe that nothing has been learnt. Let it be made clear again: this is a rerun of what happened in the week leading up to the last election when major migration legislation, making enormous changes that nobody knew the consequences of, including the government, was rammed through without examination or debate. It was guillotined and put in place. Yet that travesty of a process is now being compounded; straight after the election we are doing it again.
It is astonishing that, within a month of recommencing parliament, and after all the concerns that were raised about that disgraceful day in October when the package of bills were guillotined through the Senate, we are going to have the same thing again. I can tell you that it is almost definitely going to have to be the same thing again, because it is incumbent upon us, in terms of our responsibility as senators, to properly examine this bill. The Democrats will be taking that responsibility seriously. If we have no other mechanism, we will do it in this chamber on the floor because there are any number of questions which must be asked. It is not just a matter of us putting our views on the record; the Democrats will do that as well. Still to this day we have not had a proper opportunity to get the government fully on the record about how the bills passed last year will operate. I have a motion on the Notice Paper, which has been foreshadowed there for some time, about getting a Senate committee to examine the consequences of all those legislative changes last year. That still has not been done.
Forget about whether or not you support the policy. People have to work with the policy, whatever it is. People have to work within the law, and the hundreds of people who work around Australia trying to assist asylum seekers, people in the community and families are still wrestling with how this new process is working and what it is going to mean. We still do not know. The government do not even know. The government do not know what is going to happen on Manus Island or Nauru when those assessments are finished. This bill is being put through as yet another fall-back option for the government. If it falls over, the government will be able to bring people to Australia and detain them while they figure out, again, what they are going to do. It is compounding the travesty that occurred last year.
Without reflecting too much on the content of the bill which this motion relates to, purely from a procedural point of view, from a point of principle and our responsibilities, this is an appalling, counterproductive process. Again I say to the government that I quite genuinely believe we all have responsibility to be cooperative where possible in enabling proper consideration of business and enabling the government to get its program through. I believe the Democrats have not frustrated that process, despite our opposition to some measures, including very strong opposition to the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002. When this shonky process is engaged in, it makes it much more difficult to take a cooperative approach. Why should we be cooperative with the government getting through other measures when it foists this sort of rubbish on us? Why should we? If the government is going to treat the Senate with such contempt, why should the Senate not reciprocate in its attitude towards the government? It is a question that the government needs to consider because we do not operate in isolation; all of us operate as a group and try, despite our differing views in a policy sense, to enable issues to progress. It has to be a process that all of us undertake in a cooperative sense.
Obviously, the government has tabled reasons as to why this bill is urgent and needs to be pushed through this week. Quite frankly, the Democrats do not accept those reasons; they are not adequate. Clearly, this has been pushed through because the government does not want scrutiny of what it is doing and does not want a proper examination of what this legislation will mean. It is not an issue which has to happen now; it is not something that will not be able to be addressed in May when we come back.
It is worth making the point that, again, it is a problem of the government's own making. The government has provided a record low number of sitting days in the Senate, for decades, to consider legislation. It is the government's making that has meant that after this week we do not come back until 14 May; it is not the Democrats' and it is not the Labor Party's. This means we have a two-month gap before we can debate and pass legislation. Yet the government is expecting us, after giving us no time to debate legislation, to say, `Given that we haven't got any time to debate it, we'd better push it all through without looking at what we're doing.' It is a ridiculous and contemptible approach, one which the Democrats strongly oppose. It is undermining the role of the parliament, the whole purpose of the Senate and the fabric of our democratic system.
Perhaps it is not a surprise that the government are doing that. If you look at everything that has come to light in relation to the government in the last month or two, it is no surprise that they have a contemptible approach, but it is a surprise that the ALP may be willing to cooperate with that approach. You would think that, after the `children overboard' approach, the least we could do would be to properly examine this bill to establish whether whatever the government is telling us about this bill bears up. I do not think it does. The blatant fact is that the government, when it comes to refugee issues, will say, `Whatever it takes; we'll just make things up and cover up.' This bill goes to the heart of the whole policy that the `children overboard' issue was part of. I think the rationale they are using does not stack up. At least let us test it. We are not going to get that opportunity if we support this motion to exempt this bill from the cut-off. The Democrats strongly oppose the motion.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,3,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-03-20,"—The question before the chair is whether or not the Senate agrees to the cut-off motion applying to the Migration Legislation Amendment (Transitional Movement) Bill 2002—in other words, whether the Senate allows this bill to be debated before the end of the current sittings of the parliament this week. That is what we are talking about: whether the Migration Legislation Amendment (Transitional Movement) Bill be debated before the recess, before parliament resumes in the middle of May.
The principle that should always be applied to these questions when they are before the Senate is: if there is genuine urgency. The minister has outlined the reasons for urgency: because the bill is an integral part of the government strategy to preserve the integrity of Australia's borders and the migration and humanitarian programs. The minister goes on to say that the amendments deal with matters that are urgent as some of these non-citizens may be required to enter Australia in exceptional circumstances including to receive urgent medical treatment or to provide evidence in people-smuggling prosecution. Those are the reasons for urgency that were circulated by the authority of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Mr Ruddock. This debate determines whether we bring the bill on for debate this week in the Senate.
It is true that the opposition has accepted the need for urgent passage of this bill. As we understand the situation, this bill is designed to cope with contingencies that are likely to occur before the parliament resumes in May. That is why we are going to agree with the cut-off motion and allow the Senate to debate it before the middle of May. We accept that the government has the right to put before the parliament its proposed solutions for those contingencies. We accept, given the time frames, that the bill cannot wait. That does not mean that this bill should not have adequate examination. That is a very different issue. Timing is one point; appropriate parliamentary scrutiny is another point. I am afraid that on this particular occasion I have to say that the Democrats' own behaviour, particularly the performance of Senator Bartlett, has meant that the level of parliamentary scrutiny that the opposition would have liked to have seen applied to this bill will not occur.
—The truth of the matter is that last week, when a scrutiny of bills report was brought before this chamber, it was Senator Bartlett on behalf of the Australian Democrats who refused leave to allow that report to be brought before the parliament and its recommendations agreed to. That meant that the recommendation to refer the Migration Legislation Amendment (Transitional Movement) Bill to a Senate committee could not be put, could not be agreed to, and the committee hearing could not take place. In my view, that is a disgrace.
—I am not going to be lectured, and nor should the Senate be lectured, by Senator Bartlett on this matter, because we did need to have a Senate legislation committee look at this bill. It would have been worth while. It would have been a useful contribution. It would have added to the level of scrutiny on this particular bill. It would have assisted the public debate. It would have assisted the parliamentary consideration of this particular bill, but it was spiked by the Australian Democrats. The record stands on this. It is unfortunate that as a result of Senator Bartlett's deliberate decision to stop a parliamentary committee inquiring into and reporting on this bill—as a result of Senator Bartlett's own actions—that will not take place.
Nevertheless, the principle that should apply to bills when you consider the cut-off motion, whether you debate a bill in a particular parliamentary sittings period, does not change just because of dog-in-the-mangerish behaviour from certain senators. The opposition is consistent in the way it looks at these issues: that is, if the issue is urgent, if the bill might have application to a period of time when the parliament is not sitting—in other words, if the contingencies that it deals with may well occur before the Senate sits again—then we believe the principle should apply that the Senate agree to consider the bill.
In this case, as a result of Senator Bartlett's efforts, a parliamentary committee cannot consider the bill because of what the Australian Democrats have done. That is the unfortunate situation, but we deal with the circumstances as they arise. We deal with bills—as Senator Bartlett and Senator Brown have correctly said—on a case by case basis. That is the way one should apply the provisions of this standing order. It is certainly the approach that the opposition takes. 
Some of the other criticisms that are made by the senators on the crossbenches are fair criticisms. There is a very inadequate number of sitting days; that is true. There are very few opportunities in terms of the sitting pattern for the Senate to consider the extraordinary amount of legislation before it. That has meant that in some areas with important legislation there have had to be committee references. Senate legislation committees have a very significant amount of work to do, but the relevant committee does not have any work to do on this bill because it was stopped from providing that level of scrutiny. 
There is no point beating around the bush on this—they are the facts of the matter. The fact is that the Democrats stymied committee consideration of this bill. The opposition wanted to see that committee consideration. Some will argue that it would not have been adequate and we could have had a longer period for committee hearings. Maybe that is true—one can always extend a committee hearing—but we believe, given the record of the relevant legislation committee, that it would have benefited the Senate's debate in committee and the public interest if we had allowed that level of scrutiny. We are sorry that could not take place, but let the responsibility for that lie where it should, with the Australian Democrats. Let the responsibility for the sitting timetable, the pattern of sittings in the Senate, and the inadequate amount of time that the government has allowed for parliamentary sittings lie where it should, with the government. 
—You supported it. Why is it their responsibility? 
—You really do not understand how this works, Senator Bartlett. It is the government that brings down a sittings program, not the opposition. You say that we are all obligated to work within those constraints. You are absolutely right on that point. We are aware of that. We are aware of those constraints. We are aware of the urgent legislation we have to deal with. The opposition has to take a responsible and consistent approach to dealing with legislation that comes before the chamber. We have done so in the past and we do so on this occasion. 
In other words, because the Democrats have stymied the opportunity of this bill going to a parliamentary committee and because of its urgency—the bill is designed and written to deal with contingencies that are very likely to occur before the parliament resumes in May—we say that parliamentary consideration by the Senate of this bill is appropriate in this sittings period of the Senate. It is on that basis that we agree to support the cut-off motion, consistent with the approach that the Australian Labor Party has taken both in government and opposition.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-03-20,"—Lest the listeners—if there are any—to this debate consider that on these issues relating to immigration, refugees and the like Senator Bartlett does not do his homework, I want to put the record straight. I do not suggest that Senator Faulkner has so reflected upon Senator Bartlett in respect of that matter—
—I did not suggest he didn't do his homework; I am talking about the process issue. I don't know whether he does his homework or not. 
—Lest anyone gets that impression, that is not correct. He has a very strong record in regard to this matter. He is one who does his homework, examines the matters on their merits, makes his decision and ensures that it goes through his party. Senator Vicky Bourne, with me and others, did the hard yards and went through the detention centres and examined them. That committee made its recommendations to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and its report was presented in this parliament. 
Senator Vicki Bourne and I added an addendum to that particular report, and had that recommendation contained in the addendum by Senator Bourne and me been adopted we would not have been seeing some of the problems that we see now in that particular area. But I believe that on this occasion, with all the best will in the world, the fact that the Migration Legislation Amendment (Transitional Movement) Bill 2002 was not sent to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee is a disappointment. I am not going to reflect on what happened then, but the fact of the matter is that it was not referred and so we are now in this situation. 
I have read and had regard to the reasons the government has given and which were incorporated into Hansard yesterday. I have also had a look at the second reading speech of the minister. I have to consider whether this is really an urgent bill and whether our opposition to the cut-off motion moved by Senator Troeth is likely to adversely impact on asylum seekers. One has to consider those matters and, if they are correct, it would be unjust, in my view, to not enable the legislation to be considered and properly amended before we get up. What are the situations which could adversely affect the health and wellbeing of asylum seekers? The amendments in the bill deal with:
... matters that are urgent, as some of these non-citizens may be required to enter Australia in exceptional circumstances, including to receive urgent medical treatment or to provide evidence in people smuggling prosecutions.
I have had to consider that carefully and, though I am regularly against the cut-off motions that sometimes come into this chamber, on this occasion, for the reason that some of the asylum seekers may be disadvantaged if certain parts of the legislation are not passed by this parliament before the end of this week and continue to be disadvantaged until we sit again in mid-April—
—In May.
—Mid-May. Thank you, Senator Sherry. For those reasons I will be supporting the cut-off motion. But let me say very clearly that when considering the bills the Senate will be even more entitled to excise those parts of the legislation which do not fall within the urgency reasons that have been put forward by the government. Let me make it clear to the government that I believe that the legislation should be examined, and let them not be surprised if the arguments are raised in accordance with their own arguments—in other words, whether this is urgent. Is it urgent to get through this legislation so that some of the asylum seekers may be able to enter Australia for urgent medical reasons, to receive urgent medical treatment, or to provide evidence in people-smuggling prosecutions? Okay, when the bill is being debated, let the government say, `Yes, we will agree to stick by the reasons that we gave for the cut-off motion, and if you want to amend those areas and excise those areas that do not relate to those matters then so be it.'",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,3,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2002-03-20,"—In closing the debate, the government believes that the Migration Legislation Amendment (Transitional Movement) Bill 2002 is an important part of its comprehensive measures to address the ongoing people-smuggling problem. These measures have given effect to the government's determination that unauthorised boat arrivals should not be allowed to reach the Australian mainland, instead being placed in declared countries where their claims, if any, to asylum can be assessed. It is important that this bill be allowed to proceed through the Senate as it provides the ability for the government to manage the orderly transition of people from declared countries into Australia under exceptional circumstances. By attempting to undermine the government strategy in those matters, the Australian Democrats will succeed only in undermining the government's efforts to discourage people-smuggling. I welcome the support of the opposition and Senator Harradine for this bill to be brought to urgent consideration in this place and I remain disappointed that the Democrats continue to attempt to frustrate due consideration of this bill. Other honourable senators have referred to the fact that this bill has not been allowed to go to a Senate committee where members of the community can have input into it. That is a matter of regret, but that was a Democrat tactic and they have to live with that consequence.
The government is anxious to have this bill dealt with for some of the reasons outlined. Senator Harradine read some of the reasons, which includes allowing these asylum seekers and non-citizens to receive urgent medical treatment or provide evidence in people-smuggling prosecutions. I would have thought that that was clearly a matter of interest both for the asylum seekers themselves to be able to access that urgent medical treatment and also for Australia to be able to prosecute people smugglers. I would have thought that on those two grounds alone the Australian Democrats would have been supportive of the urgency of this bill.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-03-20,"—I think it is appropriate to speak to this briefly, given the debate we have just had, to put the whole thing in context. I will not speak for long, despite accusations that may be made to the contrary. The Democrats are not simply wanting to waste time but I think the principle about what we are doing needs to go on the record. As we have just had with the previous issue—this is the same standing order that applies—these are 12 other bills that the government believes need to be debated in this session for a variety of reasons. The reason I speak to this—the Democrats are supporting this one, to emphasise that we are not trying to frustrate the government's legislative process and program—is that there is a difference between these bills and the others. These are a range of appropriation bills that are obviously needed to fund government programs, and therefore it is appropriate that they may be passed—although, ironically, included in that is extra money for the Pacific solution that the Democrats strongly oppose. 
The legislation includes a financial corporations bill that contains an amendment that was introduced in August last year, so it has been around for a lot of time, and a quarantine amendment bill that enables the introduction of national emergency measures in relation to animal health. There is also the baby bonus bill that was flagged during the election campaign, and a bill for tax laws relating to measures that were announced in October last year that have been around for that period of time. There are also therapeutic goods amendments that relate to bioterrorist activities, stemming obviously since September 11 and other therapeutic goods amendments that link back to the 1998 mutual recognition agreement, and a couple of the veterans bills which also relate to budget measures and other aspects announced during the election campaign. So there is a range of things that have all been foreshadowed in some way or other for some period of time or are standard administrative appropriation bills. 
Let us compare that to the migration bill which was not foreshadowed at all, was only introduced on Wednesday of last week and is still not in its final form. I think the record has to be corrected in terms of the statements that are being made by the government and the opposition that somehow the Democrats prevented scrutiny of that bill by committee. What we prevented was a complete farce from occurring which would have not meant any examination of it. As I said, the bill that would have gone to the committee is not even the bill that this Senate will be addressing because there will be a couple of very major amendments that still have not seen the light of day, that the committee would not even have been aware of let alone able to examine and of course there would have been no opportunity for public input at all.
I also think that—again, looking at the reasons for urgency that are given—that is what the Senate has to consider. When the government wants to exempt bills from the cut-off they put forward reasons for urgency. The reasons put forward for these 12 bills are quite appropriate. The reasons given for the migration bill, like lots of things that this government says in relation to refugee issues, are simply a complete fabrication and a farce. People are already coming here for medical treatment. That has happened already. The evidence for people-smuggling trials is not going to occur until later in the year. There is no need for that to go through this week to enable those things happening and, as with so many other things in the refugee area, the public line the government puts is just a fabrication to cover up their real agenda. Again, I think the Democrats will cooperate with proper processes in this place and we will not frustrate the activities of the government in terms of their program but we certainly will not just sit back and let them get away with those sorts of fabrications and falsehoods about their rationale and their agenda. 
The government's record on refugee issues has been highlighted, since the election, as being built upon a myriad fabrications, distortions and falsehoods. The `children overboard' situation is, of course, a classic—but not the only, sadly—example of that. I think it is worth drawing to the Senate's attention that any time anything to do with refugees come up the alarm bells, in terms of detecting distortions, need to go off very quickly. The government's record in this area is so poor that you almost have to assume that, until we can demonstrate to the contrary, whatever rationale they use is yet another piece of fabrication and cover-up. That highlights again why we need to have proper scrutiny in those areas as opposed to the bills covered under these motions that have been around for a while and provide the opportunity for them to be passed more quickly if the government believes that is necessary. So the Democrats will be supporting this motion and I think, in speaking to it, it is simply appropriate to put on the record the vast distinction between these bills and the motion we have just passed exempting the migration bill from the cut-off.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,4,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2002-03-20,"—I just want to intervene briefly to congratulate the government, albeit reluctantly, on what is not in this motion—and that is, the five security bills that have now gone off to a legislation committee for some mature consideration over the next recess. The problem with those five bills is not that there may be anything objectionable in them but that the opposition basically got its copies of the five bills last Tuesday at 7.30 p.m. To process all five bills before they were considered at 12 o'clock the next day in the House of Representatives meant that we had to read them—60 pages of complex legislation, 60 pages of complex explanatory memorandum—and have them considered by our policy committee at 10 o'clock that night and reported to caucus at 9 o'clock the next morning.
The view then being indicated to us by the government was that these bills were required to be passed through the House of Representatives that Wednesday and sent to this particular chamber and passed by tomorrow. Then, when we did not immediately sign up to that, we were accused of stonewalling or not being fair dinkum on some of these issues. I challenge anyone on the government side, no matter how bright they are, to sit down and absorb 60 pages of complex legislation across five bills and try to work out whether, in fact, every clause is okay. When you read some of this legislation, not only is it complex but also there is a wish list by departments to get things up that they have been trying to get up for 20 or 30 years.
However, to its credit—and I have to acknowledge this—the government has eventually said, no, this chamber will not consider those five bills, and they will go off for what I hope is the proper purpose of a legislative committee: not a circus of witnesses coming along, but the minister and department officials going through the legislation clause by clause, sorting it out. Then, when it comes back into this chamber in what I think will be June this year, we will not need a long and convoluted committee stage; we will only be able to target those areas that require either amendment or further elucidation by the government.
In conclusion, I am not sure how many bills have now been exempted from the cut-off that has been given to this government; it is in the region of 400. The amount that has been refused in that time I think is probably less than 10. That just raises the question: does the cut-off motion have any useful purpose? Today probably proves it has because a minority group in the Senate wanted to make points and, I suppose, it enabled that group to make those points today. But for a lot of the designers of the cut-off resolution in the mid-1990s, especially the absolute zealots in the now government who thought the cut-off motion was the best thing since sliced bread, basically it is a waste of time, although occasionally it might have its uses. Maybe the Procedure Committee should look at eliminating it as a feature of the Senate.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,4,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-20,"—I think Senator Ray might just have argued against himself—
—I might have, yes.
—by saying that a suite of five bills, which otherwise potentially would have been pushed onto the Senate, has been set aside for much better consideration because the weapon of the cut-off bill is sitting there.
—I don't think that was the reason, but anyway—
—I am fleshing it out a bit, Senator. Anyway, the Senate does need to defend itself against government pushing through legislation that cannot be considered adequately, and the cut-off is there to enable the Senate to do just that. That is wrong by the community. When legislation brought in here overnight has to be considered, and when there is a lot at stake, the community needs time to consider it. The parliament operates on behalf of the community; it is not just for parliamentarians and parties. Indeed, the community comes first. When the government presents legislation, the community has the right to view it, to feed its considered opinion back to its representatives and then to have its representatives put that case on the floor of the Senate. That cannot be done if legislation is brought in here overnight—or even over a week. We get complicated legislation, and people need to be able to consider it.
There are occasions when, to meet unforeseen circumstances, everything has to go on fast forward. But too often that is not the case. It is just a convenience for the government to push through legislation, which very often has taken it months and months to define. For the government to put it through the parliament within a matter of days or weeks is not a satisfactory process. I have a clear example of that hidden in amongst this list of 12 bills, and it is the seventh on the list. Innocuously enough, it is the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002. Mr Acting Deputy President, I am sure you will have picked up the fact that this applies to plantations. It gives tax exemptions to plantations of trees around the country, and with that comes the reality that plantations are very often put in place of native vegetation and native forests. In other words, the native forests are cut down and woodchipped so that the plantations can be put in with great tax incentives. What does it mean if this law goes through? For the taxpayers of Australia it means that an exemption—of $25 million, according to the government; but, on the assessment of my office, some $90 million—will go to the plantations industry at the expense of the taxpayers.
Just yesterday a State of the environment report was tabled in this chamber, which shows that the government—and, indeed, the Tasmanian government—has a record of failure when it comes to protecting native vegetation cover in the country. One of the worst environmental indices—and it is rapidly deteriorating—is the loss of native vegetation cover, ecosystems, gene pools and potentially very many species because of this rapid destruction of woodlands and forests in Australia. This relates to woodlands particularly in Queensland, but at an even greater percentage rate to the destruction of thousands of hectares of native forests in Tasmania for the woodchip industry. What happens when those forests are displaced? Plantations go in. This legislation will foster that process when, just yesterday, the government itself tabled a damning report saying, `This is out of control; it needs to be brought back into control.' Here we have legislation which says, `Well, put your foot on the accelerator,' when the report says, `Put the foot on the brake'—and the government wants to exempt that from the cut-off. Where is the environmental impact assessment?
I can foreshadow that there will be debate on that matter. I will be moving to amend the legislation, and I hope that the opposition will be supporting it. In the wake of the report we got yesterday, it is entirely reasonable that the environmental impact of this legislation, which is very big, be known to this chamber before it votes for it. This is a classic case of where the cut-off should not be allowed, because there has not been due consideration. Certainly there is no opportunity for due consideration of the matter by the community, so I will not be supporting this motion. I may be the only one in here, but I will not support this motion when it provides for legislation such as this to be railroaded through this place without due consideration.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,4,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-03-20,"—The opposition will be supporting the cut-off in relation to the bills listed in the motion by the Special Minister for State. The Senate should understand that the list includes three appropriation bills which are necessary to be passed this week for the ordinary funds of this government. The legislative program put down for this week needs to be progressed. Exempting these bills from the cut-off is to allow for the presentation of these bills to the Senate so that the Senate can consider them. It is also worth considering that, of the bills that are before us in this cut-off motion, five of them are scheduled as non-controversial legislation to be considered later on on Thursday. They have been around for some time—as I suspect Robert Ray has said—and have had substantive consideration, so they should not come as a surprise. Two of them, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 and the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, are also scheduled for debate later in the week. The government has proposed to present them to the Senate for consideration, and they will obviously be debated. Senator Brown has foreshadowed that there will be substantive debate on at least one, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, as is his right. We will obviously contribute to that debate at the appropriate time. Therefore, from our perspective, the principle in determining the exemption from the cut-off remains. These are bills that require consideration before the end of the sitting. They are bills that need to pass, that need to be presented to the parliament, and, as a consequence, we will be supporting the motion.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,4,1,speech

To do otherwise could jeopardise the interests of some taxpayers, and I do not want to be held responsible for that. Like Senator Ray, I would like to congratulate the government for some legislation that is not mentioned here, including any legislation that might be around the place in respect of cross-media ownership. It would not have been a wise thing for the government to bring that into the House and then bump it up here and expect that we would agree to a cut-off.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2002-03-20,"—The debate on this motion to exempt certain bills from the cut-off has been quite interesting. The Democrats used their time to try to explain and justify the unjustifiable in relation to a previous vote. Senators Ray and Harradine have used the opportunity to thank the government for something which was not in the motion. Senator Brown used the opportunity to speak and try to assert things that were not true. As we have come to expect from Senator Brown, no matter what the topic he will wangle in the issue of woodchips. We all know—especially those of us from Tasmania—that our forests are not harvested for woodchips but for sawlogs and veneers, and it makes good sense to use the by-product rather than burning it or simply letting it rot on the ground. Having said that, I appreciate the cooperation of the Senate and look forward to the vote.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,4,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2002-03-20,"—As I understand it, on behalf of the government I am now summing up the debate on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 2002. In doing so, I want to thank honourable senators for their contributions during the second reading debate. The bill amends the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act, which authorised establishment assistance funding for the 2001-04 funding period. Establishment grants have been provided to assist new non-government schools with costs incurred in their formative years and to enable them to be more competitive with existing schools.
This bill aims to provide the necessary appropriation to enable payment of establishment grants. The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 2000 clearly establishes an entitlement to establishment grant funding for new non-government schools. I hasten to add that these new non-government schools are schools that have been registered and accepted by the various state governments around the country as having achieved appropriate standards, deeming them appropriate for registration. The bill effectively codifies the eligibility and entitlement for each new school to these grants. There is no change to the existing entitlements of schools. The funding mechanism has been altered to a standing appropriation consistent with the general recurrent grants program arrangements. This reduces the likelihood of budgetary shortfalls arising simply as a result of difficulty in precisely forecasting, several years out, the numbers of new schools and their student enrolments.
A number of amendments have been proposed and the Greens have now circulated some amendments as well. This is very much an ideological debate by those that are opposed to this government. I say on behalf of the government that we support a dual system of education in this country: both a viable state education sector and a viable non-government sector. Indeed, the non-government sector has been used by the current Leader of the Opposition for his children; by his predecessor, Mr Beazley; by his predecessor, Mr Keating; and by his predecessor, Mr Hawke. So it seems that the use of non-government schooling for children is okay for the Labor elite who happen to hold good parliamentary jobs and are able to afford it, but are we going to afford the same sort of option to the truck driver who is not on a parliamentary salary and who might want to exercise the choice that was exercised by the four Labor leaders that I have just mentioned?
We also know from previous debates that the Democrats have a very strong view against these non-government schools and in fact have vilified them. I refer to a debate that took place on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill in 1996. In that debate the Democrats made a contribution which said:
Apart from a government ideologically bound to private education, who else came forward to support this bill? The Coordinating Committee of Jewish Day Schools 
Then we were given a list:
the Australian Association of Christian Schools, the Anglican Schools Commission, the Christian parents controlled schools and the Lutheran schools. These groups support the bill 
Later on in the Australian Democrat contribution we as a government were told:
If you want to go down in history as being part of a government which places the interests of small, fundamentalist and extreme schools at the expense of Australia's public schooling system, then by all means vote for this bill.
If those sorts of vilifying and inappropriate comments were made about any other community group within our society, the headlines would have been quite stark and I am sure there would have been calls for the resignation of certain people, but it seems to be okay to denigrate Jewish schools—anything to do with the Judaeo-Christian ethic seems to be okay to denigrate.
We on the government side say that these schools have a right to exist. These people have made a contribution to society and they have a right to exercise choice in education for their children. It is interesting that some of the schools that are currently waiting for funding and waiting for this legislation to come through are part of a diverse group and include the Australian Islamic College in the marginal Labor seat of Swan. I hope Mr Wilkie, the member for Swan, explains to his electorate why he and the Labor Party are trying to withhold funds. Indeed, within that same electorate of Swan there is the Woodthorpe Drive Secondary School, and in my home state of Tasmania there is the Peregrine School in the electorate of Franklin and Trinity College in the electorate of Lyons—all have been denied funds.
Most revealing of all has been the frantic phone call from Ben from Bentleigh. Somebody rang up the office of Dr Nelson, the Minister for Education, Science and Training, just the other day and made some very strong representations about the Chabad Jewish day school—one of these nasty Jewish day schools, as the Democrats refer to them, or `extreme' day schools. They were very concerned that moneys that they had been promised had not been delivered. Ben from Bentleigh happens to be an electorate officer who works for the federal Labor member for—you guessed it—Hotham, the Leader of the Opposition. Ben from his office phoned to inquire why the school was still having to wait for its extra $6,000.
To these small schools, $6,000 goes a long way, but this stark example shows how mean spirited the opposition to this legislation is. That $6,000 for this Jewish day school would make such a big difference and because it would make such a big difference a genuine electorate officer in Mr Simon Crean's office was prepared to make very strong representations to Dr Nelson asking that this money be made available. Unfortunately, he was oblivious to the fact that the reason the money was not being made available was that the federal member for Hotham was deliberately ensuring that this legislation would not get through and therefore the funding for which the electorate officer was asking would not be forthcoming because of the federal member's deliberate actions.
It is very interesting that the Labor opposition moved a number of amendments to the bill. When the bill was first introduced it was referred to a Senate committee, and the Labor Party voted for these principles some 15 months ago—on 7 December 2000, I think, when it got carried. Now, 15 months later, they are voting against these same principles. What has changed? I suppose the change has been that we now have the federal member for Hotham as the leader of the Australian Labor Party. The ex-ACTU boss is giving Australians a taste of what a Labor government would do in relation to diversity and educational choice for parents—the sort of choice he exercised himself and, might I add, was able to afford with or without government assistance but which the vast majority of Australians could not afford without government assistance.
The Labor amendments are going to add layers of administration and complexity to what is a very simple payment formula. By seeking to prescribe the criteria for what the Labor Party believes is a new school, over and above what is already in the States Grants Act and the administrative guidelines, Labor has shown that it cannot let go of its old discredited and unfair new schools policy. I note that the Australian Democrats are suggesting by their amendments that we go back to that discredited policy. Under the Labor amendments, only six of the 58 schools that are currently waiting for funding and that this bill will assist would retain eligibility for the current legislative entitlement of $750 per student. That just shows how these amendments will gut these proposals, and it shows the mean spiritedness of the amendments and of the Labor Party's attitude to these small new schools that, I submit to the Senate, have the right to exist and the right to government support, on the basis that all the state Labor governments around the country have approved these schools for registration. There is nothing wrong with these schools. They have met all the educational and other standards required of them by the state Labor governments all around Australia, but the federal Labor Party is saying, `We have this ideological hatred of private schooling and, therefore, we will not allow the funding to go through.'
We have Australian Democrat amendments as well, and the first amendment proposed deals with physical and emotional wellbeing in our schools. I think that is a very substantive issue and a very relevant and important one; but, as the Australian Democrats know, that is being discussed at a ministerial meeting shortly and, as the states have prime responsibility for state education, it is appropriate that any action taken by the federal government in this area be in consultation with the state governments. Dr Nelson has committed himself to undertaking that contact and communication with the state government schools, and indeed with the representative organisations of the non-government schools, to see if a uniform approach can be adopted. We do not dismiss the Democrats' general philosophy or rationale in this. We just say that it is a bit too early; let us work out a strategy with all the states and then move forward together. I have already mentioned that the Democrats' other amendment would return to the old new schools policy.
Some comments have been made about state government education, and those comments ignore the fact that an extra $238 million was provided for government schools in the 2001 budget. Of the specific schools budget measures in the 2001 budget, 87 per cent of the funding was directed to the 69 per cent of students in the government sector. On a proportionate basis, this is $50 million more than government schools could expect on the basis of their enrolments and $20 million more than Senator Allison is seeking in her amendment. Of course, above and beyond that, the states are now absolutely rolling in GST money. The Labor state premiers say, `Terrible thing, this GST,' but they grab every single last cent of it. All the money from the GST goes to the states. They are now so rolling in GST money that the state governments, if they are so inclined, can spend a lot more money on state education. The proof of that is, of course, the Queensland Labor Premier Mr Beattie announcing a $60 million package for state education, which he linked back to the GST funding his state has received. That puts the lie to other Labor premiers, such as Jim Bacon in my own home state of Tasmania who says that somehow the GST has hurt Tasmania. In fact, all the states are getting more money. Various states are using their money for different purposes. The Labor Premier of Queensland, Mr Beattie, is spending it on education; Mr Carr, the Labor Premier of New South Wales, says he can use it to cut payroll tax. You have some Labor premiers at least honest enough to say that the GST money is rolling in. 
The state governments have to make their decisions and determine their own priorities and they cannot then pass the buck. At the end of the day, state government schools are called that because they are a state government responsibility. As a federal government, we contribute. We assist them, and we have now assisted them even further with the new tax regime and the GST moneys that will flow to the states. As a government, we would be willing to look at a review of the program and its operation: one would expect that of a government that is dynamic and continually seeking to improve public administration—education funding is no exception in that regard. But any review that we would undertake would be in the terms of the next quadrennium.
In summary, I urge the Senate to pass this bill unamended. The 58 schools awaiting their full entitlements, many of which serve poor communities, have waited far too long for their payments. Labor are punishing the students and families of these schools for no apparent reason other than for their own ideological indulgence. There is a very stark list which outlines how Labor members have let schools down. The federal Labor member for Swan has let down two schools in his electorate, the federal member for Franklin has let down the Peregrine school, the federal Labor member for Lyons has let down Trinity College, the federal member for Hotham is letting down the Bentleigh Chabad Jewish Day School, and the list goes on. These 58 schools are all around Australia. 
Why were these schools started? Because the mums and dads of the kids believed the sort of education these schools offer was the best for their children. Are honourable senators going to vote and deny parents the right to that choice or provide some assistance in the exercising of that choice? I especially appeal to Labor senators because they have now had a continuum of federal Labor leaders—the last four—who have all, on their substantial parliamentary salaries, exercised the option of private education. But they somehow do not want the truck driver or those on social welfare benefits to exercise that same option for their children. We strongly believe that a private education or non-government education should be not only the domain of the wealthy but also, to be a real choice for parents, an affordable and exercisable choice.
In the closing moments of this second reading debate, I will just say this. I still recall how, as a lawyer dealing with unfortunate family breakdowns, I often saw a situation where a mum—usually it was a mum—did some part-time work for no other reason than so that the family could afford the school fees, because they thought the best start in life they could provide for their children was an education. So mum and dad had agreed to make a sacrifice to look after their kids and provide them with an education. These mums and dads all around Australia are urging the Senate to pass this legislation. There are 58 new schools awaiting funding—even one in the Leader of the Opposition's own electorate, which he is denying funding to. Unwittingly, his own office was so convinced of the urgency and need for the money that the electorate officer rang the federal minister for education for the money. How embarrassing! How humiliating for the Leader of the Opposition! It would be a good opportunity now, on the strength of Ben's representations to Dr Nelson, for Mr Crean and the Labor Party to alter their attitude to this bill and to pass it.

"Senator FERGUSON,",LP,2002-03-20,"—It gives me a great deal of pleasure to speak today, a day when our Prime Minister in London has been able to get the agreement of both the President of South Africa, Mr Mbeki, and the President of Nigeria, Mr Obasanjo, to suspend Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth of Nations. I had the good fortune to be invited by the Commonwealth to be an independent observer at the most recent elections in Zimbabwe. It is the second time I have observed elections there, having led an Australian delegation in the year 2000 to observe what were then the parliamentary elections when, for the first time in over 20 years, a significant opposition party was able to present itself to the elections. 
The deterioration of human rights in Zimbabwe, since the year 2000 when I was last there, has been alarming. Violence and intimidation were widespread. We have had reports over the past 18 months of this violence and intimidation, but to see it first-hand was an experience that I will not forget. I will give one example. At midnight on 2 March, just outside Guruve, a very small town in the far north of Zimbabwe near the Zambia-Mozambique border, where I spent most of my time, some brave person had the nerve to paint a `Movement for Democratic Change', an MDC slogan, on the road. Following that, a local gang of ZANU-PF paramilitary youths moved into a village on the outskirts of the town and abducted eight young men they decided were responsible for this terrible travesty. They were taken by truck to a base camp, blindfolded and systematically beaten and brutalised. I made contact with three of these men in a safe house in Harare. They relayed to me first-hand the shocking details of the ordeal that they were put through. What really amazed me was that this was on the Wednesday prior to the elections. On the Friday, two days later, one young man was determined to return to Guruve to act as a polling agent for the opposition at the election. 
The images that I have brought home from my two weeks in Zimbabwe as a member of that Commonwealth observer group will continue to haunt me. My time was spent largely in the two constituencies in the Zambesi Valley and on the escarpment near the border with Zambia and Mozambique. I spoke to participants in the election process from all sides of the political spectrum and I observed polling at many polling stations in the region, as well as observing the process of counting the ballots. The criteria of free and fair elections were breached in every possible way. The three basic tenets of a democratic election process are freedom from violence; freedom of movement and association; and freedom of expression. On each of these counts, in the 2002 presidential elections in Zimbabwe, it failed. In the northernmost constituencies that I covered, no campaigning by the opposition was allowed, no opposition rallies were permitted and no information other than the government controlled propaganda was available. It was therefore of little surprise to me that President Mugabe polled more than 85 per cent of the vote throughout the region. 
There are numerous accounts of violence in Zimbabwe. I will quote just a couple more. On 18 February, in the full view of the advance team of the Commonwealth's observers, a group of about 1,000 ZANU-PF youths armed with clubs ran amok through the central business district of Harare, attacking MDC officers and supporters. On 22 February, a group of 200 youths armed with stones and clubs attacked the MDC officers in Kwekwe in the Midlands while members of the South African observer team were having a meeting with local MDC officials. Members of our team met numerous victims of politically motivated violence. Many had bruises, scars and axe wounds all over their bodies. One victim that was observed had the letters MDC carved in his back with a sharp knife. Another victim was chained alive in a coffin and immersed in water and threatened with drowning while being repeatedly interrogated about the identities of local MDC operatives. Members of our team in the Midlands met a woman who had been gang-raped by ZANU-PF youths because she was the sister of an MDC member. Members of our team were particularly disturbed by the number of politically motivated murders—I think there have been estimates of up to 150 people in the last 18 months—especially of MDC activists and supporters. 
Numerous complaints were made to members of our group about the activities of a paramilitary youth group trained by the government under what is superficially known as the national youth training program. This national youth training program trained people in torture. Members of this group appear to have replaced the so-called war veterans as the leading perpetrators of politically motivated violence, intimidation and abduction during this campaign, especially in the rural areas. Our observers met dozens of victims of this group and saw enough other direct evidence of their activities to be seriously concerned. Members of the youth group appeared to operate mostly at night and in uniform. Its members set up illegal roadblocks and intimidated opposition supporters, confiscating national identity cards of known or suspected MDC supporters which they needed in order to vote, and forced many from their homes and areas of residence. They are but a few examples of the many that were put by our group in our debriefings, which took over six hours, of the 60 members of the Commonwealth observer groups. 
I fear for the short-term future of Zimbabwe and its people. This beautiful and proud country that was once the breadbasket of Africa is rapidly becoming a basket case. As a direct consequence of the takeover and settlement of white owned farms under President Mugabe, Zimbabwe has gone from being a food-exporting nation to being one which is currently importing staple produce. The rule of law is almost non-existent. State sponsored violence is the order of the day. The economy is in absolute tatters, with unemployment at 60 per cent and no separation of powers or effective application of the rule of law. The official exchange rate is currently 56 Zimbabwe dollars to $US1 when at the time of Mugabe's assent to power in 1980 one Zimbabwe dollar bought $US1.48c. Although the official rate was 56 Zimbabwe dollars to $US1, we were able to buy 300 Zimbabwe dollars to $US1 from a change bureau just around the corner from our hotel.
Against this background, I have never met so many brave people, both black and white, who are determined to fight for their democratic rights against such terrible odds. The two weeks I spent in Zimbabwe have had a profound effect on me, and I hope the spirit of these brave people and their drive for democratic government is not diminished by this electoral experience and that Zimbabwe can regain the prominent position it held in southern Africa 20 years ago.
I was fortunate to be on this delegation with Julie Bishop, Kevin Rudd and Bill Gray, an ex-electoral commissioner. By way of explanation, I want to make some comments about an article written by Laurie Oakes in the Bulletin this week in which he puts a point of view which refers to both me and to the member for Curtin, Julie Bishop, and in doing so he uses information totally supplied to him by the shadow minister, Mr Kevin Rudd. I preface that by saying that I do not believe that a Commonwealth observer mission of any sort is the place for either a minister or a shadow minister in any government or parliament throughout the Commonwealth. Ministers and shadow ministers have policy decisions to make. Sometimes those are made before, pre-empting any announcements that might be made in the future. In this case, the Labor Party's shadow foreign minister called for sanctions on Zimbabwe in January and then at a later stage asked to become a member of the Commonwealth observer group. Of course, in the newspaper controlled by the government in Zimbabwe, it was written up in very bold print that the Australians were sending an observer who had already called for sanctions and how impartial would his observations be. We were invited as independent people to be part of the Commonwealth observers group. What really disturbs me about Laurie Oakes's article is that he never rang me or Julie Bishop to confirm whether any of the things that were said in letters written by Mr Rudd were true.
Julie Bishop was in Zimbabwe for three weeks, I was there for two weeks and Kevin Rudd was the last to arrive and had planned to be the first to leave, on the Monday before the count had even taken place. He then extended that to Wednesday and then to Thursday, and he finally came home on the Saturday; and he then had the hide to say, `Senator Ferguson and Julie Bishop had to return to Australia around midday on Friday,' when we had always planned to come home on Friday. The report was somewhat late because we had one extra day of counting before we were able to start writing and processing the report. Laurie Oakes said:
By that stage the observer group has not progressed very far at all in its detailed consideration, paragraph by paragraph, of what turned out to be a 46-page document. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. On the Thursday we went through the draft, and we put all the paragraphs in place so that it was a complete draft to put before the committee the next morning. Mr Rudd was not present all the time anyway, I might say. When the work was being done on the Thursday, he seemed to spend most of his time outside the room on the telephone, contacting Australian media outlets to make sure he was well heard in Australia. In fact, the basis of the report was finalised on the Thursday night. It was put to the committee on the Friday morning. We all worked in different working groups: some on the law, some on the poll and the count, some on the basic registrations. We all worked in different areas, and it all came together on the Friday.
In fulfilling his own ego, Mr Rudd then claimed that he was responsible for half the useful recommendations put into the final report—something I refused to believe—and he said it was done only at his insistence. I happen to know that there were a number of people from black countries in Africa like Botswana and Gambia, from the Caribbean states and, particularly, from Guyana, who were pushing very hard for a stronger statement than the one that had been presented. They spoke very strongly in favour of that. After we left at midday, although Mr Rudd says they did not finally conclude until 11 o'clock that night, there were in fact very few changes made to that document. I have copies of the draft and I have a copy of the final document, and there are almost no changes in the final document from the draft we made the day before. We were assured that would be the case.
Mrs Bishop and I could not get onto a different plane to come back to Australia. We were flying to Perth, and I was then flying on to Adelaide, and it was impossible to delay our departure to any later than the Friday lunchtime. For Laurie Oakes to have written up in the Bulletin these misleading comments by the Labor Party's shadow minister for foreign affairs, without at least telephoning either Julie Bishop or me to confirm whether or not the facts were accurate and to find out whether there was any truth in the statements Mr Rudd was making, does him no credit. To take them at face value and put them down as fact without making any attempt to verify whether or not the statements were true beggars all description. Laurie Oakes is supposedly one of the senior journalists in this place, and he has been for some time. If he is going to be selective about who he talks to and if he is going to promote one particular cause, he does himself no favours and he certainly does the media in general a disservice.
My time is nearly up. I can only reiterate that this was an experience that was physically exhausting and emotionally draining for me. It is one that I will never forget for the rest of my life.

I thank the minister for the information he has provided about the document he has described as the 1994 document. I ask him whether there were concluded departmental investigations then about any other Comcar records provided by Senator Heffernan or relating to the matters Senator Heffernan raised in the Senate—in other words, the alleged inappropriate use of Comcars by Justice Michael Kirby. If so, when were those matters investigated by his department? What was the result of those matters and who was informed of the result of those investigations?

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2002-03-20,"—The honourable senator is quite right. The document to which Senator Faulkner refers was the document shown on the front page of a newspaper. For the record, it gives me the opportunity to stop those on the other side and others from trawling misinformation. It is one of these unfortunate situations in this place where somebody has had a document believing it to be honest and then unfortunately finds the information not to be as he may have suspected. 
In relation to the 1994 document, I indicate to the honourable senator that the document was never presented to the department. The department first saw it when it was on the front page of a particular newspaper on, I believe, Sunday. As a result of its publication on Sunday, although Monday was a public holiday in Canberra, nevertheless officers went about examining certain aspects of the document. That document, as Senator Faulkner would be aware, is now in the hands of the Australian Federal Police, and certain consequences might flow from that investigation. I do not think it is appropriate for me to identify publicly the information that led to the department believing the document could not be authenticated. I would love to go through it chapter and verse, but unfortunately—or fortunately indeed—it is in the hands of the Australian Federal Police, and I believe they are best qualified to determine its authenticity. What was right and wrong about the document is best left in the hands of the Australian Federal Police as opposed to the super sleuths over there, or indeed me trying to use whatever forensic skills I might have. The people best suited to do this are the Australian Federal Police. That is where it ought to be left. But, for the record and so Mr Crean no longer perpetuates the myths he did on the 7.30 Report last night, the actual document, as it was printed, was first submitted to the department through the newspapers.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Privilege: Senator Heffernan</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,answer
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2002-03-20,"—I think Senator Heffernan in his speech to the Senate indicated he had sought certain information from the department. I can confirm an FOI request was made by Senator Heffernan. The documentation he was after had been destroyed pursuant to the Archives Act and therefore the department was unable to authenticate that information which had been provided—which in fact was not the complete work sheet but only extracts. As a result, there were no telltale signs on it such as registration numbers, driver details and things of that nature. This is a situation where, as the opposition asks more questions, the clearer it will become that Senator Heffernan was on a frolic of his own and the information we as a government had provided is quite clear and we as a government were not involved.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Privilege: Senator Heffernan</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,answer

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2002-03-20,"—I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a further response to a question asked by Senator Harris of me in question time yesterday.
Leave granted. 
The answer read as follows—
On 19 March 2002 Senator Harris asked me a Question Without Notice regarding:
·	whether Telstra has included or intends to include expiry dates on phone-cards and would this expiry date affect the use of these phone cards for emergency calls?
·	whether Telstra shut down the Easymail service as of 13 March 2002?
·	whether Telstra is providing considerable sponsorship for racing cars?
I undertook to provide additional information: I seek leave to incorporate the response in Hansard.
Although Telstra is partially government-owned, Telstra has been an independent corporation since 1992 and its board and management are responsible for the day to day running of the company's operations.
Telstra has advised as follows about the matters raised by Senator Harris:
Phone card expiry dates
There are two basic types of phone cards—pre-paid phone cards for use at public pay phones and “Say G'day” and “Phoneaway” cards for use from any telephone service using an access number.
The current pre-paid phone cards cannot be topped up or the credit value transferred to another card. The expiry date is clearly printed on the card and these cards must have at least an 18 month usage life when sold.
Prior to the introduction of the current phonecard system, pre-paid phone cards did not have an expiry date. However, on the introduction of the new card system, Telstra introduced a replacement program whereby customers could arrange to receive a replacement card for the remaining value, so as not to disadvantage customers holding old cards. This program is still available.
The “Say G'day” and “Phoneaway Cards” also have at least an 18 months usage life and can be recharged when the credit is exhausted. While credit remaining on these after their expiry date is not redeemable, customers can transfer the remaining credit to another pre-paid card prior to the expiry date of the old card.
All prepaid cards have an expiry date to ensure that Telstra can manage its phonecard systems. It enables Telstra to make technical changes to its operations and to enable replacement by more modern alternatives. It also enables Telstra to remove expired card numbers from the system to ensure that there are no ongoing capacity problems.
When the credit limit on a phone card has been exhausted or the card has passed its expiry date, no calls can be made using that card.
However, access to the 000 emergency service is available from any telephone without the need for phone cards.
Apart from 000, Telstra also offers reverse charge calls for situations where people do not have the coins or card to pay for such calls.
Easymail
Telstra was planning to shut down its Easymail service on 13 March. However, in response to customer feedback, the closure date has been delayed until May 2002.
Telstra is now also offering an Easymail forwarding facility for one year. Telstra has advised that it will be contacting its Easymail customers in March with further details, including arrangements for alternative services.
Racing Sponsorship
On 29 January 2002 Telstra announced its continued support of Australia's latest Formula One driver, Mark Webber, who has been appointed to the Minardi team.
Telstra has supported Mark Webber for a number of years through its subsidiary Pacific Access.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Telstra: Services and Sponsorship</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-03-20,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Special Minister of State (Senator Abetz) and the Minister for Justice and Customs (Senator Ellison) to questions without notice asked today relating to remarks made by Senator Heffernan concerning a judge of the High Court of Australia.
Today we have heard further fudging by Senator Abetz over the status of the investigation into the phoney Comcar records that were used by Senator Heffernan to smear Justice Michael Kirby in the Senate chamber. Instead of the obfuscation by Senator Abetz, it would have been much better just to come clean and tell the truth to the Senate about the status of those departmental investigations. Were extracts of the documents checked by the Department of Finance and Administration two years ago and found to be bogus? Were there other bogus documents checked by the department?
What we do know is that some two years before Mr Crean and Mr Brereton discredited the document that appeared in the Sun-Herald newspaper—which, I might say, took them less than 24 hours—forged material had been discredited by a departmental investigation. If the Department of Finance and Administration found documentary evidence, apparently being peddled around the place by Senator Heffernan, to be forged, you would think the red flag would go up. You would think someone might just accept some of the warning signals—and that in the year 2000. Wouldn't Senator Heffernan have been told—and the Prime Minister and the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Mr Moore-Wilton? Everyone in the government was aware of Senator Heffernan's obsession. Documents prepared as vicious slanders were floating around the corridors of Parliament House, and this behaviour probably could have been killed stone dead about two years ago.
We hear of a Commonwealth car driver, Mr Wayne Patterson, who says in today's Courier-Mail that the document published on the weekend was an example of things. We do not know what that means. I hope some of the police investigations now being carried out get to the bottom of that. We do not know whether this meant the document was prepared to show Senator Heffernan what to look out for in genuine Comcar dockets. Maybe those matters will be investigated now. But we are entitled to an explanation of what was investigated in the Department of Finance and Administration, who conducted the investigations, what the findings were of those investigations and who was told.
—I make this point, Senator Calvert, because it is an important point. We know that the integrity of an eminent judge has been smeared in this chamber. We know an apology was offered and was accepted. But I also make the point, of course, that the professionalism of Commonwealth car drivers has been questioned. I think it ought to be placed on the record that as far as I am concerned—and I believe many colleagues in this place think the same way—the professionalism of Commonwealth car drivers is not in question. I hope that the government would accept that as well.
Senator Abetz seems to think that this issue is over. He thinks that this is small picture stuff. But I have to say that is absolutely self-inflicted amnesia on Senator Abetz's part. What the opposition is on about here is one of the most grievous acts of abuse of the parliamentary process that we have seen in the history of this place. As we now know, it involves a forged document. Mr Howard said it is boring. Senator Abetz said it is time to move on. That is wishful thinking and they know it.

"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2002-03-20,"—If one were to take seriously the words that Senator Faulkner has said—that he and his party, the Australian Labor Party, represent a bastion of all things that are decent, wholesome and good for politics and for Australia—we would have no argument except that what Senator Faulkner says is completely duplicitous. Does Senator Faulkner believe that we hold sacred all the institutions in Australia and that he and his colleagues, his confreres in the party, would not attack those? Does Senator Faulkner believe that nowhere in Australia have ALP members attacked institutions and individual people?
Let me mention just a few instances where they have. I am not just talking about the slander of the Baillieu family, and a dead man at that, which is about as low as you can go. I am not just talking about the slander of Justice Callinan, a recent and a great addition to what is already a great fraternity of High Court judges. And I am not just talking about those other people who have been slandered in this place on a daily basis. I can think, though, more specifically of when I was in state parliament. A woman whose name was Penny Easton had a mother—a delightful woman—whose name is Mrs Barbara Campbell. False documents were tabled by the current member of another place, Dr Carmen Lawrence, and simultaneously by the Hon. John Halden in the upper house of Western Australia, that were so slanderous, so upsetting and so devastating in the obvious lies that these documents contained that this poor, dear woman—
—whom I happened to know very well, a very decent woman, a hardworking woman, a mother, a woman who had put herself through law school at mature age—
—took her life as a result of them. Is that decency? Is that appropriate? Is that all? I will tell you what it is all—
—Let me continue and I will get on, if I have time, about Senator Cook and the black hole that he left when he lied to the Australian people.
—Order! Senator Cook, would you please come to order.
—Do you know what a member of another place, the federal member for Perth, Mr Stephen Smith, said?
—Senator Lightfoot, I believe you also uttered some words that were unparliamentary. Please withdraw them.
—If I uttered words that were unparliamentary, then of course I would be happy to withdraw those insofar as they are unparliamentary or even offensive. A member in the other place, Mr Stephen Smith, the member for Perth, said about the Easton inquiry that was set up by the Western Australian government:
... any judge, any former judge, any would-be judge who lends himself or herself to a political stunt, to do any political damage to Carmen Lawrence needs to understand that he or she will be the subject of political attack by friends of Carmen Lawrence.
He said that on 8 May 1995, as quoted in the Australian. What did the former Prime Minister Mr Keating say? I do not like talking about former prime ministers, but on this occasion the seriousness of the situation warrants that I say this. Mr Keating said, `Even if it is found against Carmen Lawrence, so what?' He is talking about the royal commission set-up—`So what? I mean, it is a political matter.' He is saying that the royal commission did not have the skill or did not have the integrity to bring down a decision that was not political. Mr Keating went on to say:
This thing is that there is no question here about any serious illegality or misappropriation or maladministration of public duties. This is really about an inquiry into what was going on politically in the former cabinet. 
This is not to take note of a young woman, a young mother, who died as a result of misinformation being tabled in parliament and the misuse of parliament to an absolute degree. We are talking about people who are yet to apologise. Yet on this side of the House we have the Hon. Bill Heffernan—and I am not defending what he said because it was quite patently wrong—who at least has apologised in a fashion that must be acceptable to everyone; he is genuinely and sincerely sorry. When is the other side going to apologise about Ms Penny Easton taking her life?

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2002-03-20,"—It is appropriate that the government wheel out Senator Lightfoot to defend Senator Heffernan today because there was only one Liberal member of parliament anywhere in this country—not Senator Brandis, not Senator Hill, not Senator Calvert—who was prepared last week to defend Senator Heffernan publicly, and on the weekend who was the bunny? For anyone who has not guessed yet, it was Senator Lightfoot. Senator Lightfoot came out all guns blazing on behalf of Senator Heffernan on the weekend. Senator Lightfoot probably still thinks the bogus document was real. What a joke of a defence—trying to find a way to justify what Senator Heffernan got up to. It is a joke, Senator Lightfoot, and you should apologise along with Senator Heffernan.
But I am indebted to Michelle Grattan in today's Sydney Morning Herald for the first line in the first paragraph of her piece today. The truth was always out there. The first line says:
When they wanted to find the truth, it took John Howard and Bill Heffernan no time at all.
And that is what today's question time goes to the heart of: when did the Prime Minister and the Department of Finance and Administration know? Why can't we get a simple answer? We had stonewalling all day yesterday. What documents were the department supplied with? What documents were supplied to the FOI officer? Why won't Senator Abetz just say, `No documents were supplied'? What did he say? He said, `It would be very unusual if, when employing an FOI officer, you gave them documents.' Yes, we agree, Senator Abetz, but what about answering the question?
You were quite willing to be specific about Dr Boxall, but you are not prepared to rule out that the department was supplied documents by the Courier-Mail journalist Mr Paul Whittaker. All it would have taken to put this issue to bed for Senator Abetz is a no. Where was it? He bravely wanted to specifically defend Dr Boxall on Dr Boxall's recollections, and we accept that. But we want to know: who received the documents, who looked at them, who tested them and who passed them onto the department for verification? The department admits that it received some documentation from Senator Heffernan that purported to be departmental records, but it says they were fabrications, they were bogus. What did the department do? Somebody is out there—in other words, Senator Heffernan—peddling extracts from Comcar records that turn out to be bogus and the department does nothing. Why? Why weren't the police called in to investigate the bogus documents? Who supplied them would have perhaps been the first question.
Perhaps if Senator Heffernan had received a phone call from the AFP, `Come in, Senator Heffernan, we'd like to talk to you about these bogus documents you're circulating and that you've given to the department,' we would not have gone through this last tragic week, this last pathetic week, because the AFP investigation would have got to the heart of who bodgied up these documents, and then Senator Heffernan perhaps would not have believed this same individual, as Senator Heffernan has indicated that he got both sets of documents from the same person. If the department had done its job or, more importantly, if the minister of the day had done his job and referred the matter to the AFP, the AFP would have had Senator Heffernan and the Comcar driver in—even though they would have spoilt his Olympics—and we would have got to the bottom of who was producing fake, bogus, fraudulent documents and we would not have had to put Justice Kirby through the last four years of smear and innuendo from the ghost who stalks these corridors.
Parliament would be well served if Senator Heffernan took the advice of his leader and not only resigned but also did the big walk into the snow. That is what should happen here: Senator Heffernan should give it away because he has brought his leader, his party and this parliament into disrepute, and it is disgraceful to see a cover-up still continuing from Senator Abetz and this government. These are simple questions. They are not about what the police investigations are looking at; they are about process.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2002-03-20,"—I think we need to draw back from the partisanship of this and recognise that these are issues of very peculiar sensitivity. When Senator Heffernan stood in this place on Tuesday evening last week and gave a speech that we all regret was ever given, he caused terrible harm. He caused terrible hurt to Justice Kirby and to Justice Kirby's loved ones and family. Senator Heffernan now regrets that. He caused harm to the reputation of the High Court, and many believe that he caused harm to this institution. But I believe that Senator Heffernan, though he acted wrongly, acted in good faith, in the sense that he believed in what he was saying. We now know that he was misled. Anybody who was in this chamber at half past three yesterday afternoon and heard Senator Heffernan's unreserved retraction and apology to Justice Kirby could not but have been moved and struck by the dignity with which Senator Heffernan humbled himself to do that. He ought to have done so, and he did so as a gentleman.
Shortly afterwards, Justice Kirby issued a statement. That statement was tabled in this place. It is in the press this morning. I do not think it has ever been read in this place. Let me read an extract from it. Justice Kirby said:
I accept Senator Heffernan's apology and reach out my hand in a spirit of reconciliation. I hope that my ordeal will show the wrongs that hate of homosexuals can lead to. 
Out of this sorry episode, Australians should emerge with a heightened respect for the dignity of all minorities. And a determination to be more careful in future to uphold our national institutions—the Parliament and the Judiciary.
That was a most gracious and magnanimous statement under the circumstances, and it should be accepted by all in this place, putting party conflict behind us, in the spirit in which it was intended, just as Justice Kirby graciously accepted Senator Heffernan's unreserved apology and retraction in the spirit in which it was intended.
I am sure that, if there is one man in Australia today who does not want to see this issue being drawn down into the mire of party political point scoring, it is Justice Kirby. In the cities and towns of this nation I believe the Australian people have had a surfeit of this in the last eight days. They have seen a most eminent and distinguished man, Justice Kirby, besmirched by false allegations. They have seen a very significant parliamentarian, Senator Heffernan, humbled, and they have seen him withdraw his allegations with dignity. We have seen the victim of those allegations respond with grace and forgiveness. Surely, that ought to be the end of it. It does the High Court no good, it does this chamber no good, it does Mr Justice Kirby no good for this to be now used by an opposition as an occasion for cheap party political point scoring. Let us heed what the Australian people plainly want and put this episode behind us and get on with the business of governing.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Privilege: Senator Heffernan </title>,Questions Without Notice,10,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-03-20,"—I rise to speak on the motion to take note of the answer to the question I asked of Senator Ellison representing the Attorney-General. It is interesting to note that Senator Brandis says that that is the end of it and we should move on, particularly in relation to the criticism levelled at the High Court. However, the Attorney-General has not taken that view. Interestingly enough, in two press releases the Attorney-General commented on this particular issue. He commented on it first on 14 March where the topic states `High Court's integrity not in question'. At that stage the Attorney-General was trying, I suspect, to deflect criticism not of the High Court but of his role as the first law officer, because the first law officer's proper role is to defend the judiciary from attack. He goes on in that press release to say `some commentators', but further on he gets to the point in question where he says:
High Court judges have both the right and the ability to address any personal criticism addressed against them. 
So, as the first law officer, his view clearly seems to be that matters of personal criticism should be addressed by the High Court judges themselves. That is a disappointment, but it begs the question of an attack on the High Court itself. His answer, strangely enough, seems to be, as pointed out by the Prime Minister, that Senator Heffernan's speech has highlighted the need for a protocol, as recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission, for dealing with allegations against federal judges. So the matter does not end here. It does not end with the apology by Senator Heffernan. We now have the Attorney-General saying, against his first statement really, that there is a need for something to be done. If he is not going to take on the role of defender of the High Court, then protocols will have to be developed, and he will now reach back in time and pick up a review. It appears that the statement has emanated from report No. 89, Managing justice: a review of the federal civil justice system, 2000. I would be helped by the Attorney-General if he did say that was where it came from. Page 201 of the report says:
The Commission believes it is important for the Federal Parliament to establish a general standing procedure in advance of any controversy or crisis in atmosphere surrounding a particular allegation.
This is particularly where we are now, I suspect. But recommendation 12 goes on to say:
The Federal Parliament should develop and adopt a protocol governing the receipt ...
And it goes on. So we find no answer at the time the report was made by the Attorney-General, no answer to the recommendation by the Attorney-General, but when it is convenient, when the High Court has been attacked and he fails in his defence of it, he finds a paragraph and a recommendation to rely on. It is particularly poor form really to reach back and grab it. He is now going to deal with the protocol. We hope he does. We will keep him to the task. If he is going to develop a protocol, then let us see it developed. 
You then go back and look at what he said and his view about the judiciary and their own defence. The Attorney-General made a speech titled `Who Speaks for the Judges?' presented on 3 November 1996. I understand he has gone back to this speech a number of times in justifying why he does not defend the High Court or individuals within the High Court. It is interesting to see that, on the issue of privilege, paragraph 34 states:
This may be appropriate where criticism might significantly impair public confidence in the justice system. Furthermore, attacks from parliamentarians, particularly when made under protection of parliamentary privilege, are matters upon which the advice or support of the Attorney-General might properly be sought or given. It is in the interests of all arms of government that the integrity of democratic systems including a strong and independent judiciary be entrenched and properly understood by the Australian people.
The Attorney-General has failed his own test. He set himself a test in a speech, paragraph 34, and he fails. He does not go back and say anything about this. That is where he should have defended the judiciary. (Time expired)

"Tchen, Sen Tsebin",LP,2002-03-20,"—I give notice that 15 sitting days after today I shall move that the Fuel Quality Standards Regulations 2001, as contained in Statutory Rules 2001 No. 236 and made under the Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000, be disallowed. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short summary of the committee's concerns with these regulations.
Leave granted.
The summary read as follows—
Fuel Quality Standards Regulations 2001, Statutory Rules 2001 No. 236
The Regulations provide for the implementation of a national fuel standards scheme.
Paragraph 5(2)(b) provides that the fee payable on an application for approval for a variation of a fuel standard may be waived or reduced if the Minister thinks that the fee would cause financial hardship for the applicant. However, no criteria are specified for determining financial hardship.  
Paragraph 5(2)(c) provides that the fee must be refunded if the application is withdrawn before it is considered. It is not clear how an applicant will know when an application is to be considered. That is, it is not clear how long a period an applicant will have to be able to withdraw an application before losing the benefit of a fees refund. An associated problem is that it is not clear what is meant by the term `considered'. Does it mean `considered by the Minister'?
The Minister for the Environment and Heritage advised the Committee that guidance on these matters is provided by the department's Procedures Manual for Approvals. The Committee has written further to the Minister concerning the use of a departmental manual in these circumstances.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2002-03-20,"—I move the following amendment to the motion:
At the end of the motion add the words:
“and, in respect of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Transitional Movement) Bill 2002, the bill not be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for inquiry and report.”.
As mentioned earlier today, the Migration Legislation Amendment (Transitional Movement) Bill 2002 is an important part of the government's measures to address the ongoing problem of people-smuggling. The government's strategy in this area is starting to have results. No boats have attempted to breach our immigration controls in several months. Despite speculation about the impact of the monsoon season on boat arrivals, recent media reports indicate that people-smuggling activity is declining. Despite the claims of the Australian Democrats earlier today, their efforts to subject this bill to greater scrutiny are not about upholding the parliamentary process; rather, this is part of a deliberate, ongoing effort to undermine the government's strategy on people-smuggling—a strategy that was endorsed by this parliament and by the Australian people late last year. 
Attempts by the Australian Democrats to stymie this legislation include the Selection of Bills Committee meeting on 13 March 2002, when the government initiated a reference of the migration bill to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, with a reporting date of 19 March 2002. This reference was proposed to allow the committee to consider the bill and to enable consideration by the Senate prior to the end of the autumn sitting period. The Democrats denied leave for the Selection of Bills Committee report to be tabled on 14 March, resulting in the report not being tabled prior to the Senate rising on 14 March. This action resulted in the bill not being referred to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee last week. The Selection of Bills Committee met again on 19 March and reconsidered the proposed referrals of bills. The report now being tabled indicates that the Selection of Bills Committee considered the proposed reference of the migration bill and it says:
Senator Ian Campbell, noting the reasons why leave had been refused for the presentation of the committee's draft report on 14 March 2002, expressed a view that the referral of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Transitional Movement) Bill 2002 should not now proceed. He also noted standing order 33(1)(b) ... and that the committee's usual method of proceeding was to reserve disagreements for resolution by the Senate.
Given the actions of the Democrats to thwart the reference proposed by the government last week, and given the urgency of this bill, the government now wishes to amend the Selection of Bills Committee report to excise the referral of the migration bill to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. This will enable the bill to be brought on for debate this week and will allow the government to manage the orderly transition of people from declared countries into Australia under exceptional circumstances.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,12,1,speech

—The rationale given by the minister just then is that this is an integral part of the government's strategy to combat people-smuggling. That was not the reason given in relation to why this is urgent, and nothing that he just mentioned gives any indication about why it is urgent. That is germane to this question because this report is about having proper consideration of the bill and the reasons why the bill needs proper consideration. What I did last week in not giving leave for the report to be tabled at an inappropriate time was not to prevent it from going to a committee; it was to defer until this week consideration of it going to a committee. Now we see the government trying to prevent it from being considered by the committee. 
In speaking to this motion and the amendment moved by the minister, it is worth putting the broader situation in context. The bill was introduced in the House of Representatives a week ago, on Wednesday last week. The meeting of the Selection of Bills Committee which occurred after that was a special meeting called to consider referral of workplace relations and security legislation that had been put forward. The migration bill was not even on the agenda. The government ambushed the committee with its own reference without the committee even being aware that the bill had been introduced, let alone that it was going to be on the agenda. Then they have the hide to complain when we want to defer consideration of their report. 
A clear highlighting of why this is just another shonky exercise by the government in railroading through yet more dubious legislation without proper scrutiny can be seen in the rest of the report. There are two other bills here—in fact, a lot of bills have been referred, including the security legislation and the workplace relations legislation—but these two are migration bills, both of which were introduced at the same time, some of the content of which also had not been foreshadowed. The Democrats proposed that they be referred to a committee. We suggested a reporting date in the middle of April and the government said, `That's fine. Actually, you have some more time. Don't bother reporting back until 15 May,' which is what is in the report. 
Obviously, we do not mind having more time; to some extent, it is academic because the Senate does not resume until 14 May anyway. On the one hand, we have recognition that two migration bills, including a significant one dealing with procedural fairness, need proper scrutiny until May; yet the government is trying to railroad through this week this bill dealing with transitional movement, which is far more significant and has potentially much greater ramifications.
I remind the Senate that the reasons given this morning as to why it is urgent are that some of the people on Nauru or Manus Island may be required to enter Australia in exceptional circumstances, including receiving urgent medical treatment or providing evidence in people-smuggling prosecutions. The government know that there are not going to be any people-smuggling prosecutions between now and May which they need to get people to Australia for. They have already had people who needed urgent medical treatment come to Australia without this legislation existing. Unless they are expecting a mass outbreak of some serious disease on Manus Island, then the suggestion that there is going to be a big wave of people needing urgent medical treatment is also ridiculous. 
The government are putting forward completely false reasons as to why this bill is urgent. That falsity is being compounded by this action in preventing scrutiny of the legislation in any proper sense. It is ridiculous to even go to the pretence of referring a serious bill like this to a committee one day after it has introduced a report, particularly as there are two major amendments to this bill which still have not seen the light of day— nobody knows what they are. We do not even know the content of the bill. How we can refer a bill to a committee when a core part of it does not yet exist is simply absurd, but it is as absurd as all the other fabrications and distortions of this government on issues to do with refugees, so I suppose we should not be surprised.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,12,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2002-03-20,"—The only contribution that Senator Bartlett made that was unknown to me is his claim that they were ambushed at the Selection of Bills Committee—I did not know that in terms of this migration legislation. I will take his word that that is true, but it is a bit dissembling to say that the problem is the way it was knocked back. The fact is that the Democrats used—properly, if you like—the procedure of this place to talk out discussion on this so that the Senate could not make a decision last week. They talked it out to a point where debate was guillotined so that the Senate was prevented from making a decision to refer to a committee.
The view of the opposition is that the government has indicated that this is the one bill which it regards as urgent for this session. It also indicated, I think, that it would like the unfair dismissal industrial relation bills and the security bills put through, but, after discussion, it decided to allow them to come back in the following session so that they could be explored through the legislative process. Those two packages of bills are far more complex than this particular migration bill. Senator Bartlett is probably right when he makes the point that he would like to see the two substantive amendments that have been promised; so would I. On this occasion, the migration legislation will not be so complex that we will not be able to deal with it in the committee stage without having to go to the legislation committee for advice. It would have been preferable for the Democrats to allow it to go to that committee for at least a day's hearing. Forget what they say here today: they deliberately held it up last week so that it would not be considered this week. That is the truth of the matter and it is legitimate, but do not claim otherwise. That is exactly what they have done.
Senator Bartlett is probably right when he says the only two reasons for this bill to go through are ill-health and the problems that occasions through medivaccing and having to give evidence—but there are two much larger categories of people that this may affect. It may well be that people on Manus and Nauru are classified as refugees. They will then need to go to their country of resettlement, be it Finland, Ireland or wherever else. Almost certainly, they are going to have to transit Australia to do so. They fall into two classes: the class that is covered by the Border Protection Bill 2001, which affects only those who land on Australian territory; and those who are intercepted at sea, who have no legislative coverage—probably by accident or oversight last time. If any of those in the second category need to be repatriated out of Australia to a third country for resettlement, there is nothing in the current law to stop them from making a fresh set of refugee claims in Australia which, having already had their refugee status confirmed in either Nauru or Manus Island, is not desirable, or there could be a fourth category of those who have had refugee status not granted. They may have to be repatriated to the country they came from and you do not want to start the whole process again in Australia.
We will debate the merits of it, but it is wider than just the two categories that Senator Bartlett highlighted in terms of its effect. Therein may lie some of the urgency to have these matters settled before we resume on 14 May. It has to be conceded that it would be much better to have a legislation committee inquiry on this. It would have been better to have it as originally proposed—it was not perfect—but that was the choice you made. You thought by knocking off the committee last week that this legislation could not be considered at all this week. Your bluff has been called on that particular one and, therefore, it will not go to a legislation committee.
I do not think that is the end of the world. I think legislative committees have a pretty patchy record overall. In any event, we are well away from the original reason for setting up legislation committees. They were originally meant to virtually substitute for the committee stage in this chamber. Now they are an excuse to invite everyone along. And it is a good excuse, provided we do not fob people off and say, `Come and put your views to the committee,' rather than us trying to use some intellectual rigour to assess those views. I think you would concede that there is a danger in that as well. I personally think that there is enough urgency in this piece of legislation for it to be considered this week. I think Senator Abetz's resolution therefore has merit.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,12,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-03-20,"—I made a contribution on this matter at 10.22 a.m. today, and I commended it—
—And 30 seconds?
—Yes, it was actually 30 seconds, according to this turn I have of the Hansard pink. I commended this to the Senate when we were dealing with the issue of an exemption of this particular bill from the cut-off. There is no point in the Senate beating around the bush: the reason this bill is not going to a legislation committee is that the Australian Democrats, particularly Senator Bartlett, decided on a device to block it. As Senator Ray properly said to the Senate, that is their right. It would not be the first time that senators in this chamber have decided to use the opportunities that the standing orders provide to get a certain result. But it was an intended result. The intention of the Australian Democrats was to block this bill going to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. 
How it was done was very simple. The Selection of Bills Committee report was introduced late on Thursday last week. It was introduced late and therefore required leave of the Senate to be introduced at a time that was not the normal time for introduction on the Senate's routine of business. Therefore, the Chairman of the Selection of Bills Committee was required to seek leave. Leave was not granted to introduce the Selection of Bills Committee report which contained a recommendation for reference of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Transitional Movement) Bill 2002 to the legislation committee. As leave was not granted, the Manager of Government Business in the Senate moved to suspend standing orders. That motion was talked out. It did not matter whether it was talked out or not, the substantive motion would have been talked out anyway. It was always going to be a dead duck because a deliberate decision had been made not to allow this matter to be finalised before the guillotine came into effect at 4 o'clock on Thursday afternoon. They are the facts of the matter. 
The opposition, as I said this morning, always tries to be consistent on these issues. Therefore, if any senator wants to see a bill referred to a legislation committee via the Selection of Bills Committee process, that ought to occur. We have been very consistent in trying to ensure that that process is accepted around the chamber—often to our own disadvantage, when we are ready to debate a bill in the chamber itself. We have been very consistent. This was a deliberate attempt to stymie a committee hearing on the bill. I identified it in this chamber in a speech at the time. No-one demurred; everyone understood what was happening.
—Disagreed.
—You did not disagree; the government actually agreed on this.
—No, I was explaining what you meant.
—Every now and again the government gets something right, and agreeing with me on that occasion was one of those that you can chalk up on the record. The situation is this: it was identified at the time, we all knew what was happening and, frankly, suggestions to the contrary—if any suggestions are being made—are false. The truth is that a parliamentary tactic was used, the procedures of the place were used, the standing orders of the Senate were used, to stop a committee hearing. That is fair enough. You are entitled to do that. The Australian Democrats can do that. The opposition itself has at times used procedural devices—once or twice that has happened—when we have thought that it was in the best interests of the views we were progressing in this chamber. On this occasion it was the Australian Democrats. But the problem is that you cannot have your cake and eat it too. We now do not have an opportunity to send that bill to a committee, and that is unfortunate. The decision of our caucus—the federal parliamentary Labor Party—was that we wanted it to go to a committee for as thorough an examination as possible in a constrained time period, which is before the end of these sittings. And that gets to the next issue: should the bill be dealt with this session? (Time expired)

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2002-03-20,"—I move the following amendment to the motion:
At the end of the motion add the words:
“and, in respect of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Transitional Movement) Bill 2002, the bill not be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for inquiry and report.”.
As mentioned earlier today, the Migration Legislation Amendment (Transitional Movement) Bill 2002 is an important part of the government's measures to address the ongoing problem of people-smuggling. The government's strategy in this area is starting to have results. No boats have attempted to breach our immigration controls in several months. Despite speculation about the impact of the monsoon season on boat arrivals, recent media reports indicate that people-smuggling activity is declining. Despite the claims of the Australian Democrats earlier today, their efforts to subject this bill to greater scrutiny are not about upholding the parliamentary process; rather, this is part of a deliberate, ongoing effort to undermine the government's strategy on people-smuggling—a strategy that was endorsed by this parliament and by the Australian people late last year. 
Attempts by the Australian Democrats to stymie this legislation include the Selection of Bills Committee meeting on 13 March 2002, when the government initiated a reference of the migration bill to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, with a reporting date of 19 March 2002. This reference was proposed to allow the committee to consider the bill and to enable consideration by the Senate prior to the end of the autumn sitting period. The Democrats denied leave for the Selection of Bills Committee report to be tabled on 14 March, resulting in the report not being tabled prior to the Senate rising on 14 March. This action resulted in the bill not being referred to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee last week. The Selection of Bills Committee met again on 19 March and reconsidered the proposed referrals of bills. The report now being tabled indicates that the Selection of Bills Committee considered the proposed reference of the migration bill and it says:
Senator Ian Campbell, noting the reasons why leave had been refused for the presentation of the committee's draft report on 14 March 2002, expressed a view that the referral of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Transitional Movement) Bill 2002 should not now proceed. He also noted standing order 33(1)(b) ... and that the committee's usual method of proceeding was to reserve disagreements for resolution by the Senate.
Given the actions of the Democrats to thwart the reference proposed by the government last week, and given the urgency of this bill, the government now wishes to amend the Selection of Bills Committee report to excise the referral of the migration bill to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. This will enable the bill to be brought on for debate this week and will allow the government to manage the orderly transition of people from declared countries into Australia under exceptional circumstances.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,12,2,speech

Those two packages of bills are far more complex than this particular migration bill. Senator Bartlett is probably right when he makes the point that he would like to see the two substantive amendments that have been promised; so would I. On this occasion, the migration legislation will not be so complex that we will not be able to deal with it in the committee stage without having to go to the legislation committee for advice. It would have been preferable for the Democrats to allow it to go to that committee for at least a day's hearing. Forget what they say here today: they deliberately held it up last week so that it would not be considered this week. That is the truth of the matter and it is legitimate, but do not claim otherwise. That is exactly what they have done.
Senator Bartlett is probably right when he says the only two reasons for this bill to go through are ill-health and the problems that occasions through medivaccing and having to give evidence—but there are two much larger categories of people that this may affect. It may well be that people on Manus and Nauru are classified as refugees. They will then need to go to their country of resettlement, be it Finland, Ireland or wherever else. Almost certainly, they are going to have to transit Australia to do so. They fall into two classes: the class that is covered by the Border Protection Bill 2001, which affects only those who land on Australian territory; and those who are intercepted at sea, who have no legislative coverage—probably by accident or oversight last time. If any of those in the second category need to be repatriated out of Australia to a third country for resettlement, there is nothing in the current law to stop them from making a fresh set of refugee claims in Australia which, having already had their refugee status confirmed in either Nauru or Manus Island, is not desirable, or there could be a fourth category of those who have had refugee status not granted. They may have to be repatriated to the country they came from and you do not want to start the whole process again in Australia.
We will debate the merits of it, but it is wider than just the two categories that Senator Bartlett highlighted in terms of its effect. Therein may lie some of the urgency to have these matters settled before we resume on 14 May. It has to be conceded that it would be much better to have a legislation committee inquiry on this. It would have been better to have it as originally proposed—it was not perfect—but that was the choice you made. You thought by knocking off the committee last week that this legislation could not be considered at all this week. Your bluff has been called on that particular one and, therefore, it will not go to a legislation committee.
I do not think that is the end of the world. I think legislative committees have a pretty patchy record overall. In any event, we are well away from the original reason for setting up legislation committees. They were originally meant to virtually substitute for the committee stage in this chamber. Now they are an excuse to invite everyone along. And it is a good excuse, provided we do not fob people off and say, `Come and put your views to the committee,' rather than us trying to use some intellectual rigour to assess those views. I think you would concede that there is a danger in that as well. I personally think that there is enough urgency in this piece of legislation for it to be considered this week. I think Senator Abetz's resolution therefore has merit.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,12,2,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-03-20,"—I made a contribution on this matter at 10.22 a.m. today, and I commended it—
—And 30 seconds?
—Yes, it was actually 30 seconds, according to this turn I have of the Hansard pink. I commended this to the Senate when we were dealing with the issue of an exemption of this particular bill from the cut-off. There is no point in the Senate beating around the bush: the reason this bill is not going to a legislation committee is that the Australian Democrats, particularly Senator Bartlett, decided on a device to block it. As Senator Ray properly said to the Senate, that is their right. It would not be the first time that senators in this chamber have decided to use the opportunities that the standing orders provide to get a certain result. But it was an intended result. The intention of the Australian Democrats was to block this bill going to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. 
How it was done was very simple. The Selection of Bills Committee report was introduced late on Thursday last week. It was introduced late and therefore required leave of the Senate to be introduced at a time that was not the normal time for introduction on the Senate's routine of business. Therefore, the Chairman of the Selection of Bills Committee was required to seek leave. Leave was not granted to introduce the Selection of Bills Committee report which contained a recommendation for reference of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Transitional Movement) Bill 2002 to the legislation committee. As leave was not granted, the Manager of Government Business in the Senate moved to suspend standing orders. That motion was talked out. It did not matter whether it was talked out or not, the substantive motion would have been talked out anyway. It was always going to be a dead duck because a deliberate decision had been made not to allow this matter to be finalised before the guillotine came into effect at 4 o'clock on Thursday afternoon. They are the facts of the matter. 
The opposition, as I said this morning, always tries to be consistent on these issues. Therefore, if any senator wants to see a bill referred to a legislation committee via the Selection of Bills Committee process, that ought to occur. We have been very consistent in trying to ensure that that process is accepted around the chamber—often to our own disadvantage, when we are ready to debate a bill in the chamber itself. We have been very consistent. This was a deliberate attempt to stymie a committee hearing on the bill. I identified it in this chamber in a speech at the time. No-one demurred; everyone understood what was happening.
—Disagreed.
—You did not disagree; the government actually agreed on this.
—No, I was explaining what you meant.
—Every now and again the government gets something right, and agreeing with me on that occasion was one of those that you can chalk up on the record. The situation is this: it was identified at the time, we all knew what was happening and, frankly, suggestions to the contrary—if any suggestions are being made—are false. The truth is that a parliamentary tactic was used, the procedures of the place were used, the standing orders of the Senate were used, to stop a committee hearing. That is fair enough. You are entitled to do that. The Australian Democrats can do that. The opposition itself has at times used procedural devices—once or twice that has happened—when we have thought that it was in the best interests of the views we were progressing in this chamber. On this occasion it was the Australian Democrats. But the problem is that you cannot have your cake and eat it too. We now do not have an opportunity to send that bill to a committee, and that is unfortunate. The decision of our caucus—the federal parliamentary Labor Party—was that we wanted it to go to a committee for as thorough an examination as possible in a constrained time period, which is before the end of these sittings. And that gets to the next issue: should the bill be dealt with this session? (Time expired)

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2002-03-20,"—Pursuant to contingent notice, and at the request of the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Natasha Stott Despoja, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Stott Despoja moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of this Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 35.
This motion is urgent and should be discussed today principally for two reasons. Firstly, there has been a really horrible wave of homophobia across the country in the last few days and I suspect that is happening again. What this motion deals with, in part, is the recognition of same sex couples as de facto couples under federal law, or at least for the purposes of Family Court property disputes and their settlement. The reason that we ought to support this motion today is that it would send the right message; it would send a positive message—
—Madam Deputy President, I raise a point of a order. I seek clarification from Senator Greig as to whether he intends to move an amendment in relation to the motion on the Notice Paper.
—Senator Mackay is referring to Labor's proposal that the motion ought to have been amended. That has been done in accordance with the opposition's wishes. I was saying that there are two key reasons why this motion should proceed today: firstly, I think it is important that the federal government acknowledge the existence of same sex couples as a way of sending a positive message in light of the wave of homophobia that has swept the country in the last few days; and, secondly, it is important because the Attorney-General announced recently that he was considering legislation that would allow a transfer of the jurisdictions in terms of the way in which de facto couples were dealt with under family law or within family courts between state jurisdictions and the Commonwealth. There was recently a meeting of attorneys-general, including the federal Attorney-General, where this issue was discussed.
As it happens, legislation is being discussed and debated at this very point in time in the Western Australian jurisdiction, in my home state, which would grant same sex couples access to the Family Court under state jurisdiction. In those jurisdictions where the recognition of same sex couples is granted under the Family Court system—and that currently includes New South Wales and Victoria, I understand, and very soon my home state of Western Australia—it is only fair on the parliaments in those jurisdictions to know what exactly it is that is going to happen at the Commonwealth level. I think it is important that this chamber send a message to the government that it wants a system that does not discriminate.
My belief is that, firstly, we need to send a positive message of nondiscrimination to the gay and lesbian community and, secondly, that we need to send a message to the government so that it recognises the calls from all chief ministers and premiers in all the territories and state jurisdictions that this reform is positive and necessary and something the government should do. So we should take the opportunity today for the Senate to send that message to the Attorney on the basis that legislation is forthcoming to this chamber, once it passes the House of Representatives, to deal with that. So for those two reasons I argue that the matter is urgent and must be considered today.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY COURT: PROPERTY ISSUES</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,22,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-20,"—I support Senator Greig's motion and I congratulate him and the Democrats on bringing this motion forward. The motion, if passed, would be an injunction to the government from the Senate to catch up with public sentiment on the matter of discrimination against same sex couples. It simply accords with the view of the state Attorneys-General in the matter and would have the legislation come from the government. One would presume, if the opposition is to support this, and I think it will, that that would allow for the end of discrimination on property issues for de facto couples and see that they are settled in the Family Court.
The motion asks the government to ensure that such legislation would include the need for avoiding limitation of existing rights under state legislation for same sex couples and also ensure that an equitable legislative regime is proposed which eliminates any disadvantage or discrimination against all de facto couples, whether of the same or opposite sex. This legislation is not cutting edge. It follows legislation that has been passed by several states in Australia but many countries and jurisdictions overseas. I think that Senator Greig is absolutely right that it is a very timely opportunity for the government to respond to recent events in a positive fashion. The motion is an important one. It will be a breakthrough for the Senate if it is passed and it will be an advance for this country. It will open up an opportunity for the Howard government to catch up with the mood of the nation.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY COURT: PROPERTY ISSUES</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,22,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-03-20,"—Here we are: because I called this not formal, I am accused by Senator Greig of homophobia. I challenge him or anyone in this chamber or outside of this chamber to say when I ever supported unjust discrimination against persons because of their homosexuality. I challenge them to say when I did—in all my past life in the trade union movement or in the political arena. It is so unfair for Senator Greig to suggest that this is a matter of homophobia. I am an Independent senator here representing the state of Tasmania. I am entitled to know precisely what is behind the motions that are put forward. I am expected to agree to a situation where there has been no debate. I think this is a matter of such importance that there should be debate. That is what I am talking about: there should be debate. 
The notice of motion talks about calling on the government, in bringing forward legislation on this matter, to ensure that such federal legislation will in no way limit existing rights under state legislation. How many in this chamber can honestly say that they know what all the state legislation does? What are you suggesting we are signing up to here? How many in this chamber know not only what existing state legislation but what future state legislation we are supposed to sign up to? As we know, under the Constitution, legislation of the federal parliament overrules the states. The interesting thing is that the motion calls on the government to ensure that:
... an equitable legislative regime is proposed which eliminates any disadvantage or discrimination against all de facto couples whether they are of the same or opposite sex.
There is the nub of it. This is an attempt to get backdoor recognition of same sex couples as having marriage status relationship similar to a de facto couple, which is recognised as having a marriage like status. This is trying to get the Senate to sign up to that. I do not think that ought to be done without great consideration.
I disagree with Senator Brown: I do not think the public believes that that ought to be the situation. The family law legislation is perfectly clear—it talks about the need to preserve and protect the institution of marriage as the `union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others voluntarily entered into for life'. That is what the family law legislation says and we are now being asked by way of this motion to sign up to something that is quite contrary to the Family Law Act and what is in the Marriage Act. Whether you agree with the motion or not, I believe it is a matter that ought to be subject to proper debate—not snuck through by calling for a notice of motion to be taken as formal.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY COURT: PROPERTY ISSUES</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,22,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2002-03-20,"—Some time ago I raised whether we should abolish formal notices of motion. I raised that with the Procedure Committee because I was sick of getting squeezed on resolutions of principle. Quite often those resolutions contained 90 per cent of things I could agree with and 10 per cent of things I could not. Either you declared them not formal and they would disappear or you had to suspend standing orders and have an unlimited debate, or you had to knock them through without debate—to me, that is the problem. Time and time again, parties and individuals in this chamber are getting squeezed on these particular matters of principle. 
I read the motion and I do not have a lot of difficulty with it per se, but I have difficulty with suspending standing orders and then having to have a one-, two-, three- or four-hour debate at this stage of the session. I am afraid that is not on. One thing I will not accuse Senator Greig of is trying to stall the proceedings. I know he is not trying to do that—Senator Bartlett would love him to do it. He is not trying to do that and I accept that. I accept the sincerity with which Senator Greig is putting this forward as a principle, but it is very difficult for this Senate to adopt these resolutions constantly without any debate at all. On that point, Senator Harradine is absolutely right.
This also raises the fact that the government has botched its program so much that people like Senator Greig cannot be given general business time. We have given up more general business time overall on this side of the chamber than has ever been given up before—Thursday after Thursday, we are turning over to government business, later night sittings et cetera. You have to have some sympathy with Senator Greig because he is not getting an opportunity to have a full debate on this particular matter. I have to say that today is not the day. You can say, `You would argue, Senator Ray, that the day is never there.' But no, I will not argue that.
—When is the day?
—Exactly—the day will come, I think, Senator Brown. To put a motion like this through, a major principle, without debate, was not on, so declaring it not formal was probably the appropriate course of action. There is only one question before us: are we going to spend the rest of the day and half of tomorrow, or whatever, debating this particular matter or not? The answer is that we were never signed up for it. If we were forced to be in a position to have to vote on this as a formal motion, we can indicate now that we would have supported it. 
We are not about to vote for a suspension of standing orders and an endless debate at a time when we have a range of serious legislation which can hopefully be finished off by 6.30 tomorrow night. As it is, I suspect we will be sitting here well into Friday afternoon trying to get through what is now a limited government program. It is not a wish list because they have cut it right back—everything has been put aside, all the bluffing and all that. The government now has its minimum demands on the table, which we do not regard as unreasonable. We would like to see those matters resolved before we leave here on either Thursday night or Friday. Therefore, the suspension of standing orders may have an element of urgency but it is not warranted at this stage.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY COURT: PROPERTY ISSUES</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,22,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2002-03-20,"—The government will be opposing the proposal put forward by Senator Greig in relation to the consideration of this motion. The government has an agenda that has been put before this chamber. Urgent legislation is required to be passed before we resume for the budget session. As Senator Ray indicated, we have the rest of today and tomorrow and possibly the early hours of Friday morning—let us hope not. There is a tight schedule to be worked through and this is not the time or the place for a debate on this matter, which has a certain gravity about it, as Senator Harradine pointed out. Indeed, I would doubt that any of us sitting around the chamber at the moment could answer the question that Senator Harradine posed. That aside, the government wants to get on with the agenda. I invite the Senate to reject the motion and allow us to deal with the business that is before the Senate so that we can hopefully catch our flights on Friday morning back to our electorates.

Leave granted. 
—I thank the Senate. Despite the inference, I think, made by Senator Ray just recently, I am not trying to chew up time unnecessarily to prevent debate on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Transitional Movement) Bill 2002, which is the subject of my notice of motion. Given that the Senate has just decided to amend the Selection of Bills Committee report not to send this bill to a committee, it is fairly redundant to proceed with this notice of motion. I would like as much time as possible in this chamber to consider the bill, given that we are not going to be able to consider it in a committee.
In withdrawing this notice of motion, I do need to correct the statement made by Senator Faulkner. He said that it was the intention of the Democrats to block this bill going to a committee. The fact that I have this notice of motion on the Notice Paper pretty clearly shows that it is not the Democrats' intention to block the bill going to a committee. It was our intention to try to send it to a committee with a proper hearing, which it would not have got under the rushed approach that was being tried by the government last week. I think it is important to put that on the record. Hopefully, we can move on to the substantive issue when the bill comes on for debate later. The Democrats wanted it to go to a committee. We wanted it to get a proper hearing, not a rush through before anybody even knew the bill existed. That is why this notice of motion was put forward. But, given the matter has been determined already, I will withdraw it.

—You are right, sorry.
—The next business on the running sheet is the Greens' amendment.
—They are not here, so I would move the opposition amendment, which is the next amendment, if that is the wish of the committee.
—Can we deal with yours without having dealt with the Greens' amendment first?
—Yes, they are separate matters. 
—If Senator Brown is not even in the chamber and does not want to pursue the amendment, I am wondering how serious he is and whether we deal with it.
—Senator Abetz, we have a lot of work to do here. We are serious about processing these amendments. We believe they are worthy of the consideration of this chamber. Gratuitous abuse of other senators will not facilitate that. I would urge you, in the interests of what you perceive to be the government program, to bear in mind just how much work there is before us. I would therefore move the amendments standing in my name listed as amendments to schedule 1, item 1.

	(4A)	Where the Minister varies the list in accordance with this section, the Minister must do so in accordance with such criteria for the identification of a new school as shall be prescribed.
This amendment seeks to vary the list in accordance with the section so that established criteria for the identification of new schools—
—The advisers are asking whether the revised amendments have been circulated.
—Senator Carr, the issue is whether the revised amendments have been circulated. The Deputy Clerk advises me that that is not the case at this stage. Is that correct?
—The amendment that I am speaking to, which is listed here as 2442 on the sheet that I have before me, was distributed—and I asked for it to be distributed—yesterday. This is not a revised amendment. 
—It is not a revised amendment.
—We are right now, thank you.
—If I might speak to this amendment, what concerns us here is to provide a mechanism to establish criteria for identifying whether new schools are in genuine need. It is not sufficient, in our judgment, to rely on state registration procedures to do this. As we have been able to highlight through a range of processes, there are at least 13 schools that we have identified amongst this list of 49 at the time—I understand it has now grown to 58—where it would appear that reliance upon state registration has led to a situation where schools have been registered as new schools which are arguably outside the current guidelines. Those schools are really branches of an existing school—they are just new campuses and the schools have essentially just changed their names; I can go to the detail of these if required—or schools that have effectively extended their levels and are not in fact new schools. 
State registration bodies have responsibility for assuring the quality of education in all schools, such as for curriculum, teaching qualifications, health and safety conditions and, in some states, discipline. They are matters which go to the standards of educational provision, not to the issue of criteria for an automatic access—and I emphasise that—to Commonwealth moneys. They are in fact serving entirely differing purposes. That is why it is a grave error in public policy to rely upon a state to administer a Commonwealth program which is, in effect, open ended and which does not take into account the requirements of the Commonwealth guidelines but operates on an entirely different basis. 
What we have then is the situation, for instance, of the Christian College Highton and the Christian College Institute of Senior Education, in Highton, which is a senior campus of a school which was created and separately registered. They have the same registration address; 12 of the 13 directors are the same for the registered company; they have the same address in relation to their registration as a registered training organisation. We have the All Souls St Gabriel School at Charters Towers in Queensland, which we have discussed on previous occasions, essentially with the same people, same staff, same students, same board of governors. And so it goes on. There are numerous examples of this. 
We have the Hills Montessori School in Sydney, which has an existing preschool that has catered for three- to five-year-olds for over 20 years. It is not a new school, but it has been registered as a new school. There are several other examples that we can point to on the list where Montessori schools are extending their program. We have the ludicrous situation—this really concerns me—where a school in Australia that receives Commonwealth funding has an enrolment of one. A school with one student! That is the International Conservatorium of Music in Sydney. How can you possibly run a school program with a school of one? How do you provide the breadth of curriculum and the facilities with a school of one? 
That is the basis on which we are now operating. We can have in this country a registered school with only one student in it. As I have said before, it reminds me very much of the old Sir Humphrey Appleby scene in the Yes, Minister series where there was a hospital with no patients. What we have in this country is schools without students, getting Commonwealth funding. 
This is where the whole notion of choice has gone off the rails—absolutely off the rails. We have a situation where the concept of choice is easier to use as a rhetorical term than in an operational sense. Providing choice for some actually undermines the choices of others. A country of our size and with our financial basis, our budgetary strength, is not able to provide infinite options in regard to funding. That is why it is important to establish the question of need. We should be funding schools on the basis of real need, not on the basis of some ideological obsession, as has been the case with this government.
We have a situation that we have seen in various places around the country and that highlights the points I have been making. The way this program is currently operating concerns me. The Labor Party believes that we need to assist genuine new schools to meet legitimate start-up costs. We also need to develop criteria to ensure that real needs are actually met, not to assist schools that are appreciably operating in another disguise. We need to pay particular attention to who owns the schools, to the governing bodies and to the actual operations of the school. We cannot have a situation where the guidelines seem to be so openly flouted. This department and this government know about these problems but they rely on the one assumption that if the schools are registered by the state they automatically have access to Commonwealth moneys. No wonder this program has been blown out so badly; no wonder there have been four attempts to get the estimates on the budgetary requirements; no wonder we have schools that are really schools for profit slipping through the administrative net, to the point where, for instance, we have the case of Reddam House school in Sydney and Murdoch College in Perth which, it would appear to me, have not been properly examined by departmental officials because they are relying on state government officials to do the work that the Commonwealth should be doing. This is a Commonwealth program and it requires proper accountability mechanisms. Currently those mechanisms are not in existence.
 (Senator Hogg)—Before calling other speakers, I want to make sure that I correct something I said earlier. We are now working from a new revised running sheet, which is revised (3). The amendment that is being put forward by Senator Carr is amendment (1) on sheet 2442—no longer revised. I understand that maybe there is a revised set of amendments but they are not forthcoming at this stage. We are operating from sheet 2442.

Insert:
	(6)	The Minister must refuse to authorise, or may delay, a payment to a State under this Act for a non-government school if:
	(a)	the school has an enrolment policy which would exclude a child on the grounds of:

I remind the committee that this amendment ensures that to qualify for establishment grants the private school involved has to have a policy that would ensure it does not restrict or exclude children on the basis of their academic ability, behavioural difficulty or special needs, including physical or intellectual disability or learning difficulty. It would ensure that we do not have a process whereby if there are special requirements in education to help children who are disadvantaged in any way they are rejected from the private system and simply put across to the public system because they are an expense.
There is a great deal of anecdotal evidence to show that this is the case. For example, an unruly child may be hyperactive or difficult in some other way. In the classroom that can lead to distractions for fellow pupils and to a great deal of extra attention and care from the teacher or teachers involved. But it is also a difficulty for the child involved. Unless they get special attention, this can very easily lead to them being denied the special assistance required to help them engage in other educational or work opportunities further down the line. 
If they do require special attention, that does require extra resources. We all ought to know of anecdotes where children rejected from the private school system have simply gone to the public school system because no-one else would take them. `Cherry picking', as it is called, is inherent in this process. I do not like that term because I think that no kid is a cherry above any other child. But the meaning here is that there is selectivity by some private schools, whereby they reject the extra time, care and monetary needs that these children require. For example, it is easy to expel such children from a school and leave it to their parents to find a place for them in the public school system. That should not happen. The Greens amendment aims to make sure that it does not happen, to make sure that neither the children nor the public school system are disadvantaged by private schools rejecting, quite unfairly, such students. It is a pretty simple and fair matter and I recommend this amendment to the committee.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech

It is a good one, although I do not think the rejection of students difficult to teach—if we might put them in that category—is across the board in non-government schools. If we were to typify the sorts of schools that do, it is probably those that are at the wealthier end of the spectrum.

I ask Senator Carr to think about this matter again. This amendment should be supported, and the time for it to be supported is now. Certainly, I agree with him: it should extend right across the board to the allocation of moneys to the private school system. But let us set that principle in place now and then extend it when the opportunity comes. Let us not block it now and then consider it when a further opportunity comes. That is not good enough.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2002-03-20,"—It seems that what is sought by the amendment is to establish one rule for the non-government sector but allow for other rules for the government sector, because there are in fact government schools that have selective enrolments on the basis of academic ability. So if you allow state government schools to do it, why on earth would you not allow non-government schools to do it?
I remember, when I went through the state government school system, at Taroona High School, that people were expelled from state government schools as well. So let us not have this pretence that people are only expelled from schools in the non-government sector. They are expelled from schools in both sectors because, at the end of the day, those that are in authority determine that that is the best course of action for the wellbeing of all the other students.
The amendment also ignores—and this is something that those opposed to our philosophical approach seem to do all the time—the views of parents. Many school councils—even, as I understand it, in state government schools—determine particular discipline policies for those schools. That would be the same in state government schools and non-government schools, so it is far too prescriptive and in fact would set a criterion which is not even applicable to state government schools. The government will oppose this amendment.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-20,"—Earlier today I asked Senator Abetz, on behalf of the government, to supply the committee with the figures on this matter. He has had all day to do so. I notice that he has not, and I have no doubt that he will not, because there is an inherent discriminatory potential and reality involved in this by some schools in the private sector. Where the private sector is going to get the largesse of taxpayers' money it ought to measure up to the public sector. The public sector does have a range—it is one that is there with government input, it is one that serves the public and it is one that ultimately does absorb the most difficult youngsters. But that is not the case with the private sector, and this is an attempt to bring fairness across the system. Every senator will know that that is required. Why should we not, as legislators, when giving taxpayers' money to the private sector, expect that the private sector will act with full responsibility and take its share of responsibility for helping children, no matter what their gifts, attributes or difficulties are? That is what this amendment is about.
I appeal to the opposition to look at it again and take this opportunity, in the name of fairness, to adopt this Australian Greens' amendment to ensure that the private school system does take fair responsibility in providing special education requirements, special care and the added attention that some children need in the school systems.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2002-03-20,"—I take this opportunity to publicly congratulate Senator Guy Barnett on a fantastic first speech and wish him all the best for what I am sure will be a very distinguished career.
Honourable senators—Hear, hear!
—Senator Barnett and I go back a long way, to university days, and I am delighted that he is here with me in the Senate. To his friends in the gallery, many of whom I know: have a drink for me because I am on duty down here.
Before the fantastic speech by Senator Barnett, a few propositions were put to me by a senator and some quite false assertions were made in relation to expulsions. Indeed, those who have any understanding and knowledge of the non-government sector know that from time to time students that have been expelled from the state system end up in the non-government sector and, because of different regimes, things happen to work well for them. The converse is also true: some that get expelled from the non-government sector do well in a government school. To try to put one set of restrictions on the non-government sector is inappropriate.
In relation to the number of expulsions, once again Senator Brown finds it very difficult to stick to the facts. He asked me prior to lunch about the number of expulsions, and I indicated to him—I did not answer it—that that was a matter for state governments. State governments have that responsibility. The federal government does not keep statistics in relation to expulsions from the state school systems; the state governments do that. He should make inquiries of the state governments around the country, add them all up together and he will get the numbers of expulsions that are, unfortunately, deemed necessary by the state government authorities around Australia.
We, as a federal government, do not want to take that role away from state governments. I think in general terms they do a good job in trying circumstances. I do not think the education system would be enhanced in any way by trying to determine school expulsions from Canberra, as opposed to leaving it to those who are closer, on the ground—namely, the state government system.

Establishment amount for the program year

)))))))
These amendments will restrict the per capita establishment grants to schools which have 60 students in a primary school or a secondary school for both the first and second year of funding or 90 students for a combined primary and secondary school. I acknowledge at the outset, because no doubt Senator Abetz will point this out, that this is an arbitrary figure, but it is nonetheless an accountability measure—an attempt on our part to find a way of making sure that we do not have a situation where so-called new schools start with enormous enrolments and qualify for the establishment grants.
If they do start with enormous enrolments, one of three things can generally be argued to be the case, I think, and I am sure the government could follow this if it chose to. Those students will be from a previous school and this will be a new campus of the same school or, as Senator Carr mentioned earlier, this will be the same school setting up with the same directors and school principal and essentially the same students and qualifying for this funding when it ought not or this will be a school which may well be poaching students from existing schools in the immediate region. So our amendments are an attempt to say that a reasonable start for a school is probably two grades. That, as I understand it, is how most new schools begin. They start with preps or with year 7, and then they build the school year after year. I think I recall the minister saying that the average size of new schools in terms of students was well below either the 60 figure or the 90 figure that we are suggesting would be reasonable. These amendments certainly would stop schools starting off with over 700 students. I commend them to the Senate. As I said, I realise the figures are arbitrary; nonetheless, they attempt to get rid of what is clearly an abuse of this generous entitlement by schools that are not really new schools and are, for whatever reason, able to get around the guidelines that are in place, get past the government on this issue and qualify for establishment grants.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech

(3)	Schedule 1, item 1, page 4 (lines 16 to 21), omit the definition of establishment amount, substitute the following definition:
establishment amount for the program year is as prescribed in accordance with the principle that the amount of a grant allocated to each school will be in direct proportion to the SES score for the school set out in Schedule 4 of this Act so that the largest grant is made to the school with the lowest ranked SES score and the smallest grant is made to the school with the highest ranked SES score.
(4)	Schedule 1, item 1, page 4 (line 28) to page 5 (line 2), omit the definition of establishment amount, substitute the following definition:
establishment amount for the program year is as prescribed in accordance with the principle that the amount of a grant allocated to each school will be in direct proportion to the SES score for the school set out in Schedule 4 of this Act so that the largest grant is made to the school with the lowest ranked SES score and the smallest grant is made to the school with the highest ranked SES score.
Amendment (3) relates to primary schools and amendment (4) relates to secondary schools. Both amendments go to the issue of the amount of the grant allocation under schedule 4 of this act. The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 2002 provides a fixed per capita establishment grant for every eligible school, without regard to their circumstances. This is inconsistent with the basic principles of need. Our amendments are intended to provide a differential per capita establishment grant, based on relative need. Grants would be paid on a sliding scale, depending on each school's SES score. I want to emphasise that this should not be seen in any way as an acceptance of the SES model by us. When we get into government, I am sure there will be other tools available but, given the facilities currently in operation, because it is the only tool currently available, it is the only means by which we can allocate moneys under the current legislative framework.
What we are seeking to do here is basically to provide a logic which would make the establishment grant program consistent with the recurrent grants program and to make sure that the funds are distributed according to a measure of need. What we are seeking to do here is to ensure that all schools will receive a per capita amount. For the wealthiest schools, where the Commonwealth support is at the lowest end—and, I would argue, quite rightly so—the proposed establishment grant of $500 per student would increase the general recurrent grant by almost 80 per cent in primary and 55 per cent in secondary in the first year. For the poorest school communities with the lowest SES scores, the proposed uniform grant of $500 would be increased on general current grants of only 14 per cent for primary and 11 per cent for secondary. Quite clearly, there is a discrepancy in the way in which the government has approached this. I can only presume this is an administrative oversight. I would hate to think we would have to go through yet another series of arguments to demonstrate why it is that the government continues to provide such privileged treatment to those that are already wealthy. Then again no doubt the minister would be able to explain to me why it is that the recurrent grant paid by this arrangement is so favourable to the wealthy schools.
The resource poor schools obviously are in need of greater assistance. Schools such as Reddam House in Sydney, I believe, is one that clearly cannot be seen in the same category—given they have new marble bathrooms and the various other facilities that make it look like a TV studio, as we have already indicated—as schools such as the Ballarat Steiner School, which basically began life in the local village hall in Bungaree. The opposition is prepared to state the principle of differential grants based on need in the legislation and through our amendments to allow the government to bring back the dollar amounts in regulations. That is the approach we are taking here. We are expecting there to be integrity in the government's response. We clearly need to establish what the budgetary implications are of the government's current bill. It is our assumption that current arrangements would lead to a situation which is essentially open-ended. Our measures would provide for a sliding scale of grants to show allocations of $500 in the first year and $250 in the second year which are about the middle point of scale on a range of schools eligible for establishment grants.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2002-03-20,"—I indicate the support of the Democrats for these amendments. Having said that, I also indicate this does not suggest that we believe the SES score is an entirely suitable measure of need. As we all know, there are enormous anomalies in the way the SES score is working, but it may be better than no measure at all and it certainly will move some schools into a more equitable situation. It is a step in the right direction, but the Democrats would like on the record our acknowledgment that the SES is far from a proper tool to be doing this.

(2)	Schedule 1, item 1, page 5 (after line 2), after subsection (6), insert:
	(7)	Expenditure of a payment made in accordance with this section shall be restricted to the purposes of such recurrent establishment costs as may be prescribed.
This amendment seeks to establish the ineligibility of establishment grants funding for a school where the school derives income from school fees and where the average level of the amount of fees derived by the school is equal to an excess of the amount equivalent to a per capita GSRC. We are suggesting schools that are very wealthy are clearly in a different category from schools that are hard up.
Some schools receive from tuition fees alone funding equivalent to the higher or the recurrent resources in government schools. I have indicated to the chamber before that there are schools operating in this country—and I will just list a few—with high fees. Wesley College, for instance, is currently on $13,500 per year per child. We have Toorak College in Melbourne, $12,220 per child. We have Brighton Grammar at $13,075 per child. We have Geelong College, $11,528 per child. We have Geelong Grammar—it is obviously very difficult there—where the fees for each child are $15,820. If you are a boarder in Geelong, I understand the fees are now up to $20,000 per year. At Geelong College, I understand, you can bring your pony along if you really need to. They have stables and various other facilities available. They are obviously a struggling school. Clearly there are differentials—
—Glad you brought its donkey along.
—You mentioned donkeys, Minister, and I have no doubt I could speak at length about the number of donkeys that have dreamt up a scheme like this. It is an extraordinary proposition. You have facilities available for your pet ponies. They are clearly in a different category from a local school that is actually in such a difficult situation.
 (Senator Forshaw)—Excuse me, Senator Carr. Senator Allison, are you raising a point of order?

(5)	Schedule 1, item 1, page 5 (after line 2), after subsection (6), insert:
	(8)	A school is ineligible for establishment grant funding where:
	(a)	the school derives income from student fees; and
	(b)	the average level of the amount of fees derived by a school in paragraph (a) is equal to or in excess of the amount equivalent to per capita AGSRC.
I was explaining—in a persuasive manner, which I have no doubt the government will be moved by—that there are schools operating in this country which cater for the wealthy. Extraordinary wealth is exhibited by these schools; you just have to look at the facilities that are available. That is quite inequitable compared with schools which are not able to attract the high-fee incomes that the category 1 schools can attract. These are elite schools. Therefore, there needs to be a method of allocating funds to provide genuine equality of opportunity for all Australians. That is not the current situation. 
In terms of the policy framework that is being pursued by the Commonwealth, we acknowledge that there are high-fee schools which are receiving per capita grants from both Commonwealth and state governments and that the way in which these are allocated under the SES formula is unfair. There are schools that operate at least 30 per cent above the funding that is provided to public schools. When they are able to charge fees in excess of $10,000 to $15,000, they operate at two to three times the level of resources that are available for public schools. There is a similar pattern for Catholic parish schools, which make up 65 per cent of the non-government sector. There are clearly disparities in the availability of resources, and this is having quite a serious impact on the education system in this country. We argue that there ought to be genuine equality of opportunity and that the only way to do that is with a policy setting that aims to achieve that result.

 (Senator Forshaw)—Is it the wish of the committee that the statements of reasons accompanying the request be incorporated in Hansard. There being no objection, it is so ordered.
The statements read as follows—
Statement pursuant to the order of the Senate of 26 June 2000—
The amendment is circulated as a request because it would have the effect of increasing expenditure under the appropriation in section 111 of the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 2000 by $30million. It therefore increases the “proposed charge or burden on the people” within the meaning of the third paragraph of section 53 of the Constitution.
Statement by the Clerk of the Senate pursuant to the order of the Senate of 26 June 2000—
The Senate has treated as requests amendments which increase expenditure out of appropriations an Act amended by the bill. This request is therefore in accordance with the precedents of the Senate.
This amendment is a recycled ALP amendment from the previous debate on this subject. We feel that it is important that the federal government does not forget that the public sector exists, and there ought to be provision for government schools in this legislation. This is an arbitrary request that capital grants for government schools be increased in the order of $30 million. As I have said earlier in this debate, I spend a lot of time in government schools, and it is disappointing that so many of them exist in poor conditions. Very few government schools have no need of temporary classrooms—so-called portables—and some of these are in appalling condition and are unsuitable places for students to learn and for teachers to teach. Very often they are inadequate in size and planning, and they are very uncomfortable spaces because they are very hot in summer and very cold in winter—and often they leak as well. That is just one example of the poor facilities that government schools often have to put up with. 
I know that there are lots of schools in the non-government sector where money is tight as well, and I have visited a lot of those, but it is rare to find the same sort of struggle for facilities that you so often see in government schools. Schools have to raise money themselves. They very often do not have indoor gymnasium equipment or facilities, and this would go some small way to redressing the imbalance. I know that there is a separate budget for capital works and that is not strictly part of what this legislation is about, but it is a gesture as much as anything. I would welcome the government's support of this gesture when this request reaches the House of Representatives, because the 70 per cent of students in the government sector would feel that they were not being entirely forgotten by this government when it comes to handing out money. That is the purpose of this request. As I said, this request was moved by the ALP last time around, and I would welcome their support.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2002-03-20,"—This is clearly one of those interesting occasions where the Democrats have moved an amendment that Labor have moved in the past. I emphasise that we are committed to fair and equitable funding for all schools, including government schools. One of our great concerns has been—we are quite serious about this—the share of Commonwealth funds going to government schools since the election of this government in 1996. 
What the minister obviously did not have pointed out to him by his officials before he was given the note is that since 1996 Commonwealth funding to all government schools stood at 43 per cent. By 2004, Commonwealth funding will be down to less than 34 per cent. That is an extraordinary shift in anyone's language—moving from 43 per cent down to 34 per cent. In my view, the attitude of essentially undermining the public education system in Australia that is being pursued by this government is in sharp contrast to the traditional view that Liberal governments have pursued. Take for example Robert Menzies' attitude—you will not hear me quote Robert Menzies too often—that the Commonwealth's responsibility lies primarily with public education and public schools. In 1945 he said:
If adequate resources are not available to the states, they will cut their coats according to their cloth and that ought not be allowed to happen. As a nation, we cannot afford to do anything less than our best in a campaign, the result of which will be to determine whether in the New World we are to be a nation of strong, self-reliant, trained and civilised people or whether we are to be content with second-rate standards and more devoted to the pursuit of material advantage than to the achievement of genuine, humane community spirit.
Those are the sorts of lofty values that were expressed by Menzies. That is not the approach being pursued by this government. 
Labor are committed to genuine equality of opportunity for all Australians. This government is committed to the provision of special, privileged assistance to those who are already privileged. It is important for the Senate to be clear as to Labor's view on this issue. In all conscience, we cannot hold up this piece of legislation in that light as an example of good public policy, because it continues the trend established in the original states grants bill. The legislation we have before us goes to a program, however, of ancillary assistance, of additional funding for new non-government schools. 
The principles have to be brought to bear, and I have demonstrated they have been brought to bear by the opposition in our assessment of this legislation that allocates public funds for schools. What is sorely needed is a return to a rational and equitable system of public funding for children in all schools across this country. That is what we are committed to. We are looking for a comprehensive policy review. My colleague Ms Macklin is undertaking a comprehensive policy review of assistance that should be led by the Commonwealth to the children of this country. That will lead, in my judgment, to a new policy framework which will see schools funded under a Labor government on the basis of need—and that is all schools, not just government schools and not just non-government schools or newly established schools.
Last year, when this legislation was debated, we sought to increase funding under the Commonwealth establishment grants program. We are contemplating a situation where we might well have assumed we would be in government after the last election. If it were not for the particular directions followed by the Howard government in regard to certain issues of race, it may well have occurred. It may well have occurred had this government not adopted such a despicable position with regard to the manipulation of the race card. Had a Labor government been elected, there would have been the opportunity to undertake a thorough revamp of the establishment grants program, especially its administration and eligibility criteria, to bring funding to government schools. In that context, the measures it was appropriate to pursue at that time are not those being proposed today—they were entirely different circumstances. We are now faced with the circumstance where Australian schools are to be subject to the deprivations of Dr Kemp and the Howard government—and, whether he likes it or not, Dr Nelson is becoming the inheritor of Dr Kemp's ideology.
These circumstances behove the opposition to seek amendments to this legislation that will strengthen the positive public policy implications in terms of the establishment grants program and target funds to needier schools rather than the wealthier schools. The ones that do not need it should not get it. We ought to be able to provide a mechanism to clean up the administrative nightmare—in my opinion, the shameful mess—which has resulted from the failure of this government to face up to its responsibilities with regard to this area of schools policy.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2002-03-20,"—As Senator Allison indicated, this is a recycled ALP amendment—which even the ALP do not believe is worthy of support. Senator Carr sought to make some points in his contribution, but the facts need to be pointed out. Senator Carr referred to an alleged decrease from 43 per cent to 34 per cent in relation to funding by the Commonwealth for state government schools, which represents a nine per cent difference. Let me make two points about that. During the same period, non-government school enrolments increased not by nine per cent but by 16 per cent. Therefore, for the number of students it looks after, the state government sector in fact got an increase in real terms.
This is a philosophical argument that has been bantered backwards and forwards during the course of this debate. The Australian Labor Party and others are locked into a fixed ideological position which is often based on the politics of envy. Basically, we as a government say that, if people are prepared to invest from their private funds in the education of their children, they should not be denied access to support to which they would otherwise be entitled to, albeit on a different basis to those who are more in need. I wanted to clarify that for the record so that, in the event that any people trawl through the Hansard or anyone perhaps is listening, there is no suggestion that what Senator Carr is asserting is in fact the truth. It is part of the truth but, as is so often his wont, he can quote a bit of the truth but misrepresent the total position, and that has unfortunately occurred throughout this debate. Just for the record, of the specific schools budget measures in the 2001 budget, 87 per cent of the funding was directed to the 69 per cent of students in the government sector. 
That is the beauty of this government. This government has increased funding to both the government and non-government sectors—and the mums and dads of Australia realise and accept that. We do not try to play the wedge politics of division between the mums and dads to choose state education as opposed to non-government education. We say that both sectors should be looked after and should not be denigrated by the sort of terminology that we have had to listen to during the course of this debate. We as a government are supportive of both systems. Indeed, our very own Prime Minister is the product of the state system, as am I, and we are both committed to its adequate and ongoing funding.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-20,"—The mums and dads of Australia, by and large, send their children to public schools. That is the first thing to be said. Many of the mums and dads of Australia do not have the choices that are open to some of the mums and dads who are fortunately able to select between private schools and the public school system. The public school system is set up to ensure that there is a fair opportunity for every child who goes out the door in the morning to have her or his educational needs fulfilled and life opportunities opened up. But in the last decade or so the overall funding of education—if you compare it with spending at the start of the last decade—has dropped by more than $1 billion in this country. We are way back in the field when it comes to the proportion of the gross domestic product that goes into education. That has happened not only under the Howard government but also under previous Labor governments, but it has been accelerating.
One of the great problems is that, at the moment, not only has the number of dollars going into education diminished but also there is a diversionary process. That involves diverting money to the private school sector. No-one is going to say that that sector should not be there and no-one is going to say that anybody's choice to go to that sector should be enhanced beyond the already discriminatory positions that families find themselves in—where some people have the money and some people have not. What the Australian Greens are arguing is that we are here dealing with public funding and we are dealing with public education, and those two things go together. Private funding and private education go together as well. I know the arguments there are across the line on that, but what I am concerned about is the continually increasing difficulties for people in the public education system—not least the teachers and the students. The Democrats amendment moved by Senator Allison—which was the Labor Party's position but this has apparently now been abandoned—attempts to help hold the line as far as funding of the public school system in Australia is concerned, and the Australian Greens support it.
 (Senator Forshaw)—The question is that the request for an amendment moved by Senator Allison be agreed to.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-20,"—I move Australian Greens amendment (R1) on sheet 2470:
(R1)	Schedule 1, item 1, page 5 (after line 2), after subsection (6), insert:
	(7)	Where a new school applies for an establishment amount in accordance with this section:
	(a)	the Minister must cause all government schools within a 10 kilometre radius of the school making the application to be notified of that application;
	(b)	a school which has been notified in accordance with paragraph (a) may make a submission notifying that payment of an establishment amount is a risk to its viability, diversity or enrolment numbers;
	(c)	a submission made in accordance with paragraph (b) will be considered by the Ministerial Council on Education and Youth Affairs or its delegate;
	(d)	following consideration in accordance with paragraph (c), the Council may make a determination that a school is ineligible for establishment grant funding.
	(8)	The Minister may not make a determination in accordance with subsection (1) or (2) until the requirements in subsection (7) have been met.
This amendment means that, where new private schools are set up, the nearby public schools will have the opportunity to notify the government about the effect that will have on their enrolments and, therefore, on their financial viability. These things do not happen in isolation. There is a real concern that, where you get public school students being inveigled across to the private school system, they not only leave and go to the other school but also take money with them. It is public money, and it is a lot of public money. That further squeezes the ability of the public schools not only to survive but to produce the comprehensive and varied opportunities in education that the private school system is so good at advertising at the moment.
I recommend this amendment. It will allow government schools within a 10-kilometre radius of a new private school to make application and to notify ministers that there is a risk to their viability, their diversity and their enrolment numbers. It will also allow them to approach the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs or their delegate to inform them about this so that the council can then make a determination as to whether the private school that wishes to apply is eligible or otherwise for the establishment grant. The minister, finally, may not make a determination about this until that advice from the council is forthcoming. It is a system that says, `Let us hear back from the community which is going to be affected and the public school system that is going to be affected. Let us make sure that the impact on them of the establishment grants that we are dealing with here is known and fully assessed before we proceed.'",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2002-03-20,"—I indicate to Senator Brown that the Labor Party does support the principle of this planned provision. I have indicated already that the McKinley report on these matters—and there are two volumes of that report: 1995 and 1996—highlighted some important issues which remain valid in our considerations today. In particular, on the so-called issue of choice I think that the general rhetorical concept, which is worked so hard by the other side of the chamber on these matters, is very difficult to translate into a particular program which actually guarantees at the same time equality of opportunity. There is clearly a major contradiction in the way in which that principle is applied to the actual operations of schools. As I put it before, I think it is simply the case that the question of one person's choice may well be at the expense of another person's choice. That is apparent, I think, if you know anything about education at all.
In fact, the question of choice is not an unambiguous good; increasing choices for some obviously has effects on others. If you take a certain block of students away from a particular school, that undermines the capacity for other students in the school in terms of the curriculum offerings, the teachers that are available, the facilities that are available and so on and so forth. 
In terms of the general principle there is considerable merit, but your amendments, Senator Brown, we unfortunately did not have the opportunity to discuss with you. We did offer the opportunity to you to do that, but we did not hear back from you. It would have been better for us, I think, to have had an understanding of the way in which you have drafted this proposition. The source of the formula listed here is not clear to us; the intent of the formula is not clear to us. In that context, it is difficult for us to agree to it. Furthermore, if you look at your amendment, it goes to the issue of funding for government schools, not necessarily the issue of funding for establishment purposes for non-government schools. In that context, if it is in fact about planned provision for public education then there is a need for a much more substantive consideration of these issues and it ought to be done properly. This amendment does not fulfil those criteria and we are not able to support it.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2002-03-20,"—I just want to indicate that, likewise, the Democrats think that this is a worthy objective, but I draw Senator Brown's attention to the second reading amendment where we set out to put in place what is commonly known as planned educational provision where there is a multiplicity of methods by which the establishment of a new school needs to be judged. I think it is a fine idea to invite schools around the immediate area of a new school to make submissions but I am concerned about the distance over which this would take place—a 10-kilometre radius is a 20-kilometre diameter—and if you put that kind of circle over any metropolitan area, you will pick up a great number of schools. So administratively it would be, I think, quite difficult. 
I am also a little unclear as to the role of the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs. In doing this, it seems that this body might not be the proper one for such an arrangement. Like the ALP, I think that it is a worthy objective. I think that what we are getting at here is a better way of planning new schools so that money is not wasted on those which will turn out to be unviable or those which will make other schools unviable. It is useful to have such a tool but, in our view, the Democrats second reading amendment does this with greater effectiveness.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-20,"—I do not accept either of those arguments. The fact is that we have now had three amendments come up in a row, one of which was the Labor Party's own amendment last time around, about which the Labor Party has effectively said, `What a great idea—we oppose it. It is the sort of sentiment that we support, but give us the opportunity and we will vote it down.' That is part of the problem with the process whereby the public school system is losing out. The Labor Party is just not sticking to the principle it espouses when it gets the opportunity to drive it home using the numbers that we have here in the Senate. 
I recognise that these are difficult matters to implement, but you cannot abandon the pursuit of finding the legislative tools that are required to make sure that this runaway diversion of funds from the public school system is halted and the consideration of the impact it is having on the millions of children who go to the public school system, which is becoming very much a second-class system. We need to assess the impact of that and then do something about it. That is the important thing, doing something about it. There may be only one Australian Green in this place but we have been able, with the help of people in the education community, to come up with at least a device. I do not accept that, because that device may be imperfect, therefore you abandon the effort to make things fairer. If it is not good enough, where is the Labor amendment that is doing better? I accept Senator Allison saying that a second reading amendment would have been an alternative, but this amendment is real, it is here and it is now.
—My second reading amendment has been passed.
—Yes, but it is not implementing this provision, and this is not in conflict with it. Might I add to Senator Allison that the reason for introducing the ministerial council is to ensure that at the end of the day the federal minister for education simply cannot ignore this provision, because we know that the federal government is biased against the public school system. So, yes, I accept that this is an imperfect instrument, but it is better than not having one, and the Labor Party should be supporting it.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2002-03-20,"—Just to make it clear what the second reading amendment does, I will quickly run through the first part of it. It is to establish:
... a Planned Educational Resource Allocation Committee to assess applications for funding for the establishment of new schools in each State and Territory. This committee will comprise representatives of the Commonwealth Department of Education, Science and Training, government and non-government school employing authorities, parents and teacher unions. This Committee shall advise the Minister on the funding of new schools, taking into consideration the following:
(i) the duplication of educational services in an area;
(ii) the impact of the establishment of the new school on surrounding schools;
(iii) the willingness of the school to cooperate with other schools in the sharing of resources;
(iv) the level of determined community need for the new school;
(v) the financial viability of the new school;
and a couple of other measures. So the second reading amendment may not be in conflict, but certainly the requirements under this amendment would be, I guess, taken care of already in the amendment that was put up.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-20,"—I thank Senator Allison for that, but the answer is not quite. While the Democrats amendment is advisory, the Greens amendment takes the action that gives the ministerial council the ability to make a determination here in response to the community. That is very different to giving advice to the minister, because we by and large know what happens when you advise a minister of the Howard government in favour of the public school system. The private school system is going to have the wherewithal to carry the day there because that is the way lobbying is going currently. I reiterate that we are seeing a rapid deterioration of the ability of the public school system to deliver anything like the facilities and opportunities of the wealthy private school system. That is the reality. 
The question we have to ask in this egalitarian country of ours is whether it is right that millions of students are having their ability to have a varied, opportunity enhancing and skills enhancing education diminished so that those in already wealthy schools can have their opportunities and advantages enhanced. My answer to that is, yes, the choice is there for people to privately establish schools and develop them and give alternatives to the public school system. But we are in a nation where the public school system is being seriously eroded in its ability to give the sort of education to Australian children that we all want for them. Without investing in Australian children to the degree which is going to maximise their opportunities, we are selling short the future of the country itself. 
It is easy to come up with rhetoric like that but that is the reality, and you have to do the comparison on two scores. Firstly, how were we funding public education in this nation 10 to 20 years ago? The answer is billions of dollars ahead of where we are now. The second indicator is, how do we rate with similar countries around the world, the OECD nations, for example? We are right at the back of the pack. Injecting $1 billion, $2 billion or $3 billion more into public education would simply bring us up to mid-range. We are many billions of dollars short of being at the front, where Australians would expect their public school system should be. Yet here we are dealing with legislation which is giving millions more to the private school system, which opens up opportunities for a minority of children. I would like to see the public school system be able to give the options that the private school system is increasingly able to give as more and more public funding goes across to it. But you cannot do that unless you give the public school system the funding, and in doing so you have to vote an endorsement to the teachers, and indeed the administrators, in the public school system who strive so hard not to be demoralised by this process that is occurring in Australia.
The Senate has the opportunity to say to this government that enough is enough, that we are going to turn around this imbalance and this drift towards disadvantage in the public school system. It is a real disadvantage. I am not saying that the public school system is doing well so why don't we give some to the private school system. I am saying the public school system is doing poorly in terms of funding. As the dollars dry up for the public school system, it is very easy for the government, for ministers and Prime Minister Howard to simply say, `If the teachers do better the results will stay up.' Go and speak to those teachers, ask them about the esteem they have for the system and about the happiness with which they are able to deliver education today, as against 10 or 20 years ago. It is unfair but, worse than that, it is creating disadvantage for a great number of young Australians. Yes, these Greens amendments are tough: there is lateral thinking in them. But they are to deal with the disadvantage that the government is dishing up through this and other pieces of legislation we have seen go through this place since 1996. I say to both the Democrats and the Labor Party: support this amendment from the Australian Greens. If you do not support it, where is the alternative with teeth in it?

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-20,"—I move:
(R2)	Schedule 1, item 1, page 5 (after line 2), after subsection (6), insert:
	(9)	Where a new school receives an establishment amount in accordance with this section:
	(a)	all government schools shall be eligible for a stabilisation grant if they are within a 10 kilometre radius of a new school receiving an establishment amount;
(b)	the amount under paragraph (a) for a program year in relation to a school must not exceed the amount worked out using the formula: 

Establishment amount for the program year
x
(((((
Number of primarystudents for the school for the program year
+
Number of secondary students for the school for the program year
)))))
x 2.33
This amendment reads that where a new school receives an establishment amount in accordance with this section—remember this is for a new school in the private sector—then, firstly, all government schools shall be eligible for a stabilisation grant if they are within the 10-kilometre radius of that school and, secondly, the amount will be worked out under a formula, which is given there, which basically says that 70 per cent goes to the public school system and 30 per cent goes to the private school system.
I admit that this is a fairly blunt instrument, but I challenge those who say that it is and ask them to come up with something better. Let us not ignore this opportunity to ensure that public schools in the region of those private schools that are getting largesse through this legislation get their fair amount. Seventy per cent of children go to the public school system and 30 per cent go to the private school system. Let us have the allocation divided accordingly.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-20,"—I can answer Senator Allison.

We actually had a look at what 10 kilometres would mean in metropolitan areas. When we looked at a circle on a map, you could get 44 schools in one area.

	Schedule 1, item 1, page 5 (after line 2), after section 75, insert:
75A  Review of grants to provide establishment assistance
	(1)	The Minister must cause a review of establishment grants to be conducted by the Department of Education Science and Training.
	(2)	The review is to include an assessment of the extent to which payments made in accordance with this Act have been successful in meeting the recurrent establishment costs of new schools with particular reference to the:
	(a)	eligibility; and
	(b)	accountability and transparency; and
	(c)	administration of the payment of establishment grants.
	(3)	In conducting the review required by this section, the Department must establish and consult with an external reference group representative of school authorities and organisations.
	(4)	A report of the review conducted in accordance with this section must be made publicly available before the expiration of the 2003 calendar year.
This revised amendment (6), like all our propositions moved today, is very reasonable and fair and is moved to address the concerns that have been expressed right across the education community. There are deep issues in regard to the problems with the administration of this program, in regard to the eligibility of schools under this program and in regard to the accountability mechanisms under this program.
The Labor Party has very deep concerns regarding the equity of this program. A series of administrative anomalies and apparent misallocations of funds have been identified from the very beginning of this program. We have genuinely sought to propose changes which would strengthen the administration of this program and target funding to schools that actually need it. We have provided the government with plenty of flexibility and plenty of opportunity to address those concerns. We have, in fact, been remarkably unprescriptive with the detail. 
We hold these amendments very strongly. The issue we have particular concerns about—and I want to emphasise this so that the government understands—is the review. It is critical to our approach to this bill. What we are proposing here and what we want an understanding from the government on is that the review will address the fundamental concerns we have pursued throughout this debate—that is, the eligibility of schools for establishment grants, the accountability of the schools receiving those grants, the transparency of operation of the program and the effectiveness and efficiency of the administration of the government's program. That is why we are proposing that the review include an assessment of the extent to which payments, made in accordance with the act, have been successful in meeting the recurrent establishment grant cost of schools and that it look at eligibility, accountability and administration. 
We are proposing the establishment of a representative reference group of school authorities and organisations that would allow people who are actually deeply concerned about these matters to have an input into the review of the government's program, that the report be made public and that it be concluded in 18 months. There is plenty of time for the government to see how it is running. I have obviously expressed my deep concern about the program using the evidence available to the opposition. I trust that this amendment finds the support of the chamber. I do not expect the government to support it, but I strongly urge the government to think about the message that will go from this chamber to the House and will come back to us tomorrow, presumably.

The bill provides time for services to address what deficiencies they might have at the moment. From January 2005, if it is not a quality service it will not be funded. That might seem a long way away, but we are in 2002. These services do need time to adjust.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2002-03-20,"—This evening the Senate is considering the Migration Legislation Amendment (Transitional Movement) Bill 2002. This legislation could be summed up as legislation that is required to patch up legislation that the government initiated last year. It has been very apparent since the election that the government's plasterboard, if you like, has developed a number of serious cracks on a number of serious issues. In particular, in the area of issues relating to migration it is well known that the so-called `children overboard' affair where we know that no children ever went overboard—the truth very quickly went overboard but certainly no children ever went overboard during that affair—we have had—
—The boat sank.
—Senator McGauran, do you really want to maintain the fiction after we have seen doctored photographs and false reports? I certainly hope you have the same hope I have to be out of here by Friday. To progress further with the cracks that have developed in the government's plasterboard, we have had the problems with the Treasurer's management of the currency swap deals—a potential $5 billion loss—the Wooldridge health fiasco and the Heffernan debacle. It has been one mess after another. But here we are tonight attempting to patch up problems that have arisen from the government's approach to the legislation it initiated last year. 
We have asylum seekers under the so-called Pacific solution on Manus Island and on Nauru. They fall, for legal purposes, into two classes: those who are referred to under current legislation as offshore entry persons and those who are not covered by the parameters of that definition. What is the difference? An offshore entry person is a person who touched Ashmore Reef or Christmas Island after they were excised from the migration zone. For that category of person, the current legislation provides that if they were brought to Australia for any purpose—whether it be a medical evacuation, whether it be because they were required to give evidence in people-smuggling trials or whether it be for any other purpose—they would be barred from making an onshore Australian protection claim.
Then there is another set of asylum seekers, and they are persons who are intercepted at sea. These are persons who never touched Ashmore Reef or Christmas Island. The most celebrated of those in the media are the persons who were on the Tampa. But there have been a number of other at-sea intercepts, and the basic reason we have this bill is that when the government drafted and brought before the parliament late last year its package of legislation in relation to asylum seekers it forgot to deal with this first class of person—the class of person who was intercepted at sea, the class of person who does not fall within the definition of being an offshore entry and, consequently, the class of person who, if they were brought to Australia, would be unable to make an onshore protection claim.
So the legislation we are dealing with is a bandaid solution to the so-called Pacific solution. The government would not have required this patch or bandaid if they had dealt with the matter appropriately in the first instance, and they failed to do so. Why did they fail to do so? We all know—and the Labor Party has consistently said—that the so-called Pacific solution was more about getting a solution to re-elect the government of the day as part of their election strategy and for however long they could sustain it beyond election day. It was not very long. Rather than being a comprehensive long-term solution to the issue of asylum seekers, it was conceived and implemented in haste. Its primary purpose was for electoral advantage rather than being an appropriate and proper public policy instrument in dealing with the question of asylum seekers, and this is now very clearly starting to show.
We saw a number of announcements—I think it was two—approximately two weeks ago that further demonstrate the unravelling of the so-called Pacific solution. The first of these related to the government announcement to construct a 1,200-person detention facility on Christmas Island. I put the simple proposition to the Senate that, if the so-called Pacific solution is working, if the so-called Pacific solution is deterring further arrivals, why would the Australian government be building a 1,200-person detention facility, unless the government has simply taken leave of its senses and decided to start constructing buildings which will be perpetually empty? One would have to assume that it is engaging in this construction project because it expects further arrivals. So the so-called Pacific solution, on the government's own announced plans, is not working. It is not deterring further arrivals, and the government is making provision for significant numbers of further arrivals.
Then we have this legislation which makes very clear another part of the unravelling of the so-called Pacific solution. The public imagery that the government has always used in relation to the Pacific solution is that the asylum seekers would never, ever—a promise made over and over again by the Prime Minister; those `never, ever' words still run through my memory in respect to another matter—under any circumstances set foot on Australian soil. That is what the government has always claimed. Indeed, I remember going to polling booths during the election campaign—Senator McGauran has got a wry smile—and seeing grand banners with the Prime Minister's pronouncement, `We will determine who sets foot in Australia.' It may have contributed to and worked for your re-election, but this bill directly contradicts the Prime Minister's never, ever promise in what it represents. The government engaged in the so-called Pacific solution because it was going to be tough on the question of who came to Australia and it was going to keep all of these asylum seekers off Australian soil and put them on Manus Island and Nauru. We do know from the time of the Tampa—and let us remember that this legislation applies directly to people who were on the Tampa—that the Prime Minister was very clear about this question. Let me refer at this point to a story that was carried in the Weekend Australian around the time of the Tampa crisis. It was headed `PM weighs his anger in stormy seas', using what I think from looking at these headlines was a mixed metaphor. But, in any event, the first two paragraphs of this article say:
John Howard—
that is the newspaper's reference—
strode into the Australian's Parliament House office late on Wednesday night bristling with nervous energy. “That boat will never land in our waters, never!” he emphatically told a small group of reporters.
Aside from the fact that I do not think a boat can land in waters, it went on:
The politician whose career is a testament to his stubbornness, appeared to be operating on pure adrenaline at the end of one of the most dramatic days of his Prime Ministership. Howard's eyes bulged; his face reddened and he shifted restlessly as he spoke.
All of us I think would be quite grateful we were not witnessing this incident. I think another senator in this place might have witnessed something approaching this earlier in the week. We can only pity the group of reporters that was subject to this display. This was the imagery: `We will keep these people from Australia!' It was reminiscent of a British Prime Minister: `We shall fight them on the beaches, we shall fight in the hills'. The Prime Minister was so excited about it that his face reddened and his eyes bulged. He was always going to keep these people away from Australia. Not only did he make this statement to the Australian but he was asked by radio presenter Neil Mitchell on 3AW:
Is there any circumstance under which you would allow them to land in Australia?
The Prime Minister responded:
Our position is they should not be allowed to land in Australia.
And it went on and on with various language being used, including `never, ever'. Were these people going to be allowed to arrive in Australia? Under no circumstances. As I alluded to earlier, when the Prime Minister makes a promise, with those famous words `never, ever', we know what the most likely outcome is. As the Australian people know, there is generally a complete reversal, and that is what is happening in this case. 
We know from this legislation before the Senate, and as discussed before the House, that true to form, when the Prime Minister is out there saying over his dead body will asylum seekers off the Tampa gain access to Australian soil, more likely than not the complete reversal is about to happen—albeit of course after the election, not before the election. This bill tells us that the government wants legislative authority to allow this complete reversal to occur. This bill is legislative authority for the government to bring the Tampa asylum seekers and other asylum seekers who are intercepted at sea—you guessed it—onshore, where we were told they were never, ever going to be. 
As I indicated earlier, the government could have dealt with these matters last year. If they are going to deal with these matters now, they should make it perfectly clear that they are doing this, because they are intending to breach the promises they made to the Australian community that these asylum seekers would never come to Australia. Of course, the Australian people are capable of weighing the worth of the word of the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, who gave assurances in respect to these matters. 
I now come to the Labor Party's position on the bill, and in stating my concerns about the legislation I have regard to an amendment I understand will be moved by the government that does take into account at least a part of the concerns that I outline here tonight and were outlined by my colleague our shadow minister for migration, Ms Gillard, in the other place who, I might say, is doing a great job in that capacity. I would like to address some of those concerns in detail. The Labor Party understands that people who are currently held on Nauru or on Manus Island and who fall into the category of not being covered by the current legislation—that is, that they were intercepted at sea and that currently, if brought to Australia, they could make onshore protection claims—might from time to time require to be medically evacuated to Australia.
As we understand it, that has happened on at least one occasion from Nauru. On that occasion, the government engaged in a bit of a fiction, frankly, by giving that person a special entry permit that was timed to expire at midnight on the day they arrived. They entered Australia lawfully so that the department could not be accused of people-smuggling, but once the clock struck midnight they were in Australia unlawfully so that they could not make an onshore protection claim. Presumably there were some farcical arrangements about keeping the asylum seeker in question incommunicado for the period up to midnight so that they could not make an onshore protection claim. Presumably they were given their anaesthetic as they got off the plane—even if it might have been four or five hours until their treatment—so they could not sign a claim form between then and midnight. This is the sort of—
—Maybe Julian spoke to them for two hours.
—In the interests of pressing on, we will ignore that remark, but I do want it recorded in Hansard. To move on, one can only speculate about what would have happened if the plane had been delayed and landed after midnight and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs itself had been responsible for bringing someone into Australia unlawfully. That could well have happened. It could have happened if they had been on an Ansett flight, I suppose. We know, of course, that medical evacuations have occurred under these circumstances.
In relation to this piece of legislation, Labor accepts that there is nothing about the circumstances of being involved in a medical evacuation that ought to affect the substance of someone's legal rights. We understand that the legislation is, therefore, required to prevent someone who is medically evacuated to Australia from making an onshore claim. We take the same view about persons who might be brought to Australia to give evidence during people-smuggling trials. There is nothing about the circumstances of being required to be a witness in a trial of any nature that ought to change the legal position of an asylum seeker in relation to making an onshore protection claim.
Labor accepts that, when processing is fully completed on Nauru and on Manus Island, there will be a number of people who will be found to be genuine refugees and that some of those genuine refugees will be found long-term homes in third countries—that is, there will be other nations on the planet who will step forward and say that they are prepared to accept and look after those genuine refugees in the long term. Labor accepts that those persons may need to be transited through Australia on their way to their long-term homes—in fact, it may only be possible to transit them through Australia, given the fairly isolated nature of Nauru and their economy and the airline that is staggering through the sky at the present time. Labor accepts that they ought not to be able to make an onshore protection claim during that transit. That would be absurd. We understand the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees is not about asylum seekers forum shopping about which developed nation they would like to go to as they go through departure lounges. If they have a place where they are going to be safe and secure, they ought not to be able to make an onshore claim in transit to that place.
Then we come to the category of persons who are found not to be genuine refugees. Labor understands about that and always has. In government, Labor implemented a system whereby such persons were removed from Australia, either to their country of origin or to a third country in which they had a right to live. Labor has always understood that. The way in which the government occasionally tries to characterise us as not understanding and not being prepared to implement such a policy is really all about electoral misrepresentation and little about the truth. We accept that people who do not pass the test of being genuine refugees need to be removed. In some circumstances removals happen quickly, and in some circumstances they are very difficult.
In the positive suggestions made by my colleague Ms Gillard in the other place, we are saying that if such persons who are not genuine refugees are brought back to Australia and held in Australian centres pending removal and if the government is for some reason unable to affect that removal within six months, despite the asylum seekers cooperating with the process—so we are not in the business of saying anyone should be rewarded for non-cooperation—those persons should be able to have their claims assessed by the Refugee Review Tribunal. We want to be absolutely clear about this: we do not want the clock started again on processing. Processing of these asylum seekers has happened in Nauru and in PNG. Some of that processing may have been done by the UNHCR and some may have been done by the immigration department. We are not asking for that processing to be done again; rather we are asking that, where the government has not been able to remove them, the limited numbers of asylum seekers who are in that situation complete the processing they would have been entitled to had they come to Australia at the outset—that is, they go to the Refugee Review Tribunal.
I come to the second and very important positive suggestion made in my colleague's speech in the second reading debate in the other place. It is a very important and positive initiative. We all know that many of the asylum seekers presently in Australia, on Manus Island and on Nauru come from Afghanistan. Why did they come? Some came because they were fleeing the Taliban; some came because they were fleeing other sources of persecution; many came because the nation was unstable. We know that Afghanistan has been involved in a war, and still is. It is a war against terrorism, in which we have fielded troops. We know that Afghanistan is the most mined nation on earth. We know that the new government is struggling to stabilise the nation, and we know that there are major infrastructure problems and major problems with food, with shelter and with meeting people's medical needs. For persons from Afghanistan currently in Australia, there will be a time when most of them can go home. Some of them will be found to be genuine refugees because they were persecuted for reasons other than the Taliban regime. I am not speaking about that class of person; I am speaking about the people who, although they have been found not to be genuine refugees, cannot return home in the short term because of the situation in Afghanistan but will be able to return home at some point. I am sure that all of us in the Senate hope that point comes soon and that Afghanistan stabilises quickly, within six to 12 months, so that the people who are there and the people who return can rebuild their lives in safety and in peace. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TRANSITIONAL MOVEMENT) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-03-20,"—I rise to speak on behalf of the Australian Democrats to the Migration Legislation Amendment (Transitional Movement) Bill 2002. It is a fairly small bill but a very significant bill. I think it is one that requires appropriate scrutiny because it puts in place yet another new and, in my view, unprecedented approach to dealing with people and their potential for claiming protection and seeking asylum under the Refugee Convention.
The public would be well aware, and the Senate would remember, the shameful day last year when six bills were guillotined through this place. A couple of them had been introduced just the previous week with dramatic new powers, a dramatic removal of rights for a whole range of people, including Australians, and a complete inability for the Senate to be able to scrutinise the consequences of that package of legislation. Indeed, the Senate even now has not had much opportunity to scrutinise the consequences of those changes or the way the so-called Pacific solution and the various other aspects of this government's handling of asylum and refugee matters is being conducted. Unfortunately, despite all the outrage at the time and despite the quite strong post-election criticism of the Labor Party for rolling over and accepting the whole package of the government's legislation and the government's whole policy on legislation, we see again today in just the third sitting week of a new government the Labor Party doing it again and accepting the government's legislation.
There are a couple of amendments the government have circulated that have just appeared in the last few minutes. I have had some warning of those because of the attempts by the office of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to be cooperative. Probably the only positive thing I will say about this bill is that the minister's staff and department staff are always as helpful as they can be in assisting and providing briefings and explanations. But the fact is that the wording of this amendment was settled on only earlier today and its circulation occurred only a few minutes ago. The general public and those with expertise out of community obviously have no knowledge of what the amendment is, what it contains and what its consequences might be. Whilst there are some learned minds in the Senate, I think it would be saying a bit much for us all to assume we are the ultimate experts on issues like this. Obviously we are charged with making the final decision, but to make decisions like that without the opportunity to consult with those who have expertise is a very dangerous practice and a very poor practice. Unfortunately it is a practice this government is quite happy to perpetrate.
In some ways I can perhaps partly understand the rationale behind the Labor Party's willingness to accept this bill. I cannot understand why they are willing to allow it to be rushed through so quickly without proper scrutiny. It is hard not to come to the conclusion that the Labor Party are hoping to avoid scrutiny about their actions here. They do not want another gap of five or six weeks where the public can actually be aware of what is being done, and they would have pressure and internal tensions and divisions occurring if this matter were not flipped through without any people being aware of it. It is hard to think of any other motivation for the Labor Party's decision to allow this bill to be rushed through in such a disgracefully speedy manner.
For those who were not listening earlier today, this bill was introduced only a week ago in the House of Representatives. There was no foreshadowing by the government or the minister that any move along these lines was being considered. Two other bills came in at the same time. The government was quite happy to send those two bills to a Senate committee for extensive consideration with a report back in May. But this one, which is probably the most far-reaching, is basically being railroaded through. Attempts by the Democrats to get a meaningful Senate inquiry were stymied. Instead, we are having to debate this in the chamber without any opportunity for proper broad input and scrutiny.
I should emphasise that, as always, the Democrats will attempt to be cooperative. But there are significant issues raised by this legislation, as well as the package of legislation last year that this relates to. We have not had the opportunity to get information and answers to questions on the record. Certainly the Democrats will be using the committee stage of this debate to explore some of those issues and some of the very significant precedents occurring as a consequence of this legislation.
The government should note before they try to suggest there is any attempt by the Democrats to filibuster or frustrate the government's program that we have not stacked the speakers list. I am the only Democrat speaker on this bill. If we were simply wanting to hold this off and try to talk it out and force it to be not considered until May, then we would be stacking the speakers list with all of my colleagues. We have not done that, and I mention that to the government, although the relevant minister who should be here when the committee stage comes on is not at the moment. Perhaps his advisers can pass on to him my comment of good faith. It is a demonstration of good faith and I hope the minister will respond by actually giving answers to the questions we ask in the committee stage. Many times ministers tend not to really provide much in the way of answers to direct questions in the committee stage, particularly if they feel it is just a deliberate filibustering process. I hope the government can recognise, by the fact we have only one Democrat speaker in the second reading debate, that if we do ask extensive questions it is not because it is a filibuster but because there are important questions we need to get answers to on the record—answers on the record not just for the satisfaction or the intellectual curiosity of the Democrats but for the assistance of the many people in Australia who are concerned about these issues and the many people in Australia who work tirelessly to assist asylum seekers. There is still a lot of uncertainty and confusion in the general community about how the new migration act and rules operate in practice and what they are going to mean. There is still confusion about what the future holds for the people on Manus Island and Nauru. This bill obviously links very much to that uncertainty. It will not remove uncertainty, but it will give the government even more flexibility to do whatever it wants with those people, with their having no rights at all.
I want to examine more specifically what is contained in this bill. I will not talk to the government amendments yet, because they are not part of the bill, but I will talk to those in the committee stage. I will say that the amendments are very significant. I know that they have been sorted out in consultation with the ALP and, to some extent, that consultation has been communicated to the Democrats. I acknowledge that. The amendments basically create a new area of activity for the Refugee Review Tribunal—that is a pretty significant thing to do—and another power for the secretary to the department; that is, the power to eliminate a person's rights without any opportunity for appeal in a whole new area of activity. I will be exploring those amendments later. 
We have had a farcical time frame for this legislation. We have had one week from when it first appeared—one week with the initial bill and we have had five minutes with these amendments. We have not had the whole bill for even a week. So to suggest that there could have been any meaningful committee inquiry into this bill, with a one-day hearing last Friday, is a joke. We would not even have been inquiring into the final bill. We would have had a significant new section, as represented by these amendments, that the committee would not have been able to inquire into. It would not have even been aware they were being contemplated. That again highlights the flaw in this process. I know the government does not care about that, but I am concerned that the ALP is apparently willing to allow that to go unchallenged. It is about appropriate processes in the chamber and treating the parliament with some measure of respect, not with such a level of contempt. When this sort of thing happens, it does make it very difficult to be cooperative on other issues.
The bill creates yet another category of person. There have been many new categories—new visa categories, new criteria, new definitions of people, and new boxes that people get slotted into—created in the last few years but particularly in the last six months. Under this bill we will now have a new category under the Migration Act of a transitory person. In shorthand, a transitory person is someone who has been intercepted at sea and taken to one of the offshore entry places—Manus Island, Nauru or any of the places that have been excised from the migration zone. Basically it is anybody who got to Christmas Island or Cocos (Keeling) Islands or who got intercepted at sea and taken to one of the other places. The reason why this category is being created is to allow people who are defined as transitory persons to enter mainland Australia but not to have access to any rights. Basically, it will mean that, even if they get into Australia, they are not in Australia for the purposes of the Migration Act. In effect, this extends the excision zone by another means. So we no longer excise Christmas Island or Cocos (Keeling) Islands. For these so-called transitory people, we would excise all of Australia. Australia will no longer be in the migration zone for the purposes of this category of transitory people. That is the effect of it. 
This is actually a massive expansion; it is not a retreat, in the view of the Democrats, as has been suggested by the Leader of the Opposition and others. It is not a retreat from the Pacific solution; it is locking in the intent of it, which was to remove asylum seekers from the processes that have been built up over years of proper assessment of asylum claims. All of these people will now be removed from those processes. They will be in Australia but they will not be able to engage in our protection obligations. That is a very serious degradation, in the Democrats' view. It may be that there is a short-term benefit for some people who are on Nauru and Manus Island. Transitory persons will still be under detention when they are brought into Australia. Technically they are not in detention on Nauru and Manus Island, they are in a processing centre, but when they are brought to Australia they will be in detention. There is possibly an argument that it is better to be detained at Port Hedland than on Manus Island. I do not know, because I have not been to Manus Island. I have been to Port Hedland, Villawood, Woomera and the like, but I have not been to Manus Island or Nauru, so I do not know what the conditions are like there. There is possibly an argument that, if you are going to be detained without any rights whatsoever, you may as well be detained somewhere in Australia where you might be able to get a visitor or two rather than being detained in Nauru. The Democrats do not think that is sufficient reason for allowing such a dramatic removal of legal rights from a whole class of people—and it is not just the people who are on Nauru now. 
When you look at legislation you have to look at how it could be used, not just at how the government says it is going to be used. The minister might say, `We need this in case someone gets sick and we have to bring them to Australia to get hospital treatment,' but the fact is that that has already happened with one or two people and, as I understand it, the sky did not fall in. I do not think the so-called integrity of our immigration system was compromised as a consequence. I do not think that is sufficient reason for a massive precedent like this. I do not think you can rely on what the government says it needs this for. You have to look at what this legislation empowers it to do should it choose to use it or what it empowers a future government to do. If you look at the history of amendments to the Migration Act over many years, it is very rare when extra powers are given to a government or when legal rights are removed from individuals for those changes to be wound back. So, once we put this in place, it will be pretty hard to wind it back again. This bill does not wind back what was done last year; it extends it. 
Transitory persons might be, in the short term, people who are in Nauru. In the longer term, they could be anybody who is intercepted and put on Christmas Island for a day. That is how I understand it, and I will try to confirm that with the minister during the debate. Coincidentally or not, we are proposing to build a new detention centre on Christmas Island. People could be taken there for as short a time as desired and then moved on to Australia, but they will not be able to access Australia's protection regimes or engage Australia's protection obligations. That will be in place permanently. There is a bar on transitory persons undertaking certain legal proceedings. You do not get much more precise than that. Transitory persons will not have access to these legal rights. They will not be able to undertake any proceedings against the Commonwealth in any court as to their status as a transitory person or regarding their transfer to Australia. 
Section 198B of the bill creates a power for a Commonwealth officer to bring a transitory person to Australia. It includes the power to place the person on a vessel or vehicle, restrain the person, remove the person or use such force as is necessary and reasonable. Those actions cannot be challenged in any way. That Commonwealth officer has absolute power. No-one has any legal redress in terms of how they use that force and how they use that power.
Apart from preventing any legal procedures occurring at all in relation to transitory persons, section 498AB(2) has effect despite anything else in this act or in any other law. This overrides every other law in the Commonwealth except the Constitution. Antidiscrimination law, human rights law, any law is overridden by this bill in relation to transitory persons. They are basically put outside the law while they are inside Australia—outside the Migration Act, outside any other Australian law in terms of their rights. It is not just a retreat by this government, an acknowledgment that the Pacific solution has failed; in a sense, it is a victory for this government because it will mean that it will not need to intercept people and send them to Nauru to deprive them of their rights. The government can have them in Australia and deprive them of their rights. It will be much cheaper, which is one positive thing, I suppose, but they are still people with no rights whatsoever.
It is worth noting that—and this was an amendment made in the House of Representatives; I guess it is a positive one—the transitory person category does not apply to people who have been assessed to be a refugee for the purposes of the Refugee Convention. It will apply only to people who have had their initial claim for asylum rejected by whoever makes that assessment. Currently for the people on Nauru, apart from the initial people from the Tampa, that assessment is being made by Australian departmental officials, but it excludes those people from having any right to appeal, and currently they have no access to legal advice or assistance either. So they could get through that flawed process, be brought to Australia for any reason and still be subject to this flawed process where they have no rights. It is a significant advance in many ways from what the government managed to do by ramming legislation through the Senate last year with the support of the Labor Party. It is a matter of great disappointment to the Democrats that again this is able to be done by this government with the support of the Labor Party.
At the minimum, we should have had a bit of time to look at this. Last year we had the travesty where a bill was forced to be debated in this chamber while it was still before a Senate committee that had not even started looking at it. This time around we have not even been able to get it to a committee. It is that level of cynicism that is behind this approach on refugee law. It is a great tragedy that it always seems to be the refugees and asylum seekers, who are already among the most powerless, who so often are the victims of railroaded legislation. Sadly, this is not unusual. The action before the election might have been the worst example, but it has not been the only example. When bills eliminating rights appear, they tend to relate to migration or refugee matters. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TRANSITIONAL MOVEMENT) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2002-03-20,"—The Migration Legislation Amendment (Transitional Movement) Bill 2002 is a further piece of law in a field which is tortured by a war between concepts and facts which has its origins in legislation. I say that because I see some people here from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs for whom I have the highest admiration. I often think that the department is much criticised for problems which are created by legislators, and it is only fair that I should say that. If I explain what I mean by that, perhaps it will be clearer to those who are listening.
Australia, as has been said again and again in these debates, is a signatory to the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and to a protocol which extended the cover of that convention throughout the world. In 1951, when the convention was made, it applied only to Europe. Australia has freely signed that convention and the protocol with full knowledge of what it meant. The effect of it has been brought into domestic law. Australia could free itself of the effects of that convention by giving 12 months notice to the United Nations. It has chosen not to do that. Therefore, it has chosen to have a regime operating in Australia where people who are within its borders claim refugee status and, if it is established that they are refugees, then the regime says that Australia cannot return them to the place where they were persecuted. This is a circumstance, a regime, a system set up by legislation to enable Australia to carry out its duties under the convention which it signed freely and with full knowledge.
In reality, the convention applies only to those people who are in Australia when they make their application for refugee status. Australia has a very good system of bringing to Australia those refugees who make their application overseas, are processed overseas and are declared to be refugees. When you think about it, the convention does not really apply to their situation.
Australia has set up a system to look after those people who come here in an authorised manner, perhaps on a visitors visa. When they get here they make a claim for refugee status and are processed. I might also say that while they are being processed they are not held in detention. Others come here in an unauthorised fashion but they do not come here in a criminal fashion. The reason they do not come here in a criminal fashion is that it would be in contravention of the convention to make their actions a criminal offence. They are treated differently.
We have established a system which we really do not want people to use. If they enter Australia's waters, they can make an application. So, to stop them from getting themselves in a position where they can apply, we have a very tortuous system to keep them from entering Australia. If they are refugees, we have knowingly and freely undertaken to keep them here. It is the law itself which creates a situation which we who have brought this law into operation want to avoid. So we create the situation, we sign the convention, we ratify the convention and we bring the convention into domestic law, but we really do not want to have it operate—except, I suppose, in respect of people who come here by plane on a visitors visa and who have papers when they get here. 
I do not think we object to that, but we do object to those people who come here in a way that you might well imagine refugees would. So, to stop them coming here to apply under our law, we create all sorts of problems. We try to keep them out. We turn them away from our waters, we declare certain parts of Australia not to be parts of Australia for this purpose and we send them off to Pacific islands—and we do that in the heat of an election campaign. This proved to be a very effective strategy because, as a result of what was done, impetus was given to the government's election campaign and it played a very significant part in the government's return to office. But, having sent them off to Pacific islands in the heat of the election campaign, the situation now arises where the reality of them being on those islands means that they have to be brought to Australia for particular purposes—and so this legislation is brought in.
Tonight criticism has been made of the Labor Party's stance. But in this context it must be said that Labor has improved the legislation that has been brought in here by the government and, by the amendments that have been introduced, the government agrees that there has been an improvement. Given the controversy and the sorts of things that Senator Bartlett has talked about, there are still huge problems in this area, but at least these amendments are a step in the right direction. I think that should be taken into account—and taken into account in a way which gives credit to the Labor Party. To be fair to Senator Bartlett, I think he concedes that, although he says, of course, that the amendments do not go anywhere near far enough. I should pay tribute to Senator Bartlett in this context because he has, over the years, struggled to get a situation in Australia where the way we treat refugees has some semblance to the concepts advanced by the treaty to which we have signed up.
There is some unreality in this legislation because it in effect says, `Even though these people come within the borders of Australia'—and I would have thought that that was the situation within the concept which the convention contains as it was written in 1951—`it is not Australia for the purpose of the convention.' This, of course, is recreating Australia by definition, but that does not make it any less a country. It seems to me that, if you looked at this in terms of how things really are, you would see that, if they have come into Australia, they have come into Australia for the purpose of the convention. Nevertheless, the legislation is as it is put forward here tonight.
As a result of the efforts of the Labor Party, people who come here, who are here for a particular time and who are here under particular circumstances can access the system which allows them to claim refugee status and if they establish it under that system then they can remain here. There are some problems that we will come to, no doubt, in the committee stage. If I look at 198D(1), `Certificate of non-cooperation', it says:
If the Secretary is satisfied that a transitory person has engaged in uncooperative conduct, either before or after the person was brought to Australia, then the Secretary may issue a certificate to that effect to the Tribunal.
Uncooperative conduct is defined as:
... refusing or failing to cooperate with relevant authorities in connection with any of the following:
(a) attempts to return the person to a country where the person formerly resided;
(b) attempts to facilitate the entry or stay of the person in another country;
(c) the detention of the person in a country in respect of which a declaration is in force under subsection 198A(3).
This, I think, creates a difficulty for anybody who is going to access the new provisions because it says that if they do not go when they are asked, even though they can apply to the tribunal, nevertheless the fact that they have not gone will be held against them. So there is some strain in the legislation—strain in the sense that the concepts of the Refugee Convention, the legislation and the facts do not sit happily together. In any event, we will see what occurs during the debate in the committee stage.
There is one other matter that I should raise when I say the fault lies mainly with legislation rather than with the department. The other piece of legislation is, of course, that establishing mandatory detention. This says that if a person is in Australia, having come here as an unauthorised person, then he or she must be held in detention until there is an outcome in terms of defining whether or not that person is a refugee. That means the department has to keep the person locked up, and that creates the situation we have been experiencing over the last few years, and it has got worse and worse as time has gone on. In any event, this is another piece of legislation created by this conflict between concepts and reality. As Senator Sherry says, it is an advance on what was there before. It will be interesting to see how the committee stage goes.
There is one other thing I would like to say before I sit down. During the week, in this chamber, there has been an event that dealt with the reputation of a judge. A judge is entitled to his reputation, and in the case in point that has been vindicated, but so is everybody else entitled to their reputation. I am entitled to my reputation; you are entitled to yours, Mr Acting Deputy President. In a society that believes that one person is as good as another—an idea that comes from the teachings of many people, going back to the Galilean carpenter of 2,000 years ago—and that everybody is on the same level until proven otherwise, we should accept that, just as we are entitled to our reputation and the Justice of the High Court is entitled to his reputation, so these people who come by boat are entitled to their reputations. We should not turn them aside as a job lot; every person is entitled to be considered on his or her merits—not as part of the group. The denigration that has gone on in respect of these people is produced mainly by the conflict between the concepts behind the convention and the reality of our stance towards the asylum seekers. If we think about this, we will see that it is time that we began to consider people as individuals and not as a group that we have simply labelled in a very nasty way.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TRANSITIONAL MOVEMENT) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-03-20,"—I thank all of those senators who have contributed to the debate on this bill. This bill amends the Migration Act 1958 to allow persons who have been taken to offshore places to be brought to Australia in exceptional circumstances. These exceptional circumstances include: situations where a person has a medical condition which cannot be adequately treated in the place where that person has been taken; the transit of a person through Australia for either return to their country of residence or travel to a third country for resettlement; and transfer to Australia in order to give evidence as a witness in a criminal trial, such as a people-smuggling prosecution. The bill excludes a person who has been assessed as a refugee for the purposes of the Refugees Convention from the definition of a transitory person. This means that a person assessed to be a refugee cannot be brought to Australia in exceptional circumstances and is not a transitory person as such. 
I would like to foreshadow that during the committee stage I will be moving amendments on behalf of the government. Those amendments will entitle certain transitory persons who are brought to Australia in exceptional circumstances to make a request to the Refugee Review Tribunal for an assessment of whether they are covered by the definition of a refugee in article 1A of the Refugee Convention. Broadly speaking, an article 1A refugee is a person who is outside his or her country of nationality and has a well-founded fear of persecution. This fear may be for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. A transitory person will only be entitled to an assessment where he or she has been in Australia for a continuous period of six months or more and has cooperated with relevant authorities in relation to certain matters. For example, where relevant, a transitory person must have cooperated with the relevant authorities in relation to his or her removal from Australia. 
In summary, this bill ensures that transitory persons may be brought to Australia in exceptional circumstances without compromising Australia's immigration processes. I thank the opposition for its constructive engagement in relation to this bill and the amendment sought by the government. I think it was Senator Bartlett who indicated that he would be asking questions and would be obliged if those questions could be answered this evening in order to expedite the debate. I have advised him that the officials and I will endeavour to do just that, and of course in relation to any other questions that might be raised. I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TRANSITIONAL MOVEMENT) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2002-03-20,"—I rise to commend the decision and achievement of Prime Minister John Howard, the President of South Africa, Mr Thabo Mbeki and the President of Nigeria, Mr Obasanjo, as the three members of the Commonwealth chairpersons committee on Zimbabwe. The Zimbabwean elections earlier this month were clearly marred by a high level of politically motivated violence and did not reflect the will of the electorate. In making these remarks, I want to particularly note the contribution of our colleague Senator Alan Ferguson in the matters of public interest debate today. Anyone who listened to or read those remarks could not have been unmoved and could not have helped feeling very compelled by those remarks and by the style and sincerity with which Senator Ferguson carried out his duties, particularly when compared to reports of Mr Rudd. 
Like others in this parliament, I have concerned constituents—supporters of and former residents and citizens of Zimbabwe—who were very pleased to see Australian observers there and participating in this process. There was an overall reduction in the number of booths since the parliamentary elections in 2000. Importantly, in the cities of Harare and Bulawayo, booth numbers were reduced. People in the cities had to contend with voting for three different tiers of government, and it was the urban area that had recorded a strong level of support for the opposition. Resources in rural areas, where support for the Zanu PF was stronger, were not stretched in the same way. Indeed, booth numbers were increased in those areas. The extension of time for voting in urban areas was simply ignored by the government. 
I understand that the news was dominated by the Zimbabwean Broadcasting Corporation, which it is felt demonstrated significant bias towards the president's party. Government owned `Zimpapers' dominated the print media. The Commonwealth Observer Group for the election has highlighted the fact that the Mugabe government fostered the so-called ministry of youth training program—an obvious militia movement which I think Senator Ferguson described as `training people in torture'. As an observer to several UN ballots in East Timor in the past, this is a process I understand well and equally abhor. 
The decision that has been taken is to suspend Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth for a year and to engage Zimbabwe to promote reconciliation and to address food shortages, the need for economic recovery, restoration of the rule of law, future elections and electoral reform. This is an approach which I believe to be fair and balanced but which will require, in my view, energetic monitoring. Many commentators expected there would not be a suspension. And, of course, there will be those who would have preferred that a harsher punishment of the Mugabe regime be implemented. But the desperate economic need and food shortages that exist mean that such action would likely hurt those who are, in this case, most disadvantaged. I note today that Switzerland has committed itself to sanctions which may include the freezing of some Swiss bank accounts and other assets.
The agreement reached between Prime Minister Howard and his Nigerian and South African counterparts highlights that, contrary to some reports, the Commonwealth is not split along racial lines. Many of the media reports promoted this idea post CHOGM in Coolum. The reports of the Commonwealth Observer Group and those of our own participants in that group from this parliament show that there was significant displeasure amongst black African observers over the way that basic democratic freedoms were denied. I note the question raised by Senator Bourne in this chamber in question time this afternoon and also note her concerns that some may see the action as an appeasement. I trust the commitment to a review of the decisions taken by the Commonwealth chairpersons committee on Zimbabwe, at the request of the Commonwealth chairperson in office, will allay those concerns somewhat. 
In a situation like this, short of invading a country, the options for bringing about change are limited unless you resort to sanctions. With a country as poor as Zimbabwe, I am not sure whether sanctions do more damage than good. I think at this stage, in a very complex situation, this mix of international pressure and internal advocacy is an appropriate course to take. Zimbabwe is suffering widespread starvation, its inflation rate is 160 per cent and its unemployment rate is 60 per cent. Applying harsh sanctions is perhaps not the best first step. We have a growing commercial relationship with Zimbabwe, but it is modest. They are ranked 116th of the countries in the world which import Australian goods. So economic sanctions from Australia would probably have little effect. I do note the importance of the Australian decision to contribute $2 million in food aid through the World Food Program, which can only assist in helping the poorest in this area.
One option available to the international community down the track might be sporting sanctions. The cricket tour ban on South Africa and the ban on the rugby tour of Fiji had an effect. There are some who would contend that the banning of Zimbabwe from participating in the Commonwealth Games later this year might also have an effect. I understand the Australian Cricket Board is persisting with its tour despite today's travel warning from the government.
I think it is important that the Commonwealth is not seen just as a promoter of democratic ideals and a facilitator of free and fair elections—though those are two very important aspects of the Commonwealth's operation. As a nation we are an active member and supporter of the modern Commonwealth of Nations and value its role in advancing the interests of developing countries and small states in world affairs, including implementing appropriate development assistance programs. The Commonwealth has earned a unique profile as an association which is dedicated to the promotion of a set of fundamental political principles of enormous importance here—those of democracy, good governance and the rule of law—and it has made its mark in the pursuit of democratic principles.
The Commonwealth's networks and its interests range very widely and it contributes to immensely diverse issues, like youth affairs, gender equity, human rights, health and education. It has some well-known programs. The Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation, not surprisingly, provides technical assistance. The Commonwealth's Trade and Investment Access Facility has helped with practical advice on economic issues and assists small nation states to cope with multilateral trade processes and surviving in the new economy. The organisation was a key factor in breaking down South Africa's system of apartheid. In New York the Commonwealth Small States Office assists developing member countries with their representation at the United Nations. 
Given the importance of these programs to the prosperity of developing nations, the decision taken today by the Commonwealth chairpersons committee on Zimbabwe is a decision which not only is good for Zimbabwean citizens but also will, I hope, reinforce the value of the Commonwealth of Nations for some of the more recent doubters of its efficacy and relevance. As the member for Curtin, Julie Bishop—a member of the Commonwealth Observer Group—has stated: `The Commonwealth response is the key to steering Zimbabwe back on track.'
I am sure that all members of the Senate will recognise that there are those who have suffered much in their fight to participate in the democratic process and will also recognise how fortunate we are to participate in a free and fair democratic process in contrast. We hope that the future of Zimbabwe is much brighter than its recent past.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Zimbabwe</title>,Adjournment,38,1,speech
