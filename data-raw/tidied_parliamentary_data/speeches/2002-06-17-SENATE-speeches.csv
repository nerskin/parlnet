"PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2002-06-17,"—It is with deep regret that I inform the Senate of the death, on 14 May 2002, of Colin Lawrence Carige, a former member of the House of Representatives for the division of Capricornia, Queensland, from 1975 to 1977.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Carige, Mr Colin Lawrence</title>",Condolences,0,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,2002-06-17,"—I wish to speak on the adjournment resolution. 
—It is not the practice to have speeches on such a motion.
—I know it is not the practice. The matter I wish to raise deals with Senate procedure coming from the estimates committee, and I believe it would be appropriate to raise it as soon as possible.
—Proceed, Senator Schacht.
—I appreciate that it is not the convention to speak on a resolution of condolences at this time and I certainly do not wish to show any disrespect for the contribution that Sir John Gorton made as Prime Minister of this country, even though he was on the other side of politics. I agree with the remarks made by all senators.
I rise to speak because at the Senate estimates a week and a half ago in the Economics Committee, of which I am a member, a number of issues were raised about the conduct of the Senate committee. The issues raised included whether privilege was being made available, issues of decorum and whether the committee had accidentally suspended itself. These are all important matters. In the discussion that took place at the committee, I raised a number of issues that I believe should be referred to the full Senate for consideration. The chair of the committee, Senator Brandis, said he would write to you, Madam President, and include the transcript of the remarks made in the discussion at that time. I welcome that as I believe that is the most appropriate way to proceed.  
Today I received a letter, circulated to me from the secretary of that committee, which was sent to the committee by the Clerk of the Senate. The Clerk, clearly in a proactive way—and in no way do I criticise him—has read the transcript. I checked with Senator Brandis and found that, because he has been away, as chair of the committee he has not yet had a chance to write to you and raise the issues that have been discussed as he said he would. He told me today that he would be writing to you this week. There are a couple of very important matters involved here that, irrespective of the comments the Clerk has raised in his letter about the procedure, I believe warrant consideration by you, as President, and, if necessary, be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Procedure. 
The first issue, and the major one, concerns the risk that a Senate committee might have lost the right to privilege because someone queried whether a quorum was present at a Senate estimates committee. This arose in the Senate debate because one of my colleagues, quite rightly, in asking questions of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, asked details about certain activities of certain companies and individuals. When the officers from that agency were answering, they were warned that there may not be an appropriate quorum present and therefore privilege may not exist.
To say that this scared the officers from the statutory authority would be an understatement, and they made comment that they would be very nervous about responding as they always had if privilege were not available or if there were a doubt about privilege. I believe that is something that has to be dealt with quickly and urgently by the Senate. We cannot have a position in which officers coming before an estimates committee are concerned that any answer they give may not have the full protection of Senate privilege as we have all understood it. I think that, for the future, that is a very important issue.
I acknowledge that Senator Brandis has returned to the chamber. Senator Brandis, you may wish to take the opportunity to speak on this matter, even though it is against the convention that we have that we do not speak on a motion for the adjournment following a condolence resolution. The issue of who calls a quorum in a Senate estimates committee is at the heart of this matter. It was raised in the discussion that there was not a quorum present because there were not enough voting members from the non-government side present at the particular time. As I raised in the discussion—I draw this to your attention particularly, Madam President—the issue of a quorum is resolved by a member of the committee, in this case, or a member of the Senate drawing attention to it. Therefore there is a suspension, as we have in the Senate, the bells are rung until a quorum is re-established, and we go on with the business. It is the same in a committee; I always understood that that would be the way. But there is now some doubt, according to one of the standing orders, that at a Senate committee someone else—it may be the secretariat itself—can draw attention to the fact that there may not be a quorum present. It seems to me that we may have a different process of establishing quorums for Senate committees at the estimates level than we accept here in the Senate.
I received a copy of the letter to Senator Brandis from the Clerk on this matter. Again, I do not have any criticism of the Clerk proactively reading the transcript and anticipating Senator Brandis sending a letter. The letter says about the quorum:
The provision in standing order 29(2), whereby the chair is to suspend the proceedings of a committee whenever a quorum is not present, may be regarded as imposing a greater restriction upon committees than applies in practice in the Senate, because in the Senate it is not the practice for the President to draw attention to the absence of a quorum. 
So what we have here is a practice in the Senate that is not accepted in the committee. I think that should be clarified quite clearly. We should not have a different procedure for a committee from the standard practice here in the Senate. Even if that means changing the wording of one of the Senate standing orders, I believe that is a matter the Procedure Committee should look at, Madam President, on your referring that matter to them. That to me is a difficulty: we have a convention that operates in the full Senate chamber— 
—Madam President, I raise a point of order. I think this debate is out of order on a motion that the Senate adjourn as a mark of respect upon the death of former Prime Minister. Whilst I understand that this is apparently an important issue to Senator Schacht, he will recognise that, if he wants to develop this line of argument, there will be others who will want to respond and basically it will become a political debate which really somewhat demeans the process that we have been engaged in here today. I wonder if, through the guise of a point of order, I might implore Senator Schacht that it would be more appropriate that this debate take place tomorrow night on the adjournment, which I hope will be an unlimited adjournment.
—As I pointed out at the beginning, Senator Hill, it is a practice, not a rule, of the Senate that that be the case.
—Thank you, Madam President; I will not be long. I appreciate the remarks made by Senator Hill. I would not have raised the matter if I had not seen the letter from the Clerk today, because I was to understand—
—But you could have had the debate tomorrow.
—I still think this is an important issue, where details of the privileges of the parliament—
—But is it appropriate now?
—I have to say that former Prime Minister Gorton was a member of the Senate for something like 18 years, and I would have thought that he would understand about issues of procedure. I want to conclude, Madam President, by saying that I believe that you should await the letter from Senator Brandis as chairman of the committee before any final decision is reached on this matter. You may choose to refer it to the Procedure Committee, looking at the discussion that took place in the committee. Again, if in any way I have offended the memory of former Prime Minister Gorton, I apologise for that, but this is a matter that I thought should be raised at the first opportunity because it does deal with the workings of the Senate itself.
Senate adjourned at 1.43 p.m.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Committees: Administration</title>,Adjournment,1,1
