"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2014-12-02,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (12:32):  As the chamber continues its consideration of this bill, I invite all honourable senators to reflect on the solemn task and great privilege given to us by the Australian people. I know all senators take their role seriously. I also know the Australian people want us to be positive and, therefore, they will not smile upon us if they get a whiff of stunts or deliberate attempts by senators to cause chaos and disrupt proceedings or lay down unrealistic ultimatums to each other. 


This is the last week of parliamentary sittings, and there is a list of urgent legislation that still needs to be considered. While leaders and whips were in a meeting—a meeting where we sought to allow the proceedings of this place to be undertaken in an orderly fashion through the rest of the week—Labor, regrettably, pulled a stunt to bring on another bill not on the urgent list. The Australian people expect us to get on with the real business of restoring our nation's economic future fortunes, restoring the sustainability of various sectors, such as the tertiary education sector, and allowing the ACT government to proceed with remediating the issues of Mr Fluffy victims.


I also suggest to honourable senators that there should be some respect for the conventions and precedents of this chamber. A cause that people might feel passionately about does not necessarily justify the means by which it is pursued. The Senate has a range of procedures available to prosecute an issue without resorting to what some might consider a breach of trust for the benefit of a by-election in a state.




Senator Gallacher:
  Like South Australia!




Senator ABETZ:
  Senator Gallacher interjects. He was the one who was first on his feet last night, bringing on a stunt so early that he got his procedure incorrect—which is, I might say, one of the other pitfalls of doing such things in these circumstances.


I invite the chamber to consider its position. I think people have made their comments clear in relation to this Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014. We can read the numbers in this place. We dare say that we can foretell what will happen with the amendment to this omnibus bill and then the consideration of this bill. But this is a bill that was not on the government's urgent list; there are other matters that the Australian people actually do expect us to deal with. Mr Chairman, on that basis, I move:


That the question be now put.



The CHAIRMAN:  The question is that the question be now put.

  I will save my remarks about the broader issue of Senate management, or lack thereof from the government, for a debate later today in the interests—



Government senators interjecting—

  Precious Penny. Precious.




Senator WONG:
  I will take that interjection from Senator Macdonald, who called me 'Precious Penny' again. He is very good at personal insults. As I said to him a number of years ago, my mother always did tell me I was precious, so I suppose he might be right—but I suspect she meant it in a different way. I want to make a few points. The opposition is keen that this come to a conclusion prior to question time. The second is that it was described as a stunt by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Let everybody understand that this legislation is about—



Honourable senators interjecting—



The CHAIRMAN:  There is a lot of noise coming from both sides of the chamber. I call the chamber to order.



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Macdonald, I have just called the chamber to order and I would appreciate your assistance in that request.




Senator WONG:
  The few points I want to make are: first, that the opposition is keen to bring this to a conclusion prior to question time; second, that the bill that Senator Abetz describes as a stunt is about holding the government to a promise it made to South Australians and to workers in Western Australia and in the 2,200 companies across Australia who have contracts with the Australian Submarine Corporation that it would—



A government senator interjecting—



The CHAIRMAN:  Order! Again, I call the chamber to order.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Now you know how it feels to have someone interject constantly during question time—constantly!



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Macdonald: I have called the chamber to order and you immediately interject. I would ask you to desist from doing so.




Senator WONG:
  A promise was made to South Australians and other Australians that the submarines would be built in Australia. That is what this bill and the opposition's amendment are about.


The second point I did want to put on the record at this point concerned the comments by Senator Abetz about the Mr Fluffy asbestos demolition. I did want to make very clear to anybody listening: the opposition have already indicated to the government that we would facilitate passage of that and I think four other noncontroversial bills in the normal time for—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  We don't believe you.



Government senators:  We can't trust you.



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Wong, ignore the interjections. Again, I—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  She's just so precious.




Senator Birmingham:
  So we won't be hearing a word from you?



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Wong has the call, and I would ask other senators to cease interjecting. 




Senator WONG:
  I will start again. I would like to place on record in relation to the ACT Government Loan Bill 2014, which is the legislation that deals with the Mr Fluffy asbestos demolition issue, that the opposition have already placed on record that we would facilitate passage of that and—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Because it's helping your mates in the ACT.




Senator WONG:
  we will—



A government senator:  You're so precious.



The CHAIRMAN:  Again, I will ask for the chamber's cooperation to cease interjecting. 




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  We have nothing but constant interjections from this senator all the way through every day—



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Macdonald, this is the third occasion I have called the chamber to order and you immediately then interject. I would ask you to cease doing so. 




Senator WONG:
  I would like to indicate, again, that the opposition has expressed to the government, as I think all parties have, a willingness to facilitate passage of that legislation and three other noncontroversial pieces of legislation in the normal noncontro time on Thursday. It is important that the chamber be made aware of this—that is, we have already indicated agreement to that—given that was used as a basis to argue against the debate on this bill.

The CHAIRMAN:  Thank you. I would ask all senators to be mindful of the standing orders. Senator Birmingham, you have the call.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  I was emphasising to the chamber that this is a bill about reducing red tape. This is a bill about making government more efficient. This is a bill about tidying up the legislative agenda and tabling of the nation. This is a bill designed to ensure that our country can operate with the least amount of intervention from government as possible. And yet what we have had is a complete distortion of this bill by those opposite, a complete distortion of the government's agenda in relation to the legislation before this chamber, and it has all been done quite transparently for base political purposes.


I too will be brief because I spoke on this last night, but it is important in the light of day to ensure that this chamber and those listening understand what has happened here. Last night, in an ambush move, those opposite came into this chamber and plucked a bill that was not even scheduled for debate this week, put it on the agenda to disrupt the orderly process of what the government is seeking to achieve, to disrupt the orderly decision-making we hope to have through this place, and they did this so that they could run a stunt—a stunt of inserting into this bill an amendment that is completely unrelated to the legislation before the chair, an amendment that has no bearing on it and an amendment that, frankly, is a gross overreach in terms of the actions that the Labor Party is seeking to pursue.


It was acknowledged last night by Labor senators that the submarine contract is Australia's largest procurement decision, and yet they want to try to guide it through this place in a stunt, an ambush. That is not the responsible path for decision-making in this country. We have committed to following the well-established proper processes that have been in place since 2003 for defence procurement decisions—a two-part process through cabinet and based on sound advice of the defence chiefs. That is the type of process we have committed to doing, something that successive governments have done when they have had the courage to make defence procurement decisions—something that those opposite sorely lacked on most occasions. That is the process we are committed to upholding, not the type of stunt driven process that those opposite are seeking to deploy.


The truth is the Labor Party are more interested in stunts than they are submarines. The Labor Party are more interested in gestures than they are in jobs. Last night they wanted to bring to a vote matters around this stunt to put a submarine clause into unrelated legislation. But then we just had them vote against having a vote on this matter, with Senator Wong standing up and saying in her own special pious way, 'We want to get this matter over with and bring it to a vote.' If she wanted to bring it to a vote, Senator Wong had her chance. The Labor Party had their chance. Instead, they all lined up to vote against having a vote. Why did they do that? Of course they did that just so that Senator Wong could grandstand. Senator Wong and everyone else had 2½ hours last night in which there was ample time to grandstand. But Senator Wong chose not to grandstand last night, because that would not have suited the media cycle as well as it would for her to come in at the time that she did.


No number of stunts, no amount of clever tactics or gestures from those opposite, can get away from the basic facts. The basic facts around submarines are that in 2007 the Labor Party promised that if they were elected to government there would be action starting in 2007 around the procurement of submarines. Six years on and nothing was accomplished in that regard—six years of inaction based on a promise they took to the 2007 election and to the 2010 election and a promise made repeatedly during their two terms in government. Six years of inaction is what has created the capability gap that this government confronts in relation to our most important and valuable defensive asset: our submarines. 


Six years of inaction is what has put jobs at risk in Australia's shipbuilding industry, because it is six years of inaction that has created the so-called valley of death that the shipbuilding industry currently faces. It was not just inaction, it was not just that Senator Wong and Senator Conroy and those around the Labor cabinet table sat on their hands and did nothing for six years in relation to this major defence procurement; it was that they undertook damaging actions in that time. They cut the defence budget to the lowest level of GDP since 1938. How on earth did they think they were ever going to procure submarines with a defence budget cut of that level? They stripped the future submarine procurement program of hundreds of millions of dollars. How on earth did they think they were going to make a multibillion-dollar procurement decision while stripping the forward budget for that very program? It was those budget decisions that further added to the risk of a capability gap that we now face in making decisions about submarines. It was that slashing of the budget that created the situation of the potential valley of death and put jobs at risk.


Our government went to the last election committing that within 18 months we would make decisions about the future procurement of submarines. We went to the last election with a policy—a publicly released, written policy—something those opposite did not bother to release during the election campaign. That policy made clear that shipbuilding work would centre on South Australia's shipyards, that the Australian work in relation to submarines would centre on South Australia's shipyards. That is absolutely what will happen. We have stated time and time again that, as a result of the largest procurement decision in Australia's history in relation to submarines, there will be more jobs in the future at the South Australian shipyards. That is what everybody should take heart from. They should take heart from the fact that they now have a government in place, unlike the previous one, that will work through the proper processes, the established processes, the cabinet processes and informed by the advice of the defence chiefs, and make decisions in a timely and orderly manner—decisions to ensure that Australia does not face a capability gap in our defence assets, decisions to ensure that Australian taxpayers get the best value for money out of this multibillion-dollar procurement decision, and decisions that will preserve and protect for decades to come the jobs of South Australians employed in naval and submarine shipbuilding and maintenance work.


Let us cast aside the stunts of those opposite. They may have the numbers in this place to run around with their silly stunts, but on this side we are serious about getting submarines, filling the capability gap, protecting jobs and protecting what is important for taxpayers in terms of getting value for money. We will not be distracted by those stunts. We will not be distracted by the silly game-playing of those opposite. We will simply get on with the job of delivering the best possible outcome for all Australians.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2014-12-02,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:57):  I indicate that I support this amendment. I know that the—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You are part of the stunt, aren't you?




Senator XENOPHON:
  I know a thing or two about stunts, but I regard this as a very important issue. The fact is, prior to the last election, the government in opposition made an unequivocal commitment to build submarines in South Australia. On 8 May 2013, the then shadow defence minister Senator David Johnston said during a visit to Adelaide, 'We will deliver those submarines from right here at ASC in South Australia.' Why ASC South Australia? There is only one place that has all of the expertise that is necessary to complete one of the most complex, difficult and costly capital works projects that Australia can undertake, and it is ASC in Adelaide. He went on to say:


The Coalition today is committed to building 12 new submarines here in Adelaide. We will get that task done, and it is a really important task, not just for the Navy but for the nation.


And we are going to see the project through, and put it very close after force protection, as our number priority if we win the next federal election.


Senator Birmingham did make some valid criticisms of the former government not advancing the issue of submarines more expeditiously. I think that is a valid issue. But Senator Birmingham also said—and as a fellow South Australian senator he understands the importance of this project, its strategic importance and its economic importance to the people of South Australia and indeed the nation—that we need to have appropriate processes and good processes. 


I have been part of the naval shipbuilding inquiry. I heard the evidence a number of weeks ago from Dr John White, a man who was retained by this government because of his credibility in terms of preparing the Winter White report—with Don Winter, a former US secretary of the navy—on the AWD program, the problems with that program and what needs to be done to fix that program. Dr John White is a man who is held in high esteem by the coalition, in my view because it was Dr White who was responsible for fixing up the mess of the Anzac frigate program—taking that project over and bringing it in on time and on budget. In fact, it might have been under time and under budget. That is the turnaround that he achieved. We need to listen to him. The evidence that he gave to an inquiry of the Senate economics committee was very clear. He said that we do have time, if we get on our skates immediately and ensure that there is a competitive project definition study so that we can use the best of the best. We can get the best expertise, the best ideas from around the world, in order to build a submarine, and it ought to be built right here in Australia. Abandoning a competitive process, abandoning that due process that Dr White has recommended, would be both a strategic and an economic disaster for our nation. So there are issues that we need to consider. 


I agree with Senator Birmingham that we need to have due process. That due process appears to have been abandoned, judging by the remarks made by the Treasurer, the Hon. Mr Hockey, earlier today on the Fran Kelly program on Radio National, where he said that there will not be an open tender. It appears that there will not be any tender and that the deal has been done. There is an argument that the government has been effectively backfilling as a result of what appears to be an arrangement, an agreement, a process, that will guarantee that the subs will be built in Japan. I think that that is not the way that we need to go forward. 


This is an inelegant mechanism—this amendment to this bill—but I think it indicates the importance of this issue to not just South Australia but the nation. If we end up exporting the manufacture of our subs to another country, effectively we will see something like $20 billion-plus worth of jobs being exported overseas. We are seeing a situation where we will ignore the ongoing economic benefits, the multiplier effect, of having the subs built here, let alone the issue of skills being retained here. 


There is no reason why we cannot have the best design, even an overseas design. Those designers can be part of the project here in Australia. TKMS, the German submarine builder, which has a credible record of building submarines overseas, on time and on budget, has said as much. Indeed, in Greece, as troubled as that economy has been, it has managed to build subs, while dealing with communist unions. It built the subs on time and on budget. So I think that indicates its expertise. And there are other submarine makers that have an expertise in relation to that.


We need to listen to the experts. We need to listen to Dr John White. We need to ensure that the submarines are built in our nation. We know that, for every dollar spent here locally, there are significant flow-on economic benefits. We know, from the Royal United Services Institution of the United Kingdom, that, for every pound spent on defence procurement in that country, 37 per cent goes back into general revenue. Obviously the figure would be different here, because of different taxation arrangements and the like, but there is a significant economic impact in respect of that. 


There is also the issue of the promise. One of the reasons why I think people are so disillusioned with all of us as politicians is that, if you break a promise as fundamental as this, it just chips away at the credibility of those that break the promise and it affects all of us as politicians. I re-read a piece by Hugh Mackay from 1 August 1998. He is a social researcher, psychologist and writer. He made the point:


With trust in the political process being eroded with every bent principle, every broken promise and every policy backflip, the level of cynicism has reached breaking point for many Australians.


That was back in 1998, during the time of the GST debate. But John Howard, to his absolute credit, had the courage, had the tremendous political will, to argue an election on an unpopular measure, namely the GST. He got through, and, for that, I think John Howard needs to be acknowledged as one of the great prime ministers of this nation—for pushing through a change, a reform, and going to the electorate to seek that mandate. For that, I have enormous regard for John Howard.


Breaking this promise on submarines is not the way that the government should operate. If they believe that the ASC is not up to the task, which contradicts what was said by the Minister for Defence as shadow defence minister back in May 2013, then they need to look at the structure of the ASC. I do not necessarily accept those arguments, but, as the owner of the ASC, the government have the wherewithal to fix any problems with the ASC. We need to do this as a nation. As inelegant, clumsy and messy as this mechanism is, I am obliged, on behalf of my constituents in South Australia, to support this measure. If we do not build the submarines in South Australia, if we do not build them in Australia, with flow-on benefits to other states, then we will be making a massive strategic and economic mistake.

"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",Ind.,2014-12-02,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (13:05):  It is a pleasure to contribute on the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014 and associated amendments. I will focus my comments on the opposition's amendment, which guarantees that the Future Submarine project tender process is accountable and carried out with Australia's national interest in mind, in complete contrast to the way the Abbott government have proposed to carry out the build of our future naval shipping. The government have given every indication, through their Minister for Defence and Prime Minister, that they are prepared to abandon and betray Australia's defence shipbuilding industry and Australian designers, engineers, apprentices and tradespeople.


This Senate has censured the defence minister, who is responsible for Australia's naval shipbuilding industry. It is timely to remind this chamber of the points of that recent successful censure motion. I agree that the Minister for Defence has: (1) insulted the men and women of ASC by stating he 'wouldn't trust them to build a canoe'; (2) undermined the confidence in Australia's defence capability; (3) threatened the integrity of Australia's defence procurement project; (4) broken his promise made on 8 May 2013 to build 12 new submarines at ASC in South Australia; and (5) cut the real pay, Christmas and recreational leave for Australian Defence Force personnel. And, despite a clear message from this Senate to the PM, he has arrogantly refused to listen. Mr Abbott has refused to stand up for the men and women who build our ships. He has failed to stand up for the generation to come who will build our ships.


This has now become a matter of leadership, and the fact that the defence minister has not been ordered to step aside following a successful censure motion by the Senate reflects poorly on the Prime Minister. The people of Australia have stopped listening to him now. Broken promise after broken promise by the Prime Minister and his defence minister have destroyed their credibility and the willingness of the people of Australia to listen or trust. The fish rots from the head down, and this Liberal government is on the nose with ordinary Australians and the men and women of our naval shipbuilding program and, of course, our Australian Defence Force personnel. 


Again I remind this chamber that the government of Australia should have followed the advice of the now Governor-General, Sir Peter Cosgrove. As the former Chief of the Defence Force Sir Peter said:


Whenever I am asked why we should build submarines in Australia, my short reply is that we can’t afford not to.


Again I remind this chamber that the Australian government has identified the need to build about eight warships at a cost of $100 billion over the coming decades. Adding maintenance across the ships' lifetimes, the outlay is closer to $250 billion. I repeat that I want Tasmania to have a fair share of that $250 billion worth of Australia's shipbuilding. I remind this parliament that Tasmania can also play an important role in Australian shipbuilding for our Australian Defence Force. If this defence minister is allowed to have his way—if he is allowed to remain in this high office, undermining national security by his lack of credibility, leadership and respect for the truth—then my state of Tasmania will lose all hope of ever contributing to that $250 billion national defence-building program.


Tasmania has a maritime network taking the world by sea. Like others states, we have world-class maritime engineers, designers and shipbuilders. We have Incat, APCO Engineering, the Australian Maritime College, Cawthorn Welding, Revolution Design, Plastic Fabrications, Richardson Devine Marine, Sabre Marine & General Engineers and many more. Tasmania has world-class skills in training and research. We have the Australian Maritime College, the Asia Pacific Maritime Institute, CSIRO and Skills Tasmania. Why shouldn't Tasmanian designers, shipbuilders, tradespeople, apprentices, trainers and small business owners share in the work and the wealth that is generated by ships and other equipment built for the Australian Defence Force?


I am for Australian workers and building Australian ships and other machinery to defend our nation; this government has shown that it clearly is not. I support this bill and the amendment put before the chamber by the opposition, which will ensure a fair go for Australian workers and companies.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2014-12-02,"



Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (13:10):  I rise to speak about the opposition amendment. The Minister for Defence's disgraceful slur against the ASC last week has cast a shadow over the entire Future Submarine project. The Senate needs to urgently address this issue and ensure that the ADF get the best possible submarine and that taxpayers' money is efficiently spent. Those are the two criteria, and they should be the only criteria when it comes to this Future Submarine project. The chamber must adopt this amendment because this project is too important to be left to this incompetent minister. The efficient conduct of government and the efficient allocation of resources should be at the forefront of every minister's mind, but that is clearly not the case with this minister. 


Yesterday, the Prime Minister said he wanted 'a really effective submarine at a fair price'. I have good news for the Prime Minister: we know how to make sure that that happens. Expert after expert told the Senate that the only way to get the best capability for the best price is to hold a competitive tender process with a funded project definition study. If the Prime Minister is serious about the Future Submarine project, he will tell his senators to support this amendment. He will tell his senators to help the minister to keep his promise to build 12 submarines in Adelaide. I do not have high hopes, though, as this government has been breaking and walking away from this promise since the day it got into government. I say to those opposite that you do not have to listen to me, but listen to experts like Dr John White, who told a Senate inquiry:


There are significant technical, commercial and capability gap risks invoked by prematurely and unilaterally committing to a preferred overseas, sole-source supplier.


Retired Rear Admiral Peter Briggs told the same inquiry that the only way to pick the best submarine:


… is to conduct a competitive project definition study where you can get the answers back to your top-level requirements …


In fact, the report of the Senate inquiry recommended: 


The government … not enter into a contract for the future submarine project without conducting a competitive tender for the future submarines, including a funded project definition study. 


This is what my amendment seeks to ensure.


All that we are looking to do is to ensure that the government uses the best process so that we can make sure that we get the best possible outcome. How can you oppose a competitive tender process? How can the Liberal Party—the party of free enterprise and competition—oppose an amendment like this? The government is standing in the way. We learnt earlier today that, despite all the evidence about the benefits of a competitive tender and despite knowing that there is still time to hold a competitive tender and avoid a capability gap—and that is what the experts said—the Treasurer of Australia, Mr Joe Hockey, has ruled out holding a competitive tender process. The party of free enterprise and competition and the chief spruiker of competition in this country, the Treasurer of Australia, say there is to be no competitive tender, despite the defence minister's frequent announcements that no decision has been made. The defence minister says there has been no decision but the Treasurer says there will be no competitive tender.


Let me make it clear: it would be an absolute scandal to award this contract without a proper, fair dinkum, competitive tender process with a funded project definition study. Do not take the weasel words we are hearing from the minister at the moment and do not take the weasel words we have been hearing from various officials. This amendment to the legislation would ensure that we get a proper process. Frankly, companies from around the world which are trying to be involved in this tender process are absolutely stunned by the behaviour of this government, the champions of free enterprise and competition. They have had to resort to putting in unsolicited bids from the big submarine companies telling the government that they can build 12 submarines for a very competitive price here in Australia. 


French companies, German companies and Swedish companies have been so shocked by the conduct of this government that they have, publicly in some cases, put a bid into the public sphere saying, 'We can do this.' But is this government listening? No because it is becoming increasingly clear that they are hell-bent on their sweetheart deal with Japan. They are absolutely determined to deliver this contract to the Japanese submarine companies. We know this because we asked the minister just yesterday. His office, the Prime Minister's office and his department prepared press releases, talking points and information to announce the Japanese had won the bid. No-one in this chamber, when they vote on this, should think that there is a fair dinkum process being undertaken. This government has already made up its mind. It has already made its decision. Only this amendment will hold this government to account. 


The government's outrageous bias against Australian manufacturers is getting in the way of good, sensible government. The defence minister's colleagues know this. That is why, when the minister announced to the Senate that he would not trust the ASC to build a canoe, they dropped him like a hot potato. They walked away from him. His colleagues told the media that the defence minister's statements were 'some of the most stupid words ever heard from a senior minister'. They knew he had blown the whistle on the scam, the pretence that they are going to hold a process. The Japanese have this in the bag. The Japanese know it. The Japanese President knows it. The American President knows it. The Prime Minister knows it. Those three people had a meeting just a few weeks ago at an economic summit where they discussed putting American war systems into the Japanese submarines to be built for Australia. This is a done deal. Only this amendment can give the best possible chance of getting the best submarine at the best price and built here in Australia. 


This amendment should be supported because it will ensure that a proper and fair tender process is gone through before selecting a design and construction partner for the submarine project. This is not some new process we are talking about; this is the established process, the established best practice to get the best outcome for projects like the future submarines. Unfortunately, given the clear bias shown by the minister and the Treasurer's statements earlier today, it is clear the government will need to be dragged, kicking and screaming, to do the right thing . That is why this amendment should be supported and I commend it to the Senate and that is why any South Australian senator who comes into this chamber and votes with the government is betraying the people of South Australia who elected them. They were elected on the votes of people who believed that Tony Abbott and David Johnston would keep their promise to build 12 submarines in Australia.

Senator WATERS
 (Queensland) (13:20):  I move Greens amendment (1) on sheet 7642:


(1) Schedule 3, Parts 1 and 2, page 16 (line 2) to page 17 (line 19), to be opposed.


I wish to speak briefly on the remaining amendments on that sheet, which I will have to move separately, given that some of them are phrased differently from the others. Just to explain, the purpose of these amendments is to oppose the abolition of a handful of advisory councils which are currently serving a very useful function of providing expert advice to the minister and to the Department of the Environment, particularly about hazardous waste issues. We are opposing the abolition of the Product Stewardship Advisory Group, the Oil Stewardship Advisory Council and the Fuel Standards Consultative Committee, all of which have successfully provided expert policy advice in highly complex areas. 


We are also opposing in the later amendments, which I will move shortly, the weakening of the hazardous waste regime, which reduces transparency and reduces safeguards for the environment and for local communities.  Far from perhaps a harmless-sounding red tape reduction we are seeing a reduction in environmental standards and a reduction in community participation in important decisions that have real impacts. The government appears to be blindly implementing the recommendations of their earlier commission of audit but the fact remains that these environmental programs have been an absolute excess story. 


The aim of the Product Stewardship Advisory Group is to advise the minister on products for accreditation under the Product Stewardship Act. The government says, 'It's fine; we don't need this advice any more because the department can do this in House. 


Our advice from the experts is that the department may well have the will, but they do not have the capacity because this government has cut their staff. They also do not currently have the expertise, which is precisely why this expert body was established in the first place.


What we are seeing here, which is perhaps not unusual from this government, is a stepping away from evidence based, science based decision making. Instead, the government intends to put more pressure on an already underresourced department which, in these particular examples, lacks the skills and the resources to properly fill that gap. 


Moving now to the Oil Stewardship Advisory Council: similarly, it is an advisory body which advises the minister on matters related to the Product Stewardship for Oil Program. This encompasses things like product stewardship, recovery, recycling, benefits, the state of oil production and oil recycling industries. Having this advisory body has been a real success story. The advice from experts is that there are two meetings per year with some very fair sitting fees per member and that the advisory body provides a very useful function to the government of the day. 


The Total Environment Centre and the National Toxics Network have opposed the abolition of these bodies. The Total Environment Centre said:


By abolishing the Product Stewardship Advisory Group (PSAG) which has performed an essential function of investigating and recommending products like waste batteries and paint to be subject to recycling instead of being dumped into landfill …


The federal government is effectively taking other harmful wastes off the national recycling agenda.


It argues the department can still do this on an ‘as needs’ basis but the department does not initiate such action and it is under a clear government direction to resist new regulation.


Clearly, industry and the department are being sent a message here: 'Just keep on approving things; we do not value expert advice; let's just tick and flick.'


The fuel quality standards amendments are along a similar vein. They seek to abolish the Fuel Standards Consultative Committee. They insert a new consultation process which applies to the grant process and the variation of approvals process for fuel standards. The government says that the department will carry out that advisory role; but, again, this is why we have expert advisory bodies: when you have slashed the department down to so few staff, and particularly when the staff who remain do not have the relevant expertise in these areas, that is precisely when you need expert advice.


I will flag that there are some parts of this bill that we do not oppose in schedule 3, and some of those are genuinely duplicative. We have structured our amendments in a way that we think is fair and that does not object to the abolition of particular parts which genuinely seem to be superfluous and do not have an actual on-ground impact. We are taking a reasonable approach here, but you simply cannot abolish three expert environment advisory bodies and somehow charge the department with those new responsibilities when you have sacked hundreds of those people who are already under pressure from an existing workload. 


I will finish up by speaking to the hazardous waste amendments. The government is planning on gutting the hazardous waste regulation regime. They, of course, describe it as streamlining and simplifying. In fact, it is reducing the ability of local communities to keep track of what is going on and to be able to protect their health and their local environment. In particular, the government are seeking to remove the requirement for the particulars of an export application to be specified in regs before a decision is made to grant an export permit. They are also seeking to reduce the matters that must be included in import and export permits. They are removing the publication requirements of our permits from the Gazette and they are removing the requirement for a transit permit as well as introducing a new tenure limit on the Hazardous Waste Technical Group, which is somewhat perplexing and raises suspicions as to whether that is designed to hasten a particular person out. We are opposing the repeal of these hazardous waste provisions because this government seems intent on reducing environmental protection, as it is intent on reducing staff at the environment departments who are under an incredible amount of pressure to do valuable work. We need these expert advisory committees. They are performing a valuable role and assisting government in making positive decisions—if, of course, that advice is followed. We will, therefore, be opposing their abolition.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2014-12-02,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (12:32):  As the chamber continues its consideration of this bill, I invite all honourable senators to reflect on the solemn task and great privilege given to us by the Australian people. I know all senators take their role seriously. I also know the Australian people want us to be positive and, therefore, they will not smile upon us if they get a whiff of stunts or deliberate attempts by senators to cause chaos and disrupt proceedings or lay down unrealistic ultimatums to each other. 


This is the last week of parliamentary sittings, and there is a list of urgent legislation that still needs to be considered. While leaders and whips were in a meeting—a meeting where we sought to allow the proceedings of this place to be undertaken in an orderly fashion through the rest of the week—Labor, regrettably, pulled a stunt to bring on another bill not on the urgent list. The Australian people expect us to get on with the real business of restoring our nation's economic future fortunes, restoring the sustainability of various sectors, such as the tertiary education sector, and allowing the ACT government to proceed with remediating the issues of Mr Fluffy victims.


I also suggest to honourable senators that there should be some respect for the conventions and precedents of this chamber. A cause that people might feel passionately about does not necessarily justify the means by which it is pursued. The Senate has a range of procedures available to prosecute an issue without resorting to what some might consider a breach of trust for the benefit of a by-election in a state.




Senator Gallacher:
  Like South Australia!




Senator ABETZ:
  Senator Gallacher interjects. He was the one who was first on his feet last night, bringing on a stunt so early that he got his procedure incorrect—which is, I might say, one of the other pitfalls of doing such things in these circumstances.


I invite the chamber to consider its position. I think people have made their comments clear in relation to this Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014. We can read the numbers in this place. We dare say that we can foretell what will happen with the amendment to this omnibus bill and then the consideration of this bill. But this is a bill that was not on the government's urgent list; there are other matters that the Australian people actually do expect us to deal with. Mr Chairman, on that basis, I move:


That the question be now put.



The CHAIRMAN:  The question is that the question be now put.

 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (12:42):  I will be very brief because the opposition is keen to bring this bill to a conclusion—



Government senators interjecting—



The CHAIRMAN:  Order!




Senator WONG:
  I will save my remarks about the broader issue of Senate management, or lack thereof from the government, for a debate later today in the interests—



Government senators interjecting—



The CHAIRMAN:  Order!




Senator WONG:
  It is interesting, isn't it? Even when you try to make a short speech, they want to blow it up. Who wants to get their legislation program through? I will make some comments later—



Government senators interjecting—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Precious Penny. Precious.




Senator WONG:
  I will take that interjection from Senator Macdonald, who called me 'Precious Penny' again. He is very good at personal insults. As I said to him a number of years ago, my mother always did tell me I was precious, so I suppose he might be right—but I suspect she meant it in a different way. I want to make a few points. The opposition is keen that this come to a conclusion prior to question time. The second is that it was described as a stunt by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Let everybody understand that this legislation is about—



Honourable senators interjecting—



The CHAIRMAN:  There is a lot of noise coming from both sides of the chamber. I call the chamber to order.



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Macdonald, I have just called the chamber to order and I would appreciate your assistance in that request.




Senator WONG:
  The few points I want to make are: first, that the opposition is keen to bring this to a conclusion prior to question time; second, that the bill that Senator Abetz describes as a stunt is about holding the government to a promise it made to South Australians and to workers in Western Australia and in the 2,200 companies across Australia who have contracts with the Australian Submarine Corporation that it would—



A government senator interjecting—



The CHAIRMAN:  Order! Again, I call the chamber to order.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Now you know how it feels to have someone interject constantly during question time—constantly!



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Macdonald: I have called the chamber to order and you immediately interject. I would ask you to desist from doing so.




Senator WONG:
  A promise was made to South Australians and other Australians that the submarines would be built in Australia. That is what this bill and the opposition's amendment are about.


The second point I did want to put on the record at this point concerned the comments by Senator Abetz about the Mr Fluffy asbestos demolition. I did want to make very clear to anybody listening: the opposition have already indicated to the government that we would facilitate passage of that and I think four other noncontroversial bills in the normal time for—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  We don't believe you.



Government senators:  We can't trust you.



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Wong, ignore the interjections. Again, I—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  She's just so precious.




Senator Birmingham:
  So we won't be hearing a word from you?



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Wong has the call, and I would ask other senators to cease interjecting. 




Senator WONG:
  I will start again. I would like to place on record in relation to the ACT Government Loan Bill 2014, which is the legislation that deals with the Mr Fluffy asbestos demolition issue, that the opposition have already placed on record that we would facilitate passage of that and—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Because it's helping your mates in the ACT.




Senator WONG:
  we will—



A government senator:  You're so precious.



The CHAIRMAN:  Again, I will ask for the chamber's cooperation to cease interjecting. 




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  We have nothing but constant interjections from this senator all the way through every day—



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Macdonald, this is the third occasion I have called the chamber to order and you immediately then interject. I would ask you to cease doing so. 




Senator WONG:
  I would like to indicate, again, that the opposition has expressed to the government, as I think all parties have, a willingness to facilitate passage of that legislation and three other noncontroversial pieces of legislation in the normal noncontro time on Thursday. It is important that the chamber be made aware of this—that is, we have already indicated agreement to that—given that was used as a basis to argue against the debate on this bill.

The CHAIRMAN:  Thank you. I would ask all senators to be mindful of the standing orders. Senator Birmingham, you have the call.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  I was emphasising to the chamber that this is a bill about reducing red tape. This is a bill about making government more efficient. This is a bill about tidying up the legislative agenda and tabling of the nation. This is a bill designed to ensure that our country can operate with the least amount of intervention from government as possible. And yet what we have had is a complete distortion of this bill by those opposite, a complete distortion of the government's agenda in relation to the legislation before this chamber, and it has all been done quite transparently for base political purposes.


I too will be brief because I spoke on this last night, but it is important in the light of day to ensure that this chamber and those listening understand what has happened here. Last night, in an ambush move, those opposite came into this chamber and plucked a bill that was not even scheduled for debate this week, put it on the agenda to disrupt the orderly process of what the government is seeking to achieve, to disrupt the orderly decision-making we hope to have through this place, and they did this so that they could run a stunt—a stunt of inserting into this bill an amendment that is completely unrelated to the legislation before the chair, an amendment that has no bearing on it and an amendment that, frankly, is a gross overreach in terms of the actions that the Labor Party is seeking to pursue.


It was acknowledged last night by Labor senators that the submarine contract is Australia's largest procurement decision, and yet they want to try to guide it through this place in a stunt, an ambush. That is not the responsible path for decision-making in this country. We have committed to following the well-established proper processes that have been in place since 2003 for defence procurement decisions—a two-part process through cabinet and based on sound advice of the defence chiefs. That is the type of process we have committed to doing, something that successive governments have done when they have had the courage to make defence procurement decisions—something that those opposite sorely lacked on most occasions. That is the process we are committed to upholding, not the type of stunt driven process that those opposite are seeking to deploy.


The truth is the Labor Party are more interested in stunts than they are submarines. The Labor Party are more interested in gestures than they are in jobs. Last night they wanted to bring to a vote matters around this stunt to put a submarine clause into unrelated legislation. But then we just had them vote against having a vote on this matter, with Senator Wong standing up and saying in her own special pious way, 'We want to get this matter over with and bring it to a vote.' If she wanted to bring it to a vote, Senator Wong had her chance. The Labor Party had their chance. Instead, they all lined up to vote against having a vote. Why did they do that? Of course they did that just so that Senator Wong could grandstand. Senator Wong and everyone else had 2½ hours last night in which there was ample time to grandstand. But Senator Wong chose not to grandstand last night, because that would not have suited the media cycle as well as it would for her to come in at the time that she did.


No number of stunts, no amount of clever tactics or gestures from those opposite, can get away from the basic facts. The basic facts around submarines are that in 2007 the Labor Party promised that if they were elected to government there would be action starting in 2007 around the procurement of submarines. Six years on and nothing was accomplished in that regard—six years of inaction based on a promise they took to the 2007 election and to the 2010 election and a promise made repeatedly during their two terms in government. Six years of inaction is what has created the capability gap that this government confronts in relation to our most important and valuable defensive asset: our submarines. 


Six years of inaction is what has put jobs at risk in Australia's shipbuilding industry, because it is six years of inaction that has created the so-called valley of death that the shipbuilding industry currently faces. It was not just inaction, it was not just that Senator Wong and Senator Conroy and those around the Labor cabinet table sat on their hands and did nothing for six years in relation to this major defence procurement; it was that they undertook damaging actions in that time. They cut the defence budget to the lowest level of GDP since 1938. How on earth did they think they were ever going to procure submarines with a defence budget cut of that level? They stripped the future submarine procurement program of hundreds of millions of dollars. How on earth did they think they were going to make a multibillion-dollar procurement decision while stripping the forward budget for that very program? It was those budget decisions that further added to the risk of a capability gap that we now face in making decisions about submarines. It was that slashing of the budget that created the situation of the potential valley of death and put jobs at risk.


Our government went to the last election committing that within 18 months we would make decisions about the future procurement of submarines. We went to the last election with a policy—a publicly released, written policy—something those opposite did not bother to release during the election campaign. That policy made clear that shipbuilding work would centre on South Australia's shipyards, that the Australian work in relation to submarines would centre on South Australia's shipyards. That is absolutely what will happen. We have stated time and time again that, as a result of the largest procurement decision in Australia's history in relation to submarines, there will be more jobs in the future at the South Australian shipyards. That is what everybody should take heart from. They should take heart from the fact that they now have a government in place, unlike the previous one, that will work through the proper processes, the established processes, the cabinet processes and informed by the advice of the defence chiefs, and make decisions in a timely and orderly manner—decisions to ensure that Australia does not face a capability gap in our defence assets, decisions to ensure that Australian taxpayers get the best value for money out of this multibillion-dollar procurement decision, and decisions that will preserve and protect for decades to come the jobs of South Australians employed in naval and submarine shipbuilding and maintenance work.


Let us cast aside the stunts of those opposite. They may have the numbers in this place to run around with their silly stunts, but on this side we are serious about getting submarines, filling the capability gap, protecting jobs and protecting what is important for taxpayers in terms of getting value for money. We will not be distracted by those stunts. We will not be distracted by the silly game-playing of those opposite. We will simply get on with the job of delivering the best possible outcome for all Australians.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2014-12-02,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:57):  I indicate that I support this amendment. I know that the—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You are part of the stunt, aren't you?




Senator XENOPHON:
  I know a thing or two about stunts, but I regard this as a very important issue. The fact is, prior to the last election, the government in opposition made an unequivocal commitment to build submarines in South Australia. On 8 May 2013, the then shadow defence minister Senator David Johnston said during a visit to Adelaide, 'We will deliver those submarines from right here at ASC in South Australia.' Why ASC South Australia? There is only one place that has all of the expertise that is necessary to complete one of the most complex, difficult and costly capital works projects that Australia can undertake, and it is ASC in Adelaide. He went on to say:


The Coalition today is committed to building 12 new submarines here in Adelaide. We will get that task done, and it is a really important task, not just for the Navy but for the nation.


And we are going to see the project through, and put it very close after force protection, as our number priority if we win the next federal election.


Senator Birmingham did make some valid criticisms of the former government not advancing the issue of submarines more expeditiously. I think that is a valid issue. But Senator Birmingham also said—and as a fellow South Australian senator he understands the importance of this project, its strategic importance and its economic importance to the people of South Australia and indeed the nation—that we need to have appropriate processes and good processes. 


I have been part of the naval shipbuilding inquiry. I heard the evidence a number of weeks ago from Dr John White, a man who was retained by this government because of his credibility in terms of preparing the Winter White report—with Don Winter, a former US secretary of the navy—on the AWD program, the problems with that program and what needs to be done to fix that program. Dr John White is a man who is held in high esteem by the coalition, in my view because it was Dr White who was responsible for fixing up the mess of the Anzac frigate program—taking that project over and bringing it in on time and on budget. In fact, it might have been under time and under budget. That is the turnaround that he achieved. We need to listen to him. The evidence that he gave to an inquiry of the Senate economics committee was very clear. He said that we do have time, if we get on our skates immediately and ensure that there is a competitive project definition study so that we can use the best of the best. We can get the best expertise, the best ideas from around the world, in order to build a submarine, and it ought to be built right here in Australia. Abandoning a competitive process, abandoning that due process that Dr White has recommended, would be both a strategic and an economic disaster for our nation. So there are issues that we need to consider. 


I agree with Senator Birmingham that we need to have due process. That due process appears to have been abandoned, judging by the remarks made by the Treasurer, the Hon. Mr Hockey, earlier today on the Fran Kelly program on Radio National, where he said that there will not be an open tender. It appears that there will not be any tender and that the deal has been done. There is an argument that the government has been effectively backfilling as a result of what appears to be an arrangement, an agreement, a process, that will guarantee that the subs will be built in Japan. I think that that is not the way that we need to go forward. 


This is an inelegant mechanism—this amendment to this bill—but I think it indicates the importance of this issue to not just South Australia but the nation. If we end up exporting the manufacture of our subs to another country, effectively we will see something like $20 billion-plus worth of jobs being exported overseas. We are seeing a situation where we will ignore the ongoing economic benefits, the multiplier effect, of having the subs built here, let alone the issue of skills being retained here. 


There is no reason why we cannot have the best design, even an overseas design. Those designers can be part of the project here in Australia. TKMS, the German submarine builder, which has a credible record of building submarines overseas, on time and on budget, has said as much. Indeed, in Greece, as troubled as that economy has been, it has managed to build subs, while dealing with communist unions. It built the subs on time and on budget. So I think that indicates its expertise. And there are other submarine makers that have an expertise in relation to that.


We need to listen to the experts. We need to listen to Dr John White. We need to ensure that the submarines are built in our nation. We know that, for every dollar spent here locally, there are significant flow-on economic benefits. We know, from the Royal United Services Institution of the United Kingdom, that, for every pound spent on defence procurement in that country, 37 per cent goes back into general revenue. Obviously the figure would be different here, because of different taxation arrangements and the like, but there is a significant economic impact in respect of that. 


There is also the issue of the promise. One of the reasons why I think people are so disillusioned with all of us as politicians is that, if you break a promise as fundamental as this, it just chips away at the credibility of those that break the promise and it affects all of us as politicians. I re-read a piece by Hugh Mackay from 1 August 1998. He is a social researcher, psychologist and writer. He made the point:


With trust in the political process being eroded with every bent principle, every broken promise and every policy backflip, the level of cynicism has reached breaking point for many Australians.


That was back in 1998, during the time of the GST debate. But John Howard, to his absolute credit, had the courage, had the tremendous political will, to argue an election on an unpopular measure, namely the GST. He got through, and, for that, I think John Howard needs to be acknowledged as one of the great prime ministers of this nation—for pushing through a change, a reform, and going to the electorate to seek that mandate. For that, I have enormous regard for John Howard.


Breaking this promise on submarines is not the way that the government should operate. If they believe that the ASC is not up to the task, which contradicts what was said by the Minister for Defence as shadow defence minister back in May 2013, then they need to look at the structure of the ASC. I do not necessarily accept those arguments, but, as the owner of the ASC, the government have the wherewithal to fix any problems with the ASC. We need to do this as a nation. As inelegant, clumsy and messy as this mechanism is, I am obliged, on behalf of my constituents in South Australia, to support this measure. If we do not build the submarines in South Australia, if we do not build them in Australia, with flow-on benefits to other states, then we will be making a massive strategic and economic mistake.

"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",Ind.,2014-12-02,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (13:05):  It is a pleasure to contribute on the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014 and associated amendments. I will focus my comments on the opposition's amendment, which guarantees that the Future Submarine project tender process is accountable and carried out with Australia's national interest in mind, in complete contrast to the way the Abbott government have proposed to carry out the build of our future naval shipping. The government have given every indication, through their Minister for Defence and Prime Minister, that they are prepared to abandon and betray Australia's defence shipbuilding industry and Australian designers, engineers, apprentices and tradespeople.


This Senate has censured the defence minister, who is responsible for Australia's naval shipbuilding industry. It is timely to remind this chamber of the points of that recent successful censure motion. I agree that the Minister for Defence has: (1) insulted the men and women of ASC by stating he 'wouldn't trust them to build a canoe'; (2) undermined the confidence in Australia's defence capability; (3) threatened the integrity of Australia's defence procurement project; (4) broken his promise made on 8 May 2013 to build 12 new submarines at ASC in South Australia; and (5) cut the real pay, Christmas and recreational leave for Australian Defence Force personnel. And, despite a clear message from this Senate to the PM, he has arrogantly refused to listen. Mr Abbott has refused to stand up for the men and women who build our ships. He has failed to stand up for the generation to come who will build our ships.


This has now become a matter of leadership, and the fact that the defence minister has not been ordered to step aside following a successful censure motion by the Senate reflects poorly on the Prime Minister. The people of Australia have stopped listening to him now. Broken promise after broken promise by the Prime Minister and his defence minister have destroyed their credibility and the willingness of the people of Australia to listen or trust. The fish rots from the head down, and this Liberal government is on the nose with ordinary Australians and the men and women of our naval shipbuilding program and, of course, our Australian Defence Force personnel. 


Again I remind this chamber that the government of Australia should have followed the advice of the now Governor-General, Sir Peter Cosgrove. As the former Chief of the Defence Force Sir Peter said:


Whenever I am asked why we should build submarines in Australia, my short reply is that we can’t afford not to.


Again I remind this chamber that the Australian government has identified the need to build about eight warships at a cost of $100 billion over the coming decades. Adding maintenance across the ships' lifetimes, the outlay is closer to $250 billion. I repeat that I want Tasmania to have a fair share of that $250 billion worth of Australia's shipbuilding. I remind this parliament that Tasmania can also play an important role in Australian shipbuilding for our Australian Defence Force. If this defence minister is allowed to have his way—if he is allowed to remain in this high office, undermining national security by his lack of credibility, leadership and respect for the truth—then my state of Tasmania will lose all hope of ever contributing to that $250 billion national defence-building program.


Tasmania has a maritime network taking the world by sea. Like others states, we have world-class maritime engineers, designers and shipbuilders. We have Incat, APCO Engineering, the Australian Maritime College, Cawthorn Welding, Revolution Design, Plastic Fabrications, Richardson Devine Marine, Sabre Marine & General Engineers and many more. Tasmania has world-class skills in training and research. We have the Australian Maritime College, the Asia Pacific Maritime Institute, CSIRO and Skills Tasmania. Why shouldn't Tasmanian designers, shipbuilders, tradespeople, apprentices, trainers and small business owners share in the work and the wealth that is generated by ships and other equipment built for the Australian Defence Force?


I am for Australian workers and building Australian ships and other machinery to defend our nation; this government has shown that it clearly is not. I support this bill and the amendment put before the chamber by the opposition, which will ensure a fair go for Australian workers and companies.

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (13:10):  I rise to speak about the opposition amendment. The Minister for Defence's disgraceful slur against the ASC last week has cast a shadow over the entire Future Submarine project. The Senate needs to urgently address this issue and ensure that the ADF get the best possible submarine and that taxpayers' money is efficiently spent. Those are the two criteria, and they should be the only criteria when it comes to this Future Submarine project. The chamber must adopt this amendment because this project is too important to be left to this incompetent minister. The efficient conduct of government and the efficient allocation of resources should be at the forefront of every minister's mind, but that is clearly not the case with this minister. 


Yesterday, the Prime Minister said he wanted 'a really effective submarine at a fair price'. I have good news for the Prime Minister: we know how to make sure that that happens. Expert after expert told the Senate that the only way to get the best capability for the best price is to hold a competitive tender process with a funded project definition study. If the Prime Minister is serious about the Future Submarine project, he will tell his senators to support this amendment. He will tell his senators to help the minister to keep his promise to build 12 submarines in Adelaide. I do not have high hopes, though, as this government has been breaking and walking away from this promise since the day it got into government. I say to those opposite that you do not have to listen to me, but listen to experts like Dr John White, who told a Senate inquiry:


There are significant technical, commercial and capability gap risks invoked by prematurely and unilaterally committing to a preferred overseas, sole-source supplier.


Retired Rear Admiral Peter Briggs told the same inquiry that the only way to pick the best submarine:


… is to conduct a competitive project definition study where you can get the answers back to your top-level requirements …


In fact, the report of the Senate inquiry recommended: 


The government … not enter into a contract for the future submarine project without conducting a competitive tender for the future submarines, including a funded project definition study. 


This is what my amendment seeks to ensure.


All that we are looking to do is to ensure that the government uses the best process so that we can make sure that we get the best possible outcome. How can you oppose a competitive tender process? How can the Liberal Party—the party of free enterprise and competition—oppose an amendment like this? The government is standing in the way. We learnt earlier today that, despite all the evidence about the benefits of a competitive tender and despite knowing that there is still time to hold a competitive tender and avoid a capability gap—and that is what the experts said—the Treasurer of Australia, Mr Joe Hockey, has ruled out holding a competitive tender process. The party of free enterprise and competition and the chief spruiker of competition in this country, the Treasurer of Australia, say there is to be no competitive tender, despite the defence minister's frequent announcements that no decision has been made. The defence minister says there has been no decision but the Treasurer says there will be no competitive tender.


Let me make it clear: it would be an absolute scandal to award this contract without a proper, fair dinkum, competitive tender process with a funded project definition study. Do not take the weasel words we are hearing from the minister at the moment and do not take the weasel words we have been hearing from various officials. This amendment to the legislation would ensure that we get a proper process. Frankly, companies from around the world which are trying to be involved in this tender process are absolutely stunned by the behaviour of this government, the champions of free enterprise and competition. They have had to resort to putting in unsolicited bids from the big submarine companies telling the government that they can build 12 submarines for a very competitive price here in Australia. 


French companies, German companies and Swedish companies have been so shocked by the conduct of this government that they have, publicly in some cases, put a bid into the public sphere saying, 'We can do this.' But is this government listening? No because it is becoming increasingly clear that they are hell-bent on their sweetheart deal with Japan. They are absolutely determined to deliver this contract to the Japanese submarine companies. We know this because we asked the minister just yesterday. His office, the Prime Minister's office and his department prepared press releases, talking points and information to announce the Japanese had won the bid. No-one in this chamber, when they vote on this, should think that there is a fair dinkum process being undertaken. This government has already made up its mind. It has already made its decision. Only this amendment will hold this government to account. 


The government's outrageous bias against Australian manufacturers is getting in the way of good, sensible government. The defence minister's colleagues know this. That is why, when the minister announced to the Senate that he would not trust the ASC to build a canoe, they dropped him like a hot potato. They walked away from him. His colleagues told the media that the defence minister's statements were 'some of the most stupid words ever heard from a senior minister'. They knew he had blown the whistle on the scam, the pretence that they are going to hold a process. The Japanese have this in the bag. The Japanese know it. The Japanese President knows it. The American President knows it. The Prime Minister knows it. Those three people had a meeting just a few weeks ago at an economic summit where they discussed putting American war systems into the Japanese submarines to be built for Australia. This is a done deal. Only this amendment can give the best possible chance of getting the best submarine at the best price and built here in Australia. 


This amendment should be supported because it will ensure that a proper and fair tender process is gone through before selecting a design and construction partner for the submarine project. This is not some new process we are talking about; this is the established process, the established best practice to get the best outcome for projects like the future submarines. Unfortunately, given the clear bias shown by the minister and the Treasurer's statements earlier today, it is clear the government will need to be dragged, kicking and screaming, to do the right thing . That is why this amendment should be supported and I commend it to the Senate and that is why any South Australian senator who comes into this chamber and votes with the government is betraying the people of South Australia who elected them. They were elected on the votes of people who believed that Tony Abbott and David Johnston would keep their promise to build 12 submarines in Australia.

Question agreed to.

"Waters, Sen Larissa",AG,2014-12-02,"



Senator WATERS
 (Queensland) (13:20):  I move Greens amendment (1) on sheet 7642:


(1) Schedule 3, Parts 1 and 2, page 16 (line 2) to page 17 (line 19), to be opposed.


I wish to speak briefly on the remaining amendments on that sheet, which I will have to move separately, given that some of them are phrased differently from the others. Just to explain, the purpose of these amendments is to oppose the abolition of a handful of advisory councils which are currently serving a very useful function of providing expert advice to the minister and to the Department of the Environment, particularly about hazardous waste issues. We are opposing the abolition of the Product Stewardship Advisory Group, the Oil Stewardship Advisory Council and the Fuel Standards Consultative Committee, all of which have successfully provided expert policy advice in highly complex areas. 


We are also opposing in the later amendments, which I will move shortly, the weakening of the hazardous waste regime, which reduces transparency and reduces safeguards for the environment and for local communities.  Far from perhaps a harmless-sounding red tape reduction we are seeing a reduction in environmental standards and a reduction in community participation in important decisions that have real impacts. The government appears to be blindly implementing the recommendations of their earlier commission of audit but the fact remains that these environmental programs have been an absolute excess story. 


The aim of the Product Stewardship Advisory Group is to advise the minister on products for accreditation under the Product Stewardship Act. The government says, 'It's fine; we don't need this advice any more because the department can do this in House. 


Our advice from the experts is that the department may well have the will, but they do not have the capacity because this government has cut their staff. They also do not currently have the expertise, which is precisely why this expert body was established in the first place.


What we are seeing here, which is perhaps not unusual from this government, is a stepping away from evidence based, science based decision making. Instead, the government intends to put more pressure on an already underresourced department which, in these particular examples, lacks the skills and the resources to properly fill that gap. 


Moving now to the Oil Stewardship Advisory Council: similarly, it is an advisory body which advises the minister on matters related to the Product Stewardship for Oil Program. This encompasses things like product stewardship, recovery, recycling, benefits, the state of oil production and oil recycling industries. Having this advisory body has been a real success story. The advice from experts is that there are two meetings per year with some very fair sitting fees per member and that the advisory body provides a very useful function to the government of the day. 


The Total Environment Centre and the National Toxics Network have opposed the abolition of these bodies. The Total Environment Centre said:


By abolishing the Product Stewardship Advisory Group (PSAG) which has performed an essential function of investigating and recommending products like waste batteries and paint to be subject to recycling instead of being dumped into landfill …


The federal government is effectively taking other harmful wastes off the national recycling agenda.


It argues the department can still do this on an ‘as needs’ basis but the department does not initiate such action and it is under a clear government direction to resist new regulation.


Clearly, industry and the department are being sent a message here: 'Just keep on approving things; we do not value expert advice; let's just tick and flick.'


The fuel quality standards amendments are along a similar vein. They seek to abolish the Fuel Standards Consultative Committee. They insert a new consultation process which applies to the grant process and the variation of approvals process for fuel standards. The government says that the department will carry out that advisory role; but, again, this is why we have expert advisory bodies: when you have slashed the department down to so few staff, and particularly when the staff who remain do not have the relevant expertise in these areas, that is precisely when you need expert advice.


I will flag that there are some parts of this bill that we do not oppose in schedule 3, and some of those are genuinely duplicative. We have structured our amendments in a way that we think is fair and that does not object to the abolition of particular parts which genuinely seem to be superfluous and do not have an actual on-ground impact. We are taking a reasonable approach here, but you simply cannot abolish three expert environment advisory bodies and somehow charge the department with those new responsibilities when you have sacked hundreds of those people who are already under pressure from an existing workload. 


I will finish up by speaking to the hazardous waste amendments. The government is planning on gutting the hazardous waste regulation regime. They, of course, describe it as streamlining and simplifying. In fact, it is reducing the ability of local communities to keep track of what is going on and to be able to protect their health and their local environment. In particular, the government are seeking to remove the requirement for the particulars of an export application to be specified in regs before a decision is made to grant an export permit. They are also seeking to reduce the matters that must be included in import and export permits. They are removing the publication requirements of our permits from the Gazette and they are removing the requirement for a transit permit as well as introducing a new tenure limit on the Hazardous Waste Technical Group, which is somewhat perplexing and raises suspicions as to whether that is designed to hasten a particular person out. We are opposing the repeal of these hazardous waste provisions because this government seems intent on reducing environmental protection, as it is intent on reducing staff at the environment departments who are under an incredible amount of pressure to do valuable work. We need these expert advisory committees. They are performing a valuable role and assisting government in making positive decisions—if, of course, that advice is followed. We will, therefore, be opposing their abolition.

Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia—Minister for Defence) (14:00):  I thank the senator for the question. This, firstly, is not a hysterical issue. It seeks to put national security interests ahead of Labor union mates' interests. The government's approach, as I have said on several occasions, is that, in order to seek to prevent a capability gap, the government will follow the Kinnaird reforms to Defence procurement. It is interesting to note—because I was quite surprised to find this when I had a look back over the records—that, since July 2007, 77 major Defence acquisitions were completed by the Labor Party. Of the 77, 70 per cent were single-source procurements. That is, there was no tender. They just simply went to the contract.


I have said that what we will do is—in the ordinary course of business, as we have always done—a first and second pass process that is open and transparent. It is clear that Labor has said more on submarines in the last six weeks than ever they did in six years. Because of inaction, ignorance and a lack of understanding of the need to have a degree of duty diligence and expedition on this program, we are fronting a capability gap. That capability gap is a very serious concern to the government and to the Australian Navy. Let me reiterate: we will follow due process. (Time expired)

Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland) (15:00):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Defence, Senator Johnston, and the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Senator Scullion, to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to the manufacture of the next fleet of Australian submarines and to Indigenous affairs policy.


In my address this afternoon, I will focus on the answers given by Minister Scullion to questions that were asked of him today. From my perspective, two themes seemed to emerge from the answers to those questions during question time. The first one was that all of the issues that were being raised by Labor senators were not his responsibility; they were someone else's responsibility. They were either the responsibility of a state government or in fact our responsibility, which is somewhat troubling since he has been the minister for quite some time now.


Senator Sterle asked some very important questions about the impact of the cuts of more than $28 million in the state of Western Australia to the municipal and essential services funding program. Frankly, Minister Scullion's response was flippant and dismissive; in fact, it seemed that he did not care. It was all the responsibility of Western Australia. So $28 million has been cut from those services in Western Australia, and the state of Western Australia has responded by saying that up to 150 communities will be closed down. That is appalling and atrocious—it is quite an irresponsible response from Western Australia—but we should look at the history here. Let us not forget it was Minister Scullion who came into this chamber and proclaimed proudly that agreement—that was his word—had been reached with a number of states and territories around the municipal and essential services program, that they would be phased out and that this was an agreed position. The comments from the Queensland Premier and the Western Australian Premier would put a lie to the claim that this was in fact an agreement. Western Australian are still responding by saying that they will stop municipal services to up to 150 communities, with the result that we will see another Mapoon; we will see another event where people will be forcibly removed from their communities, with huge impacts on more regional centres around the community. And I commend Senator Scullion for his work in promoting this issue to the community.


I also want to draw attention to the issues around the huge cut, the more than $500 million cut, to Indigenous services following this budget. As well as that, as well as half a billion dollars cut from Indigenous programs, we have seen the monumental throwing up in the air of the funding programs to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations. This has been a monumental change, and all in one hit. We have seen services not even apply for funding because it was too complex. We have seen the minister or his department have to go back to talk with up to 75 organisations providing absolutely essential services across the country. They have had to talk to them about how they are going to continue to provide services to Indigenous communities, services that include domestic violence shelters. They cannot have just assumed that everyone was going to apply for these services; they must have had some knowledge that these services would simply close their doors, that they would not continue.


We have also seen the Prisoner Throughcare Program and the anti-recidivism program cut; the Aboriginal Family Violence Prevention and Legal Service defunded; preventative health programs like the tackling smoking program have been cut significantly. We know that Indigenous people smoke at a much higher rate than the non-Indigenous population, so to cut anti-smoking campaigns in your first budget is surely terribly short-sighted. Healthy lifestyle programs have also been cut. But what I found astonishing, and this goes to a question of credibility, was the second theme that appeared in today's answers. When I asked the minister if he was aware of Indigenous groups who would not speak on the record because they feared their funding would be cut, who found that the Indigenous Advancement Strategy criteria were not clear, he said he had not heard those concerns. Now Minister Scullion stands there every time we ask him questions—he is so connected to the community, but if he has not heard those concerns then he is not listening. (Time expired)

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2014-12-02,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) (15:06):  One of the areas of policy pursuit of this government, particularly of social policy pursuit, that I am most proud of is the work in Indigenous advancement, is the work to ensure that we tackle an issue that has been a sad blight on Australia throughout our modern history and that we take the necessary steps to make changes that can make a real difference, I hope, to the lives of current and, in particular, future generations.


We have made very clear that we want to focus on making a difference with the basics because we believe—from the Prime Minister to Minister Scullion and Parliamentary Secretary Tudge, right through the government—that if you get the basics right in Indigenous policy then the benefits will flow right throughout the wellbeing of our Indigenous populations.


The basics we start with are our three key priorities: getting children to school, getting adults to work and ensuring communities are safe. The truth is that we have been failing as a country across those three priorities for far too long. In many cases, Indigenous school children do not make it to school even half of the time, according to the data. Indigenous employment fell to 48 per cent in 2012-13 after significant gains between 1994 and 2008, when it had risen from 38 per cent to 54 per cent. So we have gone backwards in Indigenous employment. The most recent data indicates that there was no significant change in family and community violence between 2002 and 2008. It is clear for all to see that levels of violence in Indigenous communities are far, far too high.


So we must admit, and I would hope that everyone must admit, that the policies that have been deployed to date simply do not work, they have not worked and a new approach is needed. That is exactly what this government has done. We often hear debates about how much is being invested. It is not about how much money you spend; it is about how you spend the money that you invest. It is most important in this space that we get the policy settings right to ensure that we are investing the dollars in Indigenous policies to actually generate outcomes. I hope that we are able to spend what is necessary. But it is not about the quantum as much as what we do with it. 


Our government's new Indigenous Advancement Strategy began on 1 July this year. It absolutely was unashamedly about shaking up and reshaping the way we deliver policies for Indigenous Australians. It replaced more than 150 different individual programs scattered across government—programs that lacked cohesion or coordination—with five flexible, broad-based programs under the leadership and direction of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. It ensured that the direction sits at the heart of government, that the coordination sits at the heart of government and that we have programs in place that are able to deliver what is required on the ground. 


Those five streams focus on; firstly, jobs, land and economy; secondly, children and schooling; thirdly, safety and wellbeing; fourthly, culture and capability; and, fifthly, remote Australia. This refocusing is critical, and accompanying it is a significant investment in Indigenous policy—$4.8 billion is being invested over four years with a clear focus to achieve the results our government desires of getting more children to school and more adults into work, and delivering safer communities. Already we are seeing some positive returns in this space. Already we are seeing that the investment in the remote school attendance strategy is delivering some positive results. But of course there is much, much more to be done. But I hope that, rather than the nitpicking that we see from those opposite, we see constructive contributions from them that allow us to reshape these policies for the benefit of the Australians who need it most.

"Peris, Sen Nova",ALP,2014-12-02,"



Senator PERIS
 (Northern Territory) (15:11):  I also rise to take note of answers provided in question time today by the Minister for Indigenous Affairs in relation to concerns raised by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner Mick Gooda. A week ago, the government announced it was breaking yet another promise: it was going to scrap the promise to bring in a Closing the Gap target for incarceration rates. In response to this, Mr Gooda said, 'Australia is better at keeping Aboriginal children in jail than in school.' I thought his comment was spot on because it highlights that in this country we are trying to lock away the problems rather than solve them. Locking away the problems is easier than working hard to come up with complex solutions.


The Abbott government's cuts of half a billion dollars to Indigenous affairs is hurting Aboriginal people in this country and the claims that these cuts are not to front-line services have been proven wrong. You cannot rip out half a billion dollars without having an effect. Everybody knows this, including Mr Gooda, which is why he said that, in the first 12 months, this minister has overseen an upheaval in the Indigenous affairs portfolio which has caused 'widespread uncertainty and stress, particularly amongst Aboriginal communities'. Mr Gooda also said that there had been little or no consultation with those working at the coalface. He also said that government plans will create one of the largest upheavals in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs.


The minister should take these concerns very seriously and not dismiss Mr Gooda's views with such arrogance as he displayed today in the Senate. On this issue, the government is not listening and Aboriginal people feel like their concerns are falling on deaf ears. I say to the Prime Minister, 'If you are going to be the Prime Minister for Aboriginal affairs then the first thing you must do is open up your ears.' The Prime Minister acknowledged that his cuts are hurting. He must acknowledge that the changes he has made are not working. He must acknowledge that all we have are broken promises.


The Prime Minister should read Mr Gooda's report because the report says that the overrepresentation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as both victims and offenders in the criminal justice system is one of the most urgent human rights issues facing Australia today. Sadly, in the Northern Territory we are going backwards—Aboriginal people are held in detention without any conviction. There are Aboriginal people who have been determined by a court to be unfit to plead guilty due to their intellectual disabilities who have never been convicted but languish in prison for years. This is a clear breach of human rights. There are people who are locked up without conviction because they suffer from alcoholism. They have committed no crime and have not been charged with any offence, but they are locked up against their will in conditions doctors have warned could lead to death. We have seen this occur through ignorance. Tragically, a few weeks ago an Aboriginal woman died in custody, and all the Northern Territory government tried to do was cover up the death. Of course, these alcohol prisons are racially based. Ninety-nine per cent of those who are locked up are Aboriginal. When a non-Aboriginal person gets drunk in the pub and falls over, they do not end up in these alcohol prisons, but, if an Aboriginal person drinks in a park, the solution is to lock them up.


A facility that was deemed unsuitable for adults is being used now for our children. Young children are being held in isolation. The Northern Territory government has changed legislation so that prison officers now can ignore medical practitioners and deny an inmate medical attention. None of this will work to reduce incarceration rates. In fact, the evidence on what works is being ignored—again going back to chapter 4 of Mr Gooda's report, where he outlines what is working. I urge everyone on the crossbench to read what Mr Gooda has said. One of the programs he talks about is one in Bourke. The program is called Maranguka, which simply means 'to give to the people', 'caring' and 'offering help'. They engage locals. They empower young people rather than lecture them.


I could talk about this for hours, because it is such an important thing. The Prime Minister needs to read this report to understand what is working. I suspect that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Indigenous Affairs have broken their promise on the Closing the Gap target for incarceration rates because they do not think that they will meet any meaningful target, but, through justice reinvestment, we can. Mr Gooda has stated in his report that he is severely disappointed that the minister is backing away from his previous commitment to justice targets. He outlines why justice targets are so important if we are going to achieve a reduction in both offenders and victims. We need to end the approach of simply locking up problems that appear too hard to solve.

 (Western Australia) (15:16):  Let me begin with some congratulations. This is a very positive sign that we can look towards for 2015. At last, the Labor opposition have brought to the Senate during question time some issues worthy of debate. Congratulations. You will not be surprised to hear that senators on this side have a different point of view. You will not be surprised to hear that senators on this side reflect some of the attitudes across the Australian community. But, before I talk about the disgraceful episode that was Labor's period of governance in Indigenous affairs, before I talk about what happened to education, before I talk about what happened to employment, before I talk about what the Australian National Audit Office, the independent auditor, had to say in 2012 about Labor's performance, let us put it in context.


Labor want you to believe that on Sunday, 8 September 2013 the world changed. Labor want you to believe that everything that happened before Sunday, 8 September 2013 no longer matters. They want their legacy purged from your memory. They do not want you to be reminded about the economic vandalism. They do not want you to be reminded about the poor policy, matched only by poor implementation. They do not want you to know that much of what the government is facing now is inherited and caused by the inaction or poor action of the previous government. Nothing demonstrates the romanticism, the revisionism, of Labor more than the comments of Bill Shorten this morning. What did Bill Shorten say this morning? He said, 'Today is the anniversary of the election of the Whitlam government.' What anniversary did he not reflect on? He did not reflect on the fact that it is also the anniversary of the election of Mark Latham, when Mark Latham beat Kim Beazley by one vote in the Labor caucus room. Why doesn't Labor want you to talk about or hear about Mark Latham?




Senator Gallacher:
  What has this got to do with the debate we're having now?




Senator SMITH:
  Context is very important, Senator Gallacher. This goes to a very, very important issue. Nothing that is happening at the moment, none of the decisions the government take, is happening in isolation. It is happening under the umbrella of the poor management of the previous Labor government. So why do they not want you to hear about Mark Latham? Because this is what Mark Latham had to say about Labor on 28 August this year:


Shorten failed to support the push for rank-and-file participation: breaking down factional control and the inexorable march of dud union officials into upper house seats.


He can't afford to be missing in action again. After all, if he won't stand up for good governance inside his own party, how can he govern the country?


If Bill Shorten does not stand up for good governance in his own party, how can he stand up for good governance in the country? This is the important part: 


Shorten needs to prove to voters he's tough enough to run tight fiscal and border protection strategies.


We are dealing today with a very important issue, and that is how we progress Indigenous advantage in our community. We cannot do that without addressing some of the appalling legacy left to us by the former Labor government.


I want to turn briefly to Labor's record in Indigenous affairs. This is a personal point of view. I think that disagreement about how we approach Indigenous issues in our country is good, because it means we get better ideas. It means we get a better approach. We need more contestability in how we approach Indigenous issues in our country, much more contestability. So what do we know about Labor's record when it comes to Indigenous affairs? Let us look at school attendance. Then I will turn to employment and then I will turn to the comments of the Australian National Audit Office. Under Labor, school attendance in remote communities was appalling. In many cases, children were not even attending school 50 per cent of the time. We know we need good education to make sure that the cycle of welfare dependency is broken. What did the Australian National Audit Office say? The Australian National Audit Office said— (Time expired)

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2014-12-02,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (15:21):  I rise to take note of answers to questions asked by Senator Wong to Senator Johnston. Senator Johnston made a couple of remarks in his replies, and one was about the 'capability gap'. You would have to be quite far away from a newspaper, a radio station, a talkback journalist or a politician not to realise that there are serious questions about Senator Johnston's capability and whether he has a capability gap, whether he is actually in charge of his portfolio and in charge of his processes.


He was asked to reply to the statement made by the Treasurer this morning ruling out an open competitive tender in the purchase of Australia's defence capability in submarines. His answer was, 'It will all be aboveboard and according to Hoyle.' Well 'aboveboard', if you have a bit of a google, means open and transparent. I would have thought that would apply to a competitive tender with intense competitive pressure from various nations with the capability, including the ability for, most importantly, South Australian operations to compete. Given that the Liberal Party, allegedly, are the party of free enterprise and competition, I would have thought that they would have welcomed an open and transparent process, including a competitive tender. He went on to say 'and according to Hoyle'. Hoyle, I think, was the expert on the rules of cards. So really they have not delivered 'aboveboard and according to Hoyle'. They have actually ruled out a competitive tender.


May we ask the question: why? There are some who suggest that it has something to do with the early completion of the Japan-Australia free trade agreement. Was there a second deal in that treaty—one that the Australian population is not aware of? Was consideration given to an earlier resolution in that treaty with the inclusion of, 'We'll buy your submarines'? Was that the case? If the minister is absolutely correct that it is aboveboard, according to Hoyle, a second pass process and no decision has been made, why did the Treasurer say, 'I categorically rule out a competitive tender process'?


There are a number of South Australian senators who would probably support me, and they are not on this side of the chamber. There are probably a number of South Australian members of parliament who would be asking much the same questions of this government as we have. Senator Fawcett, Senator Ruston, Senator Birmingham, Senator Edwards, the member for Hindmarsh, the member for Sturt and the member for Boothby—all Liberal members of parliament—are on the record questioning the capability of this minister. 


As I said at the outset, is the capability gap that he is referring to in his own operation of his department? Is his office where there is a lack of capability? Are they incapable and unable to stand up to the Prime Minister's office? Is there a deal here that the Australian public know nothing about? In an early and prompt conclusion of the Japan-Australia free trade agreement was a side deal done? Was there some other arrangement made—a nod and a wink: 'Don't you worry about that. We'll buy your submarines. Just get this paperwork signed'? South Australians need to know.


There are a few in that group of Liberals who have a shiver running up their spine, because the attitude of all South Australians is that we are a defence state, we have capable people, we have many businesses investing many millions of dollars and there are many small businesses who rely on those workers and the ancillary flow-on effects in the economy. As I have said repeatedly, it is widely held and deeply felt that we need to build the submarines in South Australia. The disgraceful situation, as we heard early this morning, is that we are not even going to be allowed to tender. The Treasurer of this country said that we are not even going to be allowed to tender. The minister stumbles and mumbles about a capability gap and it being aboveboard and according to Hoyle, but it looks like a deal has been done.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (15:26):  I rise to take note of Minister Scullion's answer to the question on the Indigenous Advancement Strategy from Senator McLucas. I express my disappointment at the minister's response to that question. He clearly has not been listening to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in terms of their response to the Indigenous Advancement Strategy, which in fact they were not consulted on in the first place. I urge him to relook at Commissioner Gooda's Social justiceand native titlereport 2014 where, very clearly, Mr Gooda points out:


… it has been a year characterised by deep funding cuts, the radical re-shaping of existing programs and services, and the development of new programs and services.


… … …


Information on the transfer arrangements has been scant with minimal involvement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. There was little or no consultation with those working on the ground about which programs and activities were best kept … or which departments were best placed to administer them.


… … … 


Overall, this upheaval and lack of clarity is deeply worrying and is causing widespread uncertainty and stress, particularly amongst our communities.


Mr Gooda has been out throughout the year talking to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, and these are his findings. How can we believe the minister when the commissioner charged with social justice and working on these issues finds that, overall, this upheaval and lack of clarity is deeply worrying and is causing widespread uncertainty and stress, particularly amongst Aboriginal communities?


I must admit that absolutely reflects the feedback that I received when I was out and about talking to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. I have not been to as many communities as the commissioner has, but certainly that is the feedback. Who can blame them for feeling like that when you have had 5,000 applications? In estimates, the department's response was, 'We think that we have had around 3,000; we have not opened them all yet.' They could not tell us how many submissions they had, they could not tell us what they were for and they could not tell us the amount of money they were for. Since then, they have discovered that there are 5,000, and I do not think that they are going to be able to meet even the extension that they have granted themselves. 


Organisations that rely on this funding are deeply worried about the future, their future, but that is only really a symptom of their deep worry, which is how services are going to be provided to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The government are leading people up the garden path if they think that they are not going to be taking funding away from front-line services and that communities will not realise that their services have been cut. We have a Prime Minister for Aboriginal affairs who is overseeing a mess when it comes to delivery of services and programs. As Commissioner Gooda said, it is 'the radical re-shaping of existing programs and services'. He is overseeing a mess. That is what it is looking like to people on the ground. It absolutely looks like a mess on the ground. If it walks, talks and quacks like a duck, it is a duck. That is what is happening with this strategy. It is a duck. People are deeply worried about the future of their communities. 


On top of this process what do we see?  Premier Barnett in Western Australia announced that he is going to close up to 150 communities. That is also as a direct response to the fact that there is not enough funding coming in to support those communities. Have governments, state and federal, thought through what happens to those people when they are effectively kicked out of their communities? They end up being homeless, on the outskirts of town, living in far worse situations than those they have left, meaning that services have to go further to provide the support people need. Commissioner Gooda goes on to say:


It is disappointing that savings from the rationalisation of Indigenous programs and services will not be reinvested into Indigenous Affairs and Closing the Gap initiatives.


This, once again, is highlighting the failure of this government to provide the necessary services and support from a Prime Minister who says he is the Prime Minister for Aboriginal affairs. Then, of course, you have the Minister for Indigenous Affairs and the parliamentary secretary. Nobody really knows what is going on in the mess this government is currently making of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs.

 (Tasmania) (15:51):  I move:

The speech read as follows—



DEFENCE AMENDMENT (FAIR PAY FOR MEMBERS OF THE ADF) BILL 2014




Introduction 



Today I introduce the Defence Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill 2014.This is a very simple piece of legislation to solve a very simple problem.


An unnecessary pay crisis has developed for members of the Australian Defence Force because this government has denied the men and women of our Army, Navy and RAAF a fair pay rise.


Indeed, the pay rise of 1.5 per cent offered to our Diggers by this Government is effectively a pay cut—because it fails to even keep track with the inflation rate. 


So in order to fix this simple problem, my Private Senator's Bill proposes to link the rate of pay increase for members of our ADF—to the rate of increase offered to the federal politicians of this Parliament, or the Consumer Price Index (CPI)—whichever is greater.


Which reasonable Australian, voting according to their conscience, could oppose this simple but fair solution to the current ADF pay crisis?


If this legislation had been introduced and passed ten years ago, according to Parliamentary Library research, instead of an average 3 per cent pay rise each year, members of our ADF would have been rewarded with the annual average 7 per cent wage increase which was granted to our federal politicians.


And while I note that this Government has frozen politicians' pay rises for a couple of years, I also note that in 2012 federal politicians received a pay rise of over 34 per cent.


In response to that outrageous and almost criminal pay rise of 34 per cent for politicians in 2012, a pay freeze, motivated by shame, has currently been put in place. 


In order to properly address this schizophrenic boom and bust approach to wage rate management, my Defence Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill 2014 contains a provision which also links ADF pay to the minimum rate of the Consumer Price Index (CPI).


This means, ADF members are guaranteed to receive a pay rise, which keeps track with either politicians' pay rises or the CPI—whichever is higher.


In addition, by linking ADF pay to politicians' pay it will create a sensible, administrative mechanism, which will temper politicians' insatiable greed—and moderate their frequent and sneaky grabs for the taxpayers' cash.




Voiceless



While I commend the many military Ex-Service Organizations for the brilliant work they do on behalf of our veterans and serving ADF—because members of our Defence Force don't have a union or organization to directly raise their concerns with the Government—their grievances can remain silent and ignored.


Of course it doesn't help when you have a Prime Minister who is equally at home ignoring the cries of injustice from Australia's defence families, as well as this Senate who censured the Defence Minister for the role he played in creating this defence pay crisis.


So the simple but sad fact is that men and women of our ADF don't have a strong voice in the room when their pay and conditions are negotiated. Our Diggers can't go on strike if their government forces them to take a pay cut, loss of holidays and entitlements. You have a Prime Minister who doesn't respect the uniform, except for when he needs a photo-opportunity.


And yet our Diggers are expected, as part of their normal work conditions, to be killed or terribly wounded. And while I applaud the many public servants, (Police, Paramedics, Firefighters, Nurses, Prison and Ambulance Officers) who also run the risk, as part of their normal work conditions, of being killed or terribly wounded, these public servants' rights at work are protected by unions.


This clearly is not the case for members of our tri-services and so this is the reason why a Bill such as this is needed to protect the wages of members of our ADF. Who could reasonably argue against the proposal that our Diggers—who are prepared to shed blood in war for us—should also have their remuneration linked to those who send them to war?




Constitutional?



There may be opponents of the principle that men and women of our ADF receive—and are guaranteed fair pay. Those opponents may try and argue that this Bill breaches sections of Australia's Constitution.


Throughout the drafting of this Bill I've been aware of that possibility, however the best legal advice I've received from the Office of Parliamentary Council is that the Defence Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill 2014 does not breach any provisions of Australia's Constitution.  


Therefore anyone who says otherwise, is simply trying to procrastinate, muddy the waters and let the Abbott Government off the hook, with regard to their appalling and insincere management of the Defence pay crisis.




In closing 



In closing, I'll remind Senators of the minimal and modest pay rises that the members of the ADF have suffered over the last decade. A decade where a few men and women of our defence family shouldered a great burden in the defence of our Nation.


An independent Parliamentary brief I commissioned on the rates of defence force pay rate rises in part reads:




Defence pay increases



There is no single list of the percentage salary increase for ADF members. Therefore, in order to calculate the increases I have used the base line salary for a Warrant Officer Class 1 as listed in each year's WRA and calculated the rate of increase year to year. In addition, I have cross-checked the figure against the salary for a Pilot Officer. The average rise across the 10 years is just over 3 per cent.""


Parliamentary research also shows that in one year alone (2012) Australian politicians were awarded a 34.3  per cent pay rise from $140, 910 to $190,550.


This was an increase in one year of almost $50K ($49,640) for an Australian Politician—while an Australian Soldier (pay band 9 Corporal—now $76K p/a) received a 2.5 per cent pay rise or approximately an extra $1,900 per year.


My critics have said that I'll just be a lone voice in Parliament, but what they fail to understand is that a lone voice, armed with the facts, passion and the truth in our Parliament—a great chamber of democratic debate, can influence and change the course of history for the better.


Our men and women of the ADF deserve pay automatically linked to our politicians or at least pay which will keep track with inflation.


Bitter experience has shown that they can't rely on politicians to rally to their side—unless it was during a memorial day and there was a media opportunity in it for the politician.


My calculations reveal that a fair ADF pay deal will only cost the Abbott Government an extra 1.5 per cent or approximately $121M per year. 


We send more than $500M in foreign aid each year to Indonesia alone. They have a military with nearly 10 times the troops as our ADF. There's plenty of money in the budget, we just don't have the decision-makers with the right priorities.


In advance, I thank the Australian Labor Party, the Greens and my fellow crossbench Senators for their genuine goodwill and co-operation in order to fix a terrible injustice—the ADF pay crisis.


I commend the Defence Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill 2014 to the Senate, the Australian people, my Tasmania and the heroes in our Army, Navy and RAAF.

  The government will not be supporting this motion. The families in question hold valid Nauruan and visas and reside in that country. The women and their families were temporarily transferred to Australia for medical purposes. They do not hold an Australian visa. The minister has been advised these individuals were informed that they would be housed at Blaydin Point alternative place of detention, not placed in the community as claimed. Once their medical issues have been resolved they will be returned to Nauru where they have a right of stay. I can confirm that all individuals are now accommodated in immigration detention facilities in Darwin. Two IHMS midwives have been monitoring the women overnight. The departmental detention service provider is continuing to engage proactively and sensitively with the individuals and provide appropriate services and support.

  Once again, the Greens political party is walking both sides of the infrastructure debate. Labor neither favour roads over rail nor rail over roads, as recommended by experts. We need both to deal properly with needs, not just for some parts of our cities but across our cities, and also needs in regional Victoria. That is why we established Infrastructure Australia.


Labor allocated $3 billion to the Melbourne Metro Rail Project, based on Infrastructure Australia's advice that the metro was much better taxpayer value than the East West Link. Labor also funded M80 projects and managed motorway projects, based on high net benefits. These were also cut.


Given that the Greens political party has backed the Infrastructure Australia model, we are again surprised by a motion that seeks to supplant expert opinion. Labor supports the modal solution that gives the community the best value and supports these funds being spent in Victoria.

That the Senate take note of the document.


The Australian Human Rights Commission report No. 80 on an inquiry into the complaint of KA, KB, KC and KD v the Commonwealth of Australia is an extremely important report. It relates to four Aboriginal men who have a cognitive impairment and who have been held in indeterminate custody. This issue is extremely important. We saw recently the very sad case of Roseanne Fulton, who had a cognitive impairment and had been held in detention in Western Australia for a significant period of time before she was transferred to the Northern Territory. We have just seen on the news how that is still resulting in interactions with the law, and there is insufficient accommodation.


This report does not relate to Roseanne; it relates to four men who have now complained to the Australian Human Rights Commission. I should note that at the time this report was tabled there was also a report tabled by the Attorney-General for Australia, Senator George Brandis, who, unfortunately, in tabling that report, is basically washing his hands of this matter, saying that it is not a Commonwealth responsibility. Those are not the thoughts of the Human Rights Commission, who go through very detailed consideration of the circumstances of these men and find that, as a result of this inquiry:


… there has been a failure by the Commonwealth to take measures to work with the Northern Territory to provide accommodation and other support services, other than accommodation in a maximum security prison, for people with intellectual disabilities who are unfit to plead to criminal charges. 


In other words, people who have a cognitive impairment and are not fit to plead should not be held in prison, because they have not been found guilty of any crime. This report is saying that the Commonwealth has failed to take measures to work with the Northern Territory to ensure that accommodation is provided. The report makes some recommendations around the individuals in terms of what the Commonwealth and the Territory should be doing. The report states that the Commonwealth should:


… provide a copy of the Commission’s findings to the Northern Territory and seek assurances from the Northern Territory that it will take immediate steps to identify alternative accommodation arrangements for each of the complainants so that Mr KA and Mr KD are no longer detained in a prison and Mr KB and Mr KC are progressively moved out of held detention.


This is really clear that alternative accommodation needs to be found. It is outrageous that the Commonwealth government is washing its hands of any responsibility. This has been the Commonwealth's response every time we have asked it to start paying attention to and working on the issues around Australia, because this is not just occurring in the Northern Territory; it is occurring in all states. People with cognitive impairments who have interactions with the justice system are put in prison indeterminately. That is simply not acceptable. It is quite plainly breaching our international obligations under a number of conventions, including the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.


The Commonwealth government simply cannot wash its hands of this issue. The people of Australia expect the Commonwealth to take responsibility for all its citizens and not brush this off by saying that it is the responsibility of the Northern Territory. It is about time that the Commonwealth took responsibility for this issue and worked not just with the Northern Territory—although that is obviously the most immediate issue that needs to be dealt with, so that these four Aboriginal men are no longer held in detention—but also with the other states to ensure that there is other accommodation available for people who have a cognitive impairment so that they are not held in detention for an indeterminate period. There is a case in Western Australia, for example, where people have been held in detention for over 10 years without charge. That is simply not good enough. It is a clear breach of our international obligations.


This report needs to be reconsidered by the government. They need to very quickly take on board these issues. It is unacceptable that they wash their hands of this, that this is the way they treat very well thought through reports on these four gentlemen. They need to reconsider this report and ensure they take action so that people are no longer held in detention for indeterminate periods of time simply because they have a cognitive impairment and are unfit to plead. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

 (South Australia—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:16):  On behalf of Senator Collins, I present the 159th report of the Standing Committee of Privileges, entitled Persons referred to in the Senate: Mr Alan Manly and Ms Jennifer McCarthy, Group Colleges Australia. I move:


That the report be adopted.




Senator McEWEN:
  This report is the 70th in a series of reports recommending that a right of reply be afforded to persons who claim to have been adversely affected by being referred to in the Senate either by name or in such a way as to be readily identified.


On 14 November 2014, the President received a submission from Mr Alan Manly and Ms Jennifer McCarthy relating to a speech made by Senator Lee Rhiannon during the adjournment debate in the Senate on 2 September 2014. The President referred the submission to the committee under privilege resolution 5. The committee considered the submission at its meeting today and recommends that the proposed response be incorporated in Hansard.


The committee reminds the Senate that, in matters of this nature, it does not judge the truth or otherwise of statements made by honourable senators or the persons referred to; rather, it ensures that these persons' submissions and, ultimately, the responses it recommends accord with the criteria set out in privilege resolution 5. I commend the motion to the Senate.


Question agreed to. 




The document read as follows—





Appendix 1





Mr Alan Manly and Ms Jennifer McCarthyGroup Colleges Australia





Pursuant to Resolution 5(7)(b) of the Senate of 25 February 1988





Reply to speech by Senator Lee Rhiannon





(2 September 2014)



Pursuant to Senate Privilege Resolution 5 of 25 February 1988, we request that you refer this statement to the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges and that it be published in the Parliamentary record as a response to the statement of Senator Rhiannon on 2 September 2014 (Hansard pp.92-96).


I am Alan Manly, and my wife is Jennifer McCarthy, referred to by Senator Rhiannon. I am the Managing Director of Group Colleges Australia and my wife is the General Manager.


Concerning Senator Rhiannon's statement, we make the following observations.


Observation 1: ""Group Colleges Australia donated over $90,000 to the New South Wales Liberals between 2003 and 2011. In the year 2010-2011, GCA donated $53,249 to the New South Wales Liberals , far more than any other education provider.""


All donations made on behalf of Group Colleges have been properly declared, either to the Australian Electoral Commission or the Electoral Funding Authority. There is nothing improper in the donations made in the 2010-2011 time period, or indeed in any time period. We refute the inference that Ms McCarthy and I, or that GCA, has paid money in exchange for government reforms to the private education sector.


Observation 2: ""The husband and wife team of Group Colleges Australia, managing director Alan Manly and general manager Jennifer McCarthy, have also made individual donations totaling $11 ,588 to the Liberal Par ty. Donations from Group Colleges Australia to the New South Wales Liberal Party dried up in 2012 when then Premier Barr y O'Farrell introduced the new Jaws banning corporate donations.""


Ms McCarthy and I are strong supporters of the Liberal Party. All of our donations to any political party have been properly declared to the relevant authorities. We have nothing to hide. Any suggestion to the contrary is scurrilous.


Observation 3: ""…  Ms McCarthy , who previously had never donated to the New South Wales Liberals but whose corporate credit card was used to make donations on behalf of Group Colleges Australia, made her first donation of $3 ,500 in April 2012 , two months after the legislation prohibiting businesses such as Group Colleges Australia from donating was passed.""


The point appears to be that that Ms McCarthy, by making political donations as an individual and in accordance with the law, has somehow done something wrong or illegal or at best, deceitful. The assertion simply does not make sense, however it is still extremely damaging to Ms McCarthy's reputation. We reject it and any suggestion that we have bribed the Liberal Party in return for reforms to the sector in which our business operates is entirely false.


Observation 4: Allegations concerning Paul Nicolaou


The Senator's statement imputes that we are corrupt because Paul Nicolaou, an allegedly corrupt Liberal Party figure, was a board member of Group Colleges Australia (GCA), and by reason of this association we should also be suspected of being corrupt.


This is a baseless attempt to smear both Ms McCarthy and me merely because of our association with Paul Nicolaou, and it is without any proper foundation.


These statements have caused us immeasurable distress and are entirely false. We have always complied with our legal obligations in respect of any and every political donation we have made. We are not corrupt.


Observation 5: The letter to ICAC


The Senator has been told by ICAC that the Commission has declined to investigate the matters raised in her letter. We fail to understand why the allegations contained in that letter have been reiterated in Parliament after ICAC has declined to take action.


Observation 6: ""I think an investigation is warranted into why donations by Group Colleges and its owner are missing from Liberal Party returns.""


And


""There are discrepancies in the disclosure from the NSW Liberal Part y and GCA. I believe these matters warrant investigation by JCAC.""


Assuming that there are, as is alleged in the Senator's letter, discrepancies between amounts declared by the Liberal Party and amounts declared by Ms McCarthy and me, any failure to disclose amounts by the Liberal Party can have no bearing on the propriety of our conduct or our integrity. That is a matter for the Liberal Party and the relevant authority. We have at all times complied with our disclosure obligations.


We reject all of the allegations in the letter.


We note again that ICAC has refused to pursue these baseless accusations.


Observation 7: ""Liberal Party disclosures show donations that may not have been declared by the company""


Senator Rhiannon has absolutely no basis for making this assertion, and we wholeheartedly deny and reject the allegation.


Observation 8: The allegation that Mr Manly ""stacked the Warringah branch for Abbott's 1994 preselection.""


The email read out by the Senator in Parliament came from a former staff member at GCA. The relevant staff member's first day was 12 June 2003. I was not, in fact, introduced to Tony Abbott until 2011. The allegation that I was responsible for stacking the Warringah branch to secure Mr Abbott's preselection in 1994 is deeply offensive to me, is false and cannot be supported.


We understand that the staff member has since written to Senator Rhiannon to correct the inaccuracies in the email. That correspondence to Senator Rhiannon includes the following statement:


""My email to you was personal and I consider confidential. Shortly afterward I spoke to you and explained that my employment at Group Colleges Australia was a long time ago and that I could not be certain of my memory recall. I asked that the matter not be taken any further… 


As far as I am concerned Alan Manly is a good businessman who has helped in the education of thousands who would otherwise have been denied an opportunity.


Alan Manly and Group Colleges Australia were very good to me and I refute any aspersions cast on their dealings.""


Observation 9: ""There is nothing on Group Colleges website to warn prospective students that UBSS has only been given conditional approval…  Only a rare few would know to look at TEQSA's national register, where they will discover that GCA was unable to meet the basic threshold standards for corporate governance, which are set out in detail under the Higher Education Threshold Standards. GCA's inability to satisfy TEQSA raises questions about its original NSW accreditation, and why, in the light of its inability to demonstrate basic board accountability, TEQSA has allowed GCA to keep offering its courses.""


This is false. In fact, there is a link to the TEQSA National Register on the GCA website which sets out the conditions underpinning the approval.


In our roles as Managing Director and General Manager of GCA we are ensuring that all of the conditions imposed by TEQSA are being adhered to.


Observation 10: ""There are many concerning aspects to this (low of private money to the Liberal Party. Was the law broken? Was the money given to buy access and influence? Did people collude to bypass the stricter donation laws in NSW? These questions should be answered.""


Ms McCarthy and I have not broken the law.


We did not give money to buy access and influence.


We did not collude to bypass donation laws.


The Senator's statements are deeply offensive and have damaged our standing in the community. They are false and we wish for the Australian community to understand that this is nothing more than a baseless attack upon our characters and reputations.


Observation 11: ""Group Colleges is not the only one to foster links with the Liberal Party that were not transparent.""


We have at all times been completely transparent about our links to the Liberal Party and our donations to that Party. Yes, in 2013 I accompanied New South Wales MP Geoff Lee on a trip to India. That is a matter of public record.


We reject the suggestion that our conduct has been opaque and somehow dishonest. It has, in fact, been entirely 'above board'.


There is no basis for Senator Rhiannon to conclude that our conduct has not been transparent.


Observation 12: ""In fact, Group Colleges is a mixed business which has also invested in a travel agency recently relaunched by Prime Minister Tony Abbott's sister, Liberal Sydney City Councillor Christine Forster.""


Ms Forster is a local councillor for Redfern, where the travel agency is located. There is no impropriety whatsoever in her having attended and been involved in the launch of the business.


Observation 13: ""There is more to Group Colleges operations in Sydney. Its registered off ice is based in the centre of Sydney at MyQual""


GCA has never been ""based in the centre of Sydney"" and a cursory examination of the ASIC extracts for GCA and MyQual by Senator Rhiannon would have revealed this.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2014-12-02,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:40):  As I indicated just prior to question time today, I cannot in good conscience support the Higher Education and Research Reform Amendment Bill 2014. I think it is important to, firstly, correct what I said earlier where I had indicated in my second reading contribution that full fee-paying places for international students were also introduced. In fact, it is for domestic students as well which will allow universities to enrol students beyond the government mandated caps. That was in the context of a number of higher education reforms. There has been a significant impact on access for students, in terms of opening up the sector, that was introduced by the Gillard government, which uncapped university places and opened up the sector to greater numbers of students. This has had a significant impact on access for students, particularly those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds—which is important and essential. The Rudd-Gillard governments, however, did not introduce higher rates of funding per student and, as I mentioned earlier, cut significant amounts from the higher education budget. I think it is also important to put in context the implications of a number of these changes that are being proposed. 


A good commentator to go to, whether you agree or disagree with him, is the economics editor for The Sydney Morning Herald, Ross Gittins, who has made some interesting points that I think are both thought provoking and thoughtful in their contribution. Shortly after the changes were announced, Mr Gittins, in an opinion piece in both The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald—so the Fairfax Press—made the point:


The more economics you know, the less certain you can be about how things will turn out.


How true that is. And he talked broadly about the issue of deregulation and how the government was planning to:


… cut its contribution towards the cost of courses by an amount that averages 20 per cent.


Then he noted that the government was planning to:


… reduce the annual indexation of its contribution, switching to the consumer price index which does not rise as fast as unis, wages and other costs. 


Mr Gittins made the point that there appears to be:


… excessive faith in the ability of market competition to foster increased efficiency, constrain price increases and ensure customers get high quality.


In terms of the higher education sector, we are not talking about an ordinary product; we are talking about a sector where it is anything like a market. The point Mr Gittins made, and I agree with him, is that universities, its so-called 'firms':


… are owned by the state governments and highly regulated by the federal government. 


And there is:


… a string attached: fees charged to local students may not exceed those charged to overseas students.


…      …   …


In effect, universities have a government-regulated monopoly over a product that gives young people access to the country's highly paid jobs. 


I think it is fair to say—I agree with Mr Gittins—that:


Demand seems highly ""price inelastic"" - unresponsive to price changes.


It is interesting to note this comment made by Mr Gittins: 


In the early noughties, the Howard government allowed unis to raise their fees by 25 per cent. One small uni decided not to do so. It found its applications from new students actually fell. So the following year it put its fees up like all the others and its applications recovered.


So it seems that sometimes price is taken to be an indication of quality, when that is not necessarily the case.


It is also worth pointing out that, although the overall spending on universities as a percentage of GDP in Australia is about average amongst the OECD economies, the proportion paid by government was the third lowest by 2004. That is a real issue that we need to consider. There is also the issue of a moral hazard if we have a deregulated system. In circumstances where there are more and more students, having this link between HECS and deregulation is a double whammy for this sector. Perhaps it is overly ambitious on the part of the government. What happens in circumstances where the university has more students and more students are incurring a greater debt? There is a moral hazard because, if that debt is not paid, then it is the taxpayers who have to pick up the bill. I wonder what modelling has been done to determine whether there will be an increase in those unpaid or bad debts. It has been a much bigger issue in the United Kingdom, but I suspect that is due to the fact that there are many students from the European Union who go to universities and then go back to their home country and do not have to pay for the education that they got at a tertiary institution in the United Kingdom. 


So there is an issue in terms of safeguards for students, but there is also that fundamental issue that the government said that they would have 'masterly inactivity'. That was the term used by the Prime Minister, as opposition leader, early last year when he spoke to the Universities Australia Higher Education Conference here in Canberra.


I agree with Mr Gittins when he says, 'There ain't a lot of precedent for this radical experiment.' And this is a very significant and radical experiment. The challenge is that we want as many people as possible to be able to access the form of higher education that suits them. Under the current, uncapped system, many more people can attend university, but that means a higher cost to the government, so do we cap the number of places and restrict the number of people who go to university but have it at a lower cost for them, or do we make sure as many people as possible can attend but find another way to fund it? It is vitally important for both students and universities that we get this right. 


My hope—and I think it is a forlorn hope in terms of what we have seen both in the previous parliament and this parliament—is to have a bipartisan consensus on whatever scheme is decided on, because that is the best way to give certainty to the higher education sector. That way you get, ultimately, certainty. That is why I think it is important for the debate to include all the options. I see that Senator Kim Carr, the opposition's higher education spokesperson, the shadow minister, is in the chamber. There is an important role for the opposition to come up with alternatives, given the pressure on the system. 


It is also important to remember the importance of private providers in higher education. They can offer more targeted and flexible services for students, and they fill a valuable niche. They need to be a vital part of whatever scheme goes ahead in the short or longer term. I want to acknowledge Tabor college in Adelaide. Reverend Don Owers is a man I have enormous respect for. His proper title is principal of that college, which has a very good reputation, not just as a teaching college—offering theological courses and the like. I have enormous regard for him. I know that Reverend Owers has been very keen for these reforms to go through, but in good conscience I cannot support them.


It is also important to note what happened with VET, vocational education and training, in Victoria, where the system was rorted. I am not suggesting there would be the same potential for that to occur here, but we need to learn the lessons of what occurred in Victoria with vocational education, where there have been extraordinary shifts in that market. Maybe Senator Carr can correct me if I am wrong on this, but I think that one or two providers in the last couple of years have managed to snatch 20 per cent of the market, with all sorts of inducements and incentives. I have concerns about the quality involved with that. It is important that we learn from those mistakes. I am not equating the two sectors, but I am saying that it is important to learn from that.


The point that commentators, including Ross Gittins, have made is that university administrations are not necessarily as lean as they can be, but it is unsure whether this system will impose the necessary discipline upon them. What is proposed is that they can have uncapped fees, deregulated fees, and, if students do not pay them back, then the taxpayer picks up the tab. I do not think that is necessarily the best way to impose a discipline to keep fees down.


I note that several amendments have been circulated or proposed, and I understand there may be more to come. My colleague and friend Senator John Madigan has put up a number of proposals and suggestions. I am not sure if they have been circulated yet as amendments. I know that Senator Madigan has done this in absolute good faith, to get a better outcome. The implications of some of those amendments need to be looked at in a constructive way, because I think that what Senator Madigan has attempted to do is quite worthy. It is vitally important that we take the time to consider these amendments in more depth so that we can be sure that they achieve their aims. It is also important that we look at alternative methods of funding and look at issues of equity. Economists such as Ross Gittins make the point that there could be all sorts of unintended economic consequences in what is being proposed. We need to be very wary of that.


Tertiary education is not an ordinary product. It cannot be expected to conform to the usual market structures. For many people, participating in higher education is both an emotional and a financial decision. People may choose to attend a university because of its reputation, its convenience, its course selection, even its campus life or a combination of all of those things. We cannot expect people to undertake higher education based solely on financial reasons.


Without the appropriate safeguards in place, the market may become skewed and some providers may start to take advantage, unfairly, of students. For example, in higher education, prestige can add significant value; for many, a higher price signals greater prestige. This could clearly be open to abuse by providers, who would raise their prices simply to seem more prestigious or to signal a higher intrinsic value. I think it is also worth considering what Lord Browne did in his— (Time expired)

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (16:53):  The incorporated speech read as follows—




Introduction 



Labor is a party that has always stood up for education and realised the value of quality tuition. It is a party that believes that education should be accessible to all Australians, irrespective of background. No student should ever have to think twice about seeking a good education. Tony Abbott's plan for $100,000 degrees will do just that. This Bill will cripple Australia's future if some of our best and brightest cannot attend university due to higher fees and higher interest rates on their loans.


In another broken promise, the Government wants to cut $3.9 billion from a sector that simply cannot afford it. Before the election, Tony Abbott and Christopher Pyne promised no cuts to education, no increase to university fees, and no changes to the higher education system. The Australian people did not vote for a Government that would create a society of 'haves' and 'have nots'. Despite what Tony Abbott touts, there is no evidence that deregulated university education reduces costs to students and their families. We cannot allow this Government to place such a burden on our students, with a plan that fails both the fairness test and the national interest test.


Labor will stand up for those that will be hardest hit by the changes sought to be introduced by this Bill, including women, students from low-income backgrounds, and students from regional Australia.


No student deserves to be hit with Tony Abbott's debt sentence.




Bill in detail



The Coalition is seeking to introduce the most radical changes to the higher education system in 30 years. This Bill will cut subsidies for undergraduate study, deregulate tuition fees charged to undergraduate students, change the Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) system, and introduce fees for postgraduate research students.


Among the cuts to higher education and research is a 20 per cent cut to Commonwealth Grant Scheme funding for course delivery; a one-off efficiency dividend of 3.25 per cent on Australian Research Council grants; and a reduction in funding of the Research Training Scheme, which supports higher degree research students. In order to cover these funding cuts, universities will be forced to increase their fees by as much as 60 per cent for some degrees. The cuts to the Commonwealth Grant Scheme funding are arbitrary with increases in subsidy for some courses while others have been savagely cut. Changes to indexation arrangements for Commonwealth grant funding are also designed to reduce government funding of higher education over the long term.


Unrestrained student fees will result in the highest increase to university education costs this country has seen in a long time. In an unregulated market, universities will raise their fees far higher than what is required to offset reduced government funding. Students will foot the bill for universities increasing their research quotas just so that they can remain ahead of the race on world rankings. We only need to compare the current cost of private university degrees to public university degrees to see the difference this Bill will make. Higher fees will certainly deter entry to higher education by those from disadvantaged backgrounds. One look at the United States tells us that university competition leads to increased costs with no improvement in student outcomes. Not to mention what increased competition is going to do to our universities serving rural areas and students from low socio-economic backgrounds. $100,000 degrees are a very real prospect under this Bill.


To add to the Government's agenda of increased costs and cuts, they are seeking to change the HELP indexation rate from CPI to the Treasury 10 year bond rate. This change alone will cost students thousands of dollars extra in interest on their loans after 2016. This measure will have a regressive impact on lower income earners who would pay considerably higher interest payments than high income earners. Massive amounts of compounding interest will be shunted onto students, taking years to pay off. The Government clearly doesn't care about the impact that this will have on students who have completed their degrees. They will be forced to make life choices based on the enormous debt they have accumulated, just from attending university. Those seeking a university education will be faced with a tough choice, potentially the difference between a $25,000 debt and a $100,000 debt. To make matters worse, the Government is seeking to establish a new minimum repayment threshold for HELP debts of two per cent when a person's income reaches $50,638. 65,000 Australians will be affected by this measure.


It is not only undergraduate students hit with the harsh cuts proposed by this Bill. The Government plans to cut $173 million from the research training scheme which pays for the teaching of our PhD and Masters' research students. Universities may charge students up to $3,900 a year under HELP to cover these cuts. New PhD fees will force the next generation of innovators in our country to think about whether a PhD is really worth the cost.




Queensland education cuts



Don't be mistaken, cuts of the nature proposed by the Government are not confined to universities and federal funding. Under the LNP government in Queensland, we have seen widespread cuts to vital education providers including TAFE and public schools. The TAFE system has possibly suffered the most, with the closure of the Ithaca TAFE campus and further proposed closures of Mt Gravatt, Grovely, Alexandra Hills and Bracken Ridge campuses; this is just in the Brisbane metropolitan area alone. These closures have come as a result of Queensland Government funding cuts to many TAFE courses. Due to drastically increased financial outlays required of students, there has been a significant decrease in the numbers of students attending courses. The cost of some courses has been increased by many thousands of dollars. This is a cost that our students just cannot afford. Courses which provide vital education, skills and training to students to place them in a better position to find jobs and enter the workforce are no longer accessible and affordable to all. The erosion of TAFE funding removes the high quality, low cost, accessible education and training that Queenslanders deserve. For many students, TAFE provides a pathway into university education for students.


Now-Premier Campbell Newman made a pre-election promise that there would be no asset sales in Queensland. A contributor to the TAFE cost hike is the establishment of the Queensland Training


Assets Management Authority by the Newman Government on 1 July this year. The QTAMA now owns all of TAFE Queensland's buildings, facilities, infrastructure and assets. TAFE now has to lease back buildings and assets previously owned by Queensland taxpayers. This measure has placed TAFE in direct competition with other registered training organisations.


In 2013 the LNP Government announced six school closures including Charlton State School, Fortitude Valley State School, Nyanda State High School, Old Yarranlea State School, Stuart State School, and Toowoomba South State School, all of which have now closed. The most concerning of these closures is Nyanda State High School. In an attack of the public education system, the site of this school was sold to the privately funded Brisbane Christian College. This is a resounding example of the Queensland LNP Government privileging a select few who can afford private education. The sale of Nyanda State High School has meant that facilities funded by the public purse will now only be enjoyed by students of parents that can afford to send their children to a private school. All of the school closures involved very little public consultation. The Queensland Government failed to engage all of the relevant stakeholders and brought forward submission deadlines in order to push through their damaging plans.


In early 2014, the Newman Government closed the Barrett Adolescent Centre in Queensland; a facility that provided both education and health care services to adolescents with severe and complex mental health problems. The closure of this facility has attracted much attention following the death of three patients following the closure. A report by Queensland Health's Expert Clinical Reference Group stated that the government knew the risks when it decided to close BAC. The report also expressed concern at the loss of skilled clinical and education staff. Education is a core part of the intervention required for young people who require the level of care that was provided by BAC.


In turning back to the Bill before this chamber, it is clear that Tony Abbott is taking a leaf from the book of Campbell Newman in trying to fool the public into thinking that his Government's reforms will result in opportunity. Tony Abbott and Christopher Pyne are trying to force education providers with 500 or more equivalent full time Commonwealth Supported Students to establish a new Commonwealth Scholarship Scheme to support disadvantaged students. Providers will be required to direct 20 per cent of additional revenue that they receive from the deregulation of student contributions to the scheme. Labor and the Australian public will not be fooled. To call this arrangement a 'scholarship' is a fraud. These funds will be provided on the back of a tax on students and will work to disadvantage regional universities that cannot compete with major universities who have the capacity to charge higher fees. This Government is spruiking shallow rhetoric that does not recognise the differences between metropolitan and regional higher education.




Conclusion



It is abundantly clear that both the Abbott Government and the Newman Government in Queensland do not care about the long term sustainability of our vital public education system. Under their policies, only the well-off will have the opportunity to pursue post-secondary education. The Government is asking students to pay for their scholarship programs and for research, things that the Government currently pays for. International experience of deregulation has shown us that it is the most disadvantaged get left behind. No student should be left with a crippling debt sentence. No student should be forced to make the choice between a mortgage and a university degree. This Bill represents far too great a risk for students, the community and public education institutions.


Labor will fight this plan and the plight of the LNP government in Queensland.

"Lazarus, Sen Glenn",PUP,2014-12-02,"



Senator LAZARUS
 (Queensland—Leader of the Palmer United Party in the Senate) (16:53):  I rise today to speak in relation to the Higher Education and Research Reform Amendment Bill 2014, which the Abbott government is desperately trying to ram through the Senate. Palmer United is opposed to the higher education reforms and will be voting against the bill in every possible way. We will be voting to stop the bill from moving from the second reading stage to the committee stage, as we feel it is a waste of taxpayers' time to allow the Senate to give any further oxygen to this bill by considering amendments which only seek to window dress what is, in reality, a revolting proposal. We will be voting down any amendments which are put forward and we will be voting down the final bill. We are opposed to higher education reforms for a number of reasons, and no amount of texting, chocolates and red roses from Christopher Pyne is going to change my mind or the mind of my fellow colleague Senator Dio Wang. It is our view that the Abbott government's higher education reforms are bad to the core.


I take my role as a senator for Queensland very seriously. I ensure that, when forming a position on matters, I take the time to meet with stakeholders across my great state to seek their feedback and get their advice, to ensure that my final position reflects the wishes and will of the people. I have taken the time to meet with universities across my home state of Queensland and I have also met with student union groups. In Queensland, our universities are located in cities and in rural and regional areas across the state. 


In meeting and speaking with universities in Queensland, the feedback that I have received is clear: universities do not want their funding cut and they certainly would not cope with the cuts the Abbott government is seeking to implement through these nasty reforms. Universities have advised me that the easiest way that they could make up for a cut in funding would be to increase the cost of course fees. Increasing the cost of degrees, along with other cost-cutting measures, would enable universities to make up for the shortfall in their budgets. Universities do not have money trees growing on their campuses. An increase in course fees means that Australians will pay substantially more for higher education in this country. This would only push university degrees out of reach for most Australians.


The other concerning issue which universities raised with me is that rural and regional universities will be impacted the most by these higher education reforms. Many rural and regional universities do not have the market power of CBD based and traditional bricks and mortar universities, and any forced increase to course fees would mean that their student numbers would fall. A fall in student numbers would mean that rural and regional universities would have to start cutting courses, which would reduce the range of academic offerings available to rural and regional based students. Students from rural and regional areas will suffer and be further disadvantaged compared to the students located in CBD areas. If student numbers fall in rural and regional areas, the universities will be forced to make cuts across campuses, cutting jobs and services, which will hurt local communities and businesses that supply services and products to these universities.


Regional and rural universities provide not only an important education facility for students but also an important social and economic hub for regional towns and centres. Rural and regional universities employ local people and contribute to local economies. In fact, many of these universities also undertake research in specialist areas. These areas include agribusiness, crop health, tropical health and medicine, fisheries and aquaculture, just to name a few. This research involves local businesses and industries. Funding cuts to universities will affect the capacity of universities to undertake research. Universities have advised me that they may have to scale back research. 


Universities have also told me that, if their funding is cut, not only will they have to put up the cost of course fees but they will need to look at cutting the quality of the courses. Good courses cost money to deliver. Good courses include practical elements, field trips, quality staff and best practices, tools and equipment. The quality of higher education will fall in Australia if funding is reduced. 


While Australia offers brilliant weather and excellent opportunities, it is still considered an expensive country to do business with. Australia cannot keep trying to compete with countries like China, Taiwan and Korea in the spheres of manufacturing; we cannot compete on wages and operating costs. As a nation, we need to be drawing on our capability to innovate, invent, create and lead. To nurture and develop our reputation and international standing as a nation of creativity and innovation, we need to invest in education; we need to invest in becoming a smart country.


The world is prepared to pay for breakthroughs and advancements in science, technology, medicine and health.   These things deliver real and tangible benefits which benefit the human race and the global economy. Australia could be driving these advancements, but we need educated people to do this. Cutting funding to education will only hurt our country and hurt our future as a nation. I will not allow Australia to become the dumb country. 


In talking with universities and student union groups, I cannot find any reason to support this bill. Two of my children have just finished degrees in business at the University of Queensland. They, like many students, have entered their working life with a HECS debt, which they will carry with them until it is paid off. It is a debt that they will need to constantly bear in mind as they consider their work options and life decisions. My youngest son has just finished year 12 and is waiting to hear which university course he has been accepted into. 


As a proud parent, I personally am concerned about the impact of the higher education reforms. Too often politicians make decisions without understanding their real impact on the people they represent. As a father, I do not want to see my children lumbered with an excessive higher education debt. I want to see my children flourish and to enjoy the gifts and benefits that higher education provides. I want my children to experience the opportunities that education offers. I do not want to see them so stressed by a HECS debt that they are weighed down by the worry and start to make bad decisions about their careers and future because they are driven by debt rather than by great opportunities. I want to see all Australian children flourish and enjoy access to quality education. I would like to mention a quote by Confucius which captures how Australia should be harnessing education:


If your plan is for one year, plant rice. If your plan is for 10 years, plant trees. If your plan is for 100 years, educate children.


I refuse to vote for anything that will discourage the young men and women of our country from aspiring to undertake higher education. The other issue which concerns me is that some universities have also said that, should the reforms get through and funding is cut, they will have to look at increasing the intake of international students who are able to pay more for higher education and, as a consequence, reduce the number of placements offered in courses to local Australian kids. So not only will the cost of courses go up but also the opportunities for Australians to attend university will be reduced because there will be fewer places available. 


As I have already outlined, the higher education reforms are just bad policy and the bill is bad to the core. What I cannot understand is why the Abbott government did not take the time to properly consult with the higher education sector before developing the higher education reforms. If the Abbott government had undertaken proper consultation we would not be here talking about this terrible bill. In my opinion, I do not think this is about the higher education sector or the long-term vision of this country; this bill is about nothing more than budget cuts.


 If the Abbott government wants to cut funding to the higher education sector, to increase the cost of education for everyday Australians and to create education debt problems for our children, they should take these reforms to the Australian people at the next election and see what the people of Australia think of their dumb ideas. Palmer United does not support the higher education reforms. We will be voting against this bill.

"Madigan, Sen John",Ind.,2014-12-02,"



Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (17:03):  I rise this afternoon to speak on the Higher Education and Research Reform Amendment Bill 2014. This is undoubtedly a controversial piece of legislation which has the capacity to completely reform the higher education landscape across Australia. Whether this reform of the landscape will be positive or negative, we will not know. Whether the legislation is what it should be, we will not know. The reason we will not know is that throughout the course of this debate some senators in this place could not rise above the politics. They have indicated that they will vote this bill down at the second reading, before we have even been able to discuss amendments. Let me make this crystal clear. In its current form, I do not support this legislation. If this were the final vote today, I would not be voting for it. But this is not the final vote; this is the second reading. I am simply voting in favour of procedure. 


This vote is not about whether the bill becomes law, but whether or not we are prepared to be constructive, rather than destructive. This place is meant to be a place of review and I, for one, want to be able to properly review this legislation. We do our constituents a disservice if we refuse to even attempt to fix a bill which aims to make our higher education system more sustainable. I am not arguing that this bill is perfect. I am not even arguing that this bill is repairable. I am simply arguing that we should at least try. 


While it may be politically expedient to vote this bill down before it has had a fair hearing, in my opinion that is not the responsible thing to do. I have had over 50 meetings with universities, students, unions, lobby groups, small- and medium-sized businesses and current and former academics on this bill. As a result of these meetings, I sincerely believe that reform is needed and that reform, especially for regional universities, is required. What I have been told by those who run our nation's universities is that the status quo is unsustainable. It would be irresponsible for me to ignore their advice. I believe we owe it to the tertiary education sector and, most importantly, to the students to at least try to make some reasonable reforms work. If, at the end of that process, we in this place are unable to do that, then so be it. But the important thing is that we will have tried. That is why I have decided to vote in favour of the second reading, even when my fellow crossbenchers have indicated that they will not.  That is their right to do so. That is democracy at work.

Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (17:07):  I rise to speak on the Higher Education and Research Reform Amendment Bill 2014 before the Senate. I want to take up some of the points made by one of the previous speakers who spoke in the context of not wanting—




Senator Kim Carr:
  You are going to load up the speakers now.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, am I entitled to speak?




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Seselja
):  Indeed you are. Order on my left.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  I want to pick up on a point made by one of the previous speakers in relation to indebtedness for young students who go ahead and pursue higher education. Of course there is a fundamental solution to that problem, and that is not to incur the debt in the first instance. This is true of almost everything in life. It has always amused me when reference is made to free health care and free education when, in effect, these are the two things that are by far and away the most expensive support and services that we give as a government to those of our nation. The case has been well made that people invest my money—a point that is lost on many—in acquiring their education. This is money which I have worked for and paid my part to the receipts of this nation, which has been lent to these students so that they can advance themselves in life. I have no problem with that. I understand the value of education, and I understand ensuring that we have arrangements in place that create educational opportunity for everybody. If the circumstances of a student require them to borrow some of my money and the money of other taxpayers to invest in their education, then that has my total support. But I am afraid I do not have much sympathy for the argument that an investment, which I loaned to somebody so that they can advance their circumstances in life, is a bad investment. I think that aspect of these changes is quite appropriate.


This package has an expanding and demand-driven Commonwealth funding system for students studying for higher education diplomas, advanced diplomas and associate degrees, costing some $370 million over three years. I hark back to my own era. I recall that when I graduated in a class of 36 students, only two went on to higher education. That opportunity was not there in my age. It was not an option for families who, in my case, could not afford the cost of higher education and the costs of living away from home that were associated with it in those days, before the expansion and regionalisation with universities. So for a government to continue to invest in the opportunities for these young men and women, I think it is a terrific thing. It is of great disappointment that we need to get caught up in this selfish attitude that somehow they have to pay off a debt that has given them one of the greatest gifts in life. The figures are out there. I do not necessarily have them in front of me, but the figures are out there that demonstrate that their earning capacity goes up threefold and fourfold. The investment may also prove to be one of the soundest investments that they make in their lifetime.


The reform package extends Commonwealth funding to all Australian higher education students in non-university higher education institutions studying bachelor courses—costing $449 million over three years. So there are combined investments heading toward a billion dollars in education and in expanding opportunities for education for the young people of our nation. Indeed, whilst not being an expert on the legislation, this extends to all applicants for higher education, be they young students graduating from school or those more mature students who endeavour to enjoy some of the benefits of tertiary development. 


Over 80,000 students each year will be provided additional support by 2018. This includes an estimated 48,000 students in diploma, advanced diploma and associate degree courses and 35,000 additional students undertaking bachelor courses. Now that is a number worth repeating: 35,000 additional students. That is 35,000 young Australians who might not otherwise have had the opportunity without some of the reforms that have been presented in this higher education reform package. The legislation provides for more opportunities for students from low socioeconomic backgrounds through new Commonwealth scholarships—broadening out the scholarship program with the greatest scholarship scheme in Australia's history. This, in effect, means free education for the brightest students from the most disadvantaged backgrounds.


Often our colleagues from across the hallway here hold themselves out to have some sort of mortgage over those in our communities who come from lower socioeconomic circumstances. I know some of these young people; I know their families; I know their circumstances. I have employed people who came from lower socioeconomic circumstances. I intend to support any form of legislation through this place that increases the prospects for those young men and women. Indeed, it extends to mature students in this space also—people who can better themselves in life. That is why I believe this piece of legislation is a very well-thought-through piece of legislation. 


I was disappointed to hear Senator Lazarus earlier say that there had not been sufficient consultation. That is somewhat in conflict with some of the social media comments that the senator made earlier today, criticising Mr Pyne, the minister responsible for this package in part, for endeavouring to make contact with him. 


I want to attach my remarks to those of Senator Madigan, a statesman. I say on the record, his words today were very measured; they are very applicable to these particular circumstances. This is as important a piece of legislation as many that have come before this chamber in recent months. Everyone is in agreement that there has been a deterioration in how the Senate is conducting itself. There are, I understand, conventions that have been long held in this place that have been abused in recent times—with the gagging of debate. There cannot be, from my point of view, a more important piece of legislation; it is equal to the legislation we have had to deal with with the nation's security. 


Again, it is worth emphasising the point that there will be an additional 35,000 students, many of them from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, whose opportunities will be dashed here today if this bill is not given the opportunity for proper debate. As Senator Madigan alluded to, we need to allow the time for the ideas to mature, and for everyone to listen to everyone else's contribution. My pay-scale is too low to understand whether Minister Pyne has a capacity to move and shift on some of these issues but I am sure that he continues to be open to discussions to resolve any of the difficulties that members of this Senate have. 


Another part of the bill is freeing universities to set their own fees and compete for students. There is a novel idea! All of us operate in market arrangements away from this place—or have done, for those of us who have had some experience in business. The provision of education is a business; and probably the most important business, up there with the provision of health services and security for our nation. What a novel idea that we might allow universities to set fees and create the environment where they pursue a particular market share! I promise you they will respond to demand. You cannot survive in a free market environment unless you respond to the demands and keep yourself price attractive. So this sort of competition will give that a lift. 


Competition will definitely enhance quality and make higher education providers more responsible to the needs of the students and the labour market. When universities and colleges compete, students are the winners. These additional 35,000 students and many tens of thousands of students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds will be the winners, because competition by its very nature drives institutions or businesses to the edge to make sure they provide the most attractive, the most competitive goods or services—in this case services—for the lowest possible price. That is how you achieve your market share. Then you have an absolute obligation to maintain the quality in the delivery of those services—if you are to retain your market share and grow your business. 


I agree with the statement that when universities and colleges compete, students are the winners. By extension, our communities are the winners; our economy is a winner; all of Australia wins; we all win. That is why I am happy—despite the protests of some previous speakers—to have my money lent to students on these most equitable terms, so that they can grow. 


I had a couple of hundred staff before I left my business to come here. I invested tens upon tens upon tens of thousands of dollars in my staff, for them to advance and develop their educational background, because I was rewarded in increased productivity. It is no different here. In my case, they paid me back through their productivity as employees. In this case, these students—most of whom I will never know—will pay me back as they contribute to the productivity of this nation, and we will all be rewarded as a result.


The argument about the loans is a moot argument and needs to be set aside. When you do that, you find that a little bit of the heat comes out of this debate and you can concentrate on the positive uplift that this particular reform package delivers right across our community, not discriminating at any level. 


Strengthening the Higher Education Loan Program sees taxpayers support all students' tuition fees upfront and ensures that students only repay their loans once they are earning a decent income, of over $50,000 per annum. Let's just think about that. Not one cent needs to be paid upfront by the students, and they do not have to make a repayment until they are earning $50,000-plus. Some might think that $50,000 is not a lot of money. Certainly, some of my colleagues in this place could be forgiven for thinking that $50,000 is not a lot of money. But, if you are a young person starting out, I promise you that $50,000 is absolutely head and shoulders above what my good wife and I earned when I was 18, 19, 20, 21 or 22, when I was starting to collect some copper coins to get a bottle of milk. That's how long ago it was. The milk was still in a bottle.



Senator Payne interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Correct. And I promise you there was no-one at my gate wanting to lend me money, not one red razoo, so that I could get ahead. I would have loved a bit of this stuff around the place going back 30-odd years ago.


The package also removes the FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP loan fees which are currently imposed on some students undertaking higher education and vocational education and training. I have listened to the contributions of a number of speakers and there was not one mention of that. You want to talk about money and you want to talk about those things that you think are an impost but not one single speaker raised it, and that is so typical of the contributions often made in this place against progressive government legislation. It is almost as if every night—certainly starting last September—people go to bed, they fit up this machine, it erases the past, it erases the 26 deficits in a row and it erases all the promises of surpluses that would have allowed governments more flexibility in the space of education, in the space of health, in the space of—




Senator Wong:
  No cuts to education, no cuts to health—

  Mr Acting Deputy President, could you deal with the interjecting. It really drives me nuts. It is not a practice I engage in.

(

):  Order on my left.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Thank you for that, Mr Acting Deputy President. It was very effective. The higher education reform package also secures Australia's place at the forefront of research. It makes us competitive—



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  with an investment of $150 million in 2015-16 for the national collaborative research infrastructure. Just think about that. What a wonderful boost that will be to allow that to progress and make its contribution to these reforms.


There will be $139.5 million to deliver 100 new four-year research positions per year under the Future Fellowships scheme. What a wonderful progressive measure that is under the reforms. There will be 100 of them—all brand spanking new, polished up four-year research positions. Only the good Lord would know what will come out of that sort of investment. Even if we only get a productivity yield of 25 per cent, imagine the impetus to it will give to our nation and, in doing that, to our economy. These students who were yesterday on $50,000 a year will be on $60,000 a year and their repayments will be free as a result of the investment in the first instance, which is often a test that we apply in business before for we make the commitment in the first place.


There will be $42 million to support new research in tropical disease, which will be of great interest to my colleagues and I from the great state of Queensland where tropical diseases sometimes affect us. We have had little inflictions during the Queensland inquiry recently, where obviously the pollen from the mango trees had got to colleagues while we were trying to examine the witnesses. So this $42 million to support new research in tropical disease will be well received and supported by the good folk of Queensland, who do their share—and someone else's—in supporting the receipts of this nation so that we have sufficient money to lend to these absolutely privileged young men and women, bright young men and women, my nephews and nieces and all my staff's children. What a wonderful opportunity this is. I am having difficulty getting through this without being—



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  There are so many important things to bring to the attention of those opposite because, clearly, by the contribution made from the other side, they were not aware of some of these things otherwise there is no way in the world they would resist this legislation, as we saw from some of the crossbench.


Finally, I will close on the centrepiece, which is a $24-million contribution to the Antarctic Gateway Partnership because, as you know, I believe that wife beaters should be sent to the Antarctic—I said so a fortnight ago—and this sort of investment will make that so much easier for our nation, so it really is a double benefit—we get rid of the wife-beaters and we also support the Antarctic Gateway Partnership.


It has been a great privilege with very short notice to allow me to make a contribution here today. I hope it has had some impact on colleagues.

This bill is of the utmost importance to our nation's future. It is a reform whose time has come. It is reform that has to happen. The government has listened to concerns about certain measures in the bill and has agreed to amendments.


The status quo in Australian higher education is untenable. Universities Australia and every peak body for higher education in this country are in complete agreement with this statement and support the reforms with amendments. Therefore, the parliament of Australia and this chamber now has a choice: should we as a nation continue with an outdated higher education system and let Australia's universities fall behind the rest of the world? Are we prepared to deny current and future generations of students the opportunity to obtain a world-class education? Or will we actually embrace the challenges of the 21st century and equip our higher education institutions to compete in a global, changing economy?


This bill provides an opportunity to achieve these necessary reforms now, and disadvantaged students will particularly benefit. They will benefit from the biggest Commonwealth scholarship scheme ever, which means that there will be more help than ever for disadvantaged students to go to university. They will benefit from the abolition of loan fees, which will benefit 130,000 students a year and which has merited barely passing reference in the comments of those opposing the bill from the other side. They will benefit from the uncapping of Commonwealth supported places for pathway diplomas and other diplomas that leads straight into jobs. These reforms ensure that every person from any background who has the ability and who wants to go to university can do so.


There has been a crescendo of support for these changes from the higher education community. This is what universities, TAFEs and private higher education colleges know is needed for the future of higher education and for the future of our country. Universities Australia, the Australian Technology Network of Universities, Innovative Research Universities, the Regional Universities Network, the Group of Eight, the Australian Council for Private Higher Education and Training, and the Council of Private Higher Education have all said that the parliament should pass this bill, although they do see the need for some amendments.


Universities Australia said:


The introduction into Parliament of the Federal Government's higher education legislation is a chance for all parliamentarians to seize the opportunity for making real, lasting changes that are needed in positioning our universities for the challenges of the future.


The Australian Technology Network of Universities said:


Deregulation is a threshold issue for the sector and its passage through the Senate is crucial to protect the international reputation for quality higher education, representing around $15 Billion in export earnings for Australia.


Last week the chair of the Regional Universities Network, Professor Peter Lee, said that it was time to end the uncertainty around the higher education reforms. He said:


A new approach to university funding is needed to maintain the quality education that students expect.


I would add: 'that students deserve'. With some changes, he said the bill 'will help regional students attend and succeed at regional universities and will increase the number of professionals working in regional Australia'—surely an objective of all of us. This unprecedented consensus of support from the higher education sector is as a result of truism as expressed by Professor Sandra Harding, the chair of Universities Australia. We should not underestimate the importance of the reforms, she said, adding, 'The status quo isn’t an option.'


This bill provides a basis to transform Australia's higher education system and allow it to be the best in the world. There are four key elements to the bill. Firstly, it will see a significant expansion in access to higher education. The bill removes the current limits on Commonwealth supported sub-bachelor places. Any Australian student who wishes to study a higher education diploma, an advanced diploma or an associate degree will be able to do so with Commonwealth support for the first time ever. These are qualifications that lead to jobs in fields like child care and aged care, and jobs for computer technicians. These jobs are in increasing demand with our changing economy and our ageing population. These qualifications also form pathways to university, which the Kemp-Norton review of the demand-driven funding system found are important in helping underprepared students to succeed at university and stay at university, and to reduce the dropout rate. The bill ends the discrimination against students who study at private universities and non-university higher education institutions by giving them access to Commonwealth support places. For tens of thousands of Australian students who participate in the higher education sector in those particular institutions, that discrimination will be removed by this legislation. These two measures alone will allow an additional 80,000 Australian students each year to receive Commonwealth subsidies by 2018. That will particularly benefit students from disadvantaged backgrounds, those from rural and regional communities and those who need that little bit of extra assistance to complete their studies.


The bill also creates the Commonwealth scholarship scheme. The Commonwealth scholarship scheme will provide what is likely to be the largest scholarship support in Australia's history for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. It will include students from rural and regional Australia as well, of course. These scholarships will assist students with the cost of tuition fees, but also with the cost of living, with textbooks, with materials—the core fundamentals of coming from a challenging background and being able to be a successful, productive and good student.


Secondly, the bill gives institutions flexibility in how they are able to set their fees. The government has been very clear that fee deregulation is critical to drive greater competition, drive innovation and drive quality, so that our universities are able to compete with the best in Europe and America and the fast developing universities in Asia. The minister has spoken on a number of occasions about the number of universities in China and other countries in Asia which are rapidly reaching the top of the world scorecards in university rankings. Australia is not currently in a position to keep up with the pace. Australian institutions will in turn be more creative and will improve the quality of their teaching and learning, and that will give students the quality of education that they need and that employers are demanding in the 21st century environment. This change is crucial to ensuring the quality and the sustainability of the higher education sector in Australia. As Belinda Robinson, Executive Director of Universities Australia has said:


It is simply not possible to maintain the standards that students expect or the international reputation that Australia's university system enjoys without full fee deregulation.


Importantly, this bill provides this flexibility without reducing access or affordability. Every Australian student will still continue to be able to defer their tuition fees through HECS so they do not have to pay a cent up-front or pay a cent back until they are earning more than $50,000 a year.


That brings me to the third element of the bill, which recognises the key role that HECS plays in our higher education system. HECS is critical to ensuring that no student is denied the benefit of a higher education. Our HECS system has been and will continue to be the envy of the world.


This government is acting to make reforms fairer by removing inequities in the treatment of students and institutions under the HECS. The bill removes 20 per cent loan fees for VET FEE-HELP and the 25 per cent loan fees for FEE-HELP. These loan fees are an unfair cost on those students who are currently not receiving a Commonwealth subsidy. Removing the loan fees makes the system fairer. This measure will simplify and improve the consistency of loan arrangements for students and institutions and will benefit over 130,000 Australian students a year.


Lastly, the government is committed to ensuring Australia has a strong, competitive research system. As part of the higher education reform package, the government will invest $11 billion over four years in research in Australian universities, including $139 million for the Future Fellowships scheme and $150 million in 2015-16 to continue the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy. The previous government left funding cliffs for both of these vital research programs.


I would not like anyone listening to or observing some of the commentary being made today to think that this is some development that the government thought up last week and thought it might put to the vote this week. This is a discussion which has been happening in reality over years but in the parliamentary sense and budgetary sense over months, since May of this year.


We have seen from particularly those opposite the most extraordinarily irresponsible scare campaign. Their claims that students will face $100,000 degrees and that that will mean that disadvantaged students will not be able to go to university are, quite frankly, deceptive, cruel and duplicitous. They are factually wrong, in fact. Going to university is now and will be based on whether a student has the ability to go to university, not the size of their bank balance.


Labor shadow Assistant Treasurer, Dr Andrew Leigh, gave the lie to the scare campaign on deregulated fees when he wrote: 'There is no reason to think that fee regulation will adversely affect poorer students.' In fact, as a result of these reforms, equity and access will be improved through the new Commonwealth scholarship scheme and the Higher Education Participation Program, the HEPP. All of the university groupings that I mentioned previously have made it clear that $100,000 degrees will not be the norm or even common. For instance, Vicki Thomson, the executive director of the Australian Technology Network, destroyed the scare campaign when she said:


… the university sector is not looking to introduce standard $100,000 degrees and deregulation won't deliver them.


It is shameful the fear such myths are creating in the community. As I have said previously, as a result of this package, many thousands of students will experience fee reductions.


It is the government's view that there will be very serious consequences if the bill does not pass the parliament. If the Higher Education and Research Reform Amendment Bill is not passed we as a country will be left behind. For our universities, the funding system will continue to operate like a straitjacket. There will be little scope or incentive for them to develop and market new and innovative courses to Australian students much less a capacity for them to shine internationally. Australian universities will be forced to continue to deal with the continuing instability and uncertainty of the current funding system.


If the Senate needs any further evidence of that, it need look no further than the $6.6 billion worth of cuts that Labor announced for 2011-12 to 2016-17. That is hardly the way to run the country's third biggest export industry. Let us not forget that what Labor did not cut they left unfunded. So, if the bill does not pass, the Future Fellowships scheme will cease and many of our best researchers will be forced to go elsewhere. The National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy will cease, putting 1,500 researchers into limbo. The loss of these two programs alone will do irreparable damage to our capacity to support high-quality research. For the higher education activities of our TAFEs and private colleges we will be closing the door in their faces.


If the bill is not passed, students will continue to be locked out of pathway qualifications which, as identified by Dr Kemp and Mr Norton in the review of the demand driven system, have a significant impact on the dropout rate of students with lower ATARs. If the bill is not passed, 80,000 Australian students a year will miss out on receiving Commonwealth support to study. If the bill is not passed, we are going to forgo the largest scholarship scheme for disadvantaged students that this country has ever seen.


The government has listened to the concerns of both the crossbenchers and the higher education sector. Just today we have announced a number of responses to those concerns. The government has said that it will accept Senator Day's amendment to keep the indexation rate for student debt at CPI rather than moving to the 10-year bond rate as previously indicated. We have also said that—and I note that he is not in the chamber—we will accept Senator Madigan's amendment for a HECS indexation pause for the primary care giver of newborn children. I particularly acknowledge Senator Madigan's very considered and working contribution to the second reading debate.


The government has also today circulated other amendments that provide for the creation of a structural adjustment fund for universities focused on those with large numbers of low-SES students—




Senator Kim Carr:
  $33 million—how paltry is that? $33 million—how pathetic is that?




Senator PAYNE:
  that ensures domestic student fees must be lower than international fees. In fact, the domestic student fee and the Commonwealth contribution combined must be less than the international student fee. The government has also circulated two technical amendments on grandfathering and the definition of 'additional revenue' for the purposes of the Commonwealth scholarships. I hear Senator Carr indicating that he finds one of those amendments 'paltry'. That would have to be from a comparison with living in a complete intellectual vacuum and, therefore, I completely understand his point, from his perspective!


We have also indicated that we will support the creation in the HEPP a scholarship component for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. We have guaranteed that Commonwealth scholarship guidelines will ensure that those scholarships are focused on low-SES and regional students, as so many senators have sought. We have indicated that the Treasurer will direct the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to monitor prices in the higher education sector, and we have guaranteed a suitable process of evaluation of the reforms over coming years. These amendments will guarantee for students huge benefits of freeing up the higher education system and of supporting all Australian undergraduates from diploma courses through to bachelor degrees—for the first time ever.


Now the Australian parliament has an opportunity to support some of the greatest higher education reforms of our time, and frankly, it is clear that there is no credible alternative. It is a vacuum on the other side. The opposition has not furnished one, either when it was in office or today. In fact, as Senator Carr has suggested in recent days, their solution appears to be recapping the higher education system and slamming the door in the faces of many thousands of disadvantaged students. As Mike Gallagher, one of the most experienced figures in higher education policy, has said:


The 2014 higher education budget reforms are necessary. They are logical, coherent, sustainable, equitable and inevitable. My guess is that the detractors of microeconomic reform in Australia's higher education industry will find themselves on the wrong side of history in resisting efficiency, improvement and innovation, as they will be in opposing the redistributive measures of the package and, curiously, supporting socially regressive subsidies from general taxpayers to more advantaged segments of the community.


This bill will allow our higher education to be the best in the world, with some of the great universities in the world. It will ensure that future generations of Australians can get a world-class education to support them in the jobs of the future. It will provide the backbone of our future economy. I do not understand why those opposite want to make students continue to pay interest fees of 20 and 25 per cent on VET fee-help and fee-help. I do not understand why they are turning their backs on those who choose to participate in higher education through TAFEs and through the private sector. I do not understand why those who purport to stand up for those who face some of the greatest challenges in life cannot see that we need to make these changes and that it will indeed be the backbone of our future economy. Because if we do not, we only go backwards. I urge senators to support the bill.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2014-12-02,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:40):  As I indicated just prior to question time today, I cannot in good conscience support the Higher Education and Research Reform Amendment Bill 2014. I think it is important to, firstly, correct what I said earlier where I had indicated in my second reading contribution that full fee-paying places for international students were also introduced. In fact, it is for domestic students as well which will allow universities to enrol students beyond the government mandated caps. That was in the context of a number of higher education reforms. There has been a significant impact on access for students, in terms of opening up the sector, that was introduced by the Gillard government, which uncapped university places and opened up the sector to greater numbers of students. This has had a significant impact on access for students, particularly those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds—which is important and essential. The Rudd-Gillard governments, however, did not introduce higher rates of funding per student and, as I mentioned earlier, cut significant amounts from the higher education budget. I think it is also important to put in context the implications of a number of these changes that are being proposed. 


A good commentator to go to, whether you agree or disagree with him, is the economics editor for The Sydney Morning Herald, Ross Gittins, who has made some interesting points that I think are both thought provoking and thoughtful in their contribution. Shortly after the changes were announced, Mr Gittins, in an opinion piece in both The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald—so the Fairfax Press—made the point:


The more economics you know, the less certain you can be about how things will turn out.


How true that is. And he talked broadly about the issue of deregulation and how the government was planning to:


… cut its contribution towards the cost of courses by an amount that averages 20 per cent.


Then he noted that the government was planning to:


… reduce the annual indexation of its contribution, switching to the consumer price index which does not rise as fast as unis, wages and other costs. 


Mr Gittins made the point that there appears to be:


… excessive faith in the ability of market competition to foster increased efficiency, constrain price increases and ensure customers get high quality.


In terms of the higher education sector, we are not talking about an ordinary product; we are talking about a sector where it is anything like a market. The point Mr Gittins made, and I agree with him, is that universities, its so-called 'firms':


… are owned by the state governments and highly regulated by the federal government. 


And there is:


… a string attached: fees charged to local students may not exceed those charged to overseas students.


…      …   …


In effect, universities have a government-regulated monopoly over a product that gives young people access to the country's highly paid jobs. 


I think it is fair to say—I agree with Mr Gittins—that:


Demand seems highly ""price inelastic"" - unresponsive to price changes.


It is interesting to note this comment made by Mr Gittins: 


In the early noughties, the Howard government allowed unis to raise their fees by 25 per cent. One small uni decided not to do so. It found its applications from new students actually fell. So the following year it put its fees up like all the others and its applications recovered.


So it seems that sometimes price is taken to be an indication of quality, when that is not necessarily the case.


It is also worth pointing out that, although the overall spending on universities as a percentage of GDP in Australia is about average amongst the OECD economies, the proportion paid by government was the third lowest by 2004. That is a real issue that we need to consider. There is also the issue of a moral hazard if we have a deregulated system. In circumstances where there are more and more students, having this link between HECS and deregulation is a double whammy for this sector. Perhaps it is overly ambitious on the part of the government. What happens in circumstances where the university has more students and more students are incurring a greater debt? There is a moral hazard because, if that debt is not paid, then it is the taxpayers who have to pick up the bill. I wonder what modelling has been done to determine whether there will be an increase in those unpaid or bad debts. It has been a much bigger issue in the United Kingdom, but I suspect that is due to the fact that there are many students from the European Union who go to universities and then go back to their home country and do not have to pay for the education that they got at a tertiary institution in the United Kingdom. 


So there is an issue in terms of safeguards for students, but there is also that fundamental issue that the government said that they would have 'masterly inactivity'. That was the term used by the Prime Minister, as opposition leader, early last year when he spoke to the Universities Australia Higher Education Conference here in Canberra.


I agree with Mr Gittins when he says, 'There ain't a lot of precedent for this radical experiment.' And this is a very significant and radical experiment. The challenge is that we want as many people as possible to be able to access the form of higher education that suits them. Under the current, uncapped system, many more people can attend university, but that means a higher cost to the government, so do we cap the number of places and restrict the number of people who go to university but have it at a lower cost for them, or do we make sure as many people as possible can attend but find another way to fund it? It is vitally important for both students and universities that we get this right. 


My hope—and I think it is a forlorn hope in terms of what we have seen both in the previous parliament and this parliament—is to have a bipartisan consensus on whatever scheme is decided on, because that is the best way to give certainty to the higher education sector. That way you get, ultimately, certainty. That is why I think it is important for the debate to include all the options. I see that Senator Kim Carr, the opposition's higher education spokesperson, the shadow minister, is in the chamber. There is an important role for the opposition to come up with alternatives, given the pressure on the system. 


It is also important to remember the importance of private providers in higher education. They can offer more targeted and flexible services for students, and they fill a valuable niche. They need to be a vital part of whatever scheme goes ahead in the short or longer term. I want to acknowledge Tabor college in Adelaide. Reverend Don Owers is a man I have enormous respect for. His proper title is principal of that college, which has a very good reputation, not just as a teaching college—offering theological courses and the like. I have enormous regard for him. I know that Reverend Owers has been very keen for these reforms to go through, but in good conscience I cannot support them.


It is also important to note what happened with VET, vocational education and training, in Victoria, where the system was rorted. I am not suggesting there would be the same potential for that to occur here, but we need to learn the lessons of what occurred in Victoria with vocational education, where there have been extraordinary shifts in that market. Maybe Senator Carr can correct me if I am wrong on this, but I think that one or two providers in the last couple of years have managed to snatch 20 per cent of the market, with all sorts of inducements and incentives. I have concerns about the quality involved with that. It is important that we learn from those mistakes. I am not equating the two sectors, but I am saying that it is important to learn from that.


The point that commentators, including Ross Gittins, have made is that university administrations are not necessarily as lean as they can be, but it is unsure whether this system will impose the necessary discipline upon them. What is proposed is that they can have uncapped fees, deregulated fees, and, if students do not pay them back, then the taxpayer picks up the tab. I do not think that is necessarily the best way to impose a discipline to keep fees down.


I note that several amendments have been circulated or proposed, and I understand there may be more to come. My colleague and friend Senator John Madigan has put up a number of proposals and suggestions. I am not sure if they have been circulated yet as amendments. I know that Senator Madigan has done this in absolute good faith, to get a better outcome. The implications of some of those amendments need to be looked at in a constructive way, because I think that what Senator Madigan has attempted to do is quite worthy. It is vitally important that we take the time to consider these amendments in more depth so that we can be sure that they achieve their aims. It is also important that we look at alternative methods of funding and look at issues of equity. Economists such as Ross Gittins make the point that there could be all sorts of unintended economic consequences in what is being proposed. We need to be very wary of that.


Tertiary education is not an ordinary product. It cannot be expected to conform to the usual market structures. For many people, participating in higher education is both an emotional and a financial decision. People may choose to attend a university because of its reputation, its convenience, its course selection, even its campus life or a combination of all of those things. We cannot expect people to undertake higher education based solely on financial reasons.


Without the appropriate safeguards in place, the market may become skewed and some providers may start to take advantage, unfairly, of students. For example, in higher education, prestige can add significant value; for many, a higher price signals greater prestige. This could clearly be open to abuse by providers, who would raise their prices simply to seem more prestigious or to signal a higher intrinsic value. I think it is also worth considering what Lord Browne did in his— (Time expired)

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (16:53):  The incorporated speech read as follows—




Introduction 



Labor is a party that has always stood up for education and realised the value of quality tuition. It is a party that believes that education should be accessible to all Australians, irrespective of background. No student should ever have to think twice about seeking a good education. Tony Abbott's plan for $100,000 degrees will do just that. This Bill will cripple Australia's future if some of our best and brightest cannot attend university due to higher fees and higher interest rates on their loans.


In another broken promise, the Government wants to cut $3.9 billion from a sector that simply cannot afford it. Before the election, Tony Abbott and Christopher Pyne promised no cuts to education, no increase to university fees, and no changes to the higher education system. The Australian people did not vote for a Government that would create a society of 'haves' and 'have nots'. Despite what Tony Abbott touts, there is no evidence that deregulated university education reduces costs to students and their families. We cannot allow this Government to place such a burden on our students, with a plan that fails both the fairness test and the national interest test.


Labor will stand up for those that will be hardest hit by the changes sought to be introduced by this Bill, including women, students from low-income backgrounds, and students from regional Australia.


No student deserves to be hit with Tony Abbott's debt sentence.




Bill in detail



The Coalition is seeking to introduce the most radical changes to the higher education system in 30 years. This Bill will cut subsidies for undergraduate study, deregulate tuition fees charged to undergraduate students, change the Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) system, and introduce fees for postgraduate research students.


Among the cuts to higher education and research is a 20 per cent cut to Commonwealth Grant Scheme funding for course delivery; a one-off efficiency dividend of 3.25 per cent on Australian Research Council grants; and a reduction in funding of the Research Training Scheme, which supports higher degree research students. In order to cover these funding cuts, universities will be forced to increase their fees by as much as 60 per cent for some degrees. The cuts to the Commonwealth Grant Scheme funding are arbitrary with increases in subsidy for some courses while others have been savagely cut. Changes to indexation arrangements for Commonwealth grant funding are also designed to reduce government funding of higher education over the long term.


Unrestrained student fees will result in the highest increase to university education costs this country has seen in a long time. In an unregulated market, universities will raise their fees far higher than what is required to offset reduced government funding. Students will foot the bill for universities increasing their research quotas just so that they can remain ahead of the race on world rankings. We only need to compare the current cost of private university degrees to public university degrees to see the difference this Bill will make. Higher fees will certainly deter entry to higher education by those from disadvantaged backgrounds. One look at the United States tells us that university competition leads to increased costs with no improvement in student outcomes. Not to mention what increased competition is going to do to our universities serving rural areas and students from low socio-economic backgrounds. $100,000 degrees are a very real prospect under this Bill.


To add to the Government's agenda of increased costs and cuts, they are seeking to change the HELP indexation rate from CPI to the Treasury 10 year bond rate. This change alone will cost students thousands of dollars extra in interest on their loans after 2016. This measure will have a regressive impact on lower income earners who would pay considerably higher interest payments than high income earners. Massive amounts of compounding interest will be shunted onto students, taking years to pay off. The Government clearly doesn't care about the impact that this will have on students who have completed their degrees. They will be forced to make life choices based on the enormous debt they have accumulated, just from attending university. Those seeking a university education will be faced with a tough choice, potentially the difference between a $25,000 debt and a $100,000 debt. To make matters worse, the Government is seeking to establish a new minimum repayment threshold for HELP debts of two per cent when a person's income reaches $50,638. 65,000 Australians will be affected by this measure.


It is not only undergraduate students hit with the harsh cuts proposed by this Bill. The Government plans to cut $173 million from the research training scheme which pays for the teaching of our PhD and Masters' research students. Universities may charge students up to $3,900 a year under HELP to cover these cuts. New PhD fees will force the next generation of innovators in our country to think about whether a PhD is really worth the cost.




Queensland education cuts



Don't be mistaken, cuts of the nature proposed by the Government are not confined to universities and federal funding. Under the LNP government in Queensland, we have seen widespread cuts to vital education providers including TAFE and public schools. The TAFE system has possibly suffered the most, with the closure of the Ithaca TAFE campus and further proposed closures of Mt Gravatt, Grovely, Alexandra Hills and Bracken Ridge campuses; this is just in the Brisbane metropolitan area alone. These closures have come as a result of Queensland Government funding cuts to many TAFE courses. Due to drastically increased financial outlays required of students, there has been a significant decrease in the numbers of students attending courses. The cost of some courses has been increased by many thousands of dollars. This is a cost that our students just cannot afford. Courses which provide vital education, skills and training to students to place them in a better position to find jobs and enter the workforce are no longer accessible and affordable to all. The erosion of TAFE funding removes the high quality, low cost, accessible education and training that Queenslanders deserve. For many students, TAFE provides a pathway into university education for students.


Now-Premier Campbell Newman made a pre-election promise that there would be no asset sales in Queensland. A contributor to the TAFE cost hike is the establishment of the Queensland Training


Assets Management Authority by the Newman Government on 1 July this year. The QTAMA now owns all of TAFE Queensland's buildings, facilities, infrastructure and assets. TAFE now has to lease back buildings and assets previously owned by Queensland taxpayers. This measure has placed TAFE in direct competition with other registered training organisations.


In 2013 the LNP Government announced six school closures including Charlton State School, Fortitude Valley State School, Nyanda State High School, Old Yarranlea State School, Stuart State School, and Toowoomba South State School, all of which have now closed. The most concerning of these closures is Nyanda State High School. In an attack of the public education system, the site of this school was sold to the privately funded Brisbane Christian College. This is a resounding example of the Queensland LNP Government privileging a select few who can afford private education. The sale of Nyanda State High School has meant that facilities funded by the public purse will now only be enjoyed by students of parents that can afford to send their children to a private school. All of the school closures involved very little public consultation. The Queensland Government failed to engage all of the relevant stakeholders and brought forward submission deadlines in order to push through their damaging plans.


In early 2014, the Newman Government closed the Barrett Adolescent Centre in Queensland; a facility that provided both education and health care services to adolescents with severe and complex mental health problems. The closure of this facility has attracted much attention following the death of three patients following the closure. A report by Queensland Health's Expert Clinical Reference Group stated that the government knew the risks when it decided to close BAC. The report also expressed concern at the loss of skilled clinical and education staff. Education is a core part of the intervention required for young people who require the level of care that was provided by BAC.


In turning back to the Bill before this chamber, it is clear that Tony Abbott is taking a leaf from the book of Campbell Newman in trying to fool the public into thinking that his Government's reforms will result in opportunity. Tony Abbott and Christopher Pyne are trying to force education providers with 500 or more equivalent full time Commonwealth Supported Students to establish a new Commonwealth Scholarship Scheme to support disadvantaged students. Providers will be required to direct 20 per cent of additional revenue that they receive from the deregulation of student contributions to the scheme. Labor and the Australian public will not be fooled. To call this arrangement a 'scholarship' is a fraud. These funds will be provided on the back of a tax on students and will work to disadvantage regional universities that cannot compete with major universities who have the capacity to charge higher fees. This Government is spruiking shallow rhetoric that does not recognise the differences between metropolitan and regional higher education.




Conclusion



It is abundantly clear that both the Abbott Government and the Newman Government in Queensland do not care about the long term sustainability of our vital public education system. Under their policies, only the well-off will have the opportunity to pursue post-secondary education. The Government is asking students to pay for their scholarship programs and for research, things that the Government currently pays for. International experience of deregulation has shown us that it is the most disadvantaged get left behind. No student should be left with a crippling debt sentence. No student should be forced to make the choice between a mortgage and a university degree. This Bill represents far too great a risk for students, the community and public education institutions.


Labor will fight this plan and the plight of the LNP government in Queensland.

 (Queensland—Leader of the Palmer United Party in the Senate) (16:53):  I rise today to speak in relation to the Higher Education and Research Reform Amendment Bill 2014, which the Abbott government is desperately trying to ram through the Senate. Palmer United is opposed to the higher education reforms and will be voting against the bill in every possible way. We will be voting to stop the bill from moving from the second reading stage to the committee stage, as we feel it is a waste of taxpayers' time to allow the Senate to give any further oxygen to this bill by considering amendments which only seek to window dress what is, in reality, a revolting proposal. We will be voting down any amendments which are put forward and we will be voting down the final bill. We are opposed to higher education reforms for a number of reasons, and no amount of texting, chocolates and red roses from Christopher Pyne is going to change my mind or the mind of my fellow colleague Senator Dio Wang. It is our view that the Abbott government's higher education reforms are bad to the core.


I take my role as a senator for Queensland very seriously. I ensure that, when forming a position on matters, I take the time to meet with stakeholders across my great state to seek their feedback and get their advice, to ensure that my final position reflects the wishes and will of the people. I have taken the time to meet with universities across my home state of Queensland and I have also met with student union groups. In Queensland, our universities are located in cities and in rural and regional areas across the state. 


In meeting and speaking with universities in Queensland, the feedback that I have received is clear: universities do not want their funding cut and they certainly would not cope with the cuts the Abbott government is seeking to implement through these nasty reforms. Universities have advised me that the easiest way that they could make up for a cut in funding would be to increase the cost of course fees. Increasing the cost of degrees, along with other cost-cutting measures, would enable universities to make up for the shortfall in their budgets. Universities do not have money trees growing on their campuses. An increase in course fees means that Australians will pay substantially more for higher education in this country. This would only push university degrees out of reach for most Australians.


The other concerning issue which universities raised with me is that rural and regional universities will be impacted the most by these higher education reforms. Many rural and regional universities do not have the market power of CBD based and traditional bricks and mortar universities, and any forced increase to course fees would mean that their student numbers would fall. A fall in student numbers would mean that rural and regional universities would have to start cutting courses, which would reduce the range of academic offerings available to rural and regional based students. Students from rural and regional areas will suffer and be further disadvantaged compared to the students located in CBD areas. If student numbers fall in rural and regional areas, the universities will be forced to make cuts across campuses, cutting jobs and services, which will hurt local communities and businesses that supply services and products to these universities.


Regional and rural universities provide not only an important education facility for students but also an important social and economic hub for regional towns and centres. Rural and regional universities employ local people and contribute to local economies. In fact, many of these universities also undertake research in specialist areas. These areas include agribusiness, crop health, tropical health and medicine, fisheries and aquaculture, just to name a few. This research involves local businesses and industries. Funding cuts to universities will affect the capacity of universities to undertake research. Universities have advised me that they may have to scale back research. 


Universities have also told me that, if their funding is cut, not only will they have to put up the cost of course fees but they will need to look at cutting the quality of the courses. Good courses cost money to deliver. Good courses include practical elements, field trips, quality staff and best practices, tools and equipment. The quality of higher education will fall in Australia if funding is reduced. 


While Australia offers brilliant weather and excellent opportunities, it is still considered an expensive country to do business with. Australia cannot keep trying to compete with countries like China, Taiwan and Korea in the spheres of manufacturing; we cannot compete on wages and operating costs. As a nation, we need to be drawing on our capability to innovate, invent, create and lead. To nurture and develop our reputation and international standing as a nation of creativity and innovation, we need to invest in education; we need to invest in becoming a smart country.


The world is prepared to pay for breakthroughs and advancements in science, technology, medicine and health.   These things deliver real and tangible benefits which benefit the human race and the global economy. Australia could be driving these advancements, but we need educated people to do this. Cutting funding to education will only hurt our country and hurt our future as a nation. I will not allow Australia to become the dumb country. 


In talking with universities and student union groups, I cannot find any reason to support this bill. Two of my children have just finished degrees in business at the University of Queensland. They, like many students, have entered their working life with a HECS debt, which they will carry with them until it is paid off. It is a debt that they will need to constantly bear in mind as they consider their work options and life decisions. My youngest son has just finished year 12 and is waiting to hear which university course he has been accepted into. 


As a proud parent, I personally am concerned about the impact of the higher education reforms. Too often politicians make decisions without understanding their real impact on the people they represent. As a father, I do not want to see my children lumbered with an excessive higher education debt. I want to see my children flourish and to enjoy the gifts and benefits that higher education provides. I want my children to experience the opportunities that education offers. I do not want to see them so stressed by a HECS debt that they are weighed down by the worry and start to make bad decisions about their careers and future because they are driven by debt rather than by great opportunities. I want to see all Australian children flourish and enjoy access to quality education. I would like to mention a quote by Confucius which captures how Australia should be harnessing education:


If your plan is for one year, plant rice. If your plan is for 10 years, plant trees. If your plan is for 100 years, educate children.


I refuse to vote for anything that will discourage the young men and women of our country from aspiring to undertake higher education. The other issue which concerns me is that some universities have also said that, should the reforms get through and funding is cut, they will have to look at increasing the intake of international students who are able to pay more for higher education and, as a consequence, reduce the number of placements offered in courses to local Australian kids. So not only will the cost of courses go up but also the opportunities for Australians to attend university will be reduced because there will be fewer places available. 


As I have already outlined, the higher education reforms are just bad policy and the bill is bad to the core. What I cannot understand is why the Abbott government did not take the time to properly consult with the higher education sector before developing the higher education reforms. If the Abbott government had undertaken proper consultation we would not be here talking about this terrible bill. In my opinion, I do not think this is about the higher education sector or the long-term vision of this country; this bill is about nothing more than budget cuts.


 If the Abbott government wants to cut funding to the higher education sector, to increase the cost of education for everyday Australians and to create education debt problems for our children, they should take these reforms to the Australian people at the next election and see what the people of Australia think of their dumb ideas. Palmer United does not support the higher education reforms. We will be voting against this bill.

Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (17:03):  I rise this afternoon to speak on the Higher Education and Research Reform Amendment Bill 2014. This is undoubtedly a controversial piece of legislation which has the capacity to completely reform the higher education landscape across Australia. Whether this reform of the landscape will be positive or negative, we will not know. Whether the legislation is what it should be, we will not know. The reason we will not know is that throughout the course of this debate some senators in this place could not rise above the politics. They have indicated that they will vote this bill down at the second reading, before we have even been able to discuss amendments. Let me make this crystal clear. In its current form, I do not support this legislation. If this were the final vote today, I would not be voting for it. But this is not the final vote; this is the second reading. I am simply voting in favour of procedure. 


This vote is not about whether the bill becomes law, but whether or not we are prepared to be constructive, rather than destructive. This place is meant to be a place of review and I, for one, want to be able to properly review this legislation. We do our constituents a disservice if we refuse to even attempt to fix a bill which aims to make our higher education system more sustainable. I am not arguing that this bill is perfect. I am not even arguing that this bill is repairable. I am simply arguing that we should at least try. 


While it may be politically expedient to vote this bill down before it has had a fair hearing, in my opinion that is not the responsible thing to do. I have had over 50 meetings with universities, students, unions, lobby groups, small- and medium-sized businesses and current and former academics on this bill. As a result of these meetings, I sincerely believe that reform is needed and that reform, especially for regional universities, is required. What I have been told by those who run our nation's universities is that the status quo is unsustainable. It would be irresponsible for me to ignore their advice. I believe we owe it to the tertiary education sector and, most importantly, to the students to at least try to make some reasonable reforms work. If, at the end of that process, we in this place are unable to do that, then so be it. But the important thing is that we will have tried. That is why I have decided to vote in favour of the second reading, even when my fellow crossbenchers have indicated that they will not.  That is their right to do so. That is democracy at work.

Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (17:07):  I rise to speak on the Higher Education and Research Reform Amendment Bill 2014 before the Senate. I want to take up some of the points made by one of the previous speakers who spoke in the context of not wanting—




Senator Kim Carr:
  You are going to load up the speakers now.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, am I entitled to speak?




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Seselja
):  Indeed you are. Order on my left.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  I want to pick up on a point made by one of the previous speakers in relation to indebtedness for young students who go ahead and pursue higher education. Of course there is a fundamental solution to that problem, and that is not to incur the debt in the first instance. This is true of almost everything in life. It has always amused me when reference is made to free health care and free education when, in effect, these are the two things that are by far and away the most expensive support and services that we give as a government to those of our nation. The case has been well made that people invest my money—a point that is lost on many—in acquiring their education. This is money which I have worked for and paid my part to the receipts of this nation, which has been lent to these students so that they can advance themselves in life. I have no problem with that. I understand the value of education, and I understand ensuring that we have arrangements in place that create educational opportunity for everybody. If the circumstances of a student require them to borrow some of my money and the money of other taxpayers to invest in their education, then that has my total support. But I am afraid I do not have much sympathy for the argument that an investment, which I loaned to somebody so that they can advance their circumstances in life, is a bad investment. I think that aspect of these changes is quite appropriate.


This package has an expanding and demand-driven Commonwealth funding system for students studying for higher education diplomas, advanced diplomas and associate degrees, costing some $370 million over three years. I hark back to my own era. I recall that when I graduated in a class of 36 students, only two went on to higher education. That opportunity was not there in my age. It was not an option for families who, in my case, could not afford the cost of higher education and the costs of living away from home that were associated with it in those days, before the expansion and regionalisation with universities. So for a government to continue to invest in the opportunities for these young men and women, I think it is a terrific thing. It is of great disappointment that we need to get caught up in this selfish attitude that somehow they have to pay off a debt that has given them one of the greatest gifts in life. The figures are out there. I do not necessarily have them in front of me, but the figures are out there that demonstrate that their earning capacity goes up threefold and fourfold. The investment may also prove to be one of the soundest investments that they make in their lifetime.


The reform package extends Commonwealth funding to all Australian higher education students in non-university higher education institutions studying bachelor courses—costing $449 million over three years. So there are combined investments heading toward a billion dollars in education and in expanding opportunities for education for the young people of our nation. Indeed, whilst not being an expert on the legislation, this extends to all applicants for higher education, be they young students graduating from school or those more mature students who endeavour to enjoy some of the benefits of tertiary development. 


Over 80,000 students each year will be provided additional support by 2018. This includes an estimated 48,000 students in diploma, advanced diploma and associate degree courses and 35,000 additional students undertaking bachelor courses. Now that is a number worth repeating: 35,000 additional students. That is 35,000 young Australians who might not otherwise have had the opportunity without some of the reforms that have been presented in this higher education reform package. The legislation provides for more opportunities for students from low socioeconomic backgrounds through new Commonwealth scholarships—broadening out the scholarship program with the greatest scholarship scheme in Australia's history. This, in effect, means free education for the brightest students from the most disadvantaged backgrounds.


Often our colleagues from across the hallway here hold themselves out to have some sort of mortgage over those in our communities who come from lower socioeconomic circumstances. I know some of these young people; I know their families; I know their circumstances. I have employed people who came from lower socioeconomic circumstances. I intend to support any form of legislation through this place that increases the prospects for those young men and women. Indeed, it extends to mature students in this space also—people who can better themselves in life. That is why I believe this piece of legislation is a very well-thought-through piece of legislation. 


I was disappointed to hear Senator Lazarus earlier say that there had not been sufficient consultation. That is somewhat in conflict with some of the social media comments that the senator made earlier today, criticising Mr Pyne, the minister responsible for this package in part, for endeavouring to make contact with him. 


I want to attach my remarks to those of Senator Madigan, a statesman. I say on the record, his words today were very measured; they are very applicable to these particular circumstances. This is as important a piece of legislation as many that have come before this chamber in recent months. Everyone is in agreement that there has been a deterioration in how the Senate is conducting itself. There are, I understand, conventions that have been long held in this place that have been abused in recent times—with the gagging of debate. There cannot be, from my point of view, a more important piece of legislation; it is equal to the legislation we have had to deal with with the nation's security. 


Again, it is worth emphasising the point that there will be an additional 35,000 students, many of them from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, whose opportunities will be dashed here today if this bill is not given the opportunity for proper debate. As Senator Madigan alluded to, we need to allow the time for the ideas to mature, and for everyone to listen to everyone else's contribution. My pay-scale is too low to understand whether Minister Pyne has a capacity to move and shift on some of these issues but I am sure that he continues to be open to discussions to resolve any of the difficulties that members of this Senate have. 


Another part of the bill is freeing universities to set their own fees and compete for students. There is a novel idea! All of us operate in market arrangements away from this place—or have done, for those of us who have had some experience in business. The provision of education is a business; and probably the most important business, up there with the provision of health services and security for our nation. What a novel idea that we might allow universities to set fees and create the environment where they pursue a particular market share! I promise you they will respond to demand. You cannot survive in a free market environment unless you respond to the demands and keep yourself price attractive. So this sort of competition will give that a lift. 


Competition will definitely enhance quality and make higher education providers more responsible to the needs of the students and the labour market. When universities and colleges compete, students are the winners. These additional 35,000 students and many tens of thousands of students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds will be the winners, because competition by its very nature drives institutions or businesses to the edge to make sure they provide the most attractive, the most competitive goods or services—in this case services—for the lowest possible price. That is how you achieve your market share. Then you have an absolute obligation to maintain the quality in the delivery of those services—if you are to retain your market share and grow your business. 


I agree with the statement that when universities and colleges compete, students are the winners. By extension, our communities are the winners; our economy is a winner; all of Australia wins; we all win. That is why I am happy—despite the protests of some previous speakers—to have my money lent to students on these most equitable terms, so that they can grow. 


I had a couple of hundred staff before I left my business to come here. I invested tens upon tens upon tens of thousands of dollars in my staff, for them to advance and develop their educational background, because I was rewarded in increased productivity. It is no different here. In my case, they paid me back through their productivity as employees. In this case, these students—most of whom I will never know—will pay me back as they contribute to the productivity of this nation, and we will all be rewarded as a result.


The argument about the loans is a moot argument and needs to be set aside. When you do that, you find that a little bit of the heat comes out of this debate and you can concentrate on the positive uplift that this particular reform package delivers right across our community, not discriminating at any level. 


Strengthening the Higher Education Loan Program sees taxpayers support all students' tuition fees upfront and ensures that students only repay their loans once they are earning a decent income, of over $50,000 per annum. Let's just think about that. Not one cent needs to be paid upfront by the students, and they do not have to make a repayment until they are earning $50,000-plus. Some might think that $50,000 is not a lot of money. Certainly, some of my colleagues in this place could be forgiven for thinking that $50,000 is not a lot of money. But, if you are a young person starting out, I promise you that $50,000 is absolutely head and shoulders above what my good wife and I earned when I was 18, 19, 20, 21 or 22, when I was starting to collect some copper coins to get a bottle of milk. That's how long ago it was. The milk was still in a bottle.



Senator Payne interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Correct. And I promise you there was no-one at my gate wanting to lend me money, not one red razoo, so that I could get ahead. I would have loved a bit of this stuff around the place going back 30-odd years ago.


The package also removes the FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP loan fees which are currently imposed on some students undertaking higher education and vocational education and training. I have listened to the contributions of a number of speakers and there was not one mention of that. You want to talk about money and you want to talk about those things that you think are an impost but not one single speaker raised it, and that is so typical of the contributions often made in this place against progressive government legislation. It is almost as if every night—certainly starting last September—people go to bed, they fit up this machine, it erases the past, it erases the 26 deficits in a row and it erases all the promises of surpluses that would have allowed governments more flexibility in the space of education, in the space of health, in the space of—




Senator Wong:
  No cuts to education, no cuts to health—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, could you deal with the interjecting. It really drives me nuts. It is not a practice I engage in.



Opposition senators interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(

Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Thank you for that, Mr Acting Deputy President. It was very effective. The higher education reform package also secures Australia's place at the forefront of research. It makes us competitive—



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  with an investment of $150 million in 2015-16 for the national collaborative research infrastructure. Just think about that. What a wonderful boost that will be to allow that to progress and make its contribution to these reforms.


There will be $139.5 million to deliver 100 new four-year research positions per year under the Future Fellowships scheme. What a wonderful progressive measure that is under the reforms. There will be 100 of them—all brand spanking new, polished up four-year research positions. Only the good Lord would know what will come out of that sort of investment. Even if we only get a productivity yield of 25 per cent, imagine the impetus to it will give to our nation and, in doing that, to our economy. These students who were yesterday on $50,000 a year will be on $60,000 a year and their repayments will be free as a result of the investment in the first instance, which is often a test that we apply in business before for we make the commitment in the first place.


There will be $42 million to support new research in tropical disease, which will be of great interest to my colleagues and I from the great state of Queensland where tropical diseases sometimes affect us. We have had little inflictions during the Queensland inquiry recently, where obviously the pollen from the mango trees had got to colleagues while we were trying to examine the witnesses. So this $42 million to support new research in tropical disease will be well received and supported by the good folk of Queensland, who do their share—and someone else's—in supporting the receipts of this nation so that we have sufficient money to lend to these absolutely privileged young men and women, bright young men and women, my nephews and nieces and all my staff's children. What a wonderful opportunity this is. I am having difficulty getting through this without being—



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  There are so many important things to bring to the attention of those opposite because, clearly, by the contribution made from the other side, they were not aware of some of these things otherwise there is no way in the world they would resist this legislation, as we saw from some of the crossbench.


Finally, I will close on the centrepiece, which is a $24-million contribution to the Antarctic Gateway Partnership because, as you know, I believe that wife beaters should be sent to the Antarctic—I said so a fortnight ago—and this sort of investment will make that so much easier for our nation, so it really is a double benefit—we get rid of the wife-beaters and we also support the Antarctic Gateway Partnership.


It has been a great privilege with very short notice to allow me to make a contribution here today. I hope it has had some impact on colleagues.

Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales—Minister for Human Services) (17:34):  I thank those senators who have spoken on this extremely important Higher Education and Research Reform Amendment Bill 2014.


The bill before the Senate amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 and the Australian Research Council Act 2001 to implement a fair, balanced and necessary set of reforms to Australia's higher education system. The passage of this historic bill will spread opportunity to more students and ensure Australia is not left behind in an environment of increasing global competition.


This bill is of the utmost importance to our nation's future. It is a reform whose time has come. It is reform that has to happen. The government has listened to concerns about certain measures in the bill and has agreed to amendments.


The status quo in Australian higher education is untenable. Universities Australia and every peak body for higher education in this country are in complete agreement with this statement and support the reforms with amendments. Therefore, the parliament of Australia and this chamber now has a choice: should we as a nation continue with an outdated higher education system and let Australia's universities fall behind the rest of the world? Are we prepared to deny current and future generations of students the opportunity to obtain a world-class education? Or will we actually embrace the challenges of the 21st century and equip our higher education institutions to compete in a global, changing economy?


This bill provides an opportunity to achieve these necessary reforms now, and disadvantaged students will particularly benefit. They will benefit from the biggest Commonwealth scholarship scheme ever, which means that there will be more help than ever for disadvantaged students to go to university. They will benefit from the abolition of loan fees, which will benefit 130,000 students a year and which has merited barely passing reference in the comments of those opposing the bill from the other side. They will benefit from the uncapping of Commonwealth supported places for pathway diplomas and other diplomas that leads straight into jobs. These reforms ensure that every person from any background who has the ability and who wants to go to university can do so.


There has been a crescendo of support for these changes from the higher education community. This is what universities, TAFEs and private higher education colleges know is needed for the future of higher education and for the future of our country. Universities Australia, the Australian Technology Network of Universities, Innovative Research Universities, the Regional Universities Network, the Group of Eight, the Australian Council for Private Higher Education and Training, and the Council of Private Higher Education have all said that the parliament should pass this bill, although they do see the need for some amendments.


Universities Australia said:


The introduction into Parliament of the Federal Government's higher education legislation is a chance for all parliamentarians to seize the opportunity for making real, lasting changes that are needed in positioning our universities for the challenges of the future.


The Australian Technology Network of Universities said:


Deregulation is a threshold issue for the sector and its passage through the Senate is crucial to protect the international reputation for quality higher education, representing around $15 Billion in export earnings for Australia.


Last week the chair of the Regional Universities Network, Professor Peter Lee, said that it was time to end the uncertainty around the higher education reforms. He said:


A new approach to university funding is needed to maintain the quality education that students expect.


I would add: 'that students deserve'. With some changes, he said the bill 'will help regional students attend and succeed at regional universities and will increase the number of professionals working in regional Australia'—surely an objective of all of us. This unprecedented consensus of support from the higher education sector is as a result of truism as expressed by Professor Sandra Harding, the chair of Universities Australia. We should not underestimate the importance of the reforms, she said, adding, 'The status quo isn’t an option.'


This bill provides a basis to transform Australia's higher education system and allow it to be the best in the world. There are four key elements to the bill. Firstly, it will see a significant expansion in access to higher education. The bill removes the current limits on Commonwealth supported sub-bachelor places. Any Australian student who wishes to study a higher education diploma, an advanced diploma or an associate degree will be able to do so with Commonwealth support for the first time ever. These are qualifications that lead to jobs in fields like child care and aged care, and jobs for computer technicians. These jobs are in increasing demand with our changing economy and our ageing population. These qualifications also form pathways to university, which the Kemp-Norton review of the demand-driven funding system found are important in helping underprepared students to succeed at university and stay at university, and to reduce the dropout rate. The bill ends the discrimination against students who study at private universities and non-university higher education institutions by giving them access to Commonwealth support places. For tens of thousands of Australian students who participate in the higher education sector in those particular institutions, that discrimination will be removed by this legislation. These two measures alone will allow an additional 80,000 Australian students each year to receive Commonwealth subsidies by 2018. That will particularly benefit students from disadvantaged backgrounds, those from rural and regional communities and those who need that little bit of extra assistance to complete their studies.


The bill also creates the Commonwealth scholarship scheme. The Commonwealth scholarship scheme will provide what is likely to be the largest scholarship support in Australia's history for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. It will include students from rural and regional Australia as well, of course. These scholarships will assist students with the cost of tuition fees, but also with the cost of living, with textbooks, with materials—the core fundamentals of coming from a challenging background and being able to be a successful, productive and good student.


Secondly, the bill gives institutions flexibility in how they are able to set their fees. The government has been very clear that fee deregulation is critical to drive greater competition, drive innovation and drive quality, so that our universities are able to compete with the best in Europe and America and the fast developing universities in Asia. The minister has spoken on a number of occasions about the number of universities in China and other countries in Asia which are rapidly reaching the top of the world scorecards in university rankings. Australia is not currently in a position to keep up with the pace. Australian institutions will in turn be more creative and will improve the quality of their teaching and learning, and that will give students the quality of education that they need and that employers are demanding in the 21st century environment. This change is crucial to ensuring the quality and the sustainability of the higher education sector in Australia. As Belinda Robinson, Executive Director of Universities Australia has said:


It is simply not possible to maintain the standards that students expect or the international reputation that Australia's university system enjoys without full fee deregulation.


Importantly, this bill provides this flexibility without reducing access or affordability. Every Australian student will still continue to be able to defer their tuition fees through HECS so they do not have to pay a cent up-front or pay a cent back until they are earning more than $50,000 a year.


That brings me to the third element of the bill, which recognises the key role that HECS plays in our higher education system. HECS is critical to ensuring that no student is denied the benefit of a higher education. Our HECS system has been and will continue to be the envy of the world.


This government is acting to make reforms fairer by removing inequities in the treatment of students and institutions under the HECS. The bill removes 20 per cent loan fees for VET FEE-HELP and the 25 per cent loan fees for FEE-HELP. These loan fees are an unfair cost on those students who are currently not receiving a Commonwealth subsidy. Removing the loan fees makes the system fairer. This measure will simplify and improve the consistency of loan arrangements for students and institutions and will benefit over 130,000 Australian students a year.


Lastly, the government is committed to ensuring Australia has a strong, competitive research system. As part of the higher education reform package, the government will invest $11 billion over four years in research in Australian universities, including $139 million for the Future Fellowships scheme and $150 million in 2015-16 to continue the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy. The previous government left funding cliffs for both of these vital research programs.


I would not like anyone listening to or observing some of the commentary being made today to think that this is some development that the government thought up last week and thought it might put to the vote this week. This is a discussion which has been happening in reality over years but in the parliamentary sense and budgetary sense over months, since May of this year.


We have seen from particularly those opposite the most extraordinarily irresponsible scare campaign. Their claims that students will face $100,000 degrees and that that will mean that disadvantaged students will not be able to go to university are, quite frankly, deceptive, cruel and duplicitous. They are factually wrong, in fact. Going to university is now and will be based on whether a student has the ability to go to university, not the size of their bank balance.


Labor shadow Assistant Treasurer, Dr Andrew Leigh, gave the lie to the scare campaign on deregulated fees when he wrote: 'There is no reason to think that fee regulation will adversely affect poorer students.' In fact, as a result of these reforms, equity and access will be improved through the new Commonwealth scholarship scheme and the Higher Education Participation Program, the HEPP. All of the university groupings that I mentioned previously have made it clear that $100,000 degrees will not be the norm or even common. For instance, Vicki Thomson, the executive director of the Australian Technology Network, destroyed the scare campaign when she said:


… the university sector is not looking to introduce standard $100,000 degrees and deregulation won't deliver them.


It is shameful the fear such myths are creating in the community. As I have said previously, as a result of this package, many thousands of students will experience fee reductions.


It is the government's view that there will be very serious consequences if the bill does not pass the parliament. If the Higher Education and Research Reform Amendment Bill is not passed we as a country will be left behind. For our universities, the funding system will continue to operate like a straitjacket. There will be little scope or incentive for them to develop and market new and innovative courses to Australian students much less a capacity for them to shine internationally. Australian universities will be forced to continue to deal with the continuing instability and uncertainty of the current funding system.


If the Senate needs any further evidence of that, it need look no further than the $6.6 billion worth of cuts that Labor announced for 2011-12 to 2016-17. That is hardly the way to run the country's third biggest export industry. Let us not forget that what Labor did not cut they left unfunded. So, if the bill does not pass, the Future Fellowships scheme will cease and many of our best researchers will be forced to go elsewhere. The National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy will cease, putting 1,500 researchers into limbo. The loss of these two programs alone will do irreparable damage to our capacity to support high-quality research. For the higher education activities of our TAFEs and private colleges we will be closing the door in their faces.


If the bill is not passed, students will continue to be locked out of pathway qualifications which, as identified by Dr Kemp and Mr Norton in the review of the demand driven system, have a significant impact on the dropout rate of students with lower ATARs. If the bill is not passed, 80,000 Australian students a year will miss out on receiving Commonwealth support to study. If the bill is not passed, we are going to forgo the largest scholarship scheme for disadvantaged students that this country has ever seen.


The government has listened to the concerns of both the crossbenchers and the higher education sector. Just today we have announced a number of responses to those concerns. The government has said that it will accept Senator Day's amendment to keep the indexation rate for student debt at CPI rather than moving to the 10-year bond rate as previously indicated. We have also said that—and I note that he is not in the chamber—we will accept Senator Madigan's amendment for a HECS indexation pause for the primary care giver of newborn children. I particularly acknowledge Senator Madigan's very considered and working contribution to the second reading debate.


The government has also today circulated other amendments that provide for the creation of a structural adjustment fund for universities focused on those with large numbers of low-SES students—




Senator Kim Carr:
  $33 million—how paltry is that? $33 million—how pathetic is that?




Senator PAYNE:
  that ensures domestic student fees must be lower than international fees. In fact, the domestic student fee and the Commonwealth contribution combined must be less than the international student fee. The government has also circulated two technical amendments on grandfathering and the definition of 'additional revenue' for the purposes of the Commonwealth scholarships. I hear Senator Carr indicating that he finds one of those amendments 'paltry'. That would have to be from a comparison with living in a complete intellectual vacuum and, therefore, I completely understand his point, from his perspective!


We have also indicated that we will support the creation in the HEPP a scholarship component for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. We have guaranteed that Commonwealth scholarship guidelines will ensure that those scholarships are focused on low-SES and regional students, as so many senators have sought. We have indicated that the Treasurer will direct the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to monitor prices in the higher education sector, and we have guaranteed a suitable process of evaluation of the reforms over coming years. These amendments will guarantee for students huge benefits of freeing up the higher education system and of supporting all Australian undergraduates from diploma courses through to bachelor degrees—for the first time ever.


Now the Australian parliament has an opportunity to support some of the greatest higher education reforms of our time, and frankly, it is clear that there is no credible alternative. It is a vacuum on the other side. The opposition has not furnished one, either when it was in office or today. In fact, as Senator Carr has suggested in recent days, their solution appears to be recapping the higher education system and slamming the door in the faces of many thousands of disadvantaged students. As Mike Gallagher, one of the most experienced figures in higher education policy, has said:


The 2014 higher education budget reforms are necessary. They are logical, coherent, sustainable, equitable and inevitable. My guess is that the detractors of microeconomic reform in Australia's higher education industry will find themselves on the wrong side of history in resisting efficiency, improvement and innovation, as they will be in opposing the redistributive measures of the package and, curiously, supporting socially regressive subsidies from general taxpayers to more advantaged segments of the community.


This bill will allow our higher education to be the best in the world, with some of the great universities in the world. It will ensure that future generations of Australians can get a world-class education to support them in the jobs of the future. It will provide the backbone of our future economy. I do not understand why those opposite want to make students continue to pay interest fees of 20 and 25 per cent on VET fee-help and fee-help. I do not understand why they are turning their backs on those who choose to participate in higher education through TAFEs and through the private sector. I do not understand why those who purport to stand up for those who face some of the greatest challenges in life cannot see that we need to make these changes and that it will indeed be the backbone of our future economy. Because if we do not, we only go backwards. I urge senators to support the bill.

"McGrath, Sen James",LP,2014-12-02,"



Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland) (21:58):  Having entered this place only five months ago, this is going to be my first Christmas as a senator for Queensland. As is customary at Christmas, you think about the year that has passed and the year ahead, and you think about those who have helped you and those who have hindered you along the way. But, also, you start to think about those people who have been good and those whom you would like Santa Claus to bring presents to. I should particularly mention three wonderful people in the whips office, otherwise I will never get a speaking slot in this place ever again—Charlotte, Bec and Megan. I hope that they take this offering in goodwill.


There are those who are good and those who are bad. The Labor Party and the Greens, I am afraid, have been very naughty boys and girls this year, and I do not think Santa Claus is going to be bringing too much for my friends in the Labor Party and the Greens. I think there might be some lumps of Queensland coal for the Labor Party and, hopefully, extra coal for the Greens because of their naughtiness and how they have behaved, sadly, over these past few months.


I would like to set the record straight, to remind the Greens and Labor of the achievements of this government. If I have time, I can then highlight some of the disappointments and some of the naughtiness of Labor and the Greens. It would be very wrong of me to talk about what happened in our party room today, and I would get in lots of trouble from the whips office, but what is in the public sphere at the moment is the presentation that the Treasury gave about the highlights and the wonderful things that this government has been able to do since the election on 7 September 2013. So what I am going to do is just very, very quickly give you a highlight—



Senator Moore interjecting—




Senator McGRATH:
  I know my friends in the Labor Party really, really look forward to this!




Senator McEwen:
  You're going to sing it, are you?




Senator McGRATH:
  I am not going to sing. If there is one thing you do not want, it is to hear me sing—or even to watch me dance.




Senator Birmingham:
  We've had dancing in the chamber before!




Senator McGRATH:
  I will not be dancing. I do not do that. I am very puritan in that respect. But let us talk about what the government has been able to do in the almost 15 months that it has been in power. It has commenced the budget repair job, and isn't that fantastic, ladies and gentlemen? It is fantastic. It has started to get the budget back under control. 


We have delivered the largest infrastructure package ever. You can go to Queensland and see where the infrastructure is starting. If you go along the Gateway near Deagon, you can see the works and the planning for what is going to happen. We can talk about the Bruce Highway and the extra funds that are going to go into the Bruce Highway. As a senator who lives in regional Queensland—admittedly the Sunshine Coast but I spend a lot of time driving up and down the Bruce Highway—I am particularly excited about the work they are going to do on the Bruce Highway.


We have repealed the mining tax. We have repealed the carbon tax. We went to the election saying we would get rid of those taxes, and we have delivered. We have got rid of that carbon tax. We have got rid of that mining tax. Do you know what has happened with that? After getting rid of those taxes, we have seen the largest falls in electricity prices on record. For those Queenslanders listening at the moment—farmers driving their tractors and things like that, if they are still out there tonight—that means that your electricity prices are going to go down. We have got another hot summer coming up, as we always have in Queensland—it is not to do with climate change; we live in a hot state—and this means electricity prices are going to be lower and people's electricity bills are going to be lower.


We have privatised Medibank Private, in one of the largest floats this year globally, and we have raised over $1 billion more than was expected. Do you know what that means? That means that money is going to go to pay off the debt that the axis between the Greens and the Labor Party wreaked upon future generations of Australians. That debt is $1 billion a month in interest alone. So we have privatised Medibank Private.


We have removed around $2 billion worth of red tape. That is over 57,000 pages of legislation. That is probably about this much. For people listening at home, I have put my hand up about two feet high. That is a lot of legislation. That is a good thing.



Senator Moore interjecting—




Senator McGRATH:
  Senator Moore, I realise you are very excited about this, but it is a good thing we are getting rid of red tape. 


We have also ended—and this is quite serious—the age of entitlement for industry. We have made some tough decisions in relation to the car industry, and that has not necessarily been popular in some parts of this country. But it has helped us to finalise three free trade agreements—with Korea, Japan and China. What that is going to do for the Australian economy and the Asian economy, opening up borders, is fantastic. We have to think about our geographical placement, and having those three free trade agreements will certainly cement us as part of Asia.


We have delivered smaller government. I think most people here know that I am a big fan of small government, and getting rid of 76 agencies, authorities and boards is a positive start. I would like to see some more progress in that area, but that is just me speaking as a mere backbencher.


We have also had $1 trillion worth of environmental approvals. Over 300 major projects have been approved. That means jobs. It means jobs for people not just in Queensland but across Australia. It means that we can get this country moving again. The more jobs we have, the more money people can earn. The more they can spend, the more it grows the economy. We really want to grow the pie for all Australians.


But we have done other things. We have rebuilt the employee share schemes, because we want people to be able to own the companies they work for. We have dealt with Labor's tax backlog. I was a bit surprised about this, because Labor and the Greens are the parties of tax—and I respect them for that; those are the views they hold; I disagree with their views—but there are almost 100 unenacted tax measures. Some of these measures have not been enacted for so long that, when the Treasurer was wandering around the Treasury building, he could not find any public servants who knew what these tax measures dealt with, because they have been waiting there for so long to be enacted. We have taken the leadership—and this was shown in the G20—in cracking down on tax cheats: a 15-point plan with the OECD. 


But we have got more to look forward to this coming year. It is going to be a very exciting year. I am a new person here, but everyone says that, in the last sitting week, everyone puts the cranky pants on and people get a little bit short with each other, but I am very excited about this coming year, because we have got some very exciting things happening. We have got the Federation white paper coming out. I am really excited about that and what that means in terms of how the different levels of government deal with each other. We have got the tax white paper coming out, which I also find terribly exciting. We have got the Intergenerational report, which will come out in February. We will hopefully have further progress on budget reforms. And—and I think we should all agree on this—we have got other free trade agreements that we should encourage the government about. I think Labor would come together with us and support further free trade agreements—with Europe, with India and with the Gulf council.




Senator Birmingham:
  We have negotiated them; we have just not finalised them.




Senator McGRATH:
  Finalising them would be very good. What is a little bit disappointing is how Labor—and this is why they are going to get a nice lump of Queensland coal from Santa Claus for Christmas—are sabotaging the budget and stopping us from getting on and getting the budget back on track. Labor are opposed—and, Mr Deputy President, I am sure you will be shocked to hear this—to $28 billion worth of savings, and this includes $5 billion worth of their own savings. I hope that Labor, when they are having a sip of communion sherry or something like that over the break, will decide that they will support these changes to help us get the budget back on track.


The other thing is that Labor want an additional $15 billion of spending restored. That would worsen the budget bottom line down to $43 billion. Australia just cannot afford that. While Santa might bring his presents for free—and he is a good person, and I love Santa for that—the budget does not come for free; it is the Australian taxpayers who pay for that. I hope that the Labor Party and the Greens realise that they cannot just keep squeezing the poor Australian taxpayer to pay for their unfunded promises. I hope that they will join with us in helping to restore the budget bottom line.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you for that entertaining contribution.
