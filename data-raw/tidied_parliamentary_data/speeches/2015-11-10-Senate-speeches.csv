Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (12:32):  I rise to express Labor's support for the Defence Legislation Amendment (First Principles) Bill, which will enable implementation of certain recommendations from the First Principles Review and instil a stronger, whole-of-organisation approach within Defence. Labor's support for this bill is in line with our often expressed position that we will take a bipartisan approach on national security matters when we are satisfied it is in the national interest. 


We support the provisions of the bill that are designed to implement two specific recommendations of the First Principles Review. The first clearly establishes the role of the Chief of the Defence Force as the commander of the Australian Defence Force. The other amends the Navigation Act to allow for the consolidation of geospatial information functions in the Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation. We have no objection to these two recommendations of the First Principles Review and support their implementation.


We are aware that some in the Defence community regard the changes to the role of the Chief of the Defence Force and the statutory authority of the service chiefs as undesirable. In satisfying ourselves that the proposed changes are in the national interest, we sought and received assurances from Defence leadership that these changes codify existing arrangements in Defence. We also sought and received public assurances from all three service chiefs that they were supportive of the changes, and we consulted with service organisations. We have been reassured that this legislative change will make no substantive difference to the very real and continuing traditions of each of the services.


This bill proposes changes that will see the legislative coverage of the Defence Reserves amalgamated into a single Defence Act. This is a welcome step and continues, in legislative terms, the integration of the reserves into the total force concept that Labor initiated through Plan Suakin and Plan Beersheba.


Labor also note that the bill provides a clearer legal framework for the cadets, which we welcome. The changes clearly establish that the cadets are not part of the ADF and that instructors are not members of the ADF by virtue of their role. The changes also make clear that the cadets are a volunteer based youth development organisation. Labor support these changes as we consider that they better reflect the nature of the cadets program and make it clear that the cadets are not a junior military force. We support the introduction of an annual report on the cadets from the Chief of the Defence Force.


Labor also note the nature of the ADF employment relationship has, until now, been expressed in regulation. This bill seeks to enshrine this relationship in legislation, in the Defence Act, which we support. We believe that such an important issue should be in legislation in the interests of transparency and as one more sign of the unique nature of military service.


For the reasons I have outlined, Labor support this bill. We believe it seeks to make sensible changes that should improve the administration of Defence. In conclusion, I would like to thank the minister and her office for their willingness to make departmental officials available to brief the opposition. The cooperation shown by the minister's office and the department was greatly appreciated.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:35):  I would like to indicate my support for the Defence Legislation Amendment (First Principles) Bill, but I want to put this bill in context. It implements just one small part of the First Principles Review into Defence. That review was instigated by the current government, by former minister Senator Johnston, in August 2014. I commend Senator Johnston for his leadership on this issue. This was a very good thing to do, and it is great to see that the current defence minister is following this through, which I think is very important. 


In a nutshell, the review is about making our defence forces and the resources provided to them to be more effective in terms of both defending our nation and delivering better value for money for taxpayers. What I have learnt, though, in Senate estimates, over a number of torturous occasions, is that there is much more work to be done to ensure that Defence procurement decisions and the processes for those decisions must be improved. I do not think there should be too much dispute about that. 


For instance, the questions I have asked about submarine combat systems indicate that potentially hundreds of millions of dollars have not been spent wisely; we could have had a better outcome had all options been explored. A locally built combat system, I believe, would have been a much better option. That option would have meant a much greater degree of Australian industry involvement with Australian control of that combat system.


Just last week, I was in Singapore visiting the Defence Science and Technology Agency and met with its CEO, Mr Tan Peng Yam, and senior executives of the DSTA. I talked to them about how they went about procuring their defence capabilities and also about the fact that, for their submarines, there is a local capability in respect of their combat systems.


I note that the whole basis of the First Principles Review, or one of the key underpinnings of it, is to have true contestability in Defence. What this means is that Defence should encourage scrutiny from both within Defence and externally to ensure the best outcomes for our nation's defence and the most cost-effective way of achieving that. That may involve challenging conventional orthodoxies in the way that Defence goes about its business, particularly procurement. 


So I welcome this bill in that it implements one of the many recommendations of the First Principles Review. But in relation to this particular bill, I do have some minor concerns that I would like to explore with the Minister for Defence briefly in the context of the committee stage. They relate to how command may override some elements of contestability. I would also like some clarification in relation to the minister's ability to independently seek advice as to the single service perspectives of the Chief of Army, the Chief of Navy and the Chief of Air Force, which may differ from the single perspective presented to the minister through the CDF as part of One Defence. That is, I think, a genuine question in the context of what that means where there is a One Defence approach but there may be nuanced differences between Army, Navy and the Air Force. I would like that to be clarified during the committee stages of this debate. 


I would also like an update from the minister, in the course of the committee or at some other time, as to the other aspects of the First Principles Review, which I believe have a lot of merit in improving our Defence forces, having that genuine contestability within Defence and having Defence subject to that scrutiny to best deliver outcomes for our nation's defence in a way that is most efficient for our taxpayers but, above all, to make sure that the security of our nation is most robustly looked after. The First Principles Review, I believe, goes some way in enhancing the defence of our nation.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2015-11-10,"



Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales—Minister for Defence) (12:39):  I thank both Senator Dastyari and Senator Xenophon for their contributions to this debate and their acknowledgement of the support of the legislation. The First Principles Review of Defence, which was commissioned by this government in 2014, recommended changes to the Defence Act 1903 to formally recognise the authority of the Chief of the Defence Force and the Vice Chief of the Defence Force. The Defence Legislation Amendment (First Principles) Bill 2015 will give full command of the Australian Defence Force, made up of the Navy, Army and Air Force, to the CDF by removing legislative limitations in the Defence Act. 


Passage of this bill will mean that, for the first time, all three services of the ADF will be incorporated under one act, the Defence Act. All three services will maintain their individual identity and service chiefs, but they will come together as a part of the ADF under the Defence Act. This is historic, because, until now, each service was recognised separately in legislation, in recognition of their different histories. The bill also recognises the VCDF as the deputy of the CDF and clarifies that the powers of the service chiefs are subject to the direction of the Chief of the Defence Force. 


The current Defence Act does not explicitly recognise the ADF as a single entity in its own right—rather, it gives the impression that the ADF is a federation of the three services—and it lacks some clarity with respect to command arrangements of the CDF, the VCDF and the service chiefs. The service chiefs' role as a vital element of defence capability is enduring, and they will continue to command their respective service subject to the direction of the CDF. The bill also makes other necessary legislative amendments to make it clear that the Chief of the Defence Force, as the sole commander of the ADF, is able to make appropriate orders or give directions in relation to command, control and administrations of the ADF and for the CDF to direct and administer the ADF cadets. The chain of command and day-to-day operations of ADF members are likely to remain unchanged. The changes will have no effect on ADF members' obligations and entitlements.


The provisions in the Defence Act 1903 establishing the diarchy where the CDF and the Secretary of Defence have joint responsibility for administering the Defence Force will be remade in substantially the same terms, consistent with the First Principles Review recommendations. The bill will also streamline the legislative basis of the ADF, including by repealing the Naval Defence Act 1910 and the Air Force Act 1923 and incorporating the substantive provisions of these acts in tri-service provisions in the Defence Act. The repeal of the Naval Defence Act and the Air Force Act provides the opportunity to both modernise and simplify legislation in relation to the ADF cadets, which are voluntary community-based youth programs established by Defence in partnership with the community. The bill makes it clear that cadets, instructors and officers of cadets are volunteers and are not members of the ADF. The bill will not change the day-to-day activities of cadet units in the community. ADF cadets will continue to be formed into cadet units in Navy, Army and Air Force cadets. 


While this bill will bring each of these services together for the first time under one act, none of the traditions or identities will be lost, nor will the history of service and sacrifice that hundreds of thousands of Australians have given under the banners of the Navy, the Army or the Air Force ever be forgotten, especially as we approach Remembrance Day tomorrow. What we will have is a modern Australian Defence Force that is fit for purpose and that is capable of meeting the threats to national security of the 21st century and beyond.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:44):  My question relates to the very brief contribution I made in the second reading debate. I understand the basis for this piece of legislation, and I have said that I support it, but to what extent does the minister have a discretion or an ability to seek advice separately?


At the moment, the Chief of Defence may give the view of defence as a whole, but there may be some nuanced and subtle differences between the position of the Chief of Navy, the Chief of Air Force and the Chief of Army. That is where I am at. While I am on my feet, what progress is being made with respect to the whole issue of contestability that seems to underpin the basis of the First Principles Review and the importance of that, because I think that is very healthy in terms of the culture of defence. That is not being critical of the culture of the defence. I just think it is very healthy for an organisation like Defence to have that ethos of contestability running through it.

Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales—Minister for Defence) (12:45):  Senator Xenophon, I think it is very fair to say that there are often subtle and nuanced differences between views occasionally presented by the chiefs of the various services and, from time to time, the CDF, and between themselves for that matter. But the most important thing is that currently the minister is able to receive that separate and discrete, as in separate unit, advice. That will certainly continue under these arrangements and with the adoption of this legislation. Ultimately, of course, it is the minister who directs the CDF—that is, if you like, the top layer on that process. 


In relation to your question concerning the contestability aspects of the First Principles Review and progress in that regard, I met very early in the piece, after I was appointed, with the oversight committee of the first principles implementation team and was updated by them. I understand I am due to receive another update from the chair, Mr Peever, in fact this week. The committee under the leadership also of the VCDF is progressing very methodically through the implementation process of the First Principles Review. I am keeping a very close eye on that and am engaged in that briefing process in particular.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales) (15:05):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.


However, my own remarks will focus on the question of foreign investment in agriculture. What we saw today in the answer provided by Senator Sinodinos was the glaring inconsistency within the coalition about the approach to the agricultural sector—one of the most important sectors in terms of Australia's economy in the next couple of decades. Senator Sinodinos quite correctly points out that Australia, historically, over many hundreds of years, has been dependent on investment from overseas sources to supplement our own savings. Senator Sinodinos will be aware, I think, that there are few sectors where this is more important than in the agricultural sector. The National Farmers' Federation themselves have estimated that $1.2 to $1.5 trillion would be needed to realise the potential for this sector over the next 35 years.


We understand that this potential derives from the ability to expand our export sector to a very hungry market to our north. There are already 250 million people who are identified as being part of China's middle class, and that number is set to grow exponentially. As that grows the demand for food and fibre products will also grow exponentially as the middle class seek to improve their circumstances and their wealth. The opportunities for Australia in that context are absolutely enormous.


When sensible people in the business community here are thinking about our future, it is frequently the agricultural sector that they point to. In just one example, last year a Business Council of Australia report about Australia's competitive advantage pointed to the agricultural sector and to the food manufacturing sector as areas where Australia has the opportunity to be a global winner. In that environment, investment will be absolutely critical. There is absolutely no way, as the Farmers' Federation has acknowledged, that this can be met within Australia's savings pool.


So what is very puzzling is the stance taken by the government on this question, as evidenced by the responses today to questions from Senator Wong. There is no clarity about the role that this government anticipates for foreign investors in the agricultural sector. We see that in legislation we imagine will come before this place shortly that seeks to establish different tests and different thresholds, depending on the origin of the funds. There is absolutely no public policy rationale for a decision of this kind.


In his remarks today Senator Sinodinos pointed to the importance of scrutiny, to the importance of the Foreign Investment Review Board, in providing confidence to agricultural communities. We support that. We support the FIRB and we support its role. We support, indeed, the idea that the FIRB might focus its attentions on sensitive sectors. What we do not understand is the distinction that is made not on the sector itself but on the origin of the funds. So, the proposal to introduce a differential test, depending on whether the funds come from China, from Singapore, from the USA or from Chile, is not grounded in a sensible public policy rationale but instead speaks simply to a blinkered view from those opposite about the future of agriculture in this country.


I will digress briefly to make the point that after a long debate about the Chinese free trade agreement, where we on this side sought to stand up for the rights of Australian workers, to have their jobs put first in any decision about importing skilled labour, it is particularly galling to see the government now move to implement a completely baseless approach to foreign investment in Australian agriculture. It is disappointing that Senator Sinodinos would not repudiate the remarks by Senator Williams around selling what the land grows and not the land, because this kind of simple reduction of the challenge for us in finding appropriate levels of investment in the agricultural sector does not do anyone any good. It does not serve the agriculture sector well, it does not serve country people well and it does not serve the country well.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2015-11-10,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (15:11):  From time to time I get a little bit confused about the Labor Party's position on this issue. Today they have apparently taken the position that any more scrutiny on foreign investment and agriculture is a bad thing, but only a couple of years ago their alternative Prime Minister, their leader Kevin Rudd, the person they put up to be in charge of this country, was asked at the Asia Society Policy Institute about investment in Australian rural land, and this is what he said: 'I am a bit nervous, a bit anxious, frankly, about simply an open-slather approach on this. I think when it is about rural land and land more generally, we need to adopt a more cautious approach. We should not have open slather.' It was just two years ago that the leader of the Labor Party said he wanted a more cautions approach to foreign investment in land. But now we have a completely different position from the Labor Party on foreign investment in rural land. It is exactly the same approach they took to foreign investment in residential land—completely ad hoc and all over the place.


When they were in government, in 2009, I believe it was under Minister Bowen at the time, but I stand to be corrected, the Labor Party changed the regulations on investment in residential land to allow more open-slather and allow more foreigners to invest in residential housing, particularly existing housing. There was a huge surge in foreign investment in our major cities, particularly Sydney. But within two years they had reversed the approach and gone back to the previous approach, which basically means that foreigners generally cannot invest in residential housing or land in this country—in existing housing, I should say, because they can invest in off-the-plan and in new housing.


The Labor Party has been all over on this issue for a number of years. There was also a massive inconsistency with how we treat investment in residential property and how we treat investment in non-residential property. There are differences between them. But to come into his place and try to argue that more scrutiny and more transparency on investment in agricultural land is somehow going to make the sky fall in—it just does not make sense. We make it such that all foreigners cannot buy an existing home in Sydney or Melbourne. Why is there such inconsistency. Why do we never hear anything from the Labor Party about why foreigners should be able to invest in residential housing in our major cities, but they want to bang on about investment in rural land?


The reality is that a few years ago we increased the thresholds on Foreign Investment Review Board decisions to $250-odd million. It has been going up with inflation every year, but it sits at about $250 million. That means we provide no scrutiny at all to investment in agricultural land, because, of course, there is almost no farm in the country—one farm, perhaps: Cubbie Station—that is worth more than $250 million. It is an anomaly that we are fixing with the changes that are before the Senate at the moment.


Even after the changes we make we will still be one of the most liberal countries in the world for investment in agricultural land, and we should be, because Senator Sinodinos is correct that we do need investment in our agricultural sector. Because of that we will be and will remain one of the most liberal countries in the world in welcoming foreign investment. If you go the US, a bastion of free markets and open competition, there are 11 states in the US where no non-residents can purchase farmland—none at all. In places like Nebraska, Oklahoma, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri and North Dakota—many of them big farming states in the US—they do not allow any non-residents to buy farmland at all. In a few other states only US citizens can buy farmland. In Canada there are different restrictions between different provinces but, again, generally, foreigners are restricted to purchasing less than 40 acres in most farming states in Canada. In New Zealand any parcel of non-urban land of more than five hectares is defined as 'sensitive' and purchase by foreigners must receive approval by the Overseas Investment Office. 


Our changes to bring the threshold down from the $250 million-odd level to around $15 million for scrutiny will still make us one of the most liberal countries of the world but will provide for some scrutiny, at least, for investment in our farmland. I believe the Australian people expect us to scrutinise investments in land in this country to make sure that they are in our national interest and to make sure that decisions that we make as a government accord with the principles established in the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act, which are to make sure those investments are in our national interest.

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (15:42):  I present the explanatory memorandum and move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



AUTOMOTIVE TRANSFORMATION SCHEME AMENDMENT (SECURING THE AUTOMOTIVE COMPONENT INDUSTRY) BILL 2015


The Automotive Transformation Scheme Amendment (Securing the Automotive Component Industry) Bill 2015 seeks to amend the Automotive Transformation Scheme in order to provide Australian automotive parts makers with a fighting chance upon the exit of the major car manufacturers from Australia. It will ensure our local automotive manufacturing sectors can maintain jobs by supporting industry shift to clean technologies like electric vehicles.


We know that the up-stream automotive industry in Australia is in crisis. With Ford, Holden and Toyota all exiting Australia, the last locally produced and assembled Australian motor vehicle from these companies is likely to roll off the production line by the end of 2017.


Not only will this see up to ten thousand highly skilled workers simultaneously enter a shrinking job market, but the stress on component and parts manufacturers will lead to further rounds of factory closures and job losses.


The evidence from previous rounds of such closures is in. Two years after the exiting of the Australian market by Mitsubishi Motors in South Australia, only one third of the approximately 1000 workers who were retrenched had found full-time work. Another third had moved on to casual or part-time work while the final third were still struggling to find employment or had moved into early retirement.


This was under conditions of a still robust Australian automotive industry. This round of job losses has the capacity to be much, much worse. The impact of such a large and immediate shift will have catastrophic consequences for our communities.


The Government is fond of talking of market inefficiencies and a lack of competitiveness, of retraining and realignment, but will not keep jobs and smart manufacturing in Australia.


This Bill also addresses a second and very different challenge which confronts our nation, and in it may lie the seed of rebirth for our automotive industry. We know that our industrial addiction to fossil fuels is having an irreversible impact on our climate. The challenges of pollution and climate change need solutions, and in this Bill we put forward a way for Australia to make a significant contribution to the reduction in fossil fuel reliance in the transport sector.


The Bill we put before you today would provide the incentives needed for companies here in Australia to be early movers in the clean energy vehicle market. The Rudd Government's Automotive Transformation Scheme has at its core a good idea, which is to help the automotive industry transition through this incredibly tough period for the sector. However, what it has failed to do is envision how Australia can be a world leader in competitive high-technology manufacturing. The Greens criticised the ATS when it was first introduced as unable to see the writing on the wall. Now is our opportunity to rectify this.


This Bill would provide access to eligibility for registration under the Automotive Transformation Scheme to businesses that have developed electric or non-fossil fuel motor vehicles or engines. It would additionally provide access to eligibility for registration to the ATS for Australian component manufacturers who have developed components specifically for electric or non-fossil fuel vehicles. Current ATS recipients will continue to be supported, but a whole new group of recipients will now be eligible to receive funding under the scheme. The scheme would also be open to new component manufacturers and car makers - not just the established producers.


The Government has indicated its intent to transfer the $800 million of ATS underspend to general revenue due to limitations in the current scheme. What a wasted opportunity that would be. While thousands of Australian workers are expecting to go unhelped into the unemployment line, there are opportunities to make the industry sustainable, both economically and environmentally, into the future. Through this scheme, we can retain the important skills and workers who would otherwise be sent packing on the job market.


The Bill will limit the Minister's ability to block registration in cases where Australian electric and non-fossil fuel motor vehicle and component producers have met key eligibility requirements. This is one of those cases where Ministerial discretion may well be counter-productive to the national interest.


This Bill will change the objects of the Automotive Transformation Scheme Act2009 to include the mandate to support the Australian automotive industry in its transition away from dependence on the major motor vehicle producers as those producers reduce and cease their Australia operations; and to encourage the design and manufacturing of clean energy technologies and the production of motor vehicles that are not powered by fossil fuels. Managing this transition is essential to the functioning of the expanded scheme, the automotive industry itself and the long term future of our manufacturing sector.


Finally, in the provisions laid out in this Bill, the scheme would allow components manufacturers to also be investing in and developing components for the productions of renewable energy technologies. We already see great potential in Australia for this industry to grow. Precision Components is a South Australian manufacturer that is making frames for solar heliostats, for example. There is great potential for our smart, skilled manufacturing sector to be growing Australian activity in the development and production of these technologies.


The experts all agree that the revolution in our automotive industry is coming. It is estimated by industry and market analysts that the market in electric cars may be worth up to $500 billion dollars by 2025. Australia is already a world leader in renewable energy and sustainable agriculture technology, and there is absolutely no reason that we cannot be world leaders in the green transport and motor vehicle industry either.


The transition in Australia has already begun, but without Government effort we know that advanced manufacturing will struggle to grow. We can see examples of green shoots growing. In Port Melbourne, Futuris supplies components for Tesla. Nissan Casting Australia, based in Dandenong South, now produces powertrain castings for the Nissan Leaf. In South Australia, the Ethan Group are bringing together existing component manufacturers with a plan for innovative production of new motor vehicles, including eventually electric vehicles. There are thousands of potential linkages between Australian industry and the world market, but without the right policy settings and economic incentives Australia will miss out on this once in a generation industrial opportunity.



Marion Council in Adelaide has recently voted to investigate the potential of electric vehicle manufacturing at the Tonsley Park site. Tonsley Park was the site of the old Mitsubishi plant which closed in 2008, and which could be said to be the beginning of the exit of the big automotive manufacturing firms from Australian operations. Would it not be fitting if the place that went first in the wind down of the old industry became the incubator of the new. Let us help make this vision a reality.


We commend the Bill to the Senate.

Senator SIEWERT:
  This amendment is similar to the one that we moved last year about the 2015 sitting calendar. These sittings coincide with school holidays on three occasions—in particular, in July for Queensland, Victoria and the Northern Territory. For Queensland and Victoria, they then coincide with the school holidays in September as well. So senators who have young families, with children at school, twice will lose out on being able to spend time with their children during the school holidays. It is quite easy for us to have a calendar that does exclude sitting days on school holidays. We are supposed to be family friendly. It is very hard for us to be family friendly in this Senate. One of the ways we can be is by not calling sitting days on school holidays. (Time expired)

  Again, as I said in this place when a similar motion was moved last time, the Labor Party is not supporting the amendment, though we do understand the concerns raised by Senator Siewert. We say again that these things should be discussed beforehand so that we have the open discussion about the family-friendly processes. But it has been our position that the government of the day has the right to determine the sitting pattern. That is the convention we follow. In making that statement, I say that we should have certainty around the sitting hours and, should there be any requests for extended hours or changes to that, it would only be under exceptional circumstances and there would need to be consideration of that at the time. On that basis, we are not supporting the Greens amendment and we are living by the longstanding convention of putting the onus on the government of the day to set the pattern.

Senator FIFIELD:
  I appreciate the opposition indicating that they support the convention that the government of the day should determine the sitting schedule. Obviously this is a matter which is determined by both chambers, and it makes sense that both chambers have a common sitting pattern. It is not always possible, given that there are multiple considerations in determining a sitting pattern, to see that school holidays never coincide with sittings of the parliament. In relation to Senator Moore's comments about whether next year additional hours or days would be granted by the chamber: whether the government requests the chamber to do so will, to a large extent, be a function of whether the various groupings in this chamber facilitate quick passage of legislation.

  I just wanted to add my support for the amendment but also point out very clearly that the Australian Greens did follow the protocol. We wrote to the government, asking that they did not schedule or suggest that this parliament sits during school holidays, because of the problems it created last year. At the end of last year, when we were discussing this year's calendar, there was quite a lot of comment in this place about how we would not again see the mistake of scheduling sitting weeks during school holidays. Twelve months on, it is as if those words were either (a) forgotten or (b) hollow in the first place. Frankly, I get a bit sick and tired of hearing the lip-service to how we should be encouraging more women into this parliament, when in fact very practical considerations could be made which would make it a much more workable place to be for women.

",Senate,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Climate Change</title>,MATTERS OF URGENCY,17,1
"Waters, Sen Larissa",AG,2015-11-10,"



Senator WATERS
 (Queensland—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (15:58):  I move:


That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:


That the Turnbull government's commitment to Tony Abbott's UN Climate Targets that deny scientific realities will contribute to catastrophic global warming.


With our change of Prime Minister we have seen a complete absence of change to any of the policies that saw the downfall of the last Prime Minister. Prime Minister Turnbull is taking Tony Abbott's targets to the Paris climate conference in a few short weeks. With the change of government in Canada, that leaves Australia at the very back of the pack in terms of our commitment, based on the science, to do what is necessary to address global warming.


We have a wonderful climate change authority in this nation, which we Greens are proud to have helped establish under the former government: a science based, independent expert body that has said that in order for Australia to do its fair share to constrain global warming to less than two degrees—and I will come back to whether even that is adequate in a few moments—we would need to reduce our pollution by 40 to 60 per cent, importantly, based on 2000 levels of pollution. Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott picked the highest year of Australia's emissions as his baseline year. He chose 2005 and then said he would commit Australia to reducing pollution levels by 26 to 28 per cent. When you convert that back to the year 2000, which most other countries use as their yardstick and which we have always used here in Australia, that is about a 19 per cent reduction. The Climate Change Authority, as I have said, said the bare minimum was 40 to 60 per cent. Our former Prime Minister, continued by this Prime Minister, has said 19 per cent is fine. To do less than half of the bottom end of the bare minimum that is needed to keep global warming to two degrees is an absolute outrage. It is an insult to future generations in this country and it is an insult to the current generations living in our Pacific island neighbour countries, who are already facing saltwater incursion into their food-producing land and inundations such that their countries might not exist in a few short years.


Yet the current government, despite the change of leadership, have not changed a thing. In fact, they signed a deal with the National Party saying that they would not change former Prime Minister Tony Abbott's climate targets—they would stick with those anti-science targets that will condemn this world to catastrophic global warming and which would see Australia shirk its international responsibility to do its fair share as one of the wealthiest nations on this planet and, of course, as the highest per capita emitter on the planet. 


The current government like to champion the fact that these woeful pollution reduction targets, they say, would entail the biggest per capita reduction. That is true, but do you know what? Even after implementing those targets, Australia would still be the highest per capita polluter on the planet. We are so far ahead of the rest of the world that even after implementing the woeful targets of the Abbott, now Turnbull, government we will still be the world's worst polluter on a per capita basis. That is absolutely shameful. For the government to continue to not even engage on that fact shows their absolute disregard for science. It shows that they continue to be simply a mouthpiece for the coal and fossil fuel sectors, to their eternal shame and to the embarrassment of most Australians, who understand that we need action on global warming not just to safeguard amazing places, like the Great Barrier Reef or the Wet Tropics or Tasmania's magnificent forests or our iconic species, not just for those clear environmental benefits but for our very safety and way of life. I am from Queensland, where we have seen some really horrific extreme weather events in the last few years. We will see more of those, the science predicts, if we continue to pump out the greenhouse gas pollution that our coal industry is exporting to the rest of the world and that, sadly, we are still using way too much domestically.


Is that really the sort of future that you want to condemn us to? If you do not care about the environment, which clearly you do not, if you are not so worried about people's property and their emotional resilience being damaged, have a look at the economic prosperity that we are missing out on by refusing to get on board that transition to clean energy. Have a look at the fact that the global coal price is now in structural decline. There are many economists lining up to say that it is not just a dip it is structural decline. It is not coming back. Look instead at the embrace that other nations are giving to clean energy production, which we could be a part of. This could actually be an economic boon, for us, here in Australia. This is not news. We should not have to point this out at every opportunity. It is patently obvious global economics. The fact that this government still has its head in the sand on the science and on the economics simply shows that it is utterly morally bereft and utterly hostage to the fossil fuel sector.


There was some wonderful news just the other day that the Obama administration in the US has rejected one of the key fossil fuel projects, the Keystone Pipeline, which has long been proposed to open up Canada's tar sands. President Obama rejected it on the basis of its climate impacts. This is the first time that we have seen a project rejected in a developed nation on the basis of its global warming impacts. I hope that it is the start of a trend, because in Australia we have so many of these dangerous, extreme, unnecessary and unfinanceable projects on our books. We have the Galilee Basin in Queensland, which is one of the world's largest coal basins. If it were opened up and all that coal were exported and burnt, should the economy not be as it is, it would be the seventh largest contributor to global emissions. If it were a country, it would be the seventh largest polluter. It is an enormous coal basin that cannot be opened up or we face the end of the Great Barrier Reef and our existence as we know it. 


We have massive plans for fracking. In Queensland alone there are up to 40,000 coal seam gas and unconventional gas wells that various multinationals and some domestic companies, with the full support of this government and, I might add, the opposition, want to sink on our best food-producing land. We have already seen the huge social toll that that industry is having on our regional communities. The shocking passing of Mr George Bender, just a few weeks ago, has really given voice to the desperation that those communities are feeling because nobody is listening to them. We visit and we hear them, but nobody in government is doing anything to protect their land, their livelihood, their water supply and the world's climate. I hope that we can change course in time.


There are some good news stories. I have mentioned that the Keystone Pipeline was rejected. We have a wonderful congregation and coalition of ordinary Australians who are uniting and calling for action on this threat of global warming and who can see that the science says, 'For heaven's sake, this is beyond question; let's get on with it.' Let's get that prosperity from a clean energy economy, which we know Australia is so well placed to take advantage of, which is job rich and which could be an enormous boon for us and would see us catch up to the rest of the world. We absolutely need that. 


Part of that, of course, is having strong targets and strong policy platforms. We Greens, at our national conference at the weekend, have just announced that we do not want to see the world stabilise at below two degrees. We want to see the world aim to stabilise global warming at no more than 1½ degrees because, sadly, in the briefings that I have had with quite a number of climate scientists in recent weeks, even a 1½ degree increase in global temperature means the demise of 90 per cent of the world's coral reefs. In Queensland the Great Barrier Reef is hugely central to our economy. It brings in $6 billion every year and employs more than 60,000 people. They are local jobs, jobs in those regional communities. They could be long-term jobs that bring in prosperity for us, for evermore, if we look after the reef.


We know that climate change is the biggest change to the reef, and yet we see these plans for pathetic targets that ignore the science. Every single coal mine or coal-seam gas application that passes the environment minister's desk, no matter which big party it is from, gets ticked off. We saw the attacks on the renewable energy target. We saw the carbon price repealed. We saw the former Prime Minister make an absolute buffoon of himself any time he tried to talk about climate. The current Prime Minister has tried to change the rhetoric but there has been no change in substance. Prime Minister Turnbull needs to increase our targets in the lead-up to the Paris conference. He needs to seriously commit to that global climate finance move. He needs to get out of the way of the reform of global fossil fuel subsidies. He needs to stop embarrassing Australians and prove that we can be the clean-energy economy of the future. (Time expired)

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (16:08):  it is so pleasure to contribute to this debate, notwithstanding the nature of the motion and proposal that has been put forward by the Australian Greens. It is so pleasure to reinforce to the chamber and others that Australia is a country that in climate change terms very clearly says what it will do and does what it promises and what it says. That has been the historical record of Australia's contribution to climate change policy at a global level. What we have consistently said is that we do our fair share and make a sound contribution and that, when we make those commitments, we deliver upon those commitments. That stands in stark contrast to much of the rest of the world in terms of the approach that is taken.


It is to the credit of Australian governments, that, over time, we have successfully set out clear targets for reductions and change in our climate change profile, in our emissions profile, and that we have delivered upon those reductions and changes in our emissions profile. We are a country that is playing our part in reducing global emissions, and we will continue to do so at very substantial levels, notwithstanding the claims and rhetoric of the Australian Greens. We are already delivering lower emissions in Australia and we will continue to do so under the Turnbull government. We have a very strong and credible track record historically of making sure that Australia not only meets its emissions target reductions but exceeds them. And I am confident that, in future, we will do so.


As we approach the Paris conference on climate change Australia is going into those discussions with not just a credible target but a very strong target and a very credible contribution to make. Australia is proposing a target for reduction of emissions of between 26 and 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. When we consider that on a per capita basis, it makes Australia's promised contribution the largest of any developed nation. Our emissions on a per capita basis will be some 52 per cent lower as a result of the commitments the Turnbull government is taking to the Paris conference.


Australia is actively and constructively engaging in these discussions because we want to make sure that we build on our track record of meeting and exceeding the commitments we made under the Kyoto protocol. We want to build on our commitment of being a country that will meet, and probably exceed, the commitments we made in terms of the 2020 reductions. Every time Australia has made a commitment on the world stage to reduce emissions as part of the Kyoto protocol, we have met it and exceeded it. To reduce emissions by 2020, we will meet it and we will likely exceed it. And we are now making commitments on a global level to the largest per capita reduction of any major developed economy. I am confident that we will again meet those commitments and we may well once again exceed those commitments because as a country we take our promises very seriously. We do not make promises that we cannot meet; we make promises that we are determined and confident we will meet.


The evidence is there that we are already achieving real and significant reductions in terms of Australia's emissions profile. Our Emissions Reduction Fund, which the Turnbull government is proud to be operating and continuing, had its first auction in April 2015. Some 47 million tonnes of emissions reduction was contracted at a price of $13.95 per tonne in that first auction. This, of course, was a significant improvement on the type of outcomes that had been achieved under the carbon tax and shows that we can reduce emissions in Australia at a much lower price than what Labor's carbon tax was doing. In fact, the price of emissions reduction under the Emissions Reduction Fund is around one per cent of the cost of emissions changes that were being achieved under Labor's carbon tax. It is a demonstration that there is a cost-effective way and that we can reduce emissions without increasing electricity prices for Australian families and without driving up the cost of electricity for Australian industry and rendering Australian businesses less competitive than our global competitors and damaging jobs and business investment opportunities Australians.


We are seeing strong support for the government's Emissions Reductions Fund. More than 500 projects are currently registered under the Emissions Reductions Fund. I am pleased to advise that the second auction under the fund was held on 4 and 5 November. The results are to be announced this Thursday, 12 November by the independent authority, the Clean Energy Regulator, who is responsible for administering the operations of the Emissions Reduction Fund. Very clearly, we have an effective, efficient policy that is working to help Australia meet its 2020 targets. We have strong targets for 2030 and we will be making sure that we deliver on those targets through the most cost-effective and efficient means in the future.


We are also providing over $15 billion in support for renewables and lower emissions by investing in cutting-edge technology and innovation in this space and a new Office of Climate Change and Renewables Innovation will bring a fresh focus to the role of innovation in supporting renewable and low-emissions technologies. It will bring together the Clean Energy Regulator, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Climate Change Authority under one umbrella to ensure that we have real focus and real leadership across government and to help drive the transformation in our economy. We are confident that Australia can be and will be a world leader in this space. We will be a world leader because we will deliver upon the world's largest per capita reduction in emissions among developed nations. In delivering upon that, we will see the type of innovation and investment continue across the Australia economy that can also assist the rest of the world in their adaptation and change.


We are proud of the record we have on renewable energy and on encouraging the development of our renewable energy agencies and systems in Australia. We are the parties which, under the Howard government, established the mandatory Renewable Energy Target in the first instance and sparked investment in innovation across this sector, particularly in solar. Australia has the highest proportion of households with solar panels in the world. About 15 per cent of Australian households have some form of solar system. The next largest is Belgium at around 7½ per cent and then Germany at 3.7 per cent. It is a clear demonstration of the strong take-up across Australia of various policies and incentives across various governments that have driven that investment in renewable energy and in solar panels. More than 2.4 million solar PV and hot water systems have been installed across Australia. This is a demonstration that the Australian public has adapted to and is adopting change. Under the changes that this government has put in place, the Renewable Energy Target will confidently now see more than 23½ per cent of Australia's electricity coming from renewable sources by 2020. It will mean a doubling of large-scale renewable energy over the next five years. Let us just reflect on that point again for a second: there will be a doubling of large-scale renewable energy in Australia over the next five years under the operation of the Renewable Energy Target.


The idea perpetrated by the Australian Greens that somehow this government and Australia are not doing enough is quite ridiculous. Australia has delivered upon strong commitments in the past, is taking strong commitments to Paris and will deliver upon those strong commitments in future. Australia has implemented and is implementing strong and effective policies that are efficient to ensure that we meet our emissions reductions targets, that we inspire and invest in innovative technologies in the future and that we transform the mix of Australia's energy sector, as well as other areas of emissions. Importantly, much of our investment is also going into new areas of technology—the opportunity of increasing energy efficiency and the opportunity of ensuring that we invest in soil carbon capture technologies. These are things that other countries around the world can take up and adopt as well.


In this debate, I look forward to hearing if those opposite in the Labor Party have different targets to the government. To date, all I have heard is silence when it comes to targets, while this government is committed to very strong targets. (Time expired)

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2015-11-10,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (16:18):  I rise to be part of this debate on this important urgency motion and to indicate that Labor will be supporting this motion. This motion very much goes to the heart of the fact that whilst, over the last month or so, we thought that things may change in relation to climate policy in this country, unfortunately, under Malcolm Turnbull, the new Prime Minister, they did not. We thought that policies would at least be brought back to the sensible centre when we talked about climate change and renewable energy. But, on both of those fronts, we are still left wanting.


There is not long to go—only about a month, if that—until the Paris summit. There is important work that needs to be done at that summit, and Australia needs to play a leadership role at that summit and, of course, for our region. Unfortunately, our Prime Minister so far has confirmed that he will not change the previous Prime Minister's emissions reduction targets, including his Direct Action policy, despite the overwhelming evidence that that policy will still see Australia's pollution levels rise and despite the fact that our new Prime Minister has, in the past, been on record—a number of times, in fact—saying that that particular policy, Direct Action, is indeed a farce. Since he has shown in the past that he does not really stand by this policy, is it really then the policy that he wants to take to Paris?


The Climate Institute has indicated that the government's 26 to 28 per cent emissions reduction target is consistent with global warming of three to four degrees. This is where the government cannot have it both ways. It cannot say that, as a country, it is committed to limiting global warming to no more than two degrees, along with its counterparts China, the US and the UK—and, in fact, all major economies around the world—and then not have a policy in place that delivers it. But that is currently what we have. We have a policy in place that will not deliver warming to no more than two degrees. Therein lies the conundrum for our new Prime Minister in the lead-up to Paris. As clear as day, something needs to happen, or he is walking away from that commitment of reducing warming to no more than two degrees.


The former head of the Climate Change Authority, Mr Bernie Fraser, has said that the government's climate action rhetoric has been very disappointing, particularly the Prime Minister's. He said:


He is just sticking with the status quo ... It's a pity his courage deserted him …


This is where we did think that our Prime Minister would show some courage, because we do know how he has described the current government policy on climate change in the past—as something of an environmental fig leaf, something of a farce, something of a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale. Well, I agree with him. Direct Action, the current government policy, the policy that was put in place by the previous Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, is a farce and a recipe for recklessness on a grand scale. That is why not one economist has come out and supported it. Now is the opportunity. Malcolm Turnbull was right then; he would still be right now if he stood by those words—which I hope he still does—and went ahead and changed our government's policy in the lead-up to Paris.


According to RepuTex, Australia's biggest polluters will increase their pollution levels by 20 per cent over the next 15 years without exceeding the baseline set by the government's safeguard mechanism. RepuTex has also confirmed this week that not one company will be required to reduce its pollution levels by this government's policy. That shows that this policy just does not work. That is why I urge our Prime Minister to make the change that he knows needs to happen to this policy because he himself has called it a farce. Labor is committed very much to addressing climate change. That is why we have already outlined our commitment to 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030.


Another factor in the lead-up to Paris is our contribution, or lack thereof, to the Green Climate Fund. I understand that our Minister for Foreign Affairs has, quite rightly, said:


Australia is seen as a pragmatic, constructive and results focused member of the Green Climate Fund.


It has been that way for some time. Unfortunately, we know that, under the Abbott government, that was not the case. In fact, our previous Prime Minister was dragged kicking and screaming to ensure our government made a contribution to that fund. Whilst it may be the case that we are seen as results focused, we do need to see results from Australia's involvement in co-chairing the Green Climate Fund. The OECD has calculated that about $62 billion a year has been committed, but that makes up a shortfall which is crucial for developing countries. Many of those developing countries are in our region, as close as Papua New Guinea, Kiribati and Bangladesh—all of those countries with the threat of sea level rises and the need for the support of climate finance through the Green Climate Fund. So another plea that I make to our new Prime Minister is that he actually does make a commitment to that fund, as happened under the previous Labor government, where we made a sizeable commitment at the beginning in the development of that fund. That is another commitment that he could make in the lead-up to and at the Paris summit.


The sea level rises in the Asia-Pacific are incredibly alarming. They have been outlined by the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in its most conservative terms, as a rise, on average, of about four millimetres per year, reaching 0.22 to 0.44 metres above 1990 levels by the period 2090 to 2099. What that means is that those low-lying coastal areas in South-East Asia and those small developing island states in the Pacific are incredibly vulnerable to storm surges, coastal erosion, flooding and inundation. That is why we need to show some leadership in our Asia-Pacific region by making a strong commitment to that climate fund. Furthermore, a one-metre rise in sea level over the next century would actually submerge many small island nations in the South Pacific such as the Solomon Islands, Micronesia, Palau, Tuvalu and Kiribati, and the Maldives in the Indian Ocean, most of which are just two metres above mean sea level. There are clearly threats for the future for our Asia-Pacific neighbours. Support is needed by Australia as an OECD country and we need to commit to the Green Climate Fund in the lead-up to Paris.


The Labor Party made significant investments in renewable energy, establishing, as we know, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, or ARENA, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Climate Change Authority. ARENA has invested some $1.1 billion and leveraged $1.7 billion in private investment in new and emerging renewable energy projects. So my third plea to our new Prime Minister is: do not abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and do not abolish ARENA. These are important agencies providing support, investment and a return to government in the renewable energy space. They were part of the climate change architecture created under the previous Labor government, at a time when we were, at some point—it was actually during Malcolm Turnbull's time as Leader of the Opposition—in a state of bipartisanship. I hope we get back to a state of bipartisanship, but that can only happen if this new-broom leader makes some commitment to ensuring that Australia lifts its game in renewable energy and lifts its game in climate change policy—because, at the moment, it is very, very far behind.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2015-11-10,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (16:28):  This government's climate denialism does my head in. The denialism is reflected in the pathetic pollution reduction targets, as just defended by Senator Birmingham. All the initiatives outlined by Senator Birmingham just do not add up to the level of commitment needed. The bottom line is that, even with all of these initiatives, we will continue in Australia to be the worst polluters in the world per head. This government's climate denialism is reflected by statements such as those by Senator Brandis in question time this afternoon, professing the government's love of coal. We cannot overestimate what the consequences of global warming of three or four degrees will be, and that is what these targets are consistent with. My colleague Senator Waters has outlined how inadequate these targets are and what the impacts of continued burning of coal, gas and oil are going to be.


It is not just the devastation of the natural environment; it is the economic and social impacts. If we think we have a refugee problem in the world now, think about when billions of people are going to be made homeless because they can no longer live and can no longer grow crops in river deltas around the world, in India, Bangladesh and Vietnam. Think of the people looking for a new home when water supplies dry up in India and Pakistan. Closer to home, think of how we are going to deal with the drying out of our rivers, and of the massive impacts that are already being felt on agriculture across the country. Think of the hundreds of thousands of people currently living around the coast in Australia who are going to have to move because of rises of metres of sea level. Right now, with just 0.85 degrees of warming, we have just had Australia's hottest month on record and the Victorian bushfire season has started dangerously early. Think of the deaths we are going to have to suffer because of heatwaves and completely unfightable bushfires.


The only way I can cope with thinking about this is to redouble my efforts to make sure it does not happen. We have to slash our carbon pollution globally to keep warming to under 1.5 degrees at the maximum, and if the science is saying that, to maintain a healthy and safe climate, we have to make even deeper cuts to our carbon pollution, then we are going to have to make that possible as well.


Unlike the fossil-fuel-loving members opposite, the Greens are facing the reality of global warming. We see it as an opportunity to transform our economy, our cities and our regions to create a healthier, more vibrant and thriving Australia. The good news, and what I want to focus on in my final two minutes, is that we have lots of low-hanging fruit that we can tackle to get us there, so that we can reshape our economy so that it is healthy, as well as safeguarding our future. If we had serious targets, then these initiatives would be planned and rolled out to help us meet them.


I want to focus on the opportunities of shifting our transport systems to zero carbon transport, because transport causes 16 per cent of Australia's carbon pollution, second only as a sector to electricity production. The shifts that we need to make to slash this pollution to zero would improve health and safety, improve our quality of life, clean up our cities, reduce congestion and provide better transport options in our regions. It means shifting how we get around—making many more trips by walking, cycling and public transport—and shifting to electric vehicles powered by 100 per cent renewable energy.


Today I want to focus on those vehicle trips and the potential for electric vehicle manufacture, of cars, trucks and public transport vehicles and their components, because they contain amazing opportunities for Australia. Just this afternoon, I introduced a private member's bill which focuses on electric vehicles being the future, and which would expand the Automotive Transformation Scheme to provide a pathway for local auto manufacturing to shift to the technologies and jobs of the future, redirecting existing funding to encourage investment in the manufacture of electric and other non-fossil-fuel vehicles.


Companies like Nissan Casting in Dandenong, who want to expand their production of high-tech components for electric vehicles, are crying out for government support. There are companies like Brighsun, and I was privileged to be at the launch of their electric buses just 10 days ago in Melbourne; they want to establish their world headquarters in Melbourne and to manufacture electric buses that can go 1,000 kilometres on one charge. These are the sorts of initiatives that we should be embracing. We have the potential to have Australian-made components in every electric car built here and around the world. We can transform our economy and tackle global warming at the same time. (Time expired)

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2015-11-10,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (16:33):  I, too, rise to speak against this urgency motion of the Greens which is supported by Labor. I would note that this is yet another example of the Greens' and Labor's hyperbole—in fact, rhetoric—and simple denial of the facts. What we hear is talk of plagues, pestilence, floods and droughts. But the fact is that this government's policies are working. Despite saying that they support this motion, the ALP still provides no credible alternative in any way.


As the minister has just said, this government does what it promises. We are the 12th-largest economy in the world and are responsible for only 1.5 per cent of global emissions. In fact, our emissions reduction target will see Australia reduce our emissions by up to 52 per cent per capita by 2030, which is the largest of any developed nation. Far from the denial of the facts by those opposite, this is a significant fact and it is something that is being delivered.


It is a bit sad that those opposite just cannot stand it when those of us on this side actually have credible environmental policies. This government's environmental policies demonstrably are working, without destroying our economy. This is in stark contrast to the previous ALP and Greens government. This government is ensuring that Australia pulls its weight on the international stage when it comes to mitigating the effects of climate change. We are doing it without increasing the cost to household electricity bills or destroying our currently transitioning economy. We are achieving real and significant emissions reductions at one per cent of the cost of Labor's and the Greens' carbon tax.


Let us have a look at this a bit further, because, under the carbon tax of Labor and the Greens, Australia would actually have experienced a rise in carbon emissions. I will say that again: under the previous government's policy, Australia was on track for an increase in carbon emissions, from 578 million tonnes to 621 million tonnes by 2020. The sheer stupidity of all of this is that the previous government's increase in emissions would have come at a cost to our economy of at least $9 billion—$9 billion to actually increase carbon emissions in this country.


Coupled with the carbon tax debacle were the previous governments other many flip-flops and failures in actually implementing environmental policy. Let us remember: they scrapped solar projects; they botched the integration of renewable energy into the grid; they wasted millions of dollars on stop-start funding for so-called green initiatives before they even got off the ground.


In complete contrast, this government is successfully implementing sensible and sustainable environmental policies which demonstrably are making a difference. Our emissions reduction target, as I have said, is 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. It is credible and it is achievable, and it is also working. With this target, the government is actively engaging in international negotiations on climate change—in particular, at the forthcoming 2015 Paris conference in December. This government's practical and realistic climate change policies and emissions reduction target are actually working. Direct Action—'action' means actually doing something and not just planning and implementing failed and botched programs.


What does this mean for Australia. At a fraction of the cost of Labor's carbon tax, we secured Australia's largest emissions reduction commitment ever in the first Emissions Reduction Fund auction, in April 2015. We contracted 47 million tonnes of reduced emissions, at $13.95 a tonne. This was backed by Australian businesses. There are now more than 500 projects currently registered under the Emissions Reduction Fund and we expect this success to continue. The second Emissions Reduction Fund auction was held last week, and the government is looking forward to the announcement shortly by the Clean Energy Regulator of the results. But I am absolutely confident that they will be just as successful as the first round, if not more so.


This is proving to be one of the most effective systems in the world for actually reducing emissions. Other countries—so it is not just us—are looking to what we are doing and are now implementing Direct Action style approaches to reduce emissions, based on our example. In fact, the World Bank—not some dodgy organisation but the World Bank itself—recently launched a $100 million reverse auction that is similar to this government's Emissions Reductions Fund setup.


This policy has been the coalition's position for five years. We have been consistent and firmly resolute in what we think will work for this country. Contrast that with those opposite. The previous government has had five different policies in a little under five years. The Leader of the Opposition now cannot make up his mind. First, he promised to abolish the carbon tax. Then he voted to keep it. Now he wants to bring it back and see electricity prices and the cost of living again skyrocket for no discernible benefit to the environment and to carbon emissions.


Even worse, I am sorry to say, is the policy of the Greens. Without any thought for how it would actually work in the real world and be implementable, they want emissions reductions of 60 to 80 per cent by 2030. I cannot believe that this could possibly be achieved or is even remotely realistic, and we have yet to see any plans on how this would actually be implemented. This afternoon in this chamber with the debate on the blocking of the Carmichael mine we heard another example of this ideological blindness. The practical implication of this is that India in the foreseeable future so desperately needs coal-fired power plants to help millions of its people to get out of poverty. By blocking this mine, with our much cleaner coal, India will be forced to go to other nations to get significantly dirtier coal that will produce higher emissions and greater pollution in a country that desperately needs less of both. Again, it is just simply madness.


Their extraordinary record on coal is no better than their record on policies for carbon reduction. Between the two of them, Labor and the Greens paid $5.5 billion to brown coal generators and did not impose any obligations to reduce emissions. I will repeat that, because it is quite extraordinary: they paid $5.5 billion to Australian brown coal generators without imposing any obligation to reduce emissions. It is unfathomable policy.


Compare this mind-boggling track record with our record in government. Our Direct Action policies—as in 'action', which is actually doing something that is working—are ensuring we reduce emissions without increasing the cost of living for ordinary Australians. We are providing $15 billion in support for renewable energy and other innovative technologies to lower emissions, and we are doing it without imposing a carbon tax or imposing significant and unnecessary burdens on our economy.


We are establishing the Office of Climate Change and Renewables Innovation to bring a new focus to the role of innovation in the future of environmental energy technology. I am also pleased to note that the new Office of Climate Change and Renewables Innovation will streamline existing agencies to deliver more efficient government support to renewable energy.


Australia has a strong and very proud record on renewable energy, and this government remains committed to improving on it. We are supporting Australian households to reduce their electricity bills by investing in rooftop solar energy. In fact, Australia today has the highest proportion of households with rooftop solar panels, at about 15 per cent. To put that in context, one of the world leaders in solar panel production, Germany, has about 3.7 per cent only.


This government has a policy that is actually working. As much as it pains those on the other side to acknowledge it, this government does actually have effective environmental and climate change policies. The facts are very clear—we do. In contrast, Labor's plan has been costed at $85 billion— (Time expired)

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2015-11-10,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales) (16:43):  I rise to support the motion. I do so at a time when it is more important than ever that we consider Australia's role in the global fight to contain global warming to less than two degrees. In just a few weeks, parties from all over the world will congregate in Paris. The goal, of course, is to obtain commitments from all countries, for the first time, to reduce their emissions and ensure that we can keep the global temperature at a safe level.


In this country, unhappily, the debate has not been helped by those opposite. It concerns me greatly when I look at the actions that the government is taking, or failing to take, as we approach this very important meeting. All developed countries intended this year to submit their targets for this conference. Australia was the last of the major developed nations to put forward its target.


The government has now said that we will reduce emissions by at least 26 to 28 per cent by 2030 from 2005 levels. Unfortunately, this initial target probably does not help us meet the goals that we need to meet at this meeting. The Climate Institute has indicated that if others took the same approach and took on the same share that we have chosen to take on then we would be locked in to three to four degrees of global warming. This is completely unacceptable. It is unacceptable that we would contemplate playing a role in a global agreement that undermines our ability to reach the two per cent target. It is unacceptable that in putting forward this target, instead of standing at the front and leading—as it is in our interests to do and is our responsibility to do—we have chosen to stand at the back of the pack.


The other thing that concerns me greatly, as we consider the government's approach to this issue, is the policy mechanism, which Senator Reynolds has been discussing. Direct Action has been out there for six years, and every expert and stakeholder group who has looked at this policy has confirmed that it will not achieve meaningful reductions in carbon pollution. AiG have predicted that if the government's emissions reduction target were delivered solely through budget spending, as this policy demands, it would cost between $100 billion and $250 billion. According to RepuTex, Australia's biggest polluters will increase their pollution levels by 20 per cent over the next 15 years without exceeding the completely inadequate baselines that are set by the government's so-called 'safeguard mechanism' under Direct Action.


What really surprises me is that with the change of leader, the change of Prime Minister, the government has confirmed that it is sticking with this approach. Mr Turnbull, the Prime Minister, has previously indicated his contempt for the policy settings that I have just spoken about. Yet, just in the last few weeks, he has confirmed his intention to push forward with them, saying:


The policy we have in place is very clearly costed and calibrated … and it is effecting reductions in emissions now and at a very low cost.


It is disappointing—isn't it?—but it is really not hard to see why, because when you look at the rest of the people in his party room, they are simply not on the same page. If we look at someone like Barnaby Joyce, as recently as 2012 he said:


It is an indulgent and irrelevant debate because, even if climate change turns out to exist one day, we will have absolutely no impact on it whatsoever … we really should have bigger fish to fry than this one …


In fact, this year he said:


Look … I just—I'm always sceptical of the idea that the way that anybody's going to change the climate—and I'm driving in this morning and we're driving through a frost—is with bureaucrats and taxes.


We have a group of people in the coalition who fundamentally do not accept the science, who do not accept the role of humans in changing the climate and who are fundamentally unwilling to take the necessary steps for Australia to contribute to a meaningful global contribution to fix this problem.


The Prime Minister, in fact, knows that this is wrong. In 2009 he famously penned the words that 'Abbott's climate change policy is …'—and we all know how the rest of that quote finishes. He also said:


The Liberal Party is currently led by people whose conviction on climate change is that it is ""crap"" and you don't need to do anything about it. Any policy that is announced will simply be a con, an environmental figleaf to cover a determination to do nothing.


He went on to say:


First, let's get this straight. You cannot cut emissions without a cost.


   …   …   …


Somebody has to pay.


That is true. You cannot cut emissions without a cost. The way that the government has resolved this challenge is that, instead of asking polluters to pay, they have asked ordinary people to pay. They have asked taxpayers to cough up billions of dollars to fix a most serious problem and, unfortunately, to craft a solution that simply will not deliver. 


It is tempting to cast this as simply a question of our global responsibilities, and there is no doubt that we have very real responsibilities, particularly to our Pacific neighbours, as Senator Singh pointed out. However, even if we think only of our own self-interest, there are powerful reasons for Australia to act. We are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Warming of two degrees or more will induce significant loss of species, including those much loved species on the Great Barrier Reef that provide so much pleasure to so many Australians and provide a tourism industry and an income to many, many people in Northern Queensland. Warming of two degrees or more would produce dangerous water shortages. It would produce severe damage to coastal infrastructure and settlements. It would lead to large areas of agricultural land being taken out of production and to major risks to human life from extreme climate events.


Before I came to this place, my work in the infrastructure sector led me to have a lot of contact with those parts of Australian business that are running transport infrastructure, water infrastructure and electricity infrastructure. All of those businesses are currently making plans to deal with climate change, and when they look at what the costs of climate change will be to their business, they are not insignificant. They are particularly significant when you start to think about the impact of the increasing frequency and severity of severe weather events. If you think back to Cyclone Yasi and the floods in Victoria, the cumulative Commonwealth bill for that was $6.6 billion. Infrastructure deficits are already a problem for this country. Infrastructure that is adequate to cope with significant levels of global warming will be enormously expensive, and we need to be thinking in a very clear way about the costs to all of us if Australia goes down a path where we fail to address and halt global warming.


My concern also lies with our failure to capture the economic opportunities that will present as the globe decarbonises. We are falling behind. Investment in large-scale renewable energy fell by 88 per cent in 2014, despite the fact that, globally, clean energy investments grew by 17 per cent. This is totally unacceptable. Climate change will not be the only course of economic change for our country in the next decades. It is true that any change is difficult and produces costs and challenges for some communities. We need to confront those head-on, and we need to consider that there are very real risks to leaving change to the last minute. Rapid change is very hard for communities to deal with and leaving things to the last minute presents the very real risk that we will fail to capture the upside and will fail to get involved in the industries that might provide our people with good jobs, well-paid jobs, jobs that are connected to global markets in the energy sector, and we need to act on that now and not leave it to the last minute.


I want to talk about our approach. Labor in government will put a legal cap on carbon pollution. In fact, we will put on exactly the kind of price cap that was previously advocated by the Prime Minister before he decided to get on board with the fairly backward views of his colleagues on this question. We will increase the share of renewable energy in our electricity mix to 50 per cent by 2030 and we will work to create the jobs of the future through an electricity modernisation plan. We are moving into a very important period in terms of obtaining a global deal. Now is the time for Australia to be in the lead, not lag behind. I urge the government to change its approach.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (16:53):  I dedicate this speech to John Davis. John tragically died in a helicopter accident in the Hunter a few days ago. John was a passionate advocate about renewable energy and having action on climate change. His website with David Sentinella is called www.energy-without-carbon.org. It has always been a valuable asset. When I looked at it today, I felt that in many ways it is a memorial to him. In time I hope it will be continued, because it is full of information: politics, science and why this issue needs to be dealt with and dealt with urgently.


John would have been so pleased with this motion. Indeed, he would have been very proud that the Greens are nailing it and that we are taking it up to Mr Turnbull, a Prime Minister who came in making out that he was here to give leadership. How fundamentally he has failed. This is something that I know worried John, like it worries a lot of people. All we are seeing from the new Prime Minister is that he is following in the footsteps of the previous Prime Minister on this issue and is failing to step up at such a critical time. John would have been so proud of Senator Larissa Waters' passionate and informative speech when she opened this debate. John was very proud of the Greens MPs, and this is something that I know would have meant a great deal to him.


What drove John was his work for future generations. He knew that we have to deal with climate change now. We have heard many people speak about what is happening in the Pacific, but he also had an eye on the future and recognised how very urgent this is. He brought so much expertise to this work. He had been a maths and science teacher, a chemical engineer and a filmmaker. He made thousands of educational videos. He had worked with the ABC. He brought so much talent to the new period in his life when he was adding his energy and commitment to this most important campaign that humanity is dealing with at this very moment. I send my condolences to his partner, Felicity, and his family and friends.


Again, I want to give emphasise in this speech to the wonderful website that really encapsulates his work: www.energy-without-carbon.org. I remember that, when I first saw it, I thought he had come up with a wonderful slogan. In the past months he had been working on a new film about renewable energy and the campaign around global warming. He interviewed many of us for that and I very much hope that it will be finished. He had a Twitter account. These days when somebody dies, there are ways to look at what they left, and you can do that quite quickly. I want to share with you one of John's Tweets. To my mind it is clever and amusing, but it also sums up what we are dealing with now. The Tweet said: 'Let the fossils rest in peace. Only dinosaurs dig fossils.' Sometimes Tweets really capture it, and in many ways the speeches in support of the important motion we are dealing with here today are summed up by that very important Tweet that John sent out to the world.


John had been a Greens candidate in the seat of Davidson in the 2011 state election, picking up 12.5 per cent of the vote. John used all of those means—making films, Tweeting, his website and speaking to people—to take up the urgent issues around climate change. When he spoke he identified the key role that government has in driving change. I remember talking to him about this. He linked the role of government with the urgency of driving the transition to a clean energy economy. Clean energy was the essence of what John spoke about time and time again. This is one quote from his website:


... business does not have any pressure to look after common property, or the long term future. Issues such as health, environment, or a society's culture need to be protected by government on behalf of society.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (17:06):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



This Bill will implement the Government's 2015 Budget measure that will provide more generous and consistent support for families with dependent young people who qualify for certain youth income support payments.


From 1 January 2016, this will include removing the family assets test and the family actual means test from the Youth Allowance parental means test arrangements. This will result in a more consistent level of support for families, as young people move from Family Tax Benefit Part A to an individual income support payment. The parental income test exemptions for Youth Allowance will also be aligned with existing arrangements for Family Tax Benefit Part A.


Also from 1 January 2016, maintenance income will be removed from the Youth Allowance parental income test assessment. From 1 January 2017, a separate maintenance income test for the treatment of child support will be applied, like the test that currently applies to Family Tax Benefit Part A.


The last component of this Budget measure will apply from 1 July 2016 to families that have dependent children receiving individual youth payments that are parentally income-tested, and also younger dependent siblings. In those circumstances, the 'family pool' for the youth parental income test will include a notional maximum rate of Family Tax Benefit Part A for all of the children for whom the parents have financial responsibility. This will result in a lower rate of reduction to the dependent child's Youth Allowance than is currently the case.


With a financial commitment from the Government of $262.7 million over the forward estimates, this Bill will bring extra support to families as their children move into young adulthood—particularly rural and regional families whose children continue to study beyond Year 12.


Removing the family assets test for Youth Allowance will allow around 4,100 additional dependent Youth Allowance claimants to qualify for the first time, accessing average annual payments of more than $7,000 a year.


Removing the family actual means test will see around 1,200 more people receiving Youth Allowance for the first time, as well as increasing payments for around 4,860 existing students by approximately $2,000 a year.


The changes mean farming families will not have farm assets counted toward the means test for their dependent children claiming Youth Allowance.


Including all FTB children in the family pool for the youth parental income test will allow around 13,700 families, with dependent children in both the Family Tax Benefit Part A and youth systems, to become eligible for an average increase in payment of around $1,100 a year. Around 5,800 families, who currently miss out on payments due to the combined high taper rates, will also become eligible for an average payment of around $1,300 a year. 


The changes will reduce the significant regulatory burden on around 30,000 families subject to the family actual means test and around 200,000 families subject to the family assets test.


These measures were adopted following an examination of issues by an Interdepartmental Committee on Access to Higher Education for Regional and Remote Students at the urging of Senator Bridget McKenzie and her backbench colleagues, who have been pressing us to do more to improve access to education for regional and remote students.


Removing complex and unnecessary means tests and improving the operation of the parental income test is a good first step in responding to concerns over parental means testing and the level of student assistance available, which were identified in the Interdepartmental Committee's interim advice.


Senator Bridget McKenzie has just completed a series of Regional Higher Education Forums to discuss access to higher education, the IDC's Interim Advice and the 2015-16 Budget. Feedback from the forums will provide useful input into the Final Report of the Interdepartmental Committee that is due in November 2015.


This Bill is boosting assistance for working families, and better supporting young people into study to build their careers, develop economic opportunities and contribute to our economy.


Debate adjourned.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (19:20):  Yesterday, I had the great privilege of attending, with Deborra-lee Furness and the team at Adopt Change, led by Jane Hunt, the launch of National Adoption Awareness Week 2015. National Adoption Awareness Week was founded by Deborra-Lee Furness in 2008 and is designed to raise awareness of adoption and provide education on the support needs of children and families. This offers real encouragement to the thousands of Australian families who are ready, willing and able to embrace those children in need and give them a stable home. 


I would like to acknowledge the great work that Adopt Change do in this space. In August, Adopt Change released the Modern families: attitudes and perceptions of adoption in Australia research report, which provided information that showed there is an overwhelming sense from the community that Australia can be doing more for adoption. People want to see the red tape removed that currently makes it so hard to adopt. More than that, what they want to see is some of the entrenched attitudes against adoption, in parts of the system, removed and overcome, for the sake of vulnerable kids. There are statistics that make it very clear that this is an issue, like the 15,000 children in Australia that have been in out-of-home care for more than two years and are not with a relative, or the fact that, on average, a child in out-of-home care will be moved between six different families. It is not stable long-term, and Adopt Change is working to bring more awareness to this issue and to really help these children.


Earlier in the year, Senator Jo Lindgren and I called on the federal government to work with the states to make adoption reform a high priority. There are many other senators and members in this place who will want to join us in this push. I note the public comments of Andrew Hastie as one of a number in recent times who is joining in this significant and important push. I know there is great support in this place as well, and, in coming days in this place, I look forward to bringing forward a motion to this effect. 


This is in many ways a national tragedy. Unfortunately, we see far too many children in a situation where they do not get the kind of stability they deserve. I want to reflect on the statistics for a moment: 15,000 children have been in out-of-home care for more than two years and are not with a relative. Those are children who the courts have deemed are unable to return to their birth families, for various reasons. Usually it is because of serious dysfunction. There is an inability, for whatever reason, of the parents to look after these children. There is sometimes the most serious neglect and the most serious abuse. 


The fundamental problem at the moment is that, whilst in some cases the courts and others are acting to take kids out of these abusive and neglectful situations, I believe that, through our system, through having such a strong bias against adoption in this country, we are re-traumatising these kids. We do not give them the stability they deserve, when there are families who wish to adopt and who are capable of adopting. We see these children move again and again. Think about the trauma that causes. Think about what that does to a young child's brain development. Then we see some children ending up in residential care. They are seen as the hardest cases. I believe no case is hopeless, but they are the kids who we end up spending the most money on, and sometimes, unfortunately, without success in giving them the kinds of life opportunities that we would hope for—that I want for my children, that we would all want for children everywhere. 


The work that has been done this week and more broadly by Adopt Change is critical in shaping policies. The community is with us on this. The statistics show that the community wants change. But, unfortunately, there are aspects of the bureaucracy, aspects of the political class, who are anti-adoption and therefore are denying these children their God-given right to stability and to a safe, nurturing and loving family home. I commend the work of Adopt Change. I think there should be much more awareness and much more said about this issue.
