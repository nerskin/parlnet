Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (12:31):  It is a delight to be able to contribute to the debate on the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Bill 2017. Like many of those who have spoken on the debate already, it is important to start off by pointing out that the reforms we're debating here that are included in this legislation are indeed landmark reforms, not only in respect of the changes that they make to the legislative regime that applies to this part of the economy and to this form of communication, but also the fact—and I think this is more important—that they have the unanimous support of the Australian media industry. That in itself is a massive achievement. I have to commend the Minister for Communications, Senator Fifield, for his amazing efforts in being able to secure this agreement and support right across industry. Without that, these reforms would not be the landmark set of reforms that they are.


In debating this, we have to recognise that the Australian media landscape has indeed changed significantly over recent years, and also over the longer term as well. It's important that regulation that was designed for a specific set of circumstances and a specific type of technology that was available at the time keeps pace with the technology that has evolved since laws were put into place. The rules, the laws and the regulations need to be dynamic, like the technology available to the media sector itself is.


The important point, going back to the ability to achieve consensus in the industry on this legislation, is the fact that the government has been listening and has undertaken extensive consultation with industry and the community in preparing this legislation. I think that is an excellent example to be set in terms of how to bring about landmark reforms. The fact that we have listened means we do now have a package that will genuinely modernise regulation for this industry. As I've stated, given that technology has changed and, therefore, the laws need to now reflect that, it's important that, looking forward, we ensure we have legislation that is able to keep up with changes into the future. This is not a static thing; it's a case of being able to manage the dynamic environment, the changing environment, and the changing technologies in this sector into the future. We can't just make laws for now; they have to be futureproofed as well.


Turning to the elements of the package of legislation in the broader media reforms, these are the abolition of broadcasting licence fees for TV and radio, the introduction of spectrum use pricing, the ban on gambling advertising during sports broadcasts and children's shows, the anti-siphoning amendments scheme and list, the review of the Australian and children's content, and the $30 million fund for broadcasting women's and niche sports, which I was delighted to hear Senator Macdonald speak at length about just yesterday. He spoke about the importance of investing in both of those areas to develop both women's sports and niche sports, which don't receive the media attention they otherwise could. That is an exceptionally important part of this entire package.


This bill goes to abolishing two of the five media cross-ownership rules and providing stronger local content protections for regional TV. Australia's media cross-ownership and control rules date back to the 1980s, a period when many great things occurred—including my birth!—but they haven't been substantially updated since 2006. That is why this piece of legislation today is so important. The laws as they stand, unamended, reflect the historic media environment, the traditional mediums and platforms available to media—TV, radio and print media—which of course are still important; no-one can deny that. But the laws as they stand today don't reflect the current environment, which now encompasses a great many more technologies in the way of social media, internet and the like. So we need to take stock of that and, again, this is why this legislation is so important.


We've seen massive changes in the ways Australians access information. The online world is where most people seem to turn to access their news, and social media is a significant part of that. Even many in this chamber would turn to Facebook and Twitter for breaking news rather than the TV and radio of days gone by, because it is more instantaneous, it is unfiltered and it is direct. That is a reality we have to accept, and that's why the amendments being proposed are important.


The challenges that face traditional media and how revenue is generated on audience shares is placing a burden on traditional media, which is leading to an uncompetitive situation. The ways in which our traditional providers of media operate and use of the existing platforms in this field do need updating so that they can remain competitive with these new and emerging technologies that are competing with traditional forms of media. A little bit later on I will come to the importance of these traditional mediums to regional Australia. Most of Tasmania is considered to be regional—almost its entirety. That's why they're important to my home state of Tasmania. Another reason it's important that this bill is passed is that it ensures that Australian media companies can compete against global media giants and maintain the local jobs, which is of particular importance, especially when you look at some of the smaller entities around Australia, and so that these companies can continue to provide the local content—again, something I will touch on in more detail when reflecting on the importance of local media to regional communities.


This bill will, as is the government's intention, strengthen regional local content requirements to ensure that communities continue to have access to local news and content that is relevant to their communities and to their lives and to ensure that the information they're receiving actually does provide some benefit to their daily lives. That's something regional media has been able to do over many years and will, under these laws, continue to be able to do. It's important, though, that we do strengthen the operating environment for regional broadcasters to uphold the regional content requirements, and, as I said, the bill before us is something that goes a long way to doing just that.


Turning to the media ownership and control rules and the current situation, we currently have five rules in place that limit the control of commercial broadcasting, being TV, radio and newspapers. These rules are somewhat outdated and don't reflect, as I've said before, the contemporary digital media environment which we now operate in. All of us have these great things, these smartphones and tablets, which provide us with so much more information. But the rules, while they need changing, also need to ensure that the traditional forms of media are protected and supported as well.


The rules as they stand, though, were developed in an analog environment that was dominated by only three platforms, as I've mentioned—free-to-air TV, free-to-air radio, and print. This was a time before smart TVs, internet radio and the technology of smartphones and tablets. The current control regime and the ownership rules regulate only those three platforms and are based on geographical areas, boundaries that have since been broken with the advent of the internet and the many other channels used to distribute and access online content. 


The bill will repeal two of the five current rules, the 75 per cent audience reach rule and the two-out-of-three cross-media control rule. The 75 per cent reach rule applies to TV and prevents a person, either in their own right or as a director of one or more companies, from exercising control of commercial TV broadcasting licences whose combined licence area exceeds 75 per cent of the population of Australia. The rule was first introduced in 1987 as a 60 per cent rule and later increased in 1995 to a 75 per cent rule, obviously to reflect the changes at that time. 


As at October of last year, the figures for combined audiences were as follows: Channel 7 covered 74.51 per cent of the population; Channel 9, 73.96 per cent; and Channel 10, 67.31 per cent. For regional networks, which are generally affiliated with these larger metropolitan counterparts, the audience coverage in 2014 was, for the Prime network, 24.33 per cent; WIN Network, 25.15 per cent; and Southern Cross, 34.11 per cent. Tasmania, my home state, is covered by the WIN Network and Southern Cross, which I have to say do an excellent job of providing very relevant local content in their news bulletins and other programming as well. 


The rule has the practical effect of preventing mergers between any of the metropolitan networks, being Seven, Nine or Ten, and any of the regional networks, being Prime, WIN and Southern Cross. Any merger under the current arrangements would substantially exceed the 75 per cent rule, and the rule as it stands does little to support media diversity, as regional viewers—those who live outside of our metropolitan areas—essentially receive the same commercial TV programming as their metropolitan brothers and sisters due to the affiliation or content supply agreements. 


In the changing media landscape, with broadband internet and the proliferation of tablets, smartphones and other devices, the rule is largely redundant. The ABC and SBS now are streaming their channels online to 100 per cent of the population, if they choose to access it, right across the country, including into regional markets where metropolitan networks don't currently broadcast other than through affiliates. The repeal of this rule would remove one burden on broadcasters, allowing consolidation and change in affiliation and ownerships, making such changes to relevant competition laws, as with most other industries. It would provide broadcasters the opportunity to build operations on a greater scale and compete in an environment where audiences can already access premium content online. 


Going to the two-out-of-three cross-media rule, the rule provides that mergers can't involve more than two of the three regulated platforms of TV, radio and newspapers in any commercial radio licence area. This rule tightly regulates just TV, radio and newspapers and doesn't take into consideration the changing media landscape and the substantial online media offerings we have today, including the alternative news sources that exist. We're also seeing traditional providers now moving into these more modern platforms. A lot of our newspapers run things through social media newsfeeds and the like. They are doing their best under the current arrangements to compete, but it is important that we do support this legislation to give a truly level playing field. This rule is not suited to a contemporary media environment and it does restrict the diversity of content offered to consumers. It was introduced in 2006, which is 11 years ago, and we have to reflect on the technology we had back then versus the technology we have now. Smartphones, tablets et cetera were all in very juvenile stages of development and not as widely available to every man, woman and child as they are today. 


There are three rules to remain. Firstly, the five-four rule applies to TV and radio and is known as the minimum voices rule. It is a requirement that at least five independent media operations or media groups are present in mainland state capital cities, and at least four must be present in regional commercial radio licence areas. Secondly, the one-to-a-market rule specifies that a person must not control more than one commercial TV broadcasting licence in a licence area. Finally, the two-to-a-market rule specifies that a person must not control more than two commercial radio broadcasting licences in the same licence area. 


It is important to also point out that these specific broadcasting requirements, mergers and acquisitions in the media sector are subject to the general prohibition of anticompetitive acquisitions outlined in the Competition and Consumer Act 2010. So we can see that this sector is highly regulated—there are rules everywhere. The point is that these rules are to remain dynamic, to remain relevant and to foster growth in this area, to ensure that our media industry is operating at optimum levels in a competitive way, ensuring that all audiences—regional and metropolitan—get the content they are after. The operating environment for free-to-air commercial TV and radio broadcasters has changed substantially and is expected to continue to do so over the next five to 10 years, and I suspect well beyond that as well. The current rules on control and ownership constrain the ability of Australian media outlets to change the structure of their businesses and to respond to changes in the media environment. That's not okay in 2017. The sad reality is that that does have an impact on jobs. 


In the time remaining to me, I will briefly turn to the matter of regional content, which is an important issue; it is close to my heart. As I said before, Tasmania is almost entirely a regional community, perhaps with the exception of Hobart. Online media services do provide a useful product for consumers, but they are no substitute for local broadcasters. Australia is a very vast country, with many, many diverse and disparate communities across its land, and Tasmania is no exception to that. We are small geographically, but we are broken up into many subregions: the north-west; the west coast, which is an entirely different community with different news needs and different activities taking place; the north-east, which is within a couple of hundred kilometres of the population centre of Launceston but, again, a very different community with different needs when it comes to news and current affairs; and then, heading south, within the Hobart region, there is the Derwent Valley, the Huon Valley, the south-east and the east coast. All these areas have their own unique communities and a requirement for specific news in each of those communities.


The local broadcasters that we have—be it our TV broadcasters in Southern Cross, WIN or indeed the government broadcasters, being the ABC predominantly, and also the radio networks and print media—do a great job of providing tailored local content, which is so important for local communities. Indeed, in times of natural disaster and emergencies, it is the local TV and radio that really do assist these small communities. Again, being close to one another doesn't mean they are the same communities. The Derwent Valley, a half-hour to 40-minute drive from Hobart, may be subject to emergency warnings that Hobart is not. That's why it's important that we do have regional content available through our local broadcasters.


Of course, local programming supports much-needed jobs in regional communities. This is also through advertising through our commercial broadcasters. It's amazing when travelling around the state of Tasmania—going into any workplace and hearing the local radio station blaring in the workshop, bakery or news agency. Local businesses advertise on local radio. It provides local jobs; it supports local jobs. That's why it's important. Local programming may be at risk where regional broadcasters merge operations and there are strong expectations of cost savings. You end up with syndicated content, which is not good because that is not what these small local communities are after.


It was disappointing to reflect on one of the iterations of the committee report a Senate inquiry has done into this legislation and note the dissenting comments of opposition and Greens senators to this, because it really shows that they don't have an understanding of what regional communities require when it comes to media, when it comes to local content and, indeed, as I've just demonstrated, when it comes to local jobs. I think it is incumbent upon senators in this place—opposition, Greens and anyone else—to support the measures contained in this bill: to support the Australian media to catch up with the 21st century, to ensure we have the best regulatory regime that we possibly can and, most importantly, to support regional communities and regional content and those who produce it to make sure our regional communities are not left out because of the inner-city Labor and Green people in this place.

Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (12:51):  I rise to support the government's changes to the media laws—with some amendments that we proudly recommended, such as guaranteed funding for community radio. I speak today as probably the person in this chamber with the most experience working in the media and the most inside information about the media. 


I spent more than 55 years as a working journo before I 'jumped the shark', as they say, and ended up at this place. I worked in all forms of media: newspapers, magazines, radio, television and online media websites. I have been a cub reporter, a foreign correspondent, a Sydney newspaper editor, a TV current affairs host on free-to-air and pay TV, a radio current affairs host and an internet website blogger. Let me give the Labor Party media experts and some crossbenchers some personal statistics—and not the one about being sacked 16 times!


I started out as a cadet reporter on a small town daily newspaper across the ditch in New Zealand—TheTaranaki Herald, circulation 11,000. It was the oldest daily newspaper in New Zealand. It started in 1852. I say 'was' because it closed in 1989. I then worked on the Christchurch Star. It was first published in 1868, and it stopped publishing in 1991. I then worked for the WaikatoTimes in Hamilton, New Zealand. It started in 1872 and six years ago changed from being an afternoon paper to a morning paper. It's really struggling now, having just been bought by Fairfax. Speaking of Fairfax, I crossed the ditch on the MV Wanganella in 1963 and got a job as a police reporter on the Sydney Sun. I worked there for several years before going to New York as a foreign correspondent and returned in 1975 to become editor in 1976.


The Sydney Sun no longer exists. Neither does our bitter rival, Rupert Murdoch's Daily Mirror. All those papers have gone. All have closed down. This is the media fact that I want to ram home. They couldn't all have closed down just because I worked on them! The Fairfax papers, TheSydney Morning Herald and The Age, are being circled by bottom-feeding sharks. Their print editions could cease any time—maybe even by the end of this year. That New York landmark the Daily Newswasimmortalised in Guys and Dolls—'What's in the Daily News? I'll tell you what's in the Daily News.' I'll tell you what's in the Daily News. It was sold to the Chicago Tribune last week for $1.


I had the HINCH program on the Ten Network. That network has been in receivership and has now been sold—it hasn't gone through yet. It has been bought by CBS, a foreign corporation. That's why I ask: are you getting the drift? Are the senators getting the drift? That is why I say to any crossbenchers who oppose the relaxation of draconian, Neanderthal, out-of-date media laws—including the two-out-of-three rule and including the 75 per cent reach—that you have rocks in your head, and the Labor Party, too. Labor's shadow minister for communications, Michelle Rowland, has said that the planned relaxation of the laws 'threatens media diversity'. She said: 


Labor opposes removing the two out of three rule because it would achieve very little at potentially great cost - further media consolidation and a reduction in the diversity of voices across the media landscape.


Well, the two-out-of-three rule prevents media companies from owning a TV network, a radio station and a newspaper in the same market. That's what they're perpetuating. Ms Rowland also said that Labor does believe that the pragmatic course of action—one of them—at this time is to repeal the 75 per cent reach rule, and that is good news. She said that this would ensure that local content is bolstered following a trigger event and provide immediate licence fee relief to the commercial broadcasters. But her claim that removing the two-out-of-three rule threatens media diversity is patently wrong—Noddy Land! If we do nothing, if we play ostrich here in this house, with our heads in the sand, that is what will threaten media diversity.


I remember the days when the morning paper, especially on Wednesdays and Saturdays, weighed a tonne. Those were the days of the fabulous rivers of gold from classified advertising that made the fortunes of the Packers, the Fairfaxes and the Murdochs. But I believe that the shift of audience—and, more importantly, the advertising—to multinational giants, such as Google and Facebook, with all their tax dodging as well, threatens the very existence of newspapers and the viability of free-to-air and subscription television.


Scrapping the two-out-of-three rule will allow Australian media companies to compete on a more level playing field with global challenges. The Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, said that the sale of the Ten Network to CBS actually showed that change to the media laws are no longer necessary. Well, in my view, the sale of Channel Ten to CBS means an even more urgent need for a review of media laws. The way it stands at the moment, the way it stood when CBS got in and ambushed Lachlan Murdoch and Bruce Gordon—but leaving them out of it for a minute—no other Australians could have a level playing field and a chance to compete against CBS.


I believe all of this should have happened years ago. And I agreed with communications minister Mitch Fifield when he said awhile back that a few facts have escaped some of the knockers in the other place and in the Senate. He said that, No. 1, Kylie Minogue does not live on Ramsay Street anymore, and, No. 2, the internet does exist. He said that it is very important that our media laws reflect the second of these facts. Consider this: people no longer rush home to watch the six o'clock news—or shall I say, immodestly, the old Hinch at Seven. News now is 24/7. The current laws, the deliberately restrictive laws, were brought in years ago, long before we had pay TV, before the internet, before smartphones, before podcasts, before website editorials and before online newspapers—some of them, of course, behind paywalls. I must admit that my advice to Rupert Murdoch, as an ex metropolitan newspaper editor, was that he should never have posted anything on the website for free, because if you then start charging for stories people won't want to pay for them. Well, that's another story.


Getting back finally to this media package: as a former newspaper editor, as an old journo with more than 50 years of experience in the game, let me warn you that I have never known the Australian media to be under such a threat. Some will sink; that is true. Some will thrive. New platforms will appear that we have never even dreamed of. I, for one, want that diverse media freedom to grow and flourish around the country, in metropolitan areas and in the regions. And I say that today because I'm not going to just sit back and say, as somebody once said, 'That's life; good night'!

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2017-09-12,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (12:59):  The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Bill 2017 forms part of a comprehensive package of reforms that have been put forward by the Turnbull government, announced in May this year, and it's aimed at sustaining, among a number of things, the free-to-air broadcasting sector. The other part of the package is the Commercial Broadcasting (Tax) Bill 2017, otherwise known as the tax bill. There are a number of components to the bill and I will run through those before I talk about some of the details and some of the reasons these reforms are important in today's media environment. 


The bill comprises a number of measures—firstly, it aims to reform the outdated media regulation in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to better reflect the contemporary digital media environment, and that goes to the 75 per cent audience reach provision and the two-out-of-three cross-media control rule. As a few previous speakers have identified, the digital environment and where Australians are turning to to source their media, whether that be for entertainment or more particularly for news and current affairs, has led to a substantial change in the dynamics of the community. I will come back to address that in a little more detail. The bill will also amend and introduce some additional local programming obligations under the act for regional commercial television broadcasting licences because, at the moment, their licences can become part of a group commercial television licence, and there can be a change of control with the area affected by that exceeding the current 75 per cent rule. We are looking to amend the antisiphoning scheme under the act and the antisiphoning notice, and I will mention some of the key sporting events that people would be concerned about here in Australia in articulating what those changes may actually mean. 


The legislation looks to permanently abolish annual television and radio licence fees and datacasting charges payable by commercial providers, and again you've got to keep this in the context of all of the overheads associated with establishing a broadcast facility, perhaps a local radio station. I think of Flow FM, based in Kapunda, that broadcasts to a network of country communities across South Australia. They do that at some considerable cost, compared to somebody who streams information on the internet and whose set-up and ongoing costs are really low. If we're keen to keep the free-to-air broadcast type of service going, we need to make sure these broadcasters remain competitive. Certainly people in the digital space don't have the same kind of licensing and regulatory fees that people in the broadcast area do, and so, given those people in the broadcast area have to wear these overhead costs, we need to make sure that they are competitive in terms of their cost base. 


People tend to think of news or entertainment or talkback radio shows as being the sorts of things that free-to-air broadcasting provides, but free-to-air radio plays an important role in emergency management in this nation. Sometimes after significant events, whether they be floods or fires, the post-disaster analysis is done formally—for example, in Queensland after the floods in 2015—and at other times it's done as a result of community-led efforts, particularly after bushfires. Whatever the case is, people look at the infrastructure that has failed—and one of the areas that sometimes fails is communications. That might be because exchanges or the connecting lines that transmit data are burnt, or perhaps because the power has failed and there is no backup at the exchange or the mobile phone tower. So the communications often fail. Sometimes it's even just congestion; so many people are trying to use the network. One of the key measures for getting information to people about the often rapid development of natural disasters is free-to-air radio, and so it's really important that, for regional communities in particular, we have a sustainable base for those services so that they can be providing that information to communities who need it.


There's another whole debate around analysing post-disaster activity to work out where the failure modes are within our communication system. I note there have been calls recently for all mobile phone towers to have backup batteries, for example, that exceed the capacity of their existing ones. Whilst I welcome the intent behind that, I merely point out that the loss of battery backup power is but one failure mode that can cause a breakdown in communication for a community in a given region. You might double the size and go from half a day to even two days, but when we look at some of the events that have occurred there have been multiple days without mains power. So the processes, for example, that Telstra has in place already, where it can provide either a complete mobile phone tower facility to replace a tower that has been damaged or burnt, or it can provide a generator—they have in recent events even flown in generators by helicopter to keep things like mobile phone towers operating—we see that there is a real role in national disaster resilience planning for all three levels of government to work together. 


I was speaking yesterday in fact with Minister Keenan about some of the funding they've announced in South Australia, along with Minister Malinauskas there, for both community groups and organisations that are seeking to plug some of those gaps. It's an important measure to make sure we have communications available. I'd certainly be encouraging communities and also local government to be reaching out and seeing what services are already provided. In particular the Attorney-General's Department underpins some of the priority communication services that allow firefighters and first responders to have priority access through telephone networks. They can link in, at a very nominal cost to them, to some of those supports provided by the federal government, but also that resilience planning to work out ahead of time with communications network providers such as Telstra as to where the likely failure modes are and where the responses will be needed, so that, as the disaster progresses—particularly things like bushfires—we can put in place the appropriate measures. But right upfront one of those key ones is free-to-air radio. My message to people in rural communities is, 'Get involved with that planning at a community and local government level, but make sure you have a radio with batteries available to be listening to those warnings, because it's an important part.' It's a bit of an aside to this broadcasting amendment, but it just highlights one of the critical life-saving needs for free-to-air broadcasts into our regional communities in particular. 


As well as abolishing the fees, the legislation also looks to remove the taxes on the equipment used by commercial broadcasters, establish tax collection and assessment arrangements for the new interim transmitter licence tax and establish a statutory review of the new tax arrangements in 2021 consistent with a broad review of spectrum pricing which is underway. It establishes a transitional support payment scheme for 19 commercial broadcasters to make sure no broadcaster will be worse off during this transitional period.


Before I come back to some of those digital things, I want to touch on the concept of spectrum again. People often wonder why we make so much fuss about spectrum. Coming from a defence background and chairing the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee, what we see increasingly is that not only in the conduct of our day-to-day life but also in our banking, our national security and a whole range of areas, spectrum is an incredibly important issue that we need to be aware of. Not only is the allocation of spectrum important but also the price signals we send in terms of who can access and use that spectrum. In this case here, people are looking at how that spectrum should be priced, and I just want to make the point that it's not a free good. Every time you give up some spectrum that can be used in one area, you potentially limit the availability of that spectrum to be used for something that we think is critical. For example, in the national defence space, whether that be telemetry of data around aircraft and missile systems, whether that be communications systems, be it commercial or defence and government related, spectrum is not a free good. There is a finite allocation that can be made. These reviews need to take into account not only the commercial availability of spectrum to media broadcasters but also the broader considerations that government has. 


The first reform looks at responding to the contemporary digital media environment, and it looks at repealing some of the outdated media ownership and control laws, such as the 75 per cent audience reach or the two-out-of-three cross-control rule. What opponents of that ignore is that many people now almost solely access their entertainment, their social contact and, more frequently now, their current affairs and news information through social media platforms that are internet based. Whether it's Facebook, Google or whatever site you want to use, there are providers reaching far more than 75 per cent of a population. That is changing, fundamentally, the dynamics in our marketplace. In some ways, that is good; it means that people can at very low cost access information or entertainment across a broad range of areas where, perhaps, a broadcaster previously didn't have the licence to distribute particular information. 


There are also really negative aspects to it, which is why it's important that we make sure these alternative voices remain commercially viable into the future. What I'm talking about there is what is increasingly being known as the echo effect of social media. In the United States, the Brookings Institution, for example, has had a look at what President Obama did through his campaigns, and, more recently, at what President Trump did in his campaign. Demos, a cross-party think tank in the UK, has looked at the impact of social media and this echo effect in the UK in their most recent election. What has become increasingly apparent is that in the day of social media, where people are becoming connected predominantly through networks of like-minded people, the algorithms used by corporations such as Facebook and Google are looking at your preferences and then feeding news to you and directing you to news sites or articles that reflect your point of view. 


I can see, for advertisers, why that kind of thing is appealing. If somebody does a Google search for, say, red hats, to then be able to present that person with information about people who are designing or selling red hats is really good marketing. It is very clever. A lot of Australians would be shocked to realise how much of their personal lives, preferences and habits—even where they travel—are actually known to corporations like Google and Facebook through the collection of data from their internet searches. There is the reporting back from things like Google Maps. It will predict, the next time you hop in the car, where you are about to go on a Sunday afternoon. I've noticed that on my own iPhone. When I turn it on, it pops up and guesses where I'm going to go, because it's obviously been tracking for some time. 


That's fine, in some senses, from a commercial perspective. But the concern raised by Demos and the Brookings Institution is that where people only access news from a particular news source that already supports their perception, it actually reinforces their bias. So whilst it may be a valid perspective, it's really important—if our polity is to continue to work as a functioning liberal plural democracy—that the plurality of views is recognised and valued. One of the problems is, if you have a cohort who merely access their information from a subset of news streams that informs them from a particular perspective, they start to believe—this is what the studies are showing—that anyone who doesn't see the world through their own prism is not a reasonable person, that that person doesn't have well-founded or well-meaning interpretations of what's happening in the world. We see that in some of the current debates where people are being called racists, bigots and other things because they have a different view.


What we've seen in the UK around Brexit and parties like UKIP and in the United States around the Trump campaign is that there is an increasing division between groups in communities. There have been some quite fascinating papers written about why people who sit in one camp can look at another and go: 'Why is that person unable to actually see and appreciate my perspective? Why are they so wrong and stuck in their views?' 'The studies are pointing to the fact that this digital divide in our community, this echo-chamber effect, means that people aren't being challenged on a regular basis to recognise that there are other valid views around the same topic and that one set of facts can have a number of interpretations and can have a number of quite reasonable differences between people in our community.


The ability to have broadsheet newspapers, television broadcasters, broadcasting news and free-to-air radio that people will either deliberately or even accidentally interact with provides an alternate perspective to what they may have been fed through their Facebook feed or other feeds through digital media. That's really important for the actual continuation of a successful plural society where a diversity of views actually makes us stronger, as opposed to having everybody just believing that their point of view is the only right point of view and that, if you don't hold their point of view, you must somehow be morally bankrupt.


These provisions around media ownership are far from decreasing the number of voices. What they're trying to do is make alternate voices commercially sustainable. That's because, if these other providers aren't out there and the echo effect continues, we will get to the point where the only voice that people will interact with, unless they very deliberately make an effort to escape the algorithms of Facebook, Google and others who feed them information, will be these free-to-air-type broadcasters. It's important that those voices are commercially sustainable so that, in years to come, they will still be here in our community.


Just very quickly, there are some other areas of Australian content that I think are important. Again, it comes back, in part, to this culture. We're being told constantly that we are part of a global community, and that's all great, except for the fact that not all cultures are the same and not all communities are the same. Whilst it's wonderful to see what other countries are doing, it's really important, also, that we celebrate what is uniquely Australian, particularly by having our young people exposed to views of Australian life and Australian attitudes so that they actually grow up having an understanding of what it means to be an Australian, as opposed to somebody living in the suburbs of an American sitcom and all the things that go along with that.


The review that was announced in May, for example, looking at both Australian children's content production and distribution incentives combined with audience demand to find ways to actually help Australian content to be delivered and be successful is really important. In South Australia, for example, McLeod's Daughters was a very famous and successful series for a number of years. The town of Freeling where that was produced was actually in my electorate of Wakefield when I was a member in the other place, and it was not only a source of local work in South Australia but also provided a great tourist opportunity for businesses in Freeling with people constantly wanting to come through to see the pub, the sets and everything that happened in Freeling. But, importantly, it also gave a glimpse into, albeit a dramatised view, Australian life. It was an Australian situation, as opposed to a situation somewhere in downtown New York in an American sitcom.


Recently, the creator of McLeod's Daughters, Ms Graeme-Evans, wrote another script for a new miniseries. Channel 9 is looking at potentially supporting that but hasn't committed. The kinds of incentives that we're looking for—the media ownership rules that we're looking for and the relaxation of things like fees to make it more commercially viable—are the sorts of things we need to encourage people like Channel 9 to actually commit and say, 'Yes, we'll get behind a new miniseries of McLeod's Daughters.' There was actually quite a significant financial impact for the community in South Australia from the production of that series, and that could happen again. So these media reforms are welcomed for the long-term benefit of our broadcasters and the long-term benefit of our society by having a range of voices and Australian content to inform all Australians of the future of our nation.

"Griff, Sen Stirling",NXT,2017-09-12,"



Senator GRIFF
 (South Australia) (13:19):  A review of Australia's media environment is long overdue. Our current broadcasting and media ownership laws have been overtaken by the commercial realities of the digital age and are now serving to undermine, rather than underpin, a strong Australian media. Traditional media businesses are haemorrhaging profits. The once rivers of advertising gold have become a trickle, with online giants such as Google and Facebook now taking the majority share. With limited revenue from their digital pursuits, media organisations that are keeping their heads above water are doing so through ongoing cost cutting, by selling off assets or by tapping into shareholders that have very deep pockets. But, as we saw with the Ten Network, deep pockets can't be relied on indefinitely.


Ironically, to save itself, the industry is eroding its core product. It is trying to do more with less, with varying degrees of success. Nowhere is this pressure more evident than in the newsrooms of our free-to-air broadcasters, daily newspapers and commercial radio stations. In the past few years we have seen wave after wave of redundancies across print and broadcast media. The Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance estimates that since 2011 an estimated 2,500 journalists, photographers and subeditors have taken a package and left the industry. Most of these were seasoned staff with a wealth of skill and contacts. Their loss represents a loss of knowledge and depth for newsrooms across the country. Their loss is a collective hit to broad-ranging, hard news, serious investigative journalism and intelligent, objective analysis, as opposed to opinion, which is flourishing in its place.


Obviously, no-one in this place wants to see the industry depleted any further than it has been. That is why this bill and the debate is so important. For politicians there are many occasions when we don't like what we read, hear or see in the news, particularly about ourselves, but we all accept that a robust, independent and free press is fundamental to a well-functioning democracy. Anyone who believes otherwise is very much deluding themselves. And anyone who thinks that mainstream media can survive and deliver quality and insightful news—as opposed to dumbed down, populist clickbait—without urgent legislative intervention is suffering an acute case of blind optimism.


Newsrooms are already using online clicks to determine what gets priority on their online sites. This is not a healthy trend. We already have enough stories about the Instagram photo Kim regrets most or the 12 practical uses of avocado oil that will blow your mind. Civic journalism needs to be safeguarded. We need a thriving media to bring important news, no matter how boring it might be, to a good chunk of its audience. We need to loosen the straitjacket that once served to protect diversity but now serves to shackle the industry to outdated operating models. We need to rein in the uncompetitive advantages that global internet giants, such as Facebook and Google, are exploiting. At the moment, these market-distorting digital dominators are appropriating unique, Australian-made content and profiting from it while also enjoying the lion's share of advertising revenue. They need to pay a fair price for unique content that is not their own.


If media organisations stop producing unique content, where does that leave the likes of Apple News and Facebook? They will probably have to put their hands in their own pockets to pay people to make shareable news and entertainment content, and that is way more expensive than pilfering it for free or for below-market rates. Their market-distorting powers are such that 2,000 news organisations in the US and Canada recently banded together to seek permission to negotiate collectively with Google and Facebook. What they want is simply to have a fairer share of the revenue and customer data that these giants collect in return for using their journalism. The Nick Xenophon Team agrees wholeheartedly with the industry that these online giants need to be called into account. That is why I and my NXT colleagues have pushed very hard for an ACCC inquiry that will lay bare, for once and for all, the tactics and conditions that search engines and social media platforms have imposed on Australian media organisations.


We have in-principle support from the government for an inquiry by the competition watchdog that will probe into the impact of these platforms on the media and advertising landscape and determine whether their practices impede media organisations from recouping their own costs. We hope that the government will proceed with the ACCC inquiry, regardless of the outcome of this bill, as it will be a very important tool for levelling the playing field and, ideally, making these digital giants pay their fair share for the valued content made by others. 


Anecdotally, these digital platforms have media organisations over a barrel. The media businesses I have spoken to don't like the terms they are forced to accept. They receive very little, if any, benefits from them but feel very much powerless to challenge them. These obligations and conditions will now finally be weighed by the competition watchdog, and, unlike media and other third-party organisations, the ACCC actually has the power to address any uncompetitive behaviour it finds. I do hope these digital platforms are, in a way, sweating over this prospect. Their days of somewhat ripping off media organisations and disingenuously claiming that it's all fair play in an open market are hopefully very much numbered.


Getting fair compensation for the use of their content will assist the traditional media business model in an environment where they are fighting for every advertising dollar. According to figures in ACMA's most recent communications report, print media has been capturing less and less of the national advertising dollar. It attracted $5.3 billion in advertising revenue in 2011, but this collapsed to $2.3 billion by 2015 as more and more advertisers shifted away from traditional platforms in favour of digital. Digital advertising now accounts for almost half of the Australian advertising market. According to the Commercial Economic Advisory Service of Australia, online ad share grew by six percentage points last year to make up almost 49 per cent of the total Australian advertising market. This came partly at the expense of traditional media. For instance, the advertising spend on free-to-air television dropped by 21 per cent last year from 24 per cent the previous year.


The digital advertising sector is getting stronger and stronger. According to IAB Australia, the total online advertising spend grew to a whopping $7.4 billion last year, up a substantial 23 per cent on 2015. But this has proven to be a double whammy for media organisations not only because it's such a competitive space but also because the returns generated from online advertising are generally lower. Interestingly, the ABC is contributing in a small but arguably unnecessary way to this struggle. It spent $1.5 million last year on digital marketing to push its editorial content through social media and on search engines. Given the public broadcaster's main website is already ranked amongst the top sites in Australia, we question whether the public broadcaster should be using its scarce resources to essentially compete against commercial news sites. It is clear that action needs to be taken. Australian media companies cannot produce quality content with dwindling resources.


We are also particularly pleased that the government listened to us and industry and has scrapped licence fees for commercial television broadcasters and radio broadcasters. Licence fees were becomingly increasingly burdensome at a time when falling network advertising revenues has forced broadcasters to make difficult decisions about how to fund their operations. They were also increasingly unfair with commercial free-to-air broadcasters paying around $127 million a year in licence fees whilst their digital competitors paid absolutely nothing. The licence fees will be replaced with an interim transmitter tax regime, which will be levied to reflect spectrum use. It will not end the disparity with digital providers, but it will at least cost commercial free-to-air broadcasters less—about a third of what they are collectively paying now. They are very much the positives in the bill.


In turning to the rest of the bill, I acknowledge that there have been concerns by some in this place and in the community that scrapping our media control laws may harm diversity. In reality, the greater threat to diversity is the industry's steady erosion. We need to remember that the current rules were drafted for the analog era, and that time is forever gone. Our world has dramatically altered. Ongoing dynamic change in the media landscape is our new reality and there is no use pretending that laws made 25 years ago are still relevant today.


When the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 came into being, it would still be another four years before Google would surface as a PhD research project and 12 years before Facebook would come onto the scene. It was a time when most people only watched free-to-air television, listened to radio and read the daily newspapers. There were no podcasts, no on-demand content streaming, no online news sites, no social media, and advertisers flocked, in a big way, to mainstream media. The laws drafted then did not unfairly restrict competition or prevent media organisations from succeeding. 


These laws no longer reflect the reality we all operate in, which is one where the internet is effectively the fourth unregulated media player. The net covers 100 per cent of the country, 100 per cent of the time, and makes a mockery of the 75 per cent audience coverage rule. The 75 per cent reach rule threshold came into force in 1993 and was established to prevent metropolitan commercial stations from merging with or buying the regional networks Prime, WIN or Southern Cross, thus having blanket coverage across Australia. However, affiliation agreements between the major and regional networks mean that, in practice, almost identical programming extends across metro and regional areas. Ten, Nine and Seven also allow viewers to stream much of their content for free, and let's not forget that pay television providers are at liberty to broadcast their content across the entire country without any similar restrictions.


The two-out-of-three rule is especially redundant considering consumers are no longer stuck with whatever their newspaper, local television station and radio stations decide to offer. There are no borders or barriers. You can find pretty well any kind of information you need, seek out whatever opinion resonates with you and stream or download a wide variety of entertainment, as long as it is legal and your internet plan allows it. In the end, it all comes down to choice, your choice.


Every major commercial broadcaster and publisher has an online presence, and whilst the majority of Australian online news services are still owned by the dominant players—namely, News Corp and Fairfax—there are plenty of alternatives out there. You can go straight to the source often on Twitter. There are citizen bloggers and eyewitness accounts in real time. There are a number of new players not associated with the majors, such as BuzzFeed, The Conversation, Junkee, or InDaily in my home state of South Australia and its affiliate The New Daily in Victoria. So consumers have no shortage of options, irrespective of the mainstream media licences covering their area. By the same token, the two-out-of-three ownership law was designed to protect media diversity by preventing ownership of more than two of the traditional regulated media platforms—namely, newspapers, commercial radio and commercial television—in the same market.


We understand the argument that it now risks inhibiting the ability of media companies to restructure or find economies of scale that will enable them to survive and hopefully thrive. However, we cannot simply repeal this rule and walk away. The so-called minimum voices test will maintain the diversity floor, and it is worth pointing out that the ACCC has oversight of mergers to ensure there is no detrimental market impact. Section 50 of the Competition and Consumer Act prevents mergers that are likely to substantially lessen competition. Even so, we can still be more proactive about protecting what we value. We can help protect diversity by taking some of the financial pressures off smaller players in order to help them thrive. We will keep negotiating with the government in good faith in order to achieve this aim.


To conclude, what we don't want is for the current laws to assist in the slow death of Australian news media. We need to act to provide Australian media with a more level playing field and a legislative environment that is more responsive to the modern operating landscape. If we don't, we may eventually be left consuming little more than mindless clickbait and fake news with our morning cornflakes or smashed avocado. My NXT colleagues and I agree it is time to substantially reform our existing media laws. This bill makes a sound start, but we believe that there is more that can be done and we reserve our final position for now.

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2017-09-12,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (13:35):  I too rise to commend and applaud the Turnbull government on the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Bill 2017. Before I get into the reasons why I particularly support this bill, I would like to commend the speakers who have just preceded me, in particular Senator Hinch. There is no-one in this chamber, and very few people in this nation, who have more experience in more platforms of the Australian media landscape than the human headline, our wonderful Senator Derryn Hinch. I think he made a very compelling case as to why this legislation is so necessary. He said himself, just now in this chamber, that he's never known the Australian media to be under such threat. In his own inimitable way he also said that you have to have rocks in your head to actually oppose these reforms. He very clearly, and I think very cogently, destroyed the ALP's claim that these changes will restrict diversity. As he said, it is patently wrong. In fact, Senator Hinch also argued, again very cogently, that not supporting these changes in this bill will actually further restrict the media. Those who believe otherwise, he said, are in Noddy Land. I could not agree more with what Senator Hinch just said.


I'd also like to congratulate Senator Griff on his comments just now in the chamber. Again, Senator Griff put a very cogent, clear argument as to why media reform is necessary, and I would like to thank him for his very considered words. He pointed out very clearly the unfairness that has now arisen in relation to legislation that was drafted in 1993 in a very analog world. Today it is distorting the market to such a degree that those who operate in the digital world have a great advantage over the traditional media, which is so important, as Senator Fawcett said, in regional Australia. As Senator Fawcett also said—and I congratulate him for making these points in relation to confirmation bias—all Australians need to have as much diversity as possible in the information that they see and hear through all the various platforms of communication, rather than just the one point of view, to avoid the echo chamber that Senator Fawcett mentioned.


I believe that, in our Australian society, media outlets continue to play a crucial role in reflecting and representing our culture and providing information to our local communities, and they are, ultimately, critically important to our democratic processes. As the former chair of the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee I heard very compelling evidence in the inquiry on this legislation. That inquiry left me in absolutely no doubt that broadcasters and publishers are operating in an increasingly challenging environment, with intense competition for audiences and advertising revenue and also from other media companies, including the ABC, which, I believe, has a distorting impact on the ability of commercial broadcast media to make a profit and be competitive in this current environment. 


To pick up Senator Hinch's words, I think anybody in this place that does not see Network Ten's announcement of voluntary administration in June this year as a concern is in Noddy Land. It is indicative of the current instability and the obstacles that are hindering the performance of our traditional broadcasters. They are hamstrung by analog-era legislation which digital media are clearly not subject to. This bill provides the necessary and appropriate reforms to ensure that our media outlets are equipped and the regulatory framework in which they operate is appropriate for today and also for tomorrow's media environment. There are many new challenges, and it is outrageous that we are hamstringing these organisations to the point where some are going into voluntary administration or, as Senator Hinch said, have simply closed their doors, reducing diversity. This bill provides the necessary and appropriate reforms to ensure that our media outlets are equipped with the regulatory framework that they need to survive in a digital world, and not only survive but, hopefully, prosper. 


Similarly to the Electoral and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, which I spoke to yesterday in this chamber, the bill before us, in many of its amendments, seeks to modernise aspects of an act which is severely out of date and is now having many contrary impacts on our democracy. In terms of the Electoral Act, it was in relation to the types of communications we receive on electoral matters, in campaigns. In this case, if we don't change, if we don't update our laws so that all of our media outlets, no matter what and how they broadcast, are able to do so, our democracy will be the poorer, because people simply will not be getting the information they need to make informed choices and to be getting alternative points of view, as Senator Fawcett so eloquently pointed out in his speech on this issue. 


I commend the minister on his stakeholder and industry engagement and on gaining unanimous support from all sectors of the media industry, many of which consider this media reform package and this bill as vital to their longevity and their viability. Again, if the Channel 10 insolvency doesn't sound alarm bells for those opposite, I don't know what will. Let me share with the chamber some of the comments by industry. First of all, Network Ten CEO Paul Anderson stated:


… it is blindingly obvious that these pre-internet era laws are now achieving the opposite of what they were intended to do. 


In 1993. He went on:


They are now working against a strong, viable and diverse media sector, and they must go. 


News Corp Australian Executive Chairman Michael Miller—




Senator Dastyari:
  They're the old filibuster notes!




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  Order on my left!




Senator REYNOLDS:
  Senator Dastyari might not like to hear what these people are saying—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Reynolds, please address your comments through the chair.




Senator REYNOLDS:
  However, they are important. These are the people who are impacted by the position of those opposite. News Corp Australian Executive Chairman Michael Miller said: 


… the passage of these two pieces of legislation will allow the local media players who have vested interests in local communities to compete with the internationals that are coming into the market— 


Primarily straight into rural and regional households through digital communication platforms that are not subject to the same rules as some of the other longstanding organisations. Free TV Australia has said unequivocally that the government's media reform package is:


… crucial for Australian jobs and our ability to continue creating great local programming that is watched by millions of Australians every day.


The CEO of Prime Media Group, Mr Ian Audsley, said that this bill is critical to retaining regional broadcasting jobs and:


There has been a lot of talk about the threat to diversity if the two-out-of-three rule is repealed. We would argue that there is greater threat to media diversity if the media reform bill is not passed …


Which is exactly what Senator Hinch has just told this chamber, with all of his years of experience—that there is a greater threat to media diversity if these bills are not passed, because the risk is that even more journalists will lose their jobs in regional Australia, more newsrooms will be forced to scale down and, in a worst-case scenario, some businesses will close. 


This bill will provide the Australian media industry and sector stakeholders with the necessary stability, assurance and support to embrace the modern media environment, the digital media environment, which this act never even conceived of back in 1993. Free-to-air broadcasters play a vital role in providing access to high-quality Australian content. What do they provide? They provide current affairs, sport, drama and children's programs to all Australians, all over this nation. However, as we all know and many speakers here have said, the broadcasters are operating in a very different environment, against increasingly competitive and challenging circumstances, due to the entry of online service providers, who are simply not subject to the same rules and restrictions as the broadcasters are.


Although Australian audiences have viewing opportunities across many platforms, I'm sure over the next few years there will be many more platforms to come. To make sure that the Australian industry remains competitive, the Senate must pass this bill. We can no longer shackle traditional media outlets with laws that do not apply to the new organisations and those that will come in the future. It is a fact that, if passed, the majority of broadcasters will be better off. Although it may take time for businesses to transition to the proposed new fee model, the minister has made it clear that a transitional support package will be available. The support package will ensure broadcasters are no worse off as a result of these changes in the bill. In turn—and importantly for broadcasters—it will provide them with certainty for the next five years that their fees will not increase. This is a very responsible thing to do, and it is yet another example of this government taking responsible actions and making responsible decisions that are in the interests of all Australians.


In addition to the government's media reform package, this bill will modernise regulation and help position the industry as a sector to deal with existing and future challenges and changes in communication platforms. This bill will not only ensure that the act is relevant today; it will also ensure that the operation of the act does not hold industry back or impose regulations that are no longer relevant or applicable—the time came and went for the current legislation many, many years ago. The minister lamented that the regulations governing our media companies do not allow them to meet the challenges on a level playing field, as a result of the increase in online, on-demand operators and the many foreign technology companies that now operate here in Australia.


Again, as the chair of the environment and communications committee—which looked in detail at this legislation and heard evidence from many different sectors in this industry—I firmly believe this bill, with the reform package that was announced in May this year, provides a sensible suite of measures. The package provides the necessary reforms to modernise media regulation and to position the Australian media industry to deal with existing and future challenges more effectively.


The first—and probably one of the most significant—reform that this bill will introduce is the repealing of the 75 per cent audience reach rule and the two-out-of-three cross-media control rule. As you've heard from senators on the crossbench and on the government side, these rules are completely and utterly out of date. They are distorting and killing some of our regional TV stations and other broadcast media. They were written in 1993. As Senator Hinch said, we are no longer in a world where Kylie Minogue lives on Ramsay Street, among many other things—for example, 1993 was the year Meatloaf released his song 'I'd Do Anything for Love' and, given his recent performances, he'd probably have done better to stay with that song in 1993. But that is the world that this legislation was introduced to regulate—an analog world, which no longer exists.


This 75 per cent audience reach rule is a classic example of why this bill is required. It prohibits a person, either in their own right or as a director of one or more companies, from being in a position to exercise control of commercial TV broadcasting licences whose combined reach exceeds 75 per cent of the Australian population. This rule is clearly redundant and, as has been said by Senator Hinch and Senator Griff, is grossly distorting, particularly on rural and regional media. It doesn't protect diversity anymore. In fact, it is doing quite the opposite; it is further restricting media diversity, and it has to change. Audiences across the country today receive essentially the same broadcast content due to affiliation agreements between metropolitan and regional networks, and all three metropolitan TV broadcasters and the ABC stream some or all of their channels online to 100 per cent of the population. This rule takes into account none of that. It is an outdated analogue-era requirement. It takes into account none of the digital access to news, stories, programs and children's entertainment that most Australians now have.


The second thing that this bill does which I think is very important is amend local programming obligations to introduce additional obligations for regional broadcasters. This bill includes a welcome range of measures to ensure the availability of local content in regional areas and strengthens links between local content and the communities it is broadcast to. In the absence of such regulation, the high cost of local content production and structural changes underway in the media more broadly will create further incentives for broadcasters to achieve efficiencies, placing even further pressure on the supply of local content programming genuinely at the local level.


The third thing that this bill does—again, having heard all of the evidence in the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee—is amend the antisiphoning scheme and antisiphoning notice. This scheme was established in 1994 and regulates the acquisition of broadcast rights for sporting and other events of cultural significance or national importance. This bill seeks to ensure that events on the antisiphoning list remain freely available to all Australian viewers. This government continues to support the principle that nationally significant events should be available to free-to-air television. The antisiphoning scheme is outdated and needs reform. Again, it does not cater for the new digital media communications environment. The bill will remove the multichannelling rule, which prevents free-to-air broadcasters from televising events first or exclusively on their digital multimedia channels. Repealing the multichannelling rule will provide flexibility for free-to-air broadcasters to optimise television coverage of listed events to the benefit of audiences right across this country.


The fourth great thing that this bill does—and, again, having heard a lot of evidence on this in the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee when we looked at this bill—is abolish TV and radio licence fees and other charges. The committee heard overwhelming evidence that these licence fees and datacasting charges have absolutely no place in a modern regulatory framework in the digital age. They were designed for a very different nation and a very different type of media. This bill will repeal the unwarranted taxes, starting with the payment that would be otherwise due in December 2017. Instead, the government will establish tax collection and assessment arrangements for an interim transmitter licence tax and will establish a statutory review of the arrangements in 2021—a very sound idea. The introduction of a transmitter licence tax and the abolition of the broadcasting licence fees will result in the vast majority of broadcasters paying considerably less in terms of their overall fee and tax burden. Again, I point out that these are fees and tax burdens that their digital competitors, who are streaming right across this country into their markets, are not subject to. It is grossly unfair that we are saddling certain broadcasters with these outdated fees and taxes and not subjecting them to those who now broadcast the same content or similar content directly to our homes.


Finally, the government will establish a transitional support payment scheme for commercial broadcasters—again, a very sensible and sound measure. This five-year transitional support package will provide financial relief up to 30 June 2020. It supports 19 individual commercial broadcasters to transition to the new spectrum tax model, helps optimise their business structures and supports growth over the medium to long term. And, as I've said, importantly, that will help them also provide much more genuinely local content in rural and regional Australia.


As part of this package, the legislation will require the Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA, to, after 30 June 2019, undertake a review and report on whether the new tax laws should be repealed or amended. Again, this is a very sensible measure. ACMA will consult on the review, enabling broadcasters to input into the development of the future tax arrangements.


We have a historic media package that has the support of the entire media sector. We have heard very clear and cogent arguments of why this reform is so necessary to retain the diversity and the richness of, and the commercial viability of, this sector in our community. I commend the government for this package.

Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (13:56):  The government wants One Nation support for this package so badly that it has agreed to invite a razor gang into the books of the ABC. And it wants Nick Xenophon's support for the package so badly that it has agreed not to embarrass him into being forced to vote in support of One Nation's proposal. But make no mistake, voting for this bill means voting for One Nation's deal. I know that, One Nation knows that and you can bet your last dollar that Nick Xenophon and his team know that, too.


As for what the details are, we still don't know. The government won't tell us and they won't tell us. All we know is that it commits the government to review the ABC and ask if it is reducing the profitability of its commercial rivals. Guess what? The job of the ABC isn't to make money for its commercial rivals. Its job is to guarantee all Australians have access to news, programming and information that affects their lives, no matter where they live or how wealthy they are. The deal the government has made isn't designed to improve the ABC; it is designed to defund it. It's a deal to set up a rigged kangaroo court that is determined to find the ABC guilty and lay the groundwork for slashing the budget of the most trusted news source in the country—or, as I like to refer to it, the eighth great wonder of the world.


That is the deal that is before us. That is the vote we are taking—to defend the ABC or to defund it. No amount of tax breaks or inquiries into tech giants can change that. As the old saying goes, if you don't know all the details of the deal, don't vote for it. If you knew all the details of the deal, you probably wouldn't vote for it anyway. A vote in favour of this package is a vote in favour of all the strings that come attached to it. The government could have opted to put the full details of the deal in the legislation, but it decided not to because it is embarrassed by what it has agreed to. And if something is so embarrassing that not even this government would be willing to put its name to it, then it says something about all those who are voting to support it. No matter what else is said, no matter who says it, there's only one thing you need to remember: if you are proud of something, you don't hide it.


The deal that has been made between One Nation and the Turnbull government doesn't go ahead unless this vote passes. What we're doing by voting for this media reform package is actually voting for a dirty deal, because the government decided to link the two. We are voting for something on paper and another thing altogether in practice. We're choosing whether to defend the ABC or to defund it. I will not endorse this deal. I am willing to vote to help the commercial players by doing away with outdated media ownership regulations but I refuse to vote for a package that hurts journalism in rural and regional Australia.


The bill before us is only half the deal. The other half will not be put to the vote. This is the vote—for the visible half and for the invisible other. It is the only opportunity we will have to oppose the dirty deal the government has made to let loose the razor gangs on the budget of the ABC for the crime of doing exactly what the public needs a public broadcaster to do.


I won't be supporting this bill and I am disappointed that I can't. I'm disappointed that I can't support this bill, because I support what it's trying to achieve in principle. The media landscape is changing fast and—

Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (12:31):  It is a delight to be able to contribute to the debate on the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Bill 2017. Like many of those who have spoken on the debate already, it is important to start off by pointing out that the reforms we're debating here that are included in this legislation are indeed landmark reforms, not only in respect of the changes that they make to the legislative regime that applies to this part of the economy and to this form of communication, but also the fact—and I think this is more important—that they have the unanimous support of the Australian media industry. That in itself is a massive achievement. I have to commend the Minister for Communications, Senator Fifield, for his amazing efforts in being able to secure this agreement and support right across industry. Without that, these reforms would not be the landmark set of reforms that they are.


In debating this, we have to recognise that the Australian media landscape has indeed changed significantly over recent years, and also over the longer term as well. It's important that regulation that was designed for a specific set of circumstances and a specific type of technology that was available at the time keeps pace with the technology that has evolved since laws were put into place. The rules, the laws and the regulations need to be dynamic, like the technology available to the media sector itself is.


The important point, going back to the ability to achieve consensus in the industry on this legislation, is the fact that the government has been listening and has undertaken extensive consultation with industry and the community in preparing this legislation. I think that is an excellent example to be set in terms of how to bring about landmark reforms. The fact that we have listened means we do now have a package that will genuinely modernise regulation for this industry. As I've stated, given that technology has changed and, therefore, the laws need to now reflect that, it's important that, looking forward, we ensure we have legislation that is able to keep up with changes into the future. This is not a static thing; it's a case of being able to manage the dynamic environment, the changing environment, and the changing technologies in this sector into the future. We can't just make laws for now; they have to be futureproofed as well.


Turning to the elements of the package of legislation in the broader media reforms, these are the abolition of broadcasting licence fees for TV and radio, the introduction of spectrum use pricing, the ban on gambling advertising during sports broadcasts and children's shows, the anti-siphoning amendments scheme and list, the review of the Australian and children's content, and the $30 million fund for broadcasting women's and niche sports, which I was delighted to hear Senator Macdonald speak at length about just yesterday. He spoke about the importance of investing in both of those areas to develop both women's sports and niche sports, which don't receive the media attention they otherwise could. That is an exceptionally important part of this entire package.


This bill goes to abolishing two of the five media cross-ownership rules and providing stronger local content protections for regional TV. Australia's media cross-ownership and control rules date back to the 1980s, a period when many great things occurred—including my birth!—but they haven't been substantially updated since 2006. That is why this piece of legislation today is so important. The laws as they stand, unamended, reflect the historic media environment, the traditional mediums and platforms available to media—TV, radio and print media—which of course are still important; no-one can deny that. But the laws as they stand today don't reflect the current environment, which now encompasses a great many more technologies in the way of social media, internet and the like. So we need to take stock of that and, again, this is why this legislation is so important.


We've seen massive changes in the ways Australians access information. The online world is where most people seem to turn to access their news, and social media is a significant part of that. Even many in this chamber would turn to Facebook and Twitter for breaking news rather than the TV and radio of days gone by, because it is more instantaneous, it is unfiltered and it is direct. That is a reality we have to accept, and that's why the amendments being proposed are important.


The challenges that face traditional media and how revenue is generated on audience shares is placing a burden on traditional media, which is leading to an uncompetitive situation. The ways in which our traditional providers of media operate and use of the existing platforms in this field do need updating so that they can remain competitive with these new and emerging technologies that are competing with traditional forms of media. A little bit later on I will come to the importance of these traditional mediums to regional Australia. Most of Tasmania is considered to be regional—almost its entirety. That's why they're important to my home state of Tasmania. Another reason it's important that this bill is passed is that it ensures that Australian media companies can compete against global media giants and maintain the local jobs, which is of particular importance, especially when you look at some of the smaller entities around Australia, and so that these companies can continue to provide the local content—again, something I will touch on in more detail when reflecting on the importance of local media to regional communities.


This bill will, as is the government's intention, strengthen regional local content requirements to ensure that communities continue to have access to local news and content that is relevant to their communities and to their lives and to ensure that the information they're receiving actually does provide some benefit to their daily lives. That's something regional media has been able to do over many years and will, under these laws, continue to be able to do. It's important, though, that we do strengthen the operating environment for regional broadcasters to uphold the regional content requirements, and, as I said, the bill before us is something that goes a long way to doing just that.


Turning to the media ownership and control rules and the current situation, we currently have five rules in place that limit the control of commercial broadcasting, being TV, radio and newspapers. These rules are somewhat outdated and don't reflect, as I've said before, the contemporary digital media environment which we now operate in. All of us have these great things, these smartphones and tablets, which provide us with so much more information. But the rules, while they need changing, also need to ensure that the traditional forms of media are protected and supported as well.


The rules as they stand, though, were developed in an analog environment that was dominated by only three platforms, as I've mentioned—free-to-air TV, free-to-air radio, and print. This was a time before smart TVs, internet radio and the technology of smartphones and tablets. The current control regime and the ownership rules regulate only those three platforms and are based on geographical areas, boundaries that have since been broken with the advent of the internet and the many other channels used to distribute and access online content. 


The bill will repeal two of the five current rules, the 75 per cent audience reach rule and the two-out-of-three cross-media control rule. The 75 per cent reach rule applies to TV and prevents a person, either in their own right or as a director of one or more companies, from exercising control of commercial TV broadcasting licences whose combined licence area exceeds 75 per cent of the population of Australia. The rule was first introduced in 1987 as a 60 per cent rule and later increased in 1995 to a 75 per cent rule, obviously to reflect the changes at that time. 


As at October of last year, the figures for combined audiences were as follows: Channel 7 covered 74.51 per cent of the population; Channel 9, 73.96 per cent; and Channel 10, 67.31 per cent. For regional networks, which are generally affiliated with these larger metropolitan counterparts, the audience coverage in 2014 was, for the Prime network, 24.33 per cent; WIN Network, 25.15 per cent; and Southern Cross, 34.11 per cent. Tasmania, my home state, is covered by the WIN Network and Southern Cross, which I have to say do an excellent job of providing very relevant local content in their news bulletins and other programming as well. 


The rule has the practical effect of preventing mergers between any of the metropolitan networks, being Seven, Nine or Ten, and any of the regional networks, being Prime, WIN and Southern Cross. Any merger under the current arrangements would substantially exceed the 75 per cent rule, and the rule as it stands does little to support media diversity, as regional viewers—those who live outside of our metropolitan areas—essentially receive the same commercial TV programming as their metropolitan brothers and sisters due to the affiliation or content supply agreements. 


In the changing media landscape, with broadband internet and the proliferation of tablets, smartphones and other devices, the rule is largely redundant. The ABC and SBS now are streaming their channels online to 100 per cent of the population, if they choose to access it, right across the country, including into regional markets where metropolitan networks don't currently broadcast other than through affiliates. The repeal of this rule would remove one burden on broadcasters, allowing consolidation and change in affiliation and ownerships, making such changes to relevant competition laws, as with most other industries. It would provide broadcasters the opportunity to build operations on a greater scale and compete in an environment where audiences can already access premium content online. 


Going to the two-out-of-three cross-media rule, the rule provides that mergers can't involve more than two of the three regulated platforms of TV, radio and newspapers in any commercial radio licence area. This rule tightly regulates just TV, radio and newspapers and doesn't take into consideration the changing media landscape and the substantial online media offerings we have today, including the alternative news sources that exist. We're also seeing traditional providers now moving into these more modern platforms. A lot of our newspapers run things through social media newsfeeds and the like. They are doing their best under the current arrangements to compete, but it is important that we do support this legislation to give a truly level playing field. This rule is not suited to a contemporary media environment and it does restrict the diversity of content offered to consumers. It was introduced in 2006, which is 11 years ago, and we have to reflect on the technology we had back then versus the technology we have now. Smartphones, tablets et cetera were all in very juvenile stages of development and not as widely available to every man, woman and child as they are today. 


There are three rules to remain. Firstly, the five-four rule applies to TV and radio and is known as the minimum voices rule. It is a requirement that at least five independent media operations or media groups are present in mainland state capital cities, and at least four must be present in regional commercial radio licence areas. Secondly, the one-to-a-market rule specifies that a person must not control more than one commercial TV broadcasting licence in a licence area. Finally, the two-to-a-market rule specifies that a person must not control more than two commercial radio broadcasting licences in the same licence area. 


It is important to also point out that these specific broadcasting requirements, mergers and acquisitions in the media sector are subject to the general prohibition of anticompetitive acquisitions outlined in the Competition and Consumer Act 2010. So we can see that this sector is highly regulated—there are rules everywhere. The point is that these rules are to remain dynamic, to remain relevant and to foster growth in this area, to ensure that our media industry is operating at optimum levels in a competitive way, ensuring that all audiences—regional and metropolitan—get the content they are after. The operating environment for free-to-air commercial TV and radio broadcasters has changed substantially and is expected to continue to do so over the next five to 10 years, and I suspect well beyond that as well. The current rules on control and ownership constrain the ability of Australian media outlets to change the structure of their businesses and to respond to changes in the media environment. That's not okay in 2017. The sad reality is that that does have an impact on jobs. 


In the time remaining to me, I will briefly turn to the matter of regional content, which is an important issue; it is close to my heart. As I said before, Tasmania is almost entirely a regional community, perhaps with the exception of Hobart. Online media services do provide a useful product for consumers, but they are no substitute for local broadcasters. Australia is a very vast country, with many, many diverse and disparate communities across its land, and Tasmania is no exception to that. We are small geographically, but we are broken up into many subregions: the north-west; the west coast, which is an entirely different community with different news needs and different activities taking place; the north-east, which is within a couple of hundred kilometres of the population centre of Launceston but, again, a very different community with different needs when it comes to news and current affairs; and then, heading south, within the Hobart region, there is the Derwent Valley, the Huon Valley, the south-east and the east coast. All these areas have their own unique communities and a requirement for specific news in each of those communities.


The local broadcasters that we have—be it our TV broadcasters in Southern Cross, WIN or indeed the government broadcasters, being the ABC predominantly, and also the radio networks and print media—do a great job of providing tailored local content, which is so important for local communities. Indeed, in times of natural disaster and emergencies, it is the local TV and radio that really do assist these small communities. Again, being close to one another doesn't mean they are the same communities. The Derwent Valley, a half-hour to 40-minute drive from Hobart, may be subject to emergency warnings that Hobart is not. That's why it's important that we do have regional content available through our local broadcasters.


Of course, local programming supports much-needed jobs in regional communities. This is also through advertising through our commercial broadcasters. It's amazing when travelling around the state of Tasmania—going into any workplace and hearing the local radio station blaring in the workshop, bakery or news agency. Local businesses advertise on local radio. It provides local jobs; it supports local jobs. That's why it's important. Local programming may be at risk where regional broadcasters merge operations and there are strong expectations of cost savings. You end up with syndicated content, which is not good because that is not what these small local communities are after.


It was disappointing to reflect on one of the iterations of the committee report a Senate inquiry has done into this legislation and note the dissenting comments of opposition and Greens senators to this, because it really shows that they don't have an understanding of what regional communities require when it comes to media, when it comes to local content and, indeed, as I've just demonstrated, when it comes to local jobs. I think it is incumbent upon senators in this place—opposition, Greens and anyone else—to support the measures contained in this bill: to support the Australian media to catch up with the 21st century, to ensure we have the best regulatory regime that we possibly can and, most importantly, to support regional communities and regional content and those who produce it to make sure our regional communities are not left out because of the inner-city Labor and Green people in this place.

"Hinch, Sen Derryn",DHJP,2017-09-12,"



Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (12:51):  I rise to support the government's changes to the media laws—with some amendments that we proudly recommended, such as guaranteed funding for community radio. I speak today as probably the person in this chamber with the most experience working in the media and the most inside information about the media. 


I spent more than 55 years as a working journo before I 'jumped the shark', as they say, and ended up at this place. I worked in all forms of media: newspapers, magazines, radio, television and online media websites. I have been a cub reporter, a foreign correspondent, a Sydney newspaper editor, a TV current affairs host on free-to-air and pay TV, a radio current affairs host and an internet website blogger. Let me give the Labor Party media experts and some crossbenchers some personal statistics—and not the one about being sacked 16 times!


I started out as a cadet reporter on a small town daily newspaper across the ditch in New Zealand—TheTaranaki Herald, circulation 11,000. It was the oldest daily newspaper in New Zealand. It started in 1852. I say 'was' because it closed in 1989. I then worked on the Christchurch Star. It was first published in 1868, and it stopped publishing in 1991. I then worked for the WaikatoTimes in Hamilton, New Zealand. It started in 1872 and six years ago changed from being an afternoon paper to a morning paper. It's really struggling now, having just been bought by Fairfax. Speaking of Fairfax, I crossed the ditch on the MV Wanganella in 1963 and got a job as a police reporter on the Sydney Sun. I worked there for several years before going to New York as a foreign correspondent and returned in 1975 to become editor in 1976.


The Sydney Sun no longer exists. Neither does our bitter rival, Rupert Murdoch's Daily Mirror. All those papers have gone. All have closed down. This is the media fact that I want to ram home. They couldn't all have closed down just because I worked on them! The Fairfax papers, TheSydney Morning Herald and The Age, are being circled by bottom-feeding sharks. Their print editions could cease any time—maybe even by the end of this year. That New York landmark the Daily Newswasimmortalised in Guys and Dolls—'What's in the Daily News? I'll tell you what's in the Daily News.' I'll tell you what's in the Daily News. It was sold to the Chicago Tribune last week for $1.


I had the HINCH program on the Ten Network. That network has been in receivership and has now been sold—it hasn't gone through yet. It has been bought by CBS, a foreign corporation. That's why I ask: are you getting the drift? Are the senators getting the drift? That is why I say to any crossbenchers who oppose the relaxation of draconian, Neanderthal, out-of-date media laws—including the two-out-of-three rule and including the 75 per cent reach—that you have rocks in your head, and the Labor Party, too. Labor's shadow minister for communications, Michelle Rowland, has said that the planned relaxation of the laws 'threatens media diversity'. She said: 


Labor opposes removing the two out of three rule because it would achieve very little at potentially great cost - further media consolidation and a reduction in the diversity of voices across the media landscape.


Well, the two-out-of-three rule prevents media companies from owning a TV network, a radio station and a newspaper in the same market. That's what they're perpetuating. Ms Rowland also said that Labor does believe that the pragmatic course of action—one of them—at this time is to repeal the 75 per cent reach rule, and that is good news. She said that this would ensure that local content is bolstered following a trigger event and provide immediate licence fee relief to the commercial broadcasters. But her claim that removing the two-out-of-three rule threatens media diversity is patently wrong—Noddy Land! If we do nothing, if we play ostrich here in this house, with our heads in the sand, that is what will threaten media diversity.


I remember the days when the morning paper, especially on Wednesdays and Saturdays, weighed a tonne. Those were the days of the fabulous rivers of gold from classified advertising that made the fortunes of the Packers, the Fairfaxes and the Murdochs. But I believe that the shift of audience—and, more importantly, the advertising—to multinational giants, such as Google and Facebook, with all their tax dodging as well, threatens the very existence of newspapers and the viability of free-to-air and subscription television.


Scrapping the two-out-of-three rule will allow Australian media companies to compete on a more level playing field with global challenges. The Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, said that the sale of the Ten Network to CBS actually showed that change to the media laws are no longer necessary. Well, in my view, the sale of Channel Ten to CBS means an even more urgent need for a review of media laws. The way it stands at the moment, the way it stood when CBS got in and ambushed Lachlan Murdoch and Bruce Gordon—but leaving them out of it for a minute—no other Australians could have a level playing field and a chance to compete against CBS.


I believe all of this should have happened years ago. And I agreed with communications minister Mitch Fifield when he said awhile back that a few facts have escaped some of the knockers in the other place and in the Senate. He said that, No. 1, Kylie Minogue does not live on Ramsay Street anymore, and, No. 2, the internet does exist. He said that it is very important that our media laws reflect the second of these facts. Consider this: people no longer rush home to watch the six o'clock news—or shall I say, immodestly, the old Hinch at Seven. News now is 24/7. The current laws, the deliberately restrictive laws, were brought in years ago, long before we had pay TV, before the internet, before smartphones, before podcasts, before website editorials and before online newspapers—some of them, of course, behind paywalls. I must admit that my advice to Rupert Murdoch, as an ex metropolitan newspaper editor, was that he should never have posted anything on the website for free, because if you then start charging for stories people won't want to pay for them. Well, that's another story.


Getting back finally to this media package: as a former newspaper editor, as an old journo with more than 50 years of experience in the game, let me warn you that I have never known the Australian media to be under such a threat. Some will sink; that is true. Some will thrive. New platforms will appear that we have never even dreamed of. I, for one, want that diverse media freedom to grow and flourish around the country, in metropolitan areas and in the regions. And I say that today because I'm not going to just sit back and say, as somebody once said, 'That's life; good night'!

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2017-09-12,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (12:59):  The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Bill 2017 forms part of a comprehensive package of reforms that have been put forward by the Turnbull government, announced in May this year, and it's aimed at sustaining, among a number of things, the free-to-air broadcasting sector. The other part of the package is the Commercial Broadcasting (Tax) Bill 2017, otherwise known as the tax bill. There are a number of components to the bill and I will run through those before I talk about some of the details and some of the reasons these reforms are important in today's media environment. 


The bill comprises a number of measures—firstly, it aims to reform the outdated media regulation in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to better reflect the contemporary digital media environment, and that goes to the 75 per cent audience reach provision and the two-out-of-three cross-media control rule. As a few previous speakers have identified, the digital environment and where Australians are turning to to source their media, whether that be for entertainment or more particularly for news and current affairs, has led to a substantial change in the dynamics of the community. I will come back to address that in a little more detail. The bill will also amend and introduce some additional local programming obligations under the act for regional commercial television broadcasting licences because, at the moment, their licences can become part of a group commercial television licence, and there can be a change of control with the area affected by that exceeding the current 75 per cent rule. We are looking to amend the antisiphoning scheme under the act and the antisiphoning notice, and I will mention some of the key sporting events that people would be concerned about here in Australia in articulating what those changes may actually mean. 


The legislation looks to permanently abolish annual television and radio licence fees and datacasting charges payable by commercial providers, and again you've got to keep this in the context of all of the overheads associated with establishing a broadcast facility, perhaps a local radio station. I think of Flow FM, based in Kapunda, that broadcasts to a network of country communities across South Australia. They do that at some considerable cost, compared to somebody who streams information on the internet and whose set-up and ongoing costs are really low. If we're keen to keep the free-to-air broadcast type of service going, we need to make sure these broadcasters remain competitive. Certainly people in the digital space don't have the same kind of licensing and regulatory fees that people in the broadcast area do, and so, given those people in the broadcast area have to wear these overhead costs, we need to make sure that they are competitive in terms of their cost base. 


People tend to think of news or entertainment or talkback radio shows as being the sorts of things that free-to-air broadcasting provides, but free-to-air radio plays an important role in emergency management in this nation. Sometimes after significant events, whether they be floods or fires, the post-disaster analysis is done formally—for example, in Queensland after the floods in 2015—and at other times it's done as a result of community-led efforts, particularly after bushfires. Whatever the case is, people look at the infrastructure that has failed—and one of the areas that sometimes fails is communications. That might be because exchanges or the connecting lines that transmit data are burnt, or perhaps because the power has failed and there is no backup at the exchange or the mobile phone tower. So the communications often fail. Sometimes it's even just congestion; so many people are trying to use the network. One of the key measures for getting information to people about the often rapid development of natural disasters is free-to-air radio, and so it's really important that, for regional communities in particular, we have a sustainable base for those services so that they can be providing that information to communities who need it.


There's another whole debate around analysing post-disaster activity to work out where the failure modes are within our communication system. I note there have been calls recently for all mobile phone towers to have backup batteries, for example, that exceed the capacity of their existing ones. Whilst I welcome the intent behind that, I merely point out that the loss of battery backup power is but one failure mode that can cause a breakdown in communication for a community in a given region. You might double the size and go from half a day to even two days, but when we look at some of the events that have occurred there have been multiple days without mains power. So the processes, for example, that Telstra has in place already, where it can provide either a complete mobile phone tower facility to replace a tower that has been damaged or burnt, or it can provide a generator—they have in recent events even flown in generators by helicopter to keep things like mobile phone towers operating—we see that there is a real role in national disaster resilience planning for all three levels of government to work together. 


I was speaking yesterday in fact with Minister Keenan about some of the funding they've announced in South Australia, along with Minister Malinauskas there, for both community groups and organisations that are seeking to plug some of those gaps. It's an important measure to make sure we have communications available. I'd certainly be encouraging communities and also local government to be reaching out and seeing what services are already provided. In particular the Attorney-General's Department underpins some of the priority communication services that allow firefighters and first responders to have priority access through telephone networks. They can link in, at a very nominal cost to them, to some of those supports provided by the federal government, but also that resilience planning to work out ahead of time with communications network providers such as Telstra as to where the likely failure modes are and where the responses will be needed, so that, as the disaster progresses—particularly things like bushfires—we can put in place the appropriate measures. But right upfront one of those key ones is free-to-air radio. My message to people in rural communities is, 'Get involved with that planning at a community and local government level, but make sure you have a radio with batteries available to be listening to those warnings, because it's an important part.' It's a bit of an aside to this broadcasting amendment, but it just highlights one of the critical life-saving needs for free-to-air broadcasts into our regional communities in particular. 


As well as abolishing the fees, the legislation also looks to remove the taxes on the equipment used by commercial broadcasters, establish tax collection and assessment arrangements for the new interim transmitter licence tax and establish a statutory review of the new tax arrangements in 2021 consistent with a broad review of spectrum pricing which is underway. It establishes a transitional support payment scheme for 19 commercial broadcasters to make sure no broadcaster will be worse off during this transitional period.


Before I come back to some of those digital things, I want to touch on the concept of spectrum again. People often wonder why we make so much fuss about spectrum. Coming from a defence background and chairing the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee, what we see increasingly is that not only in the conduct of our day-to-day life but also in our banking, our national security and a whole range of areas, spectrum is an incredibly important issue that we need to be aware of. Not only is the allocation of spectrum important but also the price signals we send in terms of who can access and use that spectrum. In this case here, people are looking at how that spectrum should be priced, and I just want to make the point that it's not a free good. Every time you give up some spectrum that can be used in one area, you potentially limit the availability of that spectrum to be used for something that we think is critical. For example, in the national defence space, whether that be telemetry of data around aircraft and missile systems, whether that be communications systems, be it commercial or defence and government related, spectrum is not a free good. There is a finite allocation that can be made. These reviews need to take into account not only the commercial availability of spectrum to media broadcasters but also the broader considerations that government has. 


The first reform looks at responding to the contemporary digital media environment, and it looks at repealing some of the outdated media ownership and control laws, such as the 75 per cent audience reach or the two-out-of-three cross-control rule. What opponents of that ignore is that many people now almost solely access their entertainment, their social contact and, more frequently now, their current affairs and news information through social media platforms that are internet based. Whether it's Facebook, Google or whatever site you want to use, there are providers reaching far more than 75 per cent of a population. That is changing, fundamentally, the dynamics in our marketplace. In some ways, that is good; it means that people can at very low cost access information or entertainment across a broad range of areas where, perhaps, a broadcaster previously didn't have the licence to distribute particular information. 


There are also really negative aspects to it, which is why it's important that we make sure these alternative voices remain commercially viable into the future. What I'm talking about there is what is increasingly being known as the echo effect of social media. In the United States, the Brookings Institution, for example, has had a look at what President Obama did through his campaigns, and, more recently, at what President Trump did in his campaign. Demos, a cross-party think tank in the UK, has looked at the impact of social media and this echo effect in the UK in their most recent election. What has become increasingly apparent is that in the day of social media, where people are becoming connected predominantly through networks of like-minded people, the algorithms used by corporations such as Facebook and Google are looking at your preferences and then feeding news to you and directing you to news sites or articles that reflect your point of view. 


I can see, for advertisers, why that kind of thing is appealing. If somebody does a Google search for, say, red hats, to then be able to present that person with information about people who are designing or selling red hats is really good marketing. It is very clever. A lot of Australians would be shocked to realise how much of their personal lives, preferences and habits—even where they travel—are actually known to corporations like Google and Facebook through the collection of data from their internet searches. There is the reporting back from things like Google Maps. It will predict, the next time you hop in the car, where you are about to go on a Sunday afternoon. I've noticed that on my own iPhone. When I turn it on, it pops up and guesses where I'm going to go, because it's obviously been tracking for some time. 


That's fine, in some senses, from a commercial perspective. But the concern raised by Demos and the Brookings Institution is that where people only access news from a particular news source that already supports their perception, it actually reinforces their bias. So whilst it may be a valid perspective, it's really important—if our polity is to continue to work as a functioning liberal plural democracy—that the plurality of views is recognised and valued. One of the problems is, if you have a cohort who merely access their information from a subset of news streams that informs them from a particular perspective, they start to believe—this is what the studies are showing—that anyone who doesn't see the world through their own prism is not a reasonable person, that that person doesn't have well-founded or well-meaning interpretations of what's happening in the world. We see that in some of the current debates where people are being called racists, bigots and other things because they have a different view.


What we've seen in the UK around Brexit and parties like UKIP and in the United States around the Trump campaign is that there is an increasing division between groups in communities. There have been some quite fascinating papers written about why people who sit in one camp can look at another and go: 'Why is that person unable to actually see and appreciate my perspective? Why are they so wrong and stuck in their views?' 'The studies are pointing to the fact that this digital divide in our community, this echo-chamber effect, means that people aren't being challenged on a regular basis to recognise that there are other valid views around the same topic and that one set of facts can have a number of interpretations and can have a number of quite reasonable differences between people in our community.


The ability to have broadsheet newspapers, television broadcasters, broadcasting news and free-to-air radio that people will either deliberately or even accidentally interact with provides an alternate perspective to what they may have been fed through their Facebook feed or other feeds through digital media. That's really important for the actual continuation of a successful plural society where a diversity of views actually makes us stronger, as opposed to having everybody just believing that their point of view is the only right point of view and that, if you don't hold their point of view, you must somehow be morally bankrupt.


These provisions around media ownership are far from decreasing the number of voices. What they're trying to do is make alternate voices commercially sustainable. That's because, if these other providers aren't out there and the echo effect continues, we will get to the point where the only voice that people will interact with, unless they very deliberately make an effort to escape the algorithms of Facebook, Google and others who feed them information, will be these free-to-air-type broadcasters. It's important that those voices are commercially sustainable so that, in years to come, they will still be here in our community.


Just very quickly, there are some other areas of Australian content that I think are important. Again, it comes back, in part, to this culture. We're being told constantly that we are part of a global community, and that's all great, except for the fact that not all cultures are the same and not all communities are the same. Whilst it's wonderful to see what other countries are doing, it's really important, also, that we celebrate what is uniquely Australian, particularly by having our young people exposed to views of Australian life and Australian attitudes so that they actually grow up having an understanding of what it means to be an Australian, as opposed to somebody living in the suburbs of an American sitcom and all the things that go along with that.


The review that was announced in May, for example, looking at both Australian children's content production and distribution incentives combined with audience demand to find ways to actually help Australian content to be delivered and be successful is really important. In South Australia, for example, McLeod's Daughters was a very famous and successful series for a number of years. The town of Freeling where that was produced was actually in my electorate of Wakefield when I was a member in the other place, and it was not only a source of local work in South Australia but also provided a great tourist opportunity for businesses in Freeling with people constantly wanting to come through to see the pub, the sets and everything that happened in Freeling. But, importantly, it also gave a glimpse into, albeit a dramatised view, Australian life. It was an Australian situation, as opposed to a situation somewhere in downtown New York in an American sitcom.


Recently, the creator of McLeod's Daughters, Ms Graeme-Evans, wrote another script for a new miniseries. Channel 9 is looking at potentially supporting that but hasn't committed. The kinds of incentives that we're looking for—the media ownership rules that we're looking for and the relaxation of things like fees to make it more commercially viable—are the sorts of things we need to encourage people like Channel 9 to actually commit and say, 'Yes, we'll get behind a new miniseries of McLeod's Daughters.' There was actually quite a significant financial impact for the community in South Australia from the production of that series, and that could happen again. So these media reforms are welcomed for the long-term benefit of our broadcasters and the long-term benefit of our society by having a range of voices and Australian content to inform all Australians of the future of our nation.

"Griff, Sen Stirling",NXT,2017-09-12,"



Senator GRIFF
 (South Australia) (13:19):  A review of Australia's media environment is long overdue. Our current broadcasting and media ownership laws have been overtaken by the commercial realities of the digital age and are now serving to undermine, rather than underpin, a strong Australian media. Traditional media businesses are haemorrhaging profits. The once rivers of advertising gold have become a trickle, with online giants such as Google and Facebook now taking the majority share. With limited revenue from their digital pursuits, media organisations that are keeping their heads above water are doing so through ongoing cost cutting, by selling off assets or by tapping into shareholders that have very deep pockets. But, as we saw with the Ten Network, deep pockets can't be relied on indefinitely.


Ironically, to save itself, the industry is eroding its core product. It is trying to do more with less, with varying degrees of success. Nowhere is this pressure more evident than in the newsrooms of our free-to-air broadcasters, daily newspapers and commercial radio stations. In the past few years we have seen wave after wave of redundancies across print and broadcast media. The Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance estimates that since 2011 an estimated 2,500 journalists, photographers and subeditors have taken a package and left the industry. Most of these were seasoned staff with a wealth of skill and contacts. Their loss represents a loss of knowledge and depth for newsrooms across the country. Their loss is a collective hit to broad-ranging, hard news, serious investigative journalism and intelligent, objective analysis, as opposed to opinion, which is flourishing in its place.


Obviously, no-one in this place wants to see the industry depleted any further than it has been. That is why this bill and the debate is so important. For politicians there are many occasions when we don't like what we read, hear or see in the news, particularly about ourselves, but we all accept that a robust, independent and free press is fundamental to a well-functioning democracy. Anyone who believes otherwise is very much deluding themselves. And anyone who thinks that mainstream media can survive and deliver quality and insightful news—as opposed to dumbed down, populist clickbait—without urgent legislative intervention is suffering an acute case of blind optimism.


Newsrooms are already using online clicks to determine what gets priority on their online sites. This is not a healthy trend. We already have enough stories about the Instagram photo Kim regrets most or the 12 practical uses of avocado oil that will blow your mind. Civic journalism needs to be safeguarded. We need a thriving media to bring important news, no matter how boring it might be, to a good chunk of its audience. We need to loosen the straitjacket that once served to protect diversity but now serves to shackle the industry to outdated operating models. We need to rein in the uncompetitive advantages that global internet giants, such as Facebook and Google, are exploiting. At the moment, these market-distorting digital dominators are appropriating unique, Australian-made content and profiting from it while also enjoying the lion's share of advertising revenue. They need to pay a fair price for unique content that is not their own.


If media organisations stop producing unique content, where does that leave the likes of Apple News and Facebook? They will probably have to put their hands in their own pockets to pay people to make shareable news and entertainment content, and that is way more expensive than pilfering it for free or for below-market rates. Their market-distorting powers are such that 2,000 news organisations in the US and Canada recently banded together to seek permission to negotiate collectively with Google and Facebook. What they want is simply to have a fairer share of the revenue and customer data that these giants collect in return for using their journalism. The Nick Xenophon Team agrees wholeheartedly with the industry that these online giants need to be called into account. That is why I and my NXT colleagues have pushed very hard for an ACCC inquiry that will lay bare, for once and for all, the tactics and conditions that search engines and social media platforms have imposed on Australian media organisations.


We have in-principle support from the government for an inquiry by the competition watchdog that will probe into the impact of these platforms on the media and advertising landscape and determine whether their practices impede media organisations from recouping their own costs. We hope that the government will proceed with the ACCC inquiry, regardless of the outcome of this bill, as it will be a very important tool for levelling the playing field and, ideally, making these digital giants pay their fair share for the valued content made by others. 


Anecdotally, these digital platforms have media organisations over a barrel. The media businesses I have spoken to don't like the terms they are forced to accept. They receive very little, if any, benefits from them but feel very much powerless to challenge them. These obligations and conditions will now finally be weighed by the competition watchdog, and, unlike media and other third-party organisations, the ACCC actually has the power to address any uncompetitive behaviour it finds. I do hope these digital platforms are, in a way, sweating over this prospect. Their days of somewhat ripping off media organisations and disingenuously claiming that it's all fair play in an open market are hopefully very much numbered.


Getting fair compensation for the use of their content will assist the traditional media business model in an environment where they are fighting for every advertising dollar. According to figures in ACMA's most recent communications report, print media has been capturing less and less of the national advertising dollar. It attracted $5.3 billion in advertising revenue in 2011, but this collapsed to $2.3 billion by 2015 as more and more advertisers shifted away from traditional platforms in favour of digital. Digital advertising now accounts for almost half of the Australian advertising market. According to the Commercial Economic Advisory Service of Australia, online ad share grew by six percentage points last year to make up almost 49 per cent of the total Australian advertising market. This came partly at the expense of traditional media. For instance, the advertising spend on free-to-air television dropped by 21 per cent last year from 24 per cent the previous year.


The digital advertising sector is getting stronger and stronger. According to IAB Australia, the total online advertising spend grew to a whopping $7.4 billion last year, up a substantial 23 per cent on 2015. But this has proven to be a double whammy for media organisations not only because it's such a competitive space but also because the returns generated from online advertising are generally lower. Interestingly, the ABC is contributing in a small but arguably unnecessary way to this struggle. It spent $1.5 million last year on digital marketing to push its editorial content through social media and on search engines. Given the public broadcaster's main website is already ranked amongst the top sites in Australia, we question whether the public broadcaster should be using its scarce resources to essentially compete against commercial news sites. It is clear that action needs to be taken. Australian media companies cannot produce quality content with dwindling resources.


We are also particularly pleased that the government listened to us and industry and has scrapped licence fees for commercial television broadcasters and radio broadcasters. Licence fees were becomingly increasingly burdensome at a time when falling network advertising revenues has forced broadcasters to make difficult decisions about how to fund their operations. They were also increasingly unfair with commercial free-to-air broadcasters paying around $127 million a year in licence fees whilst their digital competitors paid absolutely nothing. The licence fees will be replaced with an interim transmitter tax regime, which will be levied to reflect spectrum use. It will not end the disparity with digital providers, but it will at least cost commercial free-to-air broadcasters less—about a third of what they are collectively paying now. They are very much the positives in the bill.


In turning to the rest of the bill, I acknowledge that there have been concerns by some in this place and in the community that scrapping our media control laws may harm diversity. In reality, the greater threat to diversity is the industry's steady erosion. We need to remember that the current rules were drafted for the analog era, and that time is forever gone. Our world has dramatically altered. Ongoing dynamic change in the media landscape is our new reality and there is no use pretending that laws made 25 years ago are still relevant today.


When the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 came into being, it would still be another four years before Google would surface as a PhD research project and 12 years before Facebook would come onto the scene. It was a time when most people only watched free-to-air television, listened to radio and read the daily newspapers. There were no podcasts, no on-demand content streaming, no online news sites, no social media, and advertisers flocked, in a big way, to mainstream media. The laws drafted then did not unfairly restrict competition or prevent media organisations from succeeding. 


These laws no longer reflect the reality we all operate in, which is one where the internet is effectively the fourth unregulated media player. The net covers 100 per cent of the country, 100 per cent of the time, and makes a mockery of the 75 per cent audience coverage rule. The 75 per cent reach rule threshold came into force in 1993 and was established to prevent metropolitan commercial stations from merging with or buying the regional networks Prime, WIN or Southern Cross, thus having blanket coverage across Australia. However, affiliation agreements between the major and regional networks mean that, in practice, almost identical programming extends across metro and regional areas. Ten, Nine and Seven also allow viewers to stream much of their content for free, and let's not forget that pay television providers are at liberty to broadcast their content across the entire country without any similar restrictions.


The two-out-of-three rule is especially redundant considering consumers are no longer stuck with whatever their newspaper, local television station and radio stations decide to offer. There are no borders or barriers. You can find pretty well any kind of information you need, seek out whatever opinion resonates with you and stream or download a wide variety of entertainment, as long as it is legal and your internet plan allows it. In the end, it all comes down to choice, your choice.


Every major commercial broadcaster and publisher has an online presence, and whilst the majority of Australian online news services are still owned by the dominant players—namely, News Corp and Fairfax—there are plenty of alternatives out there. You can go straight to the source often on Twitter. There are citizen bloggers and eyewitness accounts in real time. There are a number of new players not associated with the majors, such as BuzzFeed, The Conversation, Junkee, or InDaily in my home state of South Australia and its affiliate The New Daily in Victoria. So consumers have no shortage of options, irrespective of the mainstream media licences covering their area. By the same token, the two-out-of-three ownership law was designed to protect media diversity by preventing ownership of more than two of the traditional regulated media platforms—namely, newspapers, commercial radio and commercial television—in the same market.


We understand the argument that it now risks inhibiting the ability of media companies to restructure or find economies of scale that will enable them to survive and hopefully thrive. However, we cannot simply repeal this rule and walk away. The so-called minimum voices test will maintain the diversity floor, and it is worth pointing out that the ACCC has oversight of mergers to ensure there is no detrimental market impact. Section 50 of the Competition and Consumer Act prevents mergers that are likely to substantially lessen competition. Even so, we can still be more proactive about protecting what we value. We can help protect diversity by taking some of the financial pressures off smaller players in order to help them thrive. We will keep negotiating with the government in good faith in order to achieve this aim.


To conclude, what we don't want is for the current laws to assist in the slow death of Australian news media. We need to act to provide Australian media with a more level playing field and a legislative environment that is more responsive to the modern operating landscape. If we don't, we may eventually be left consuming little more than mindless clickbait and fake news with our morning cornflakes or smashed avocado. My NXT colleagues and I agree it is time to substantially reform our existing media laws. This bill makes a sound start, but we believe that there is more that can be done and we reserve our final position for now.

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2017-09-12,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (13:35):  I too rise to commend and applaud the Turnbull government on the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Bill 2017. Before I get into the reasons why I particularly support this bill, I would like to commend the speakers who have just preceded me, in particular Senator Hinch. There is no-one in this chamber, and very few people in this nation, who have more experience in more platforms of the Australian media landscape than the human headline, our wonderful Senator Derryn Hinch. I think he made a very compelling case as to why this legislation is so necessary. He said himself, just now in this chamber, that he's never known the Australian media to be under such threat. In his own inimitable way he also said that you have to have rocks in your head to actually oppose these reforms. He very clearly, and I think very cogently, destroyed the ALP's claim that these changes will restrict diversity. As he said, it is patently wrong. In fact, Senator Hinch also argued, again very cogently, that not supporting these changes in this bill will actually further restrict the media. Those who believe otherwise, he said, are in Noddy Land. I could not agree more with what Senator Hinch just said.


I'd also like to congratulate Senator Griff on his comments just now in the chamber. Again, Senator Griff put a very cogent, clear argument as to why media reform is necessary, and I would like to thank him for his very considered words. He pointed out very clearly the unfairness that has now arisen in relation to legislation that was drafted in 1993 in a very analog world. Today it is distorting the market to such a degree that those who operate in the digital world have a great advantage over the traditional media, which is so important, as Senator Fawcett said, in regional Australia. As Senator Fawcett also said—and I congratulate him for making these points in relation to confirmation bias—all Australians need to have as much diversity as possible in the information that they see and hear through all the various platforms of communication, rather than just the one point of view, to avoid the echo chamber that Senator Fawcett mentioned.


I believe that, in our Australian society, media outlets continue to play a crucial role in reflecting and representing our culture and providing information to our local communities, and they are, ultimately, critically important to our democratic processes. As the former chair of the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee I heard very compelling evidence in the inquiry on this legislation. That inquiry left me in absolutely no doubt that broadcasters and publishers are operating in an increasingly challenging environment, with intense competition for audiences and advertising revenue and also from other media companies, including the ABC, which, I believe, has a distorting impact on the ability of commercial broadcast media to make a profit and be competitive in this current environment. 


To pick up Senator Hinch's words, I think anybody in this place that does not see Network Ten's announcement of voluntary administration in June this year as a concern is in Noddy Land. It is indicative of the current instability and the obstacles that are hindering the performance of our traditional broadcasters. They are hamstrung by analog-era legislation which digital media are clearly not subject to. This bill provides the necessary and appropriate reforms to ensure that our media outlets are equipped and the regulatory framework in which they operate is appropriate for today and also for tomorrow's media environment. There are many new challenges, and it is outrageous that we are hamstringing these organisations to the point where some are going into voluntary administration or, as Senator Hinch said, have simply closed their doors, reducing diversity. This bill provides the necessary and appropriate reforms to ensure that our media outlets are equipped with the regulatory framework that they need to survive in a digital world, and not only survive but, hopefully, prosper. 


Similarly to the Electoral and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, which I spoke to yesterday in this chamber, the bill before us, in many of its amendments, seeks to modernise aspects of an act which is severely out of date and is now having many contrary impacts on our democracy. In terms of the Electoral Act, it was in relation to the types of communications we receive on electoral matters, in campaigns. In this case, if we don't change, if we don't update our laws so that all of our media outlets, no matter what and how they broadcast, are able to do so, our democracy will be the poorer, because people simply will not be getting the information they need to make informed choices and to be getting alternative points of view, as Senator Fawcett so eloquently pointed out in his speech on this issue. 


I commend the minister on his stakeholder and industry engagement and on gaining unanimous support from all sectors of the media industry, many of which consider this media reform package and this bill as vital to their longevity and their viability. Again, if the Channel 10 insolvency doesn't sound alarm bells for those opposite, I don't know what will. Let me share with the chamber some of the comments by industry. First of all, Network Ten CEO Paul Anderson stated:


… it is blindingly obvious that these pre-internet era laws are now achieving the opposite of what they were intended to do. 


In 1993. He went on:


They are now working against a strong, viable and diverse media sector, and they must go. 


News Corp Australian Executive Chairman Michael Miller—




Senator Dastyari:
  They're the old filibuster notes!




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  Order on my left!




Senator REYNOLDS:
  Senator Dastyari might not like to hear what these people are saying—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Reynolds, please address your comments through the chair.




Senator REYNOLDS:
  However, they are important. These are the people who are impacted by the position of those opposite. News Corp Australian Executive Chairman Michael Miller said: 


… the passage of these two pieces of legislation will allow the local media players who have vested interests in local communities to compete with the internationals that are coming into the market— 


Primarily straight into rural and regional households through digital communication platforms that are not subject to the same rules as some of the other longstanding organisations. Free TV Australia has said unequivocally that the government's media reform package is:


… crucial for Australian jobs and our ability to continue creating great local programming that is watched by millions of Australians every day.


The CEO of Prime Media Group, Mr Ian Audsley, said that this bill is critical to retaining regional broadcasting jobs and:


There has been a lot of talk about the threat to diversity if the two-out-of-three rule is repealed. We would argue that there is greater threat to media diversity if the media reform bill is not passed …


Which is exactly what Senator Hinch has just told this chamber, with all of his years of experience—that there is a greater threat to media diversity if these bills are not passed, because the risk is that even more journalists will lose their jobs in regional Australia, more newsrooms will be forced to scale down and, in a worst-case scenario, some businesses will close. 


This bill will provide the Australian media industry and sector stakeholders with the necessary stability, assurance and support to embrace the modern media environment, the digital media environment, which this act never even conceived of back in 1993. Free-to-air broadcasters play a vital role in providing access to high-quality Australian content. What do they provide? They provide current affairs, sport, drama and children's programs to all Australians, all over this nation. However, as we all know and many speakers here have said, the broadcasters are operating in a very different environment, against increasingly competitive and challenging circumstances, due to the entry of online service providers, who are simply not subject to the same rules and restrictions as the broadcasters are.


Although Australian audiences have viewing opportunities across many platforms, I'm sure over the next few years there will be many more platforms to come. To make sure that the Australian industry remains competitive, the Senate must pass this bill. We can no longer shackle traditional media outlets with laws that do not apply to the new organisations and those that will come in the future. It is a fact that, if passed, the majority of broadcasters will be better off. Although it may take time for businesses to transition to the proposed new fee model, the minister has made it clear that a transitional support package will be available. The support package will ensure broadcasters are no worse off as a result of these changes in the bill. In turn—and importantly for broadcasters—it will provide them with certainty for the next five years that their fees will not increase. This is a very responsible thing to do, and it is yet another example of this government taking responsible actions and making responsible decisions that are in the interests of all Australians.


In addition to the government's media reform package, this bill will modernise regulation and help position the industry as a sector to deal with existing and future challenges and changes in communication platforms. This bill will not only ensure that the act is relevant today; it will also ensure that the operation of the act does not hold industry back or impose regulations that are no longer relevant or applicable—the time came and went for the current legislation many, many years ago. The minister lamented that the regulations governing our media companies do not allow them to meet the challenges on a level playing field, as a result of the increase in online, on-demand operators and the many foreign technology companies that now operate here in Australia.


Again, as the chair of the environment and communications committee—which looked in detail at this legislation and heard evidence from many different sectors in this industry—I firmly believe this bill, with the reform package that was announced in May this year, provides a sensible suite of measures. The package provides the necessary reforms to modernise media regulation and to position the Australian media industry to deal with existing and future challenges more effectively.


The first—and probably one of the most significant—reform that this bill will introduce is the repealing of the 75 per cent audience reach rule and the two-out-of-three cross-media control rule. As you've heard from senators on the crossbench and on the government side, these rules are completely and utterly out of date. They are distorting and killing some of our regional TV stations and other broadcast media. They were written in 1993. As Senator Hinch said, we are no longer in a world where Kylie Minogue lives on Ramsay Street, among many other things—for example, 1993 was the year Meatloaf released his song 'I'd Do Anything for Love' and, given his recent performances, he'd probably have done better to stay with that song in 1993. But that is the world that this legislation was introduced to regulate—an analog world, which no longer exists.


This 75 per cent audience reach rule is a classic example of why this bill is required. It prohibits a person, either in their own right or as a director of one or more companies, from being in a position to exercise control of commercial TV broadcasting licences whose combined reach exceeds 75 per cent of the Australian population. This rule is clearly redundant and, as has been said by Senator Hinch and Senator Griff, is grossly distorting, particularly on rural and regional media. It doesn't protect diversity anymore. In fact, it is doing quite the opposite; it is further restricting media diversity, and it has to change. Audiences across the country today receive essentially the same broadcast content due to affiliation agreements between metropolitan and regional networks, and all three metropolitan TV broadcasters and the ABC stream some or all of their channels online to 100 per cent of the population. This rule takes into account none of that. It is an outdated analogue-era requirement. It takes into account none of the digital access to news, stories, programs and children's entertainment that most Australians now have.


The second thing that this bill does which I think is very important is amend local programming obligations to introduce additional obligations for regional broadcasters. This bill includes a welcome range of measures to ensure the availability of local content in regional areas and strengthens links between local content and the communities it is broadcast to. In the absence of such regulation, the high cost of local content production and structural changes underway in the media more broadly will create further incentives for broadcasters to achieve efficiencies, placing even further pressure on the supply of local content programming genuinely at the local level.


The third thing that this bill does—again, having heard all of the evidence in the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee—is amend the antisiphoning scheme and antisiphoning notice. This scheme was established in 1994 and regulates the acquisition of broadcast rights for sporting and other events of cultural significance or national importance. This bill seeks to ensure that events on the antisiphoning list remain freely available to all Australian viewers. This government continues to support the principle that nationally significant events should be available to free-to-air television. The antisiphoning scheme is outdated and needs reform. Again, it does not cater for the new digital media communications environment. The bill will remove the multichannelling rule, which prevents free-to-air broadcasters from televising events first or exclusively on their digital multimedia channels. Repealing the multichannelling rule will provide flexibility for free-to-air broadcasters to optimise television coverage of listed events to the benefit of audiences right across this country.


The fourth great thing that this bill does—and, again, having heard a lot of evidence on this in the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee when we looked at this bill—is abolish TV and radio licence fees and other charges. The committee heard overwhelming evidence that these licence fees and datacasting charges have absolutely no place in a modern regulatory framework in the digital age. They were designed for a very different nation and a very different type of media. This bill will repeal the unwarranted taxes, starting with the payment that would be otherwise due in December 2017. Instead, the government will establish tax collection and assessment arrangements for an interim transmitter licence tax and will establish a statutory review of the arrangements in 2021—a very sound idea. The introduction of a transmitter licence tax and the abolition of the broadcasting licence fees will result in the vast majority of broadcasters paying considerably less in terms of their overall fee and tax burden. Again, I point out that these are fees and tax burdens that their digital competitors, who are streaming right across this country into their markets, are not subject to. It is grossly unfair that we are saddling certain broadcasters with these outdated fees and taxes and not subjecting them to those who now broadcast the same content or similar content directly to our homes.


Finally, the government will establish a transitional support payment scheme for commercial broadcasters—again, a very sensible and sound measure. This five-year transitional support package will provide financial relief up to 30 June 2020. It supports 19 individual commercial broadcasters to transition to the new spectrum tax model, helps optimise their business structures and supports growth over the medium to long term. And, as I've said, importantly, that will help them also provide much more genuinely local content in rural and regional Australia.


As part of this package, the legislation will require the Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA, to, after 30 June 2019, undertake a review and report on whether the new tax laws should be repealed or amended. Again, this is a very sensible measure. ACMA will consult on the review, enabling broadcasters to input into the development of the future tax arrangements.


We have a historic media package that has the support of the entire media sector. We have heard very clear and cogent arguments of why this reform is so necessary to retain the diversity and the richness of, and the commercial viability of, this sector in our community. I commend the government for this package.

"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",JLN,2017-09-12,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (13:56):  The government wants One Nation support for this package so badly that it has agreed to invite a razor gang into the books of the ABC. And it wants Nick Xenophon's support for the package so badly that it has agreed not to embarrass him into being forced to vote in support of One Nation's proposal. But make no mistake, voting for this bill means voting for One Nation's deal. I know that, One Nation knows that and you can bet your last dollar that Nick Xenophon and his team know that, too.


As for what the details are, we still don't know. The government won't tell us and they won't tell us. All we know is that it commits the government to review the ABC and ask if it is reducing the profitability of its commercial rivals. Guess what? The job of the ABC isn't to make money for its commercial rivals. Its job is to guarantee all Australians have access to news, programming and information that affects their lives, no matter where they live or how wealthy they are. The deal the government has made isn't designed to improve the ABC; it is designed to defund it. It's a deal to set up a rigged kangaroo court that is determined to find the ABC guilty and lay the groundwork for slashing the budget of the most trusted news source in the country—or, as I like to refer to it, the eighth great wonder of the world.


That is the deal that is before us. That is the vote we are taking—to defend the ABC or to defund it. No amount of tax breaks or inquiries into tech giants can change that. As the old saying goes, if you don't know all the details of the deal, don't vote for it. If you knew all the details of the deal, you probably wouldn't vote for it anyway. A vote in favour of this package is a vote in favour of all the strings that come attached to it. The government could have opted to put the full details of the deal in the legislation, but it decided not to because it is embarrassed by what it has agreed to. And if something is so embarrassing that not even this government would be willing to put its name to it, then it says something about all those who are voting to support it. No matter what else is said, no matter who says it, there's only one thing you need to remember: if you are proud of something, you don't hide it.


The deal that has been made between One Nation and the Turnbull government doesn't go ahead unless this vote passes. What we're doing by voting for this media reform package is actually voting for a dirty deal, because the government decided to link the two. We are voting for something on paper and another thing altogether in practice. We're choosing whether to defend the ABC or to defund it. I will not endorse this deal. I am willing to vote to help the commercial players by doing away with outdated media ownership regulations but I refuse to vote for a package that hurts journalism in rural and regional Australia.


The bill before us is only half the deal. The other half will not be put to the vote. This is the vote—for the visible half and for the invisible other.

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (14:00):  My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, Senator Nash.



An honourable senator interjecting—




Senator FARRELL:
  Yes, seriously. Yesterday, the minister dismissed the Commonwealth's involvement in the projects in Queensland contracted to Newlands Civil Construction. I refer to the National Partnership Agreement on Land Transport Infrastructure Projects, an agreement between the Commonwealth and the states. Can the minister confirm that the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing project, under which Newlands Civil Construction has been contracted to deliver at least $2.5 million in works, is included in the agreement and is 80 per cent funded by the Commonwealth?

Senator Farrell:
  I seek leave to table a copy of the national partnership agreement and the schedule setting out the projects funded in Queensland.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals, Minister for Regional Development, Minister for Local Government and Territories and Minister for Regional Communications) (14:02):  I understand that Senator O'Sullivan has expressed publicly that he doesn't have nor ever has had an interest in a corporation or entity that has a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in an agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth of Australia. I would say that, if the opposition has in its possession—



The PRESIDENT:  Point of order, Senator Wong.




Senator Wong:
  Mr President, the question went to—



Senator Cormann interjecting—




Senator Wong:
  Well, the answer is actually not directly relevant. The question—



The PRESIDENT:  Address your remarks to me, Senator Wong.




Senator Wong:
  I apologise. I was being distracted by Senator Cormann.



Government senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order on my right!




Senator Wong:
  My point of order goes to direct relevance. This is the minister representing the relevant minister for the Commonwealth ruling out that Senator O'Sullivan has received financial benefit as a result of involvement in family companies gaining $6 million in Commonwealth contracts. It is not relevant to say that Senator O'Sullivan has said that. The question is to the minister representing the minister who has carriage of this substantial amount of money.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Cormann, on the point of order.




Senator Cormann:
  On the point of order, by mere virtue of the fact that Senator Nash was able to point out that there was no such interest, according to Senator O'Sullivan, clearly mere logic dictates that, if there is no benefit overall then there is no benefit in the specific. So the minister was clearly being directly relevant to the question.



The PRESIDENT:  In relation to the point of order, Senator Wong, I believe the minister was being directly relevant. Minister, you were interrupted. Had you concluded your answer or do you have more to offer?




Senator NASH:
  I've concluded my answer.

 (South Australia) (14:09):  My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, Senator Nash. Yesterday, the New South Wales government released the interim investigation report following allegations of water theft and corruption aired on ABC's Four Corners.Can the minister confirm that the report has found that the public's confidence in administration of water management in New South Wales has been undermined by ineffectual compliance and enforcement programs, allegations of noncompliance remaining unresolved and public servants being investigated by the New South Wales corruption watchdog, all of this under the minister's watch?

I can of course confirm that the report has been received and that the state minister has made some comments relating to that. I do note that Minister Niall Blair has announced that he will immediately look to act on key components of the Water Management Compliance Improvement Package, which has been recommended by Mr Matthews in his interim report. I also note the speed with which the minister acted in this area.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals, Minister for Regional Development, Minister for Local Government and Territories and Minister for Regional Communications) (14:11):  No, I don't. Indeed, there have been a number of very appropriate measures put in place to deal with this issue. Firstly, of course, we have seen the independent inquiry led by Ken Matthews, which has handed down its report. We've seen the Commonwealth-initiated Murray-Darling Basin Authority review of the basin-wide compliance regimes. We've seen the ANAO audit of the national partnership agreement on implementing the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. We have seen referrals to the New South Wales ICAC and, of course, the Senate rural and regional affairs committee inquiry into the integrity of the water market.

Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales—Minister for Defence) (15:07):  As I foreshadowed yesterday, I have some further information from the Minister for Human Services for Senator Hinch in relation to a question he asked me last week concerning eligibility for the DSP. The minister advises that eligibility for the DSP is determined by assessing the impact the condition has on an individual's capacity to work rather than the condition itself. To be eligible for the DSP, the legislative requirements are that an individual's condition needs to be fully diagnosed, treated and stabilised as well as attract a rating of at least 20 points under the impairment tables. While I can't comment on the specifics of the individual case that the senator referred to, it is important to note that there are specific eligibility criteria for all income support payments. So I emphasise again that eligibility for the DSP is determined by assessing the functional impact that a condition has on the person in question and not on the presence of any particular medical condition itself.


To be granted a DSP, a person must, in addition to meeting other eligibility criteria, meet both the income and assets tests, except of course unless they are permanently blind; have a permanent physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment with a rating of at least 20 points under the impairment tables; be unable to work for 15 hours or more per week within the next two years because of their condition; and have actively participated in a program of support—for example, JobSearch, rehabilitation, educational or training—unless they have a severe impairment or they're manifestly eligible, such as where a person has a terminal illness. While a disability support pension claim is being processed, other income support is available, such as Newstart allowance or youth allowance, with an exemption of all mutual obligation activities, including looking for work.


In relation to the qualifications of DSP assessors, job capacity assessors in the Department of Human Services are qualified health and allied health professionals. There are a variety of professional qualifications, ranging from registered nurses to psychologists and occupational therapists. The department works to align individuals with an assessor who has related qualifications to assess the condition in question. The department also has a health professional advisory unit staffed by qualified medical practitioners and can also contact a person's treating health professional.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (15:10):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis), the Minister for Indigenous Affairs (Senator Scullion) and the Minister for Regional Development (Senator Nash) to questions without notice asked by Senators McAllister, Ketter and Polley today.


What a pathetic attempt by this government to fudge the figures and not release any data relating to the aged care home care packages. We have been waiting since February—seven months—and there are older Australians who have been waiting for more than two years for home care packages. We know they go from level 1, which is the lowest, up to level 4. This is a really serious issue for older Australians, and there wouldn't be very many families in this country that aren't affected one way or the other when it comes to aged care.


Last month, we had the launch of the My Aged Care support line. The Minister for Aged Care, Ken Wyatt, admitted then that more than 200 people have been identified as waiting for over two years for these home care packages. I get calls into my office on a weekly basis from family members and older people who are distressed and so anxious about getting the support they need to be able to stay at home. Let's face it, this government has never had a good record when it comes to aged care. During the Howard government, we remember Bronwyn Bishop and the kerosene baths. We've now had three ministers in this government, and not one them has been able to progress any real reforms. In 2012, when we were in government, under former minister Mark Butler, Labor actually did the hard yards. We worked with the opposition at that time, we worked with the sector and we worked with consumers to make sure that we had the foundations there for reform that we knew was going to be of paramount importance to older Australians going forward. All of the hard work's already been done for them, yet they still can't roll out the reforms.


I'll give you a couple of real examples of people that have been waiting for a long time. The minister suggesting that people aren't dying waiting for the delivery of these home care packages is outrageous, because she doesn't know. Not only was she ineligible, most likely, to be even sitting in this chamber but, as a minister, she obviously didn't have a brief on something that, as I said, is one of the major issues confronting the aged-care sector in this country. I know very well that the minister is very much aware of it. The issue is: how bad are these figures going to be? I think they're going to be much, much worse than what this government has ever anticipated. I have an example of an instance where a 92-year-old gentleman with high needs has been told that he will have to wait 18 months for a level 4 package. How absurd is that at 92? Just this morning, we had a constituent contact us whose mother was approved for a level 4 package 12 months ago. It was only this week that her mother received an interim level 2 package. This is just unacceptable.


Australians deserve much better from this government, particularly when it comes to older Australians. We know that the result of these long waiting times is that those older people who are on level 4 end up either going to an acute hospital, being prematurely put into residential homes or they die. That's the reality. I'm calling on the government—I couldn't believe that somebody who was responsible for health in regional Australia, Senator Nash, would not have that information. How out of touch are the government? How arrogant are they that they think that they can keep older Australians and their families in the dark about this data? One thing I will say is that data will be crucial in formulating policy going forward. This government will then have to act on that. Like most Australians, I'm afraid that we do not have the confidence in this government to be able to deliver the outcomes that Australians need.


All Australians, particularly our older Australians, deserve to have this support so they can stay at home much longer. That's a better outcome for whichever government is in power at a Commonwealth level. You save more money by keeping people in their own homes and giving them that support. But the last place older Australians want to end up in is an acute hospital. That is the last place that they want to be. They want to be able to age in their own home with dignity, with respect and with the care that they so justly deserve. This is a reflection on the government. It is one that I would be ashamed of if I were sitting on that side of the chamber. Older Australians deserve much better. (Time expired)

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania) (15:15):  It is always good of the Labor Party to move a motion to take note of specific answers because what it highlights to the Australian people is the lack of depth and lack of substance in relation to the Labor Party's approach to all issues of public policy. What it shows us is that the Australian Labor Party has no plan and no vision for our great country. What they're able to do is throw a lot of stones from the sidelines without providing any genuine answers or policy prescriptions to deal with the issues confronting our nation. And so we had this bizarre question time today—all sorts of were issues raised, but there was no theme or coherence other than throwing stones, whereas on this side of the chamber the Australian people heard questions about international security—the threat from North Korea, a matter of genuine substance and a matter of genuine concern to the Australian people.


We as a government are getting on with the issue of national security. We are getting on with the issue of economic security. When we're talking of economic security, we are talking about ensuring that we are getting the budget deficit back into shape and getting it down to zero so that we can then start paying back the debt—a legacy of Labor. I note that there are schoolchildren watching this particular debate. The legacy that the Australian Labor Party has left them and all their fellow schoolchildren, right around Australia, is a legacy of deficit and debt that they will be repaying through—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Resume your seat please, Senator Abetz. Senator Polley?




Senator Polley:
  I know there's usually some lenience, but there is nothing in Senator Abetz's contribution today that relates to the questions that I took note of.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Abetz, I do remind you that taking note is in relation to responses from Senators Brandis, Scullion and Nash. I also appreciate this is a wide-ranging debate, so please continue.




Senator ABETZ:
  You always know you've got the Australian Labor Party on the run when they make spurious points of order to try to stop the train of thought and the flow of the conversation that we on this side are seeking to have with the Australian people. The conversation that we are seeking to have with the Australian people is to highlight and juxtapose what the Australian Labor Party spends question time on in comparison to what the government spends question time on. You do the compare and contrast, you do the juxtaposition and you see that one side is fit and proper for purpose, namely, for the service of the Australian people.


Getting back to the point I was making, the young people of Australia today will be faced with paying off the deficit and debt left to them by a profligate Labor government during the 2007-13 period. This indebtedness is a result of Labor seeing a problem—immediate answer: throw money at it! Like they did with education—a huge increase in education expenditure with a huge decline in outcomes, confirming to everybody that expenditure does not necessarily relate to good outcomes.



Opposition senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator ABETZ:
  We as a government are getting on with the job of bringing the budget back into shape.


Similarly, we are dealing with the issue of energy costs, something which impacts every single Australian, like a pensioner hoping to be able to heat their house in winter or cooling it in summer. It's a huge issue for every single pensioner in this country. It is an issue for the household budget, where mums and dads are trying desperately to keep the household budget in shape. It is of impact to the farmer, to the small businessman and, indeed, to the large manufacturers. Every single Australian is impacted by energy policy, and we have been left with a legacy from the Australian Labor Party and an approach by the Australian Labor Party where they would make the current problems so much worse, impacting our pensioners, our families, our small businesses and our farmers and manufacturers even more than they are impacted today. The government is getting on with the task. Labor can keep on throwing rocks and getting engaged in the personal vilification, but we will not be distracted from serving the Australian people.

"Watt, Sen Murray",ALP,2017-09-12,"



Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (15:21):  I rise to take note of answers by Senator Brandis and Senator Nash in relation to energy. It wasn't that long ago, we all remember, that promises were made by Malcolm Turnbull, Tony Abbott and other ministers in this government that, if they were elected to office, energy bills and electricity bills would fall by $550 all around Australia. But, of course, this is just one of those many promises that we saw from the Liberals that were broken as soon as they got into office. Whether it was about cuts to health care, cuts to education or cuts to electricity prices, the minute they got elected all of those promises were out the window.


What we've actually seen in reality is wholesale electricity prices double over the four years that this government has been in office. Every time we have ministers from this government get up and complain about energy prices, they need to have a look in the mirror, because they are the people who are responsible for this failure. And, unfortunately, ordinary Australians are paying the price through higher electricity bills. Every single solution that has been proposed to fix this has been blocked by elements within this government—the extreme right of the Liberal Party ganging up with the National Party—to kill off the carbon pollution reduction scheme from the Rudd and Gillard government and the emissions intensity scheme, something supported by the government's own Chief Scientist. Most recently, they have been ganging up to kill off the clean energy target, the latest suggestion by the Chief Scientist to try to bring energy prices under control.


Now, why is this happening? As I say, it is because of the ganging up between the extreme right within the Liberal Party and National Party members of this government who are so blinded by their ideology that they have lost sight of the best solutions we have to try to bring energy prices under control. There is no issue on which they are more blinded by ideology than their obsessive opposition to renewable energy. Even just this weekend we saw it from the National Party again. They met up for their national conference in Canberra, and what did they decide to do? They decided to remove all subsidies for renewable energy. We are yet to hear from ministers on whether this decision from the National Party is actually going to be put into practice by this government. They are the junior partner in this coalition government, and you would think that decisions from their national conference would actually carry some weight. And this decision to remove subsidies from renewable projects is obviously bad for the environment, but it is equally bad for jobs, particularly in regional Queensland, in the state that I come from.


Every day, we hear from the National Party that they are the party that represents regional Queensland and regional Australia. In actual fact, if you look at their record, they do nothing more than let down regional Australia, and they are doing it again here through their obsessive determination to kill off renewables and to kill off jobs in renewable energy right across Queensland. This decision from the federal National Party would kill thousands of jobs in renewable energy projects right across regional Queensland. Now, don't just believe me when I'm saying this. From the government's own renewable energy body, ARENA, the Australian Renewable Energy Authority—its own reports say that due to ARENA's own federal government funding it will support 2,300 direct jobs in the Australian regions, and thousands of indirect jobs in creating new renewable energy projects right across Australia. In Queensland alone, there are a number of projects that are being supported by federal government funding that would not go ahead without it, and we would see hundreds of jobs sacrificed at the altar of the National Party's ideological opposition to renewables.


There are 500 jobs at the Kidston solar farm near Georgetown in north Queensland, 200 jobs at the Whitsunday Solar Farm near Collinsville in Central Queensland, 175 jobs at the Barcaldine Solar Farm in Central Queensland, another 120 jobs at the Collinsville solar power station in Central Queensland, 30 jobs at the Longreach Solar Farm in Central Queensland and, in south-west Queensland, 50 jobs at the Oakey Solar Farm. Just that handful of projects adds up to about a 1,000 jobs in regional Queensland that are only happening because of this federal government's support for renewable energy. We don't think it's as strongly supportive as it should be, but the Nationals actually want to kill off these subsidies and kill off these thousands of jobs in Queensland and right across Australia. The Nationals do not support regional Australia. They need to get behind these projects. (Time expired)

Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (15:26):  I was very grateful to have the opportunity to participate in the MPI debate yesterday, initiated by the Labor Party, on energy. So I'm even more delighted to have an opportunity to re-emphasise some of the points that I made yesterday and to add some new ones to this very important debate. I thank them, again, for bringing this important issue before us. Senator Watt's contribution leant heavily on the theme of ideology, and he accused the coalition of being ideological in our approach to energy when we know that nothing could be further from the truth and we know that the only ideological parties on this question are, in fact, the Labor Party and the Greens.


The coalition has an agnostic approach to energy. We don't feel the need to pick and choose and to support winners above others within the energy market. We think it would be a great thing if renewable energy prospered, just as we think that other forms of energy that meet our energy needs should grow and prosper. That may include, and should include, base load traditional sources of energy such as coal and gas. One of the other common refrains from those opposite in this debate is that what we need and what we lack in this policy space is certainty and, if only the energy industry had certainty, then prices would be stable or may even fall. But the truth is that part of the energy industry already has certainty, and that's the renewable part of the energy industry.


The renewable part of the industry has certainty, and we know that they do because there's been record investments in renewable in recent years under this government and under the policies of this government. In 2016, large-scale renewable energy investment was at a record high, and it was five times greater than it was in 2015. More than $4 billion has been committed over the last year in renewable energy investment. Of the 98 new power plants accredited in 2016, 86 were solar and, just in case you are not clear, zero were gas and zero were coal. Small-scale renewable investment was also strong with 182,000 new installations last year. So there's no lack of certainty for the renewable energy industry. There is a lack of certainty for other players in the energy market, and they are providers of traditional thermal base-load power, such as coal or gas—an essential part of the energy mix for the foreseeable future until we can get to a system that somehow can provide sufficient backup or reserves, because we know that renewable energy is variable and unreliable due to weather conditions.


Why don't coal and gas have certainty? Why isn't anyone investing in these products? Why hasn't a power plant of these types been built for the last 10 years in Australia? Because they're lacking certainty. And their lack of certainty is a future Labor government. They know there is a chance of a future Labor government, and they know when it comes their business model could be completely smashed by a carbon tax, an emissions trading scheme, an emission intensity scheme or what other new name the Labor Party comes up with for its plans to tax energy production. For an investor in a coal-fired power station—even a new high-efficiency, low-emissions one—or in a gas-fired power station, when they're contemplating their 30-year return on investment that they need for their business model to work, they know that they don't have the certainty they need.


I think it's also worth unpacking exactly what the Labor Party and the Greens mean by certainty when they're talking about the renewable energy industry. Normally, when businesses are seeking certainty what they are seeking is a stable policy environment, secure property rights and certainty around taxation to make sure that, basically, they can run their own business without intervention and be confident that they'll get a reasonable return on their investment. That's the certainty that most businesses seek. 


The certainty that the Labor Party and the Greens are seeking on behalf of the renewable energy industry is not property rights certainty; it is not stable tax arrangements; it is certainty of subsidies. Senator Watt admitted it in his own contribution to this debate. He said that the renewable energy industry requires subsidies in order to succeed. They need subsidies. So the certainty they seek is taxpayers and energy users—consumers—continuing to pay renewable energy companies, even when their products are not competitive, when they're not economic, to have that certainty of return. The coalition doesn't believe in this approach. The coalition believes, as I said earlier, in an agnostic approach that allows all forms of energy to compete fairly and evenly and allows those which have the best model to succeed. We're not in the business of picking winners and choosing winners.


The idea that there is some risk to the renewable energy industry from the removal of subsidies completely undercuts their argument that renewables are currently cost competitive. We heard in this debate only yesterday from Senator McAllister that renewables are cost competitive, that they are efficient, that they are, in fact, even cheaper than traditional forms of energy. Why do they need subsidies then? For what purpose should we subsidise an alternative energy source which is apparently more efficient and cheaper? It shouldn't be necessary at all. They should be able to survive on their own two feet. The truth is that those opposite know that they are not yet ready to survive on their own two feet. Perhaps they will be one day. Hopefully, they will be one day. But the truth is, right now, today, they need subsidies, and those opposite are calling for certainty of taxpayer subsidies.

Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (15:31):  Well, the Nationals certainly weren't very agnostic on the weekend, were they? We saw what came in, echoing the thoughts of the right wing of the Liberal Party and trying to kill off the clean energy target. That's not very agnostic at all. It's no wonder that we see so much chaos, dysfunction and misinformation coming from those opposite. 


You only have to look at the inconsistency from the leadership of the federal government. We've had the Treasurer, Scott Morrison, walk into the chamber carrying a lump of coal. We've seen him say he is for coal-fired power generation; we've seen him say he's against coal-fired power generation. We've seen the Prime Minister say he's for coal-fired power generation and we've seen him say he's against coal-fired power generation. This is all in recent months. It is because of a lack of leadership from the Prime Minister that this is happening. 


There is no clear direction on energy from the federal government of Australia. I'm going to break it down into three parts: their record since they were elected; their record since the Finkel report came down; and their record when it comes to long-term policy decision-making. In each one of these areas, they are severely lacking. 


A few people have talked about their record since they got elected. We know that former Prime Minister Abbott promised that power bills would be lowered by $550, yet here we are four years later and they're up almost $1,000 around the country. We know they had a war on renewables, halting investment in new generation and halting job creation at the same time. Following a question from Senator McAllister today, we know that they've overseen 4,000 megawatts of generation exit the market, including Hazelwood. 


The true tragedy of Hazelwood closing was the fact that that community and those workers got six months to prepare. That is absolutely ridiculous, but that is what happened on this government's watch. Yet here they are crying crocodile tears for the workers at Liddell, when that company has been responsible in giving significant notice and coming up with a plan to transition those workers into other jobs. Yet that side are prepared to play politics. We have the Minister for the Environment and Energy, the faux friend of the worker, Josh Frydenberg, suddenly saying he is concerned for those workers and wanting to provide an ongoing future for them. It is playing politics with their lives. What we saw with Hazelwood is their true record when it comes to it. 


Their record since they were elected is a sorry one, but their record since Finkel was released is just as dire. More than three months ago now the Finkel report came down. What have we seen in regard to the clean energy target? No progress whatsoever. In fact, based on what we saw at the weekend, it's probably regressed. They're making no progress at all in trying to reach an agreement within the coalition, let alone talking to the Labor Party to provide that certainty that so many people have spoken about. We've seen numerous examples of the Prime Minister having cups of tea with energy retailers, yet the best we've seen out of that is a letter. That's all consumers are going to see by the end of the year: they're going to get a letter. That's the best the Prime Minister could do.


Then, when it comes to the long-term policy and his discussions with AGL, every time they have a meeting we get different reports. The Treasurer and the energy minister say they have agreed that they will look at selling it, and then AGL contradict that. We have seen in the last 24 hours similar examples where the records of the government and of AGL are quite different. This is the chaos and dysfunction that we're seeing from that side with regard to energy. Today we put questions to Senator Scullion around the domestic gas security mechanism. We have seen uncertainty around its legitimacy because it was brought in by Senator Canavan. When asked about it yesterday, this was the response from Senator Brandis: 'We have restricted gas exports.' It was clear today, from the nonanswer from Senator Scullion, that they have done nothing like that as yet. We know that they have time to do it, but so far they have done nothing on that, contradicting the answer that we had from Senator Brandis yesterday. And there has been no action on the five-minute settlement when it comes to wholesale power prices, something that has been identified that can drive down costs. This is the record of the government when it comes to long-term energy policy. It is a sorry tale indeed. Overall what we are seeing under the government is prices up, pollution up, reliability down and a government that blame everyone else because they have a lack of leadership to settle a long-term policy for the benefit of Australians.

   (v) the Queensland Government’s Reef Water Quality Independent Science Panel’s 2017 Consensus Statement explained that key ecosystems continue to be in poor condition and that current initiatives will not meet water quality targets,


   (vi) the Independent Science Panel also made a separate statement that the 2016 and 2017 bleaching events are likely to be unprecedented in human history and that, to protect the reef, global average temperature rises would need to be limited to 1.2° celsius;


(b) calls on all senators and members to visit the reef to see first-hand the mass coral bleaching being caused by climate change; and


(c) calls on the Government to:


   (i) set specific climate objectives in the Reef 2050 plan, and

Senator McGRATH:
  The Australian and Queensland governments agreed at the recent Great Barrier Reef Ministerial Forum to bring forward a planned update to the Reef 2050 Plan. The Australian government is strongly committed to boosting the health and resilience of the reef through the Reef 2050 Plan. Our projections show that both governments will invest more than $2 billion in protecting the reef over a decade, including through key measures such as improving water quality and by culling crown-of-thorns starfish. In July 2017, UNESCO praised Australia's work in implementing the Reef 2050 Plan.

The speech read as follows—



Mr President, I am proud to present the Parliamentary Business Resources Amendment (Voluntary Opt-out) Bill 2017. This measure was a core commitment of mine to the people of Queensland and Australia, to whom I serve, after the recent outrageous pay rises of parliamentarians, coming off the back of stagnating wages growth over the last decade. 


Everyday Australians would be appalled to know that not only do politicians constantly gleefully accept pay rises, but if one of their more modest colleagues wants to refuse acceptance of that pay rise they are unable to do so. 


As stated in the explanatory memorandum, the purpose of this bill is to for provide Senators and Members the option to 'opt-out' of receiving any or all of their entitlements. There is currently no mechanism available for Senators or Members to opt-out of receiving part or all of their entitlements. This bill will allow Senators or Members to provide, by written notice, that they wish to no longer receive part or all of their entitlements. 


Australians want a higher level of performance from their politicians. All too often the political elites let everyday Australians down. Pay is no exception. 


If it is the case that the major parties want to band together and allow perpetual pay increases for politicians, so be it. However it is incumbent upon those with their snout in the trough to allow those who have respect for the Australian people to opt-out of a pay rise if they so wish. 


Any politician who does not vote for this bill is sending a clear message to the Australian people that they lack respect for their fellow parliamentarians to refuse a pay rise, and what is worse, they lack respect for the Australian people. 


The Australian people have the right to analyse who among those elected are the ones that want more pay, and who are the ones that are willing to take a haircut on their take home pay.


Some of us stand on the side of battling everyday Aussies, the rest will vote against this bill.

  I table an explanatory memorandum and seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



This bill will provide seriously or terminally ill patients, whose doctors believe medicinal cannabis will relieve their suffering, with rapid access to these treatments.


The bill makes two crucial amendments to the Customs Act 1901 and the Narcotic Drugs Act 1967 to give faster access to medicinal cannabis for those patients with illnesses from which they are reasonably likely to die within a matter of months, or from which premature death is reasonably likely to occur in the absence of early treatment.


This bill:


1) Allows access to Australian medicinal cannabis products through Special Access Scheme Category A; and


2) Ensures the government cannot block Special Access Scheme Category A access to imported medicinal cannabis products via import licence conditions.


The Special Access Scheme (SAS) of the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) provides a pathway to provide for the import and/or supply of a therapeutic good that is not registered on the Australian Register for Therapeutic Goods (ARTG), for a single patient, on a case by case basis. 


The SAS allows doctors to prescribe the most appropriate treatments to their patients even when that treatment is not yet registered.


While there are different categories under the SAS, category A only applies to those patients whose doctor believes their condition meets the definition established by the regulator, specifically ""patients who are seriously ill with a condition from which death is reasonably likely to occur within a matter of months, or from which premature death is reasonably likely to occur in the absence of early treatment.""


The regulatory requirements for the category A pathway involve a notification to the TGA by the doctor, and reflect the seriousness of the condition of patients who meet the eligibility criteria for this category.


Any unapproved therapeutic good can potentially be prescribed by a doctor and supplied via the SAS except drugs in schedule 9 of the Poisons Standard (where the manufacture, possession, sale or use is prohibited by State or Territory law). Schedule 9 drugs cannot be accessed through the SAS Category A process.


When the TGA rescheduled medicinal cannabis treatments from schedule 9 of the Poisons Standard to schedule 8 in November 2016, these treatments became eligible for supply via category A of the SAS for those eligible. However, the Government cynically sought to cut off this access to these terminally ill patients by blocking category A access for Australian produced medicinal cannabis in the Narcotic Drugs Amendment Act 2016, and introducing a disallowable instrument to block category A access for importation of international medicinal cannabis.


On 13 June 2017, the Senate voted to disallow the instrument blocking category A access to imported medicinal cannabis. This made it unlawful to prevent importation of medicinal cannabis via category A of the SAS. Despite this, the government wrote to all those suppliers with import licences, telling them that they would not be permitted to import under category A due to a condition in their import licence. They included in that letter a veiled threat that their licence would be in jeopardy should suppliers seek to import under category A.


This action by the government is condemned, and the first amendment this bill makes ensures that the government cannot block importation under category A by relying on conditions of import licences.


The disallowance motion that the Senate supported in June this year related only to imported medicinal cannabis treatments. In introducing the Narcotic Drugs Amendment Act 2016, the government blocked category A access for Australian medicinal cannabis treatments.


The second amendment this bill makes is to ensure that Australian medicinal cannabis, along with imported medicinal cannabis, is accessible via category A of the SAS. This not only ensures that emerging Australian medicinal cannabis suppliers are not disadvantaged; it also ensures that when Australian medicinal cannabis treatments become available, terminally ill patients will be able to access them rapidly. 


This bill is about securing access to medicinal cannabis for those Australian patients who need it most, in the face of needless cruelty and red-tape from this government. 


I commend it to the Senate.

(b) on 7 September 2017, the Minister for Defence tabled a letter in response claiming public interest immunity, and stated that release of such documents would potentially damage national security, damage international relations and adversely affect the Department of Defence's negotiation position in respect of future contracts;


(c) information on Australian Industry Capability and the partnering or use of Australian shipyards, and how Techport and other Australian facilities might be used in the program are not matters that would reasonably attract a security classification – the order for production of documents does not seek access to any documents that have been marked with national security markings, only unclassified data;


(d) the tender is restricted to three foreign companies: BAE Systems, Fincantieri and Navantia – a claim that disclosing documents passed to three commercial companies could in some way affect Australia's international relations is not a reasonable claim;


(e) the Government is seeking to negotiate a contract that prevents established Australian shipbuilders and their workers from a lead role in Australia's Continuous Naval Shipbuilding Program – this approach will have the opposite effect of a creating a sovereign capability – contract negotiations under the current tender arrangements will be harmful to Australian industry and national security; and


(f) on 16 July 1975, the Senate laid out by resolution its position with respect to public interest immunity claims – paragraph 4 of that resolution makes it clear that, while the Senate may permit claims of public interest immunity to be advanced, it reserves the right to determine whether a particular claim will be accepted.

The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
) (16:19):  I inform the Senate that, at 8.30 am today, 13 proposals were received in accordance with standing order 75. The question of which proposal would be submitted to the Senate was determined by lot. As a result, I inform the Senate that the following letter has been received from Senator Whish-Wilson:


Pursuant to standing order 75, I propose that the following matter of public importance be submitted to the Senate for discussion:


'The devastating storms and floods that have occurred in South Asia and the Americas, and the threat posed to Australia's natural resources, call for urgent action on global warming.'


Is the proposal supported?



More than the number of senators required by the standing orders having risen in their places—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I understand that informal arrangements have been made to allocate specific times to each of the speakers in today's debate. With the concurrence of the Senate, I shall ask the clerks to set the clock accordingly.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (16:20):  There's no more important time to be reflecting on what a future of climate change looks like than now, when we are seeing such extreme weather events all around the world. It's not a future that any of us want, and we still have time to do something about it if we act. I know you've heard a lot from the Greens on this issue. I will take up Senator Birmingham's challenge from question time last week to actually hear from some climate scientists on this issue. I've been following several. There have been hundreds that have been speaking out on this issue in recent weeks around Hurricane Irma in the US. Mr Jon Foley said:


I'm mad. We climate scientists have been warning people about climate change for decades, and politicians deliberately wasted that time.


Scientists generally aren't political beings; they tend to operate outside of our political sphere, but many scientists are recognising now that science, especially climate science, is increasingly political. They understand that politics has failed to tackle the challenges of climate. It's failed the Great Barrier Reef. Recently, it looks very much like a future of climate change is upon us.


I want to read to you a couple of quotes. The Mayor of Miami—a Republican mayor, may I say—whose citizens were recently evacuated, said, 'If not now, when do we discuss climate change?' He said:


This is the time to talk about climate change. This is the time that the president and the EPA and whoever makes decisions needs to talk about climate change. If this isn't climate change, I don't know what is.



The New York Times recently posted an excellent article. They sought out the views of key climate scientists, many who actually live in Florida. Here's a sample of what some of them had to say. Professor Ben Kirtman, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, said he believes it's more important to be discussing climate change around events like Irma. He said:


It's precisely the conversation that we should be having right now. I'm not sure what’s insensitive about that. It's really important to direct resources and funds to the crisis on the ground at the moment, of course.


He also said that we need to be talking about future consequences. Another scientist, Professor Leonard Berry, a former Director of the Center for Environmental Studies at Florida Atlantic University, said:


Immediately afterward we've got to say 'Come on guys, let's really see if this is a harbinger of the future.' And it clearly is to those of us who have looked even generally at the issue. One should be sensitive, but not stupid.


President Trump, as we know, has derided climate change as a hoax. He's looking to cut significant funding to US climate programs. Another climate scientist, Katharine Hayhoe, an atmospheric scientist at Texas Tech University, said:


We know that as humans, we are all too good at pretending like a risk, even one we know is real, doesn't matter to us.


She wrote:


When we try to warn people about the risks, there's no 'news' hook. No one wants to listen. That's why the time to talk about it is now. The most pernicious and dangerous myth we've bought into when it comes to climate change is not the myth that it isn't real or humans aren't responsible. It's the myth that it doesn't matter to me. And that is exactly the myth that Harvey shatters.


I also have some quotes from Australian scientists that I won't be able to read out now. Climate change is here on us now. We should be discussing this. How are we going to act to prevent more of these damaging storms in the future? By cutting emissions— (Time expired)

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (16:24):  I too rise to speak on this so-called matter of public importance. But, unlike those opposite, what I would like to do is begin by expressing my deepest condolences to the victims of the recent natural disasters that have been cited, which have tragically claimed the lives of several thousand people and devastated local communities. 


I'm extremely proud that Australia has a leading role in international humanitarian responses to disasters, and we play a particularly important role in the Indo-Pacific region in combating the impacts of these natural disasters. Australia will invest another $12.3 million over three years in the World Bank's Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery to help build greater resilience in our region. I would point out that this government has increased Australia's humanitarian aid budget by 18 per cent for this financial year to support neighbouring countries' preparation and responses to these incidents. I'm very proud in particular that our wonderful ADF provides such brilliant support and humanitarian relief following natural disasters overseas.


The natural disasters affecting South Asia and the Americas, which are cited in this so-called MPI, are tragic, and their victims deserve to be treated with the utmost respect and sympathy, as do all victims of other natural disasters that have occurred and continue to occur around the globe. But I've got to say I am utterly appalled that some in this place have sought to conflate and exploit these particular tragedies for their own almost evangelical purposes—and I think that the Spanish inquisitors would have envied their religious zealotry on this issue. 


Yes, the climate has always been changing, for over 650,000 years. We've had seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, and for the last 7,000 years we have been in this current climate phase. Does the climate change? Absolutely. Do I think that climate is impacted by human activity? Most probably. But for those opposite to again use these disasters to try and make some political capital is quite appalling. 


I know every single person in this place wants to leave the world, and certainly the environment, in a better place than it was when we inherited it, but not at the cost of energy security, affordability and Australian jobs today. We have to be cognisant of our environment and how best to protect it, but it cannot be at the expense of Australians' livelihoods and their standard of living. This chamber and this place cannot be guided by the blind ideological zealotry that those on the crossbenches—in this case the Greens—display. 


In contrast, this government has set strong, responsible and achievable emissions reduction targets. We understand that there is a dilemma at play here. We do need—and we on this side absolutely accept the need—to transition to a lower emissions future whilst still providing affordable and secure energy for hardworking, everyday Australians and their families, a concern that those opposite clearly do not have. Rather than being guided by blind ideology and always being on the watch for consequences that are sometimes of biblical proportions—plagues, floods and things that have been predicted for 2,000 or 3,000 years—



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator REYNOLDS:
  Those opposite, when they're talking about this, actually sound like these great evangelical preachers.



Opposition senators interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Order on my left!




Senator REYNOLDS:
  I rest my case, Mr Acting Deputy President. They can't even allow other people speaking on this issue to be heard in silence. They have to shout us down because they don't like hearing what we think about what they're doing. But, rather than being guided by blind ideology and always, as I said, being on the watchout for consequences of biblical proportions—signs that the world is about to end, plagues, floods, pestilence—those on this side take a much more responsible approach. We do want to improve our environment, we do want to reduce our emissions, but not at the cost of all Australians.


Australia produces just 1.3 per cent of global emissions, as my colleague Senator Macdonald is fond of pointing out in this chamber. We do believe it is important, which is why we've joined the global response to climate change. It is why Australia and this government ratified the Paris Agreement in November 2016. Australia does make a strong contribution to the negotiations and implementations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Sometimes I think that's why those opposite get so, so evangelical about this whole issue—they can't stand the fact that other people actually care about the environment and want to do something, but, again, not at all costs and not to the cost of all Australians, to their jobs and to their livelihoods and affordability. They're always talking about affordability, but the direct implications of their berserk and bizarre policy of having renewable energy at all costs at 12 per cent and increasing it when we don't have the adequate base power is impacting on all Australians. Shame on you for actually using the disasters in other places to—

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2017-09-12,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:31):  I rise also to speak on this matter of public importance from Senator Whish-Wilson on the devastating storms and floods in South Asia and the Americas and the threat posed to Australia's natural resources. It calls for urgent action on global warming. It is a topic of debate with which we on this side have no issue. We have long stood for urgent action on global warming. It is important for Australian households and businesses and it is vital for people living in areas of our world who face a high frequency of natural disasters. But I do wonder where would this debate be if in 2009, before Senator Whish-Wilson and I were in this place, his predecessors Senator Milne and Senator Bob Brown had supported the original Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Climate change was an urgent policy area in 2009, which is why we introduced the Clean Energy Future package—to provide a mechanism that would ensure prices were affordable, to ensure our electricity infrastructure was reliable and to ensure that we promoted technology that is sustainable, low carbon and, where possible, carbon free. 


It is a tragic debate that has plagued this nation for the past decade, and it remains an urgent policy area now in 2017. But, of course, when the Greens did support Labor on climate change action in 2011, the mechanism within the legislation to reduce carbon pollution was almost identical to that in the earlier 2009 bill. With a delay of two years, all that was achieved was the creation of space for Mr Abbott to launch his dangerous, ill-informed scare campaign—a scare campaign that his former senior adviser Peta Credlin admitted this year was all about politics and nothing about economics or the environment. It is important to point out the delay of two years enabled Mr Abbott to take the leadership and commit the next five years to the repealing of the carbon price. However, he failed to replace it with any credible climate change or energy policies after it was repealed. So, when the Greens get up in this place and say we must take urgent action on climate change, I agree, but I remind them of their ideological move in 2009, when they were unable to accept a proposal that would have had the support of all Labor and the majority of the coalition. No, that just wasn't good enough for them. The failure to legislate for the CPRS back then is a big part of the reason we are where we are in this country now, and it set in train the climate change policy calamity of the years to come. 


Regardless of the political history, this is a timely matter of public importance. With the destruction we've seen in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, the Caribbean and the southern United States, urgent action is desperately needed both to mitigate the impacts of climate change and to limit climate change itself. In the week that the Turnbull government is seeking to strongarm AGL into selling or keeping open the Liddell power station and in the week that the National Party passed a motion at its national conference to end all subsidies to renewable energy, we're presented with this matter of public importance on urgent action on climate change. 


While the wording of this MPI is a little hard to understand, I commend Senator Whish-Wilson for including both the devastating floods in South Asia as well as the hurricane in the Caribbean and southern United States. Too often the debate is focussed on Australia and our immediate allies, when natural disasters know no borders and when millions of people in less developed countries face homelessness, loss of livelihoods and, indeed, loss of life. In The Sydney Morning Herald yesterday, Peter Hartcher, wrote an article, 'Five big global crises that got worse while the world watched Hurricane Irma'. Tucked in at No. 5 was climate change. Mr Hartcher wrote: 'Climate change gathers force.' He said that three climate scientists from Scientific Americanwrote: 'The strongest storms are getting stronger.' They said:


... it is not likely to be a coincidence that almost all of the ... hurricanes on record ... have occurred over the past two years.


Critically, it is now possible to confidently attribute certain weather events and natural disasters directly to climate change. Rephrasing that, we can now attribute the incidents of an individual natural disaster to climate change. What does that mean? Simply, it means we need to act. We need to act now. The old saying, 'You can't attribute any single extreme global event to global warming,' is indeed a mark of the past because the science has moved on and, to be frank, the time for debate has expired.


In South Asia, entire villages remain under water and 40 million people are trying desperately to rebuild their lives. Forty million people—that's basically twice our population; two times the population of Australia—have spent over a month with their villages under water, their crop lands destroyed, no access to clean water and nowhere to bury their relatives and friends who have passed away. In the Caribbean, 34 people are known to have passed away. While fewer people are affected than in South Asia, the stories of devastation are similar.


We're not without threat. Our cyclones and wildfires are getting more intense and more frequent, and many of our near neighbours in the Pacific are already facing permanent displacement. There has been no pause in climate change, no slowdown in temperature rises and no reduction in natural disasters, and yet there has been complete inaction from the government. Yes, they went to Paris and they signed up to the Paris agreement. Yes, they maintained that Australia must comply with our international obligations. But they failed to see the huge benefits, both economically and environmentally, that can flow to Australia from having strong action on climate change. They go to the opening of a renewable energy project and pretend to support the workers there, but they offer no support when they come back to Canberra.


The Paris agreement is our world's first comprehensive climate agreement. It's the culmination of decades of negotiations and decades of scientific research. The Paris agreement has three aims: holding the increasing temperatures below two degrees, increasing our ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and improving financing pathways for low greenhouse gas emissions energy development. For Australia to meet our obligations under the Paris agreement, we need a government that is willing to act; a government that's capable of reaching a compromise; a government that puts the planet and people at the forefront; a government that will admit that it was wrong in 2013 when it repealed the carbon price without replacing it with any legal mechanism to ensure that Australia tackles climate change; and a government that will admit that it was wrong in 2013 when it left Australia without a path to help industry, households and businesses reduce emissions. We have a government that won't introduce policies that give Australia a chance of making our contribution to holding the increasing temperatures below two degrees; a government that isn't interested in supporting Australians and the people of our region to adapt to climate change; and a government that is deeply divided over finding ways to finance and build new low-emissions technology and renewable energy technology.


It's time for Mr Turnbull to show some leadership on climate change; stop the cheap, baseless politics made famous by his predecessor, Mr Abbott; pull his rogue junior partner into line; enact a sector-wide energy policy that will ensure that prices are affordable for Australian households and businesses; and ensure we have an energy system that is reliable, sustainable and promotes new low-carbon and carbon-free technologies.


Labor is offering to work with the government to find middle ground here and set a place in the future for a credible low-carbon energy policy—a suite of policies on climate change to ensure that we do our bit to reduce carbon emissions, that we are able to adapt and manage the devastating impacts of the disasters that we know have been caused naturally, and that there are appropriate incentives in place to see the rollout of renewable energy technology. The matter of public importance today is timely, and it's vital that we see this debate both in terms of Australian households and businesses and in terms of the natural disasters around the world, because they are increasing in severity, they are increasing in frequency and they are directly related to climate change. We need leadership from this Prime Minister on what was once a central tenet of his political purpose, leadership from Mr Turnbull that is sorely lacking. We need urgent action on climate change in this country. Labor have consistently said that we will work with the government to achieve a lasting solution, but we need the government to come to the table and take this matter seriously.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (16:41):  It seems that the mantra of the Greens party is 'never let a natural disaster go to waste'. While disaster footage beams into our living rooms on the 24/7 media cycle, they make sure that it comes with the general complaints of: 'See, I told you so! The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are imminent unless all you little people out there change your ways, repent and live a life of green virtue and subsistence.' In times gone by, it was the bloke with the sandwich board on the corner that was caricatured in all the movies saying, 'The end is nigh!' and it was because of his religious conviction. Now we've got a religious conviction of a different form, and it resides within the Greens. When hurricanes form or hit, they blame it on global warming. When bushfires strike, they blame it on global warming. When there's too little rain or snow, they blame it on global warming. When there's too much rain or snow, they blame it on global warming. But they won't explain why the Bureau of Meteorology makes temperature records disappear to suit the mantra that has been emanating from the politically correct for far too long. They have record hot, record cold, record dry, record wet—it doesn't matter, because it's all the responsibility of mankind.


The only real threat to Australia's plentiful natural resources is the Greens and their growing band of useful zealots. At every turn, they try to prevent us from digging up our vast coal, gas and uranium resources. When we're lucky enough to bring them to the surface, we're not allowed to use them in this country, according to the Greens; we have to send them off overseas for someone else to use. That only prevents us, including the elderly and the infirm, from using warmth in winter and accessing cool in summer.


The latest mad green changes, rushed through parliament yesterday with the assent of the few Libs and Nats who bothered to even know what they were voting on, will begin to phase out the engines we typically use to boat, to fish, to dirtbike, to mow or to blow leaves with. This is the green agenda coming to life in this place. These crazy, obsessive busybodies are a threat to not just our natural resources but, increasingly, our enjoyment and our way of life. There seems to be no stopping the madness and zealotry of this Greens ideology, which seems to harbour and incubate most effectively within five to 10 kilometres of our larger central business districts and, increasingly, in our school system. These are the real threats to our resources and our very existence. They should be ashamed of their misuse and abuse of natural disasters, which have a real and catastrophic effect on many individuals, for their base political games. This place deserves better. Australia deserves better.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (16:44):  The storms and floods in South Asia and the Americas have devastated and displaced millions of people. We extend our condolences to the victims, and our thoughts and prayers are with them. The impacts of hurricanes Irma, Jose and Katia continue to be felt in Mexico, the Caribbean and the United States, compounded of course by the 8.1 magnitude earthquake that struck Mexico. In South Asia, heavy rain during the monsoon season has resulted in widespread and significant flooding and landslides across Nepal, Bangladesh and India.


The Australian government has responded by providing $2 million to the international relief effort, including $1 million through our humanitarian partnership with Australian non-government organisations and $1 million through the World Food Programme. Our assistance will deliver emergency shelter, food, clean water and health care for those who have been affected by the disaster. Our contribution to the World Food Programme will enable it give assistance to almost 6,000 children under the age of five and over 1,500 pregnant and nursing mothers for moderate and acute malnutrition in the worst-affected areas. In addition to this support, Australia is providing essential hygiene supplies and vital health services to over 6,000 women and girls. Australia commends the government of Nepal for its leadership in coordinating response efforts across the country.


As Minister for International Development and the Pacific, I want to say that the Australian government is committed to supporting nations in our region to prepare for, respond to and recover from disasters, and to be able to do this themselves to the greatest extent possible. So I say to Senator Urquhart: can you please get your facts correct before you make wrong assertions? Of course, why let the facts get in the way of spin and a few lies!


In our region, the Australian government is working very hard. We live in one of the most disaster-prone areas of the world. Seven out of 10 of the most disaster-prone countries are in our region. So we are working in a whole range of different ways, especially across the Pacific, to build the important resilience that communities need to meet the next disaster. And that includes helping remote Pacific communities diversify their crops to help them respond better following natural disasters. It includes providing scholarships and education, supporting our NGO partners and deploying technical assistance through mechanisms such as the Australian Civilian Corps.


The Australian government has also launched a new $50 million Australian humanitarian partnership to assist Pacific countries and communities better prepare for and manage disasters. Support for strengthening resilience in the Pacific includes: $33 million over five years in climate and weather services; $17 million over seven years in disaster and climate risk governance; and $2.3 million over two years to assist countries to better access and manage global climate finance, including with the focus on the Green Climate Fund. In a challenging budget environment, we have increased our humanitarian funding by $60 million to almost $400 million, which includes an increase of $20 million in the emergency fund up to $150 million and an allocation of $32.2 million to strengthen Australia and our region's preparedness to respond to disasters.


During a response, we work closely with governments and partners to ensure our efforts meet their needs and supports local action. Australia was also the first and one of the largest supporters when Tropical Cyclone Pam devastated Vanuatu in March 2015. It caused 11 deaths, impacted almost 200,000 people and resulted in $600 million in damage. In the wake of Pam, we committed a $50 million package of assistance, which included: an initial $15 million for immediate relief and early recovery; a further $35 million to support longer term recovery and reconstruction, including aiding economic recovery and repairing and rebuilding critical infrastructure and restoring health and education facilities.


Australia was also the largest contributor to the response to Tropical Cyclone Winston, which hit Fiji in February 2016, causing 44 deaths and impacting over half a million people. Our $35 million assistance package included an initial recovery of immediate relief of $15 million. The rest of it will support longer term recovery and reconstruction to rebuild schools, repair and rebuild health facilities, restore water and sanitation services, and rebuild and repair damaged markets and accommodation facilities for vendors—75 per cent of whom are women.


We are investing over $100 million through bilateral and global partnerships for disaster risk reduction programs. In 2017-18, we will invest $200 million to support the government's five-year $1 billion commitment to addressing climate change. This will support developing countries' climate actions to, most especially, build resilience. Additionally, at last year's Pacific Islands Forum meeting Prime Minister Turnbull announced $300 million over four years for building climate resilience in the Pacific. We are also pleased to support Fiji as part of its COP23 Presidency with a contribution of $6 million—again, demonstrating our commitment to the framework for resilience building and building partnerships in our region.


Irrespective of what one's views are on the issue of climate change, the reality is that in our region we need to deal with the next cyclone; the next climate event which will have catastrophic consequences. The Abbott government committed Australia to a 26 to 28 per cent target as part of our commitments under the Paris agreement, in accordance with a domestic agenda, and the Turnbull government is continuing to work to meet these targets. Our focus is on building practical, day-to-day resilience building.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:51):  Sometimes I wonder what it will take for the climate fundamentalists on the hard right of the coalition to realise that they've got this wrong. When exactly will it be that the penny drops that they have messed this up, and not just a little bit but in a really big way? I wonder this because I am genuinely curious about what more they need in terms of proof of human-induced climate change. Is it scientific proof that they need? For decades now, we've had scientific consensus about the nature and causes of climate change. 


James L Powell, Executive Director of the National Physical Science Consortium, reviewed more than 24,000 peer-reviewed papers on global warming that were published in 2013-14 and, of those, only five reject the reality of rising temperatures or the fact that human emissions are the cause. Maybe scientific evidence isn't enough. Maybe the hard right don't really trust the boffins. Maybe what the hard right need to hear is consensus amongst the hard-nosed element of the business community. Well, the Australian business community is pretty much united in its view that climate change is real and we need to act. Let's have a look at what BHP says—the favourite of the coalition. They state:


Our position on climate change


We accept the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change … assessment of climate change science, which has found that warming of the climate is unequivocal, the human influence is clear and physical impacts are unavoidable.


That's very promising. What else do they say? They talk about their approach and say: 'We believe an effective policy framework should include a complementary set of measures, including a price on carbon, support for low-emissions technology and measures to build resilience.


BHP was one of a whole range of companies, NGOs and community groups that came out this year in support of an EIS, which is Labor's preferred policy. But, as you can see from the debate this year, calls to action from the business community aren't actually enough. They are not enough to move the hard right of the coalition. Maybe they are men who like to see things with their own two eyes. Maybe they don't want to trust models and projections. Maybe they will believe we need to act when we see the effects of climate change happening in the real world. Well, we are there already. We are starting to see the physical phenomena that were predicted by the scientific models. We are seeing melting sea ice. We are seeing an increased incidence of natural disasters, perhaps like having two of the most powerful storms on record hit the US in just two weeks. We are seeing higher than average temperatures consistently and many more severe heat events. All of that leaves you wondering what exactly would be the standard of proof required. Where is there left to go? Will these people only accept the need for action on climate if the sea is lapping at their door? By that stage, it will be too late. All of it would be comic if it weren't sad. The Liberal and National parties have hijacked this country's climate policy and they've stopped us taking real and necessary action. That inaction has costs. 


We've talked a lot about energy in this chamber recently. In part, that is because four years of inaction is starting to bite. You can only get away with not acting on things for so long. Eventually the cracks start to show. The government's refusal to have a real policy on energy didn't bring things to a crashing halt right away—not straightaway—but it did cause a slowdown in investment. Four years later, in the government's fifth year in office, we can see the costs that come with that: ageing infrastructure, higher power bills, higher emissions. We are fast approaching a similar point with the physical risks of climate change. This won't happen all at once, because it never does. But, slowly and gradually, we will be seeing events like Hurricanes Harvey and Irma occurring more and more frequently. The government are doing nothing about it. They have no plan, no credible policy and, seemingly, no-one cares. 


The government might not recognise the risk, but business does. It is becoming standard for big Australian companies to have policies that manage climate risk, and that's because they recognise that the physical effects of climate change pose real risks to their businesses. What does one of Australia's very, very big banks, Westpac, say about it? They say:


Despite the commitment to limit global warming to two degrees, climate change will still cause shifts in weather patterns and increase the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Communities may experience weather events that they are unfamiliar with or for which they are not prepared.


They've got a whole policy about adjusting their business model to deal with the reality of a warming world and what it will do to their market. Telstra, the biggest telecommunications company in Australia, says: 


Increased frequency and severity of extreme weather can damage and disrupt our infrastructure and operations. 


This, in turn, can affect customer service and have wider financial, health and safety implications. We are committed to better understanding the risks posed by climate change to our infrastructure and people, and identifying action to strengthen the climate change resilience within our business.


In the last little while, there's been a sort of allegation that AGL is only taking the decisions it's taking because it has been infiltrated by a single person who once had a relationship with the Labor Party. But, when you look at the range of actions being taken by the largest businesses in Australia, you see a consistency in their approach, which is to recognise that climate change is real and to recognise that it has very real and worrying impacts on business models and to start to work out how to respond to that. 


Transurban, a big manager of transport infrastructure across the country, conducted a series of climate change risk assessments for many of their major projects to assess the potential impacts of a range of climate change scenarios, looking at 2040, 2070 and 2090. The risks they were interested in included: the effect of potential extreme weather events; indirect risks such as the increased risk of power supply interruptions due to heatwaves; and the effect on the expected lifetime of infrastructure due to increased temperatures, heatwaves, rainfall and storm surges. If you manage a whole lot of kit and you manage stuff that is made of concrete, you need to start thinking about what it will mean to have very, very hot days. You need to start thinking about whether that infrastructure is designed to cope with very, very heavy rainfall events which produce much larger levels of run-off than anyone ever predicted when they were building transport infrastructure just a decade ago. 


One of the most exposed sectors, however, is the insurance sector. The Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, warns that over time the adverse effects of climate change could threaten economic resilience and financial stability, and insurers are currently at the forefront. ClimateWise is a coalition of 29 insurers. It includes the industry's biggest names: Allianz, Swiss Re, Zurich and Lloyds. Last year, they issued a report looking at the impact of climate change on their industry, and the outlook isn't good. The report said—and these are big numbers:


Since the 1950s, the frequency of weather-related catastrophes, such as windstorms and floods, has increased six-fold. As climate-related risks occur more often and predictably, previously insurable assets are becoming uninsurable, or those already underinsured further compromised.


These are serious warnings from people who are in the business of assessing risk, and they are telling us that we have a problem. But no-one on the other side of the chamber is listening. The chairman of the Global General Insurance at Aviva said the insurance industry's role as society's risk manager is under threat. He said:


Our sector will struggle to reduce this protection gap if our response is limited to avoiding, rather than managing, society's exposure to climate risk.


People, we have a problem. The complacency with which the coalition approach this issue is extraordinary. It's not just the environment groups, it's not just the opposition, it's not just the scientists warning them; it is business. Business is telling them that it is time to act, but, constrained by the coalition's hard-right partners, they are failing to do so.

Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (17:01):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I rise with enormous pride to say of the Greens' MPI today: what a flog. The Greens have no understanding, let alone any deep understanding, because they rely on opinions, not data. I'll say it again: the Greens have no understanding, let alone any deep understanding, because they rely on opinions, not data. That is why the Greens cannot withstand scrutiny.


Consider recent hurricanes in the North Atlantic and North America. Senator Whish-Wilson's recent claims have been dishonest. Firstly, I want to honour the sad loss of life in the North Atlantic. But, then, I want to say the following facts. In the 10 years from 2007 to 2016, there were 10 hurricanes in the North Atlantic-North America area. In the 10 years from 1950 to 1959, there were 18—almost double. In the 10 years from 1910 to 1919, there were 21—slightly more than double the latest 10 years. And in the 10 years from 1880 to 1889, there were 27 hurricanes in that region—almost three times the current level.


Let's consider the hurricanes that actually make landfall. In the last 12 years, there were none—zip, zero. Strong land-falling cyclones are still declining over the last 120 years even after cyclone Irma. That is why NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, and the UN IPCC itself—that corrupt body—in its latest reports all admit that hurricane activity is decreasing.


Let's look at something else. The Greens don't seem to be worried about deaths. Deaths per year per million population in the USA have deceased from almost nine per million people in 1900 to almost two in 1920 and to almost zero in 2010. They've gone from almost nine deaths per million people per year in 1900 to almost zero in 2010. These are facts—hard, measured data. North America's largest hurricane tragedy was in the Galveston hurricane where thousands died.


Similarly, the empirical evidence shows that there is no change in rainfall or flooding frequency, flooding severity or flooding duration. The floods in Brisbane in the 1890s were greater by far than the floods in any recent period in Brisbane. Drought severity, frequency and duration are lower now than in the past. Snowfall shows no changes. Temperature shows no changes—and I will come back to that. Ocean alkalinity shows no changes—that is the pH level. It's alkaline not acidic, as alarmists like to claim. Ocean alkalinity shows complete uniformity. Sea levels show nothing unusual. Polar ice caps are increasing in the Arctic and fluctuating naturally in the Arctic. There are no changes occurring in climate.


So consider the Greens' implicit warming claimed in their MPI—their last two words were 'global warming'. Let's consider temperatures. In the last 22 years—that's more than half the satellite record, and that's known to be by far the most accurate record for measuring tropospheric, atmospheric temperatures—more than half the temperature records in satellite measurements have shown no warming; no warming at all. In the last 160 years, the longest temperature trend was from the 1930s to 1976—40 years of, wait for it, cooling. And that was at a time when humans increased markedly their production of carbon dioxide. But it cooled. In the 1880s and 1890s in Australia, they were warmer than today; fact. The medieval warming period was warmer by far than today globally. The Roman warming period, 1,000 years or so before the medieval warming period, was warmer again. So there is no warming. In the absence of warming, we heard the claims of 'global warming' morph to 'global climate change'. And now we hear the term 'extreme weather'.


The CSIRO has made three presentations to us since I entered the Senate, and we have torn apart every one of them. I will be speaking more to that in the near future. The CSIRO cannot, in response to our request, prove anything unprecedented in climate. What's more, in the first of their presentations they admitted there is no danger. More to come from that. But I want to get through and discuss the ramifications of this. What the Greens are claiming by distorting the science is anti-human. The reality is that as a result of hydrocarbon fuels and human creativity we have built levies and dams—until the Greens arrived. We can't build them any more in Australia. We have better building codes and better zoning, and we are dropping subsidies for insurance. The data shows that human fatalities have decreased and are continuing to decrease. That's the reality. The fact is that ignorance and deceptions kill. And the poor in India and the poor in Australia pay. That is why the Greens' position is anti-human. I am fiercely pro-human. That's why I devoted nine years to understanding the science, getting the empirical scientific evidence and understanding cause and effect. That is why I remain pro-human.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-09-12,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (17:08):  I want to start my contribution by remembering and grieving for the 1,200 or more people killed by the floods in South Asia and well over 100 by hurricanes Harvey and Irma in the Caribbean and in the US. We have to remember that this debate is about people. We have to remember we are talking about and legislating for people—their lives and wellbeing—and the health and wellbeing of our planet and all of the species that we share our planet with.


That said, can I just share some facts with you—some real facts. The floods in South Asia are the region's worst floods for 40 years, with a metre of rain falling over some areas in the space of days. There are 40 million people affected in Nepal, India and Bangladesh. Hurricane Harvey was a one-in-25,000-year storm. Hurricanes Harvey and Irma are going to cost in clean-up about $100 billion each.


The next fact is that there is absolutely no doubt that the intensity of these storms and the frequency of intense storms are a clear signal of global warming. The science is crystal clear. This is what we experience with 1.3 degrees of warming, and we are on track to four degrees of warming. As Bill McKibben said so eloquently in The Guardian yesterday:


Maybe it was too much to expect that scientists' warnings would really move people. ... Maybe it's like all the health warnings that you should eat fewer chips and drink less soda, which, to judge by belt-size, not many of us pay much mind. Until, maybe, you go to the doctor and he says: ""Whoa, you're in trouble."" Not ""keep eating junk and some day you'll be in trouble"", but: ""You're in trouble right now, today. As in, it looks to me like you've already had a small stroke or two.""


We are in trouble. These hurricanes and storms tell us so, let alone in Australia the death of the Great Barrier Reef and that the climate of Australia's wheat-growing areas is heating to the climate of the central deserts. We ignore this climate catastrophe at our peril.


But our government has no plan. They just want to prop up the clunker of a coalmine—they are falling over themselves to subsidise the Adani coalmine, because the private sector won't touch it because coalmining is an outdated, destructive, dying industry. Then they belittle and ridicule anybody who dares to call out the truth.


Labor, on climate-destroying coal, are sitting on the fence. They need to rule out support for the Adani coalmine. They can't have it both ways. They can't be concerned about global warming on the one hand and wave through the development of the biggest coalmine in Australia's history on the other.


I remain optimistic. We're going to kick this science-denying government out of office and we can swiftly move to a clean future for us all. (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2017-09-12,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (17:11):  I join this debate and echo the words of Senator Fierravanti-Wells. I express my concern and sorrow to those who have been affected by disasters recently and across time immemorial. I'm disappointed that the Greens would use these human tragedies to try to make some cheap political points, as they continue to do.


It's interesting to observe these debates. I don't always agree with Senator Roberts. His view is his own view, but is, it appears to me, a more scientific view than that of anyone else who speaks in these particular discussions. But what I'm interested in is this. When someone like Senator Roberts has a different view from Senator Rice, Senator Hanson-Young and Senator Whish-Wilson, they're treated with disdain and giggling fits and the putting-down of anyone who doesn't happen to follow their ideology. Senator Roberts made some valid points. He quotes the facts of cyclones. I saw this years ago. He has actually said when the cyclones hit, and yet the Greens would tell you that this is a new phenomenon. I remember when Yasi hit the Greens said, 'This is the worst cyclone to hit Australia since 1917.' Now Senator Rice says, 'These are the worst floods to hit South-East Asia for a long time'—40 years. What happened before those 40 years? There were floods of that magnitude and there have been at all occasions. Certainly, with the media and social media the way it is, we're more aware of these disasters when they happen. Senator Roberts gives the facts. The Greens will never dispute those because they can't. They just try to belittle the deliverer of the message.


I never enter into the debate of whether human activity is causing climate change. The climate is, of course, changing. There's no doubt about that; no-one can deny that. I never enter that debate because I don't have that scientific knowledge, but neither does anyone else in this room, and neither does everyone else at the UBC—the Ultimo Broadcasting Corporation, which used to be called the ABC. They don't have the facts either; they don't have the scientific knowledge. They just mouth the platitudes of others who have a particular agenda, and the Greens are amongst them. The Greens could not tell you about the science themselves; they just mouth the platitudes that someone has told them. I continue to ask them and they never answer me.


Australia is doing its bit. We're reducing our emissions and we help with disaster resilience—not climate resilience; disaster resilience—particularly in the Pacific. Australia emits less than 1.2 per cent of the world's emissions of carbon. If the world's emission of carbon is what's causing climate change—which it is, according to the Greens—then I ask the Greens: why are you so determined to destroy Australia's industry and our standard of living by even further reducing the emissions of carbon?



Senator Rice interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Sterle
):  Order, Senator Rice!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I've asked them time and time to tell me scientifically what impact Australia's emission of carbon has on the changing climate of the world. They never answer that question, because they can't. So I asked the Chief Scientist, Dr Finkel, what would happen if Australia reduced its emissions by 1.2 per cent, which is the total of Australia's emissions.



Senator Rice interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Rice, I have let you get away with a little bit but it's gone on for a while now and I ask you to cease, please.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you for the protection, Mr Acting Deputy President, but I don't need protection from the likes of Senator Rice. This is the typical Greens' thing. If you don't agree with them, they will deride you, giggle like schoolgirls and try to shout you down.


I keep raising the point that they won't tell me what impact 1.2 per cent will have on the changing climate of the world—but Dr Finkel did. I asked Dr Finkel: if we shut Australia down, if we reduce Australia's emissions by 1.2 per cent, what impact would that have on the changing climate of the world? Dr Finkel said—and it's on Hansard—'virtually none'. The Greens are in here every day saying, 'Cut Australia's jobs; do away with manufacturing; do away with motor vehicles; do away with everything that has a carbon emission because it's going to kill the Barrier Reef,' yet Dr Finkel says that it will have virtually no impact on the changing climate of the world. The Greens bring lie, after lie, after lie to this debate—as they do with everything. We just heard a Greens senator say that the Barrier Reef is dead. That is a direct and outright lie. The Barrier Reef is not dead; it is brilliant. There are parts of it in some condition, but the Barrier Reef continues.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  A point of order, Senator Whish-Wilson.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Senator Macdonald is misleading the chamber. No Greens senator said that the Barrier Reef is dead. I ask you to reflect on Hansard and call Senator Macdonald up for lying.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Whish-Wilson, that is a debating point; there is no point of order.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Senator Rice clearly said in her presentation—and Hansard will show this—'That's why the Barrier Reef is dead.' It is not dead, but the Greens would have you believe that and so would the UBC—what used to be the ABC—all the GetUp! people and all the left-wing groups of that type.


This debate needs a reality check. Unfortunately, you will never get it from the Greens. They can't tell you anything about the science, because they simply don't know. They just mouth the platitudes and the particular thing they heard from some left-wing group at some time in the past. It needs a reality check. Start answering those questions that Senator Roberts puts to you. I don't know whether he has the knowledge, but he has the facts on the cyclones and the floods. They're not new; they've happened all the time through the world's evolution, and they will continue to happen. They are a natural impact. Even if you are a believer in man's inducement of climate change, what Australia emits will have virtually no impact. (Time expired)

 (South Australia) (17:19):  I rise to contribute to this debate by reflecting on the new-found socialism of the Turnbull government. Here I am standing in this place to reflect on Fidel Frydenberg, Castro Canavan and Malcolm the Marxist—

Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  and their new-found faith in socialising energy production.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Hanson-Young—



A government senator interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Don't make it any worse. Senator Hanson-Young, no longer ago than question time, we had a similar incident, and I would ask that you refer to members of this chamber and the other by their proper title.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Of course, Mr Acting Deputy President. The coalition used to claim to be the party of market forces but, under Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce, they have embraced socialism. They have introduced export controls on gas; they want to spend $1 billion of taxpayer money subsidising the Adani coalmine; they want to use taxpayers' money to build and bail out old coal-fired power stations; and, of course, they have run a mile from market-based mechanisms for pricing carbon, which even the Prime Minister once crossed the floor to support. The one thing the energy industry says it wants is certainty, but, far from certainty, all it has from this government is chaos—all the coalition has given the industry is chaos. 


Let's take a closer look. It started with former Prime Minister John Howard, who gave us the Renewable Energy Target in 1997, but he raged against the price on carbon right up until 2006. As the 2007 election approached, John Howard supported an ETS, but post election the Liberals dumped it—for a while, at least, until Brendan Nelson unambiguously supported pricing carbon. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, of course, supported an ETS right up until—well, then he didn't. Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, forever the contrarian, even supported a price on carbon just because Malcolm Turnbull didn't, but, soon after he became opposition leader, Tony Abbott opposed all carbon pricing and admitted he was just a bit of a weathervane. Then, as Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, after ripping up the carbon price, gave us the Renewable Energy Target, which we still have today. The coalition has been all over the shop when it comes to climate policy and energy policy, but where have they settled? 


They have settled for socialism. They will outsource health and education spending—all those essential services—but they want to insource the construction and maintenance of coal-fired power stations. They are socialists. We now see those in the National Party have become the coal communists. For years I have sat here and been lectured about the inefficiency of the public sector by the coalition in this place, and here we have Fidel Frydenberg and Castro Canavan— (Time expired)

Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (17:23):  I present the report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories on the strategic importance of Australia's Indian Ocean territories. I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


I rise today to present the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories report on its inquiry into the strategic importance of Australia's Indian Ocean territories. The Indian Ocean territories are made up of Christmas and Cocos Keeling Islands, which are a part of the electorate of Lingiari in the Northern Territory and which are certainly incredibly beautiful places. As Senator for the Northern Territory, I take particular interest in reaching out to constituents of the Christmas and Cocos Keeling Island groups.


The inquiry was a great opportunity to engage and meet face to face with so many stakeholders on the islands, and it gave all committee members the opportunity to experience the vibrant and diverse communities of Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands. This inquiry was different to others that have involved the Indian Ocean territories because it specifically looked into the Indian Ocean territories from a broader strategic perspective. The committee held five public round-table style hearings: two in Canberra and three in the Indian Ocean territories. Earlier this year, the committee undertook meetings with local communities on Christmas Island, West Island and Home Island. The committee inquired into the strategic importance and we investigated the changing regional security environment and security contingencies; Defence capabilities in the territories and associated infrastructure development; the scope of maritime, air and other cooperation with Indo-Pacific partners; and impacts on local communities. 


In Australia today, many people associate the region with Australia's defence and broader border protection. What many don't know is that the Indian Ocean territories have a history of strategic importance to the military, because of the access point to the Indian Ocean. In a submission to the committee, Mr Julian Yates gave a historical account of the strategic importance of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, which first became significant in World War I. West Island was used as an operating base for the British Royal Air Force and the Royal Australian Air Force for attacks on Japanese forces in Burma, Sumatra, Java and Singapore. During World War I and World War II, Cocos (Keeling) Islands were used for its phosphate resources, a fact that had them under Japanese attack in World War II. Christmas Island was also very important strategically in this regard.


In more recent times, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade stated that a secure and stable Indian Ocean region is crucial for Australia's national security and prosperity, particularly noting the economic interests of shipping routes for exports and imports. One witness told the inquiry that Australia needs a military presence on Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands to defend and maintain its interest in the territories, adding that the Indian Ocean territories could play a role in defeating organised crime. The change from its historical role also reflects the changing dynamic in the region. Competing world powers are increasing their levels of activity, and with this come security challenges in our region. The changing dynamic of the region raises security issues around transnational crime, irregular maritime migration and terrorism. For this reason, the committee supports Australia's ongoing engagement with partners in the region to address these security challenges. 


Australia is involved in various international forums relating to the Indian Ocean territories, which gives it an opportunity for diplomatic engagement, finding common ground on the interests and issues, and gaining a localised perspective on regional partnerships. Part of the regional cooperation can be addressed through the upgrade of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands airport runway. When giving evidence, Dr Malcolm Davis suggested that Australia may wish to consider whether reciprocal access to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands airport runway could be granted in the spirit of increased cooperation with India. The committee also received evidence from Dr Davis, who said that Australia should seek to further strengthen its relationship with Indonesia through further cooperation such as joint naval patrols in the Indian Ocean region.


The Indian Ocean region is a diverse area of national and economic interests. Because of this, the committee recommends that the Australian government strengthen its engagement with Australia Indo-Pacific partners through existing regional forums and alliances that Australia currently participates in. The Department of Defence told the inquiry the Indian Ocean territories would be an effective place from which to deploy and support Australian Defence Force capability in the region in the form of humanitarian and disaster relief.


The Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development noted the government's long-term strategic infrastructure to support the provision of local and state type government services in the region, including in water, wastewater, power, fuel supply and storage, airports, ports, health services, roads, community buildings and housing. Despite the department's plan, many people from the local Christmas and Cocos communities raised serious issues concerning infrastructure. Infrastructure projects like the Cocos islands airstrip and associated facilities, access to water on West Island, the crane and mooring facilities on Christmas Island, telecommunications infrastructure and the future of the Christmas Island immigration detention centre would all have a shared benefit to government, industry and local business interests. The inability to increase infrastructure funding on the island means that those projects have now built up, and this committee report recognises that. As I said, concerns were raised by members of the local communities on the islands about the need for infrastructure upgrades. The committee has recommended ongoing and extensive consultation with stakeholders and communities on long-term infrastructure solutions. 


The communities on both Christmas and Cocos islands are similar to all of our Australian communities, and they are culturally diverse and proudly Australian. The committee made a final recommendation that any government departments that wish to do further works on the island do so in genuine partnership with local communities, through consultation and action that meets the needs of the community. Underemployment and a lack of employment opportunities are certainly issues facing both these communities in the Indian Ocean territories. Mr Daniel Becker told the committee that the Cocos islands have a lot of underemployment because employment is dependent on intermittent activities. For example, there is a surge in employment when ships dock on the island to unload cargo. Jobseekers on Christmas Island are older and on the edge of retirement. The number of unemployed young people is low. Witnesses from the Chinese Literary Association stated that most young people from Christmas Island leave for mainland Australia due to lack of employment opportunities. 


The committee noted the opportunity for local employment through the increased defence and border protection activities. These include surveillance, naval patrols, a military reserve or cadet unit and potential training exercises on Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Again the Cocos airstrip was raised as an industry-boosting solution. Mr Balmut Pirus commented that, if the airstrip on West Island could be further developed, it could create opportunities for more airlines to set routes to the islands, leading to increased tourism and employment for locals. 


It was indeed a great honour to travel with the committee to the Indian Ocean territories and to hear the constituents of both Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands come forward with their solutions and their vision for the future of the Indian Ocean territories. I would like to thank the communities of Christmas Island, and Home and West islands, which make up the Cocos (Keeling) Islands group, for welcoming the committee, sharing their experiences, offering solutions and offering their hospitality, and a very special thankyou too to the residents of Christmas Island. I commend the report to the chamber. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

AUSTRALIAN BORDER FORCE AMENDMENT (PROTECTED INFORMATION) BILL 2017


The Department of Immigration and Border Protection, including its operational enforcement arm, the Australian Border Force, supports a broad range of activities that are vital for the prosperity and security of our nation. Facilitation of international trade, the supply of skilled labour for our domestic economy, business relationships, revenue collection, law enforcement and national security outcomes, travel and tourism and community protection are all important elements in building a strong and cohesive society.


To carry out these functions, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection obtains information from individuals, industry, other sectors of government and foreign partners. Some of this information is highly sensitive and must be carefully managed. The Department must ensure that it is only used and disclosed for legitimate purposes.


The Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017 clarifies the secrecy and disclosure provisions in the Australian Border Force Act 2015 (the ABF Act) to reflect the policy intent of those provisions. 


Part 6 of the ABF Act establishes these important secrecy and disclosure provisions, similar to provisions that were in place within the former Australian Customs and Border Protection Service and a range of other Commonwealth agencies. These protections prohibited the unauthorised making of a record or disclosure of information. Breach of these requirements is punishable by imprisonment for two years.


This bill will clarify Part 6 and related provisions to reflect the original intent of the legislation, which is to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of information that could cause harm to the national or public interest. 


Mishandling of information can cause significant damage to our national security, public safety, law enforcement capability or our economy. Individuals can also suffer serious detriment where personal and sensitive information is inappropriately disclosed. 


The secrecy and disclosure provisions in Part 6 of the ABF Act were adapted from the model in place for the former Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. However, this model has not kept pace with the developments in the modern border environment. This environment is complex and dynamic, and updated legislative settings are required to facilitate the evolving work of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection.


The aim of the measures in this bill, therefore, is to ensure that Immigration and Border Protection information is provided with the necessary level of protection, in a targeted manner, but is also able to be disclosed when it is appropriate to do so.


As not all information obtained by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection requires protection, the definition of the information to be protected has been refined to include only certain kinds of information, such as that relating to: the security, defence and international relations of Australia; prevention, detection and investigation of offences; protection of public health and safety; or sensitive personal and commercial matters.


There must be a balance between the competing interests of transparent, open and accountable government with the necessity of protecting certain information from disclosure which would lead to identifiable harm.


The prohibition in the ABF Act on disclosure of certain kinds of information is balanced by the exceptions to this prohibition that allow for authorised disclosures. This is why the bill includes measures to remove unnecessary and cumbersome administrative overlays. Streamlining the operation of the secrecy and disclosure provisions will allow more efficient sharing of information for legitimate purposes without removing important oversight and accountability measures.


The bill provides assurances for the Australian public, business, government and foreign partners that sensitive information provided to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection will be appropriately protected, without unnecessarily restricting informed public debate. The retrospective application of the bill (back to the date the Australian Border Force Actwas enacted) will provide the necessary certainty that only information which could harm the national or public interest if disclosed is to be protected, and will be regarded as ever having been protected, under the ABF Act. 


This will reassure individuals who may otherwise believe they have committed an offence, in circumstances which would not have amounted to an offence under these amendments.


In conclusion, this bill will clarify the intent and refine the operation of the secrecy and disclosure provisions that govern the management of information in the Immigration and Border Protection portfolio. It illustrates the fine balance that must be struck in protecting sensitive information while upholding a commitment to open and accountable government. This bill underscores that commitment and will enable the Department of Immigration and Border Protection to more effectively manage information in service of our nation.


SOCIAL SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE REFORM) BILL 2017


With this Bill, the Government is embarking on a comprehensive reform of Australia's working-age welfare payments; making the system simpler, more sustainable, and focussed on supporting people from welfare into employment. 


Introduction


The Bill introduces a new, single JobSeeker Payment, which will replace or consolidate seven existing payments in order to simplify the working age payment system. It will also strengthen welfare conditionality for jobseekers with drug and alcohol abuse issues and better encourage and support them to pursue treatment.


The Bill also sees a streamlining of administrative processes and the introduction of a new targeted compliance framework which will better identify and support vulnerable people and ensure that wilfully noncompliant jobseekers face appropriate penalties.


The Bill demonstrates that the Government is completely committed to improving the integrity of the welfare system and ensuring that recipients receive the necessary support and incentives to address barriers to employment, to look for work and to take a suitable job when it is available. This will benefit not just the jobseekers themselves but also their families, the wider community and the Australian economy.


Jobseeker Payment measures


From 20 March 2020, this bill will introduce a new, single JobSeeker Payment, which will replace seven existing payments as the main payment for people of working age.


Newstart Allowance, Sickness Allowance, Wife Pension, Bereavement Allowance, and Widow B Pension will cease from 20 March 2020. Existing Bereavement Allowance recipients will continue to receive Bereavement Allowance for the remainder of their bereavement period following 20 March 2020, but there will be no new grants of Bereavement Allowance from 20 March 2020.


Widow Allowance will close to new entrants from 1 January 2018 and will cease on 1 January 2022, when all recipients have moved to the Age Pension.


Partner Allowance will also cease on 1 January 2022 when all recipients have moved to the Age Pension.


These multiple working age payments are a product of many years of ad hoc changes and dated policy decisions, which have created a system that is difficult to understand, navigate and administer.


Creating a new JobSeeker Payment will ensure a single set of rules and rates for people of working age with the capacity to work. It will also firmly entrench long-term employment as the desired outcome for working age Australians who receive income support.


Under these changes, approximately 800,000 existing Newstart Allowance recipients are expected to transfer to the new JobSeeker Payment in 2020. A further 20,000 recipients of other working age income support payments are expected to progressively transition to the JobSeeker Payment, or other payments such as the Age Pension and Carer Payment where eligible. 


The eligibility rules and payment rates for the JobSeeker Payment will be based primarily on the existing rules and rates for Newstart Allowance. Eligibility will be broadened to include access for people who are temporarily sick or injured and unable to return to their work or study, rather than having to shift onto a different payment.


Bereavement provisions will also apply within the new JobSeeker Payment for people who would have otherwise claimed a Bereavement Allowance. Bereaved JobSeeker Payment recipients and claimants will receive a triple upfront payment, acknowledging the high upfront costs associated with losing a partner or spouse. Recipients will also receive temporary exemptions from mutual obligations requirements during their time of grief. Bereaved people will also be exempt from a number of conditions that would normally apply to jobseekers; ensuring that they get access to the payment when they need it the most.


Transitional arrangements will be put in place for Wife Pension recipients who move to the JobSeeker Payment to ensure that their nominal rate of payment is not reduced as result of these changes.


Replacing seven existing payments with one working age payment is a critical step in reforming our welfare system and will firmly entrench long-term employment as the desired outcome for Australians who enter the welfare system in a moment of need. 


The simplification of working age payments is based on the blueprint provided by Patrick McClure after the significant work done by him and his reference group on welfare reform. 


Amend the activity test for persons aged 55 to 59


This bill will also strengthen the employment focus of mutual obligations and better connect mature age jobseekers with the labour market, while still recognising that volunteering can be a valuable stepping stone into paid work.


Changes will be made to current activity test arrangements, to help ensure Newstart Allowance and Special Benefit recipients aged 55 to 59 years experience greater workforce participation and increase their chances of finding work. 


Presently, Newstart Allowance and Special Benefit recipients aged 55 or over can satisfy the activity test and meet their Annual Activity Requirement through 30 hours per fortnight of approved voluntary work, paid work or a combination of both. 


Whilst volunteering obviously has a range of benefits, participation in paid work and reduced reliance on income support should be the ultimate goal for jobseekers.


Under this measure, from 20 September 2018, Newstart Allowance and Special Benefit recipients aged between 55 and 59 years of age will have satisfied the activity test if they are engaged in at least 30 hours per fortnight of paid work, or a combination of paid work and up to a maximum of 15 hours of voluntary work. 


The 2017-18 Budget included changes to mutual obligations requirements for jobseekers in other age groups. This includes aligning Activity Requirements for jobseekers aged between 30 and 49 years of age with those for jobseekers aged under 30 and introducing Annual Activity Requirements for jobseekers aged between 60 and the Age Pension age.


Changes to participation requirements for these other age groups can be achieved through jobactive guidelines alone. No legislative amendment is required.


The Australian Government is also complementing these changes by investing over $100 million to increase the skills and experience of mature age jobseekers from 1 July 2018.


Faster connection to employment services


The bill also supports the introduction of the Work First: Faster connection to employment services measure. 


This measure makes changes to the RapidConnect arrangements to encourage jobseekers to connect more quickly with employment service providers (like jobactive and Transition to Work). 


From 1 January 2018, jobseekers subject to RapidConnect will have their Newstart Allowance or Youth Allowance (other) payment commence from the date they attended their initial appointment with their employment service provider, instead of the date the recipient first contacted the Department of Human Services or lodged their claim.


Transition to Work and jobactive providers will continue to be contractually required to have appointment times available for people to attend within two business days. If an appointment is not available or the jobseeker misses an appointment due to a reasonable cause, they will not be penalised. 


Connecting jobseekers more quickly with employment services will improve the jobseeker's chances of finding work faster.


The Government has moved amendments to ensure that where a job seeker is subject to RapidConnect and the one week ordinary waiting period, their waiting period will commence on the same day as for job seekers who are not subject to RapidConnect. This will ensure that the ordinary waiting period applies consistently as intended for all job seekers, irrespective of whether they are subject to RapidConnect. 


Removing Intent to Claim 


Through this bill, social security claimants will receive payments from the date they provide all material necessary for them to claim and to be assessed that is within their control, rather than from the date of first contact with the Department of Human Services.


This measure will encourage social security claimants to provide the information required for their claim in a timely manner, in line with government and community expectations that individuals take personal responsibility for their own affairs.


The measure will apply to all new claims for social security payments. It will not affect current recipients, unless they claim another payment.


Substance Misuse Measures


In addition, this bill introduces three measures designed to strengthen requirements for jobseekers who may have substance abuse issues and to provide improved pathways for them to pursue appropriate treatment.


The community has a right to expect that taxpayer-funded welfare payments are not being used to fund drug and alcohol addiction and that jobseekers do all that they can reasonably do to find a job, including addressing any barriers which have prevented them from doing so.


Data shows us that substance abuse is a more significant problem for people on welfare payments and is directly impacting the ability of many jobseekers to undertake activities to get them into employment:


In 2013 the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare found that those who were unemployed were 2.4 times more likely to use some types of drugs than those who were employed. 


Last year there were 4,325 occasions when someone gave drug or alcohol dependency as a reason for not meeting their mutual obligation requirements.


In September 2016, around 5,250 people were temporarily exempt from all mutual obligations due to a drug or alcohol dependency.


While there are some existing mechanisms in place for identifying jobseekers with substance abuse issues and assisting them to seek treatment, the data clearly shows that much more needs to be done to help these individuals. 


The measures in this bill will provide better pathways for jobseekers who are having difficulties meeting their mutual obligation requirements because of drug or alcohol misuse so that they can pursue the treatment they need.


Importantly, the measures in this bill are complemented by other measures that do not require legislation. This includes, for the first time, ensuring that all jobseekers are able to undertake drug or alcohol treatment as an approved activity in their Job Plan. 


This bill will also establish a modest two year trial of drug testing for 5,000 recipients of Newstart Allowance and Youth Allowance (other) from 1 January 2018. 


While drug testing is currently used in Australia by many employers and, of course, by police and law enforcement, and it has also been used overseas in relation to welfare recipients, there is little comparable evidence available to tell us whether this sort of intervention would be effective in the Australian welfare context.


That is why this measure has been specifically designed as a trial – to build that evidence base and assess the value of drug testing as a way of identifying those for whom drug misuse is a barrier to work, and as a means of supporting them to undertake treatment.


The trial will operate in three locations. The selection of these locations will be based on evidence and data about drug use in Australia to ensure the trial is targeted at supporting regions with a high incidence of drug use. The availability of treatment services and the ability to apply a welfare quarantining mechanism will also be key factors in determining trial locations.


Under this trial, from 1 January 2018, people claiming Newstart Allowance or Youth Allowance (other) in the trial locations will be required to acknowledge that they may be subject to drug testing as part of the claim process.


Drug testing will coincide with Department of Human Service' appointments and will be administered by a contracted third party drug testing provider. 


There will be comprehensive rules set out in a legislative instrument relating to the trial locations, the illicit drugs tested for and the protocols for conducting the drug tests, including safeguards to ensure that testing is conducted appropriately and in accordance with relevant standards. This legislative instrument will provide the flexibility to ensure that the expert advice of the contracted testing provider and the drug and alcohol sector can be taken into account in developing these protocols and safeguards.


There will be appropriate consequences for people who deliberately miss an appointment without a reasonable excuse or for people who refuse a drug test in order to avoid a possible positive result. 


Jobseekers who test positive to a drug test will have their payments placed on Income Management for 24 months. This is designed to restrict their access to cash and, therefore, limit their ability to use payments to fund further harmful drug use. Jobseekers who test positive will also be subject to a second drug test within 25 working days and may also be subject to further subsequent tests. This will help to identify those for whom drug misuse is an ongoing problem which may require treatment and which is creating a barrier to employment.


Jobseekers who test positive to more than one drug test during the trial will be referred to a Department of Human Services contracted medical professional with experience in drug and alcohol treatment who will assess their particular circumstances and identify appropriate treatment or support options.


If the report from the medical professional recommends treatment, the jobseeker will be required to participate in one or more treatment activities to address their substance abuse as part of their Job Plan. This could include, for example, activities such as rehabilitation, counselling or case management.


This trial is not about penalising jobseekers with drug abuse issues. It is about finding new and better ways of identifying these jobseekers and ensuring they are referred to the support and treatment they need.


This bill will also make changes to mutual obligation exemptions to better support and encourage jobseekers with substance misuse issues to remain actively engaged and pursue treatment.


Currently, jobseekers can be granted an exemption on the basis of temporary incapacity due to drug or alcohol dependency. Exemptions can also be granted in other circumstances that may be related to drug or alcohol abuse. 


This allows jobseekers to be exempt from all mutual obligation requirements with no expectation that they will undertake appropriate activities to address the underlying problem – their substance abuse.


This is why, from 1 January 2018, jobseekers will no longer be able to be exempt from their mutual obligation or participation requirements if the circumstances affecting their ability to meet their requirements is primarily due to drug or alcohol dependency or misuse.


This measure reflects that jobseekers who do have substance dependency or misuse issues that prevent them from looking for work should be taking active steps to address their issues rather than being exempt from all requirements.


It is estimated that around 11,000 exemptions per year will no longer be granted under this measure, noting that some jobseekers may currently get more than one exemption in a year related to their substance misuse. 


Jobseekers who are no longer eligible for an exemption will instead remain connected to their employment service provider and actively engaged in appropriate activities tailored to their particular circumstances and barriers to work, including their substance misuse issues. 


The Government is investing $28.8 million to ensure that jobseekers receive this tailored support from their provider during the period they would previously have been exempt. 


This bill will also tighten the reasonable excuse rules to provide an incentive for jobseekers, who are having difficulty meeting their requirements due to drug or alcohol dependency, to undertake treatment as part of their mutual obligation requirements.


Jobseekers on income support negotiate a Job Plan with their employment service provider. It is based on their individual circumstances and capacity and is designed to help the jobseeker move towards supporting themselves through paid work.


If jobseekers do not undertake the mutual obligations that are agreed to in their Job Plan, they can face financial penalties. To avoid unfairly penalising recipients, a penalty cannot legally be applied if the jobseeker has a reasonable excuse for failing to meet their requirements – that is if jobseekers miss an appointment or cannot attend an activity for reasons beyond their control. 


Currently though, there are rules which allow jobseekers to repeatedly use drug or alcohol dependency as a reasonable excuse without making any effort to address their circumstances. 


From 1 January 2018, the Government will amend the reasonable excuse criteria so that jobseekers will not be able to repeatedly use drug or alcohol dependency as a reasonable excuse unless they are seeking treatment, if it is available and appropriate. This measure targets those who are unable to meet their mutual obligation requirements due to drug or alcohol related reasons, and will encourage those recipients into available treatment.


Following a first instance of noncompliance due to drug or alcohol dependency, jobseekers will face no penalty but will be given the option of voluntarily undertaking treatment for their dependency (if that treatment is appropriate and available) or continuing with their normal mutual obligation requirements as managed by their employment services provider. 


For jobseekers who choose treatment, participating in this treatment will reduce, or in some circumstances fully meet, their mutual obligation requirements.


If a jobseeker refuses to participate in available and appropriate treatment, they will no longer be able to continue to use their drug and alcohol conditions as a reasonable excuse for future noncompliance. If they again fail to meet their requirements due to drug or alcohol use, they may then face a financial penalty.


This measure will provide stronger incentives and better support for jobseekers to pursue the treatment they need to overcome their substance dependency and move towards supporting themselves through paid work.


Together, these measures recognise that supporting jobseekers to address their substance abuse issues through appropriate treatment is a critical first step on the path to employment.


Targeted Compliance Framework


This bill will create a simpler, fairer, more targeted and certainly more effective jobseeker compliance framework to ensure that all jobseekers are meeting their mutual obligation requirements.


We know that almost two thirds of jobseekers attend all appointments or miss only one at most in any six month period, and that payment suspension is sufficient to ensure re-engagement in the majority of cases.


At the other extreme, there is a small core of jobseekers who appear to be gaming the system by only attending appointments which reactivate suspended income support payments. Those jobseekers have no underlying reason for their persistent noncompliance. 


The current framework does not differentiate between these groups of jobseekers and, critically, it does not always provide the support necessary to those who need help to meet their requirements.


The new targeted framework is designed to change the behaviour of non-genuine jobseekers, while supporting the majority of jobseekers who are absolutely genuine in their efforts to find work.


Jobseekers who wilfully and repeatedly fail to comply with their agreed job plan requirements, with no underlying cause, will face real penalties, with graduated loss of income support payments culminating in payment cancellation and a four week non-payment period for the most recalcitrant jobseekers.


Under the new framework, all jobseekers will commence in a demerits phase. Every time a jobseeker misses a requirement, their payment will be suspended then back paid when they re-engage. They will also accrue a demerit if they do not have a valid reason for their failure.


If a jobseeker accrues four demerits within six months they will enter the three strikes phase, where they will face stronger penalties, beginning with the loss of half their fortnightly payment the first time they miss a requirement without a reasonable excuse. They will lose all of their fortnightly payment the second time they do not meet a requirement and after a third failure they will face payment cancellation for four weeks.


To ensure that genuine jobseekers who are simply having difficulty meeting their requirements do not enter the three strikes phase, their provider will assess their capability and requirements after their third demerit and the Department of Human Services will also do so after their fourth. At either point, if a jobseeker is found to be unable to meet their requirements because of some underlying capability issue, those requirements will be adjusted, their demerits reset, and they will remain in the demerits phase.


Once a jobseeker is in the three strikes phase, they can still avoid any penalties by simply meeting all their requirements. Those who remain fully compliant for three months will return to the demerits phase and have their demerits reset to zero. This will provide a strong incentive for jobseekers to change their behaviour and start to comply with their requirements.


Jobseekers in either phase who refuse an offer of suitable work or fail to start in a suitable job without a reasonable excuse will have their payment cancelled and will then face a four week non-payment period before they can receive payment. This penalty is identical to that imposed on jobseekers who have reached three strikes. It recognises the seriousness of refusing work and the importance of reducing reliance on welfare wherever reasonably possible.


Jobseekers who voluntarily leave a suitable job or are dismissed due to misconduct will also face a four week non-payment period.


Waivers will no longer be available for refusing or failing to accept an offer of suitable employment, so that jobseekers who have proven time and again that they are unwilling to meet their requirements or accept work will actually serve a penalty. However the penalty for these failures is reduced from eight weeks to four weeks to reflect the detrimental impact that long periods without payment can have. 


The new compliance framework will be considerably simpler than the current system. This will make it easier for jobseekers to understand the consequences of noncompliance, and will reduce unnecessary red-tape and administration for providers. 


No penalty will be applied to any jobseeker if they have a reasonable excuse for any failure to observe a mutual obligation.


Before a jobseeker enters the three strikes phase, they will be subject to capability interviews and assessments to identify any underlying issues that may be preventing them from meeting their requirements.


Only those jobseekers who wilfully and systematically do not comply with requirements will reach the point of having their income support payments cancelled.


A jobseeker can request that the Department of Human Services review a decision to apply a financial penalty and if they are unhappy with the outcome, they can appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.


Jobseekers will not be paid pending the outcome of the appeal and will be back paid in full if the appeal is successful. 


Streamline Tax File Number Collection


Under current arrangements, claimants for social security payments have 28 days to provide a Tax File Number to the Department of Human Services after a claim has been made. This bill will streamline administrative processes in the Department of Human Services by requiring individuals who make a claim for payment, or an income‑tested health care card or seniors health card, to provide their Tax File Number, and relevant third-party Tax File Numbers, as part of their claim. Applicants who do not have their Tax File Number on hand can choose to have the Department of Human Services obtain it from the Australian Taxation Office directly on their behalf.


Information Management


From 1 January 2018, the requirement for the Department of Human Services to obtain information twice (once for administrative purposes, like raising a social welfare payment debt, and then again to pursue criminal prosecution) will be streamlined under this bill to reduce the administrative burden of welfare fraud prosecution referrals. 


The need for the Department of Human Services to obtain admissible material by search warrants pursuant to section 3E of the Crimes Act 1914, will be significantly reduced. The Department of Human Services currently requests around 1,000 of these warrants annually. 


These amendments will reduce the significant burden not only on the Department of Human Services and the Australian Federal Police, but also on the parties subject to the search warrants and the courts. 


Aligning Social Security and Disability Discrimination Law


The Government fully supports the vital role the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 plays in protecting people with disability from unfair treatment and promoting equal rights, opportunity and access. 


Certain pieces of Commonwealth legislation are exempt from coverage of the Disability Discrimination Act. This includes the Social Security Act 1991, the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004. The exemption of these Acts enables pensions, allowances and benefits for people with disability to be appropriately targeted according to the purpose of the payment. 


The Social Security Act has been exempt since the Disability Discrimination Act was first introduced in 1992. At that time, the Social Security Act included a range of provisions that are now included in separate pieces of legislation – the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999and the Social Security (International Arrangements) Act 1999. When the social security law was split into three separate Acts, however, the Disability Discrimination Act was not updated to reflect this.


This bill will address this inconsistency by also including the Social Security (Administration) Act and the Social Security (International Agreements) Act, and legislative instruments made under the Social Security Act 1991 and the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 in the list of exempt legislation for the Disability Discrimination Act. 


This will ensure consistent treatment across social security law and similar legislation relating to pensions and allowances. Importantly, these changes will not affect the broader protections that the Disability Discrimination Act provides to people with disability.


Conclusion


The Government is committed to building a fairer, more efficient and more effective welfare system that is focused on employment outcomes. 


This bill will deliver a simpler system for people receiving working age payments; provide more encouragement for people transitioning to work; provide greater support for people along the path to employment; and provide stricter compliance to ensure the integrity of our welfare system is appropriately maintained. 


These changes will make the income support system stronger and more sustainable over the long term, and will ensure that the welfare system continues to be supported by the broader community.

Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (18:27):  The media landscape is changing fast. The industry is changing and the industry's regulation needs changing too. It's ridiculous to say that the only way to defend a struggling industry is to defend the regulation that's preventing it from defending itself against new and enormous threats. But concerns around the potential loss of media diversity as a result of the changes posed are real and valid. It is important that any deal to change regulation also protects media diversity in the process. Nobody wants any one media baron to have excessive power over the political landscape, and the best way to address concerns about private media ownership is to invest in publicly owned media. The government, with courage, would put whatever it's proposing to a vote. That's not what it has agreed to. Instead, reports suggest that the government has made some sneaky handshake deal in a back room somewhere to undermine the operations of the ABC, and it has gone behind the back of the Senate to do it.


I won't be supporting the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Bill 2017, and I'm disappointed that I can't. I'm disappointed that I can't support this bill because I support in principle what it's trying to achieve, but I will not be a part of taking a pitchfork to the ABC.

Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (18:28):  I did have a prepared speech but I want to address that contribution from Senator Lambie. The media reform as presented in this suite of initiatives by the government on a very vexed and difficult issue, which befuddled the opposition when it was in power—I remember under Senator Conroy trying to find some way to ensure the sustainability and diversity of our media in the face of incredible disruption—does not mean a pitchfork to the ABC and does not mean media barons. I'd much rather an Australian own a media company in this country than a foreign company own a media company in this country, which is exactly what can occur, Senator Lambie, under current arrangements. I'm happy to walk you through it if you'd like.


What we have in front of us for this debate is a bill with a comprehensive suite of measures to bring the Australian media landscape out of the 1980s, the era of Michael J Fox, Back to the Future, Duran Duran—you might remember it, Senator Seselja and Senator Smith—before mobile phone companies outbid broadcasters to stream the Ashes or other cricket games, netball games, as we've got at the moment, or indeed AFL. That has always been the purview of our TV broadcasters, but they're being outbid for those sorts of rights and initiatives, and increasingly Australians are using their mobile phones in new and innovative ways that mean that the old regulation, the old way we regulated and the framework in which our media environment exists, is no longer tenable.


I was part of the joint committee in 2013 that made very similar recommendations, and I remember that the National Party then refused to support certain changes to aspects of our media laws because we too were concerned about local content in regional areas. We were worried about large media companies swamping our smaller newspapers, radio broadcasters and TV broadcasters. But five years down the track the reality is that I would rather have some Australian media outlets in regional areas than none, and that is what we're staring down the barrel of if we don't give them a fighting chance to deliver the type of diversity that we need and that technology can deliver us over time even.


This was before we had Netflix, Stan, Facebook or Google. The media environment in this country has been severely disrupted, and we've seen a very direct result and impact of that disruption as journalists face job losses, as Australians turn away from broadsheets to Facebook for their news and as regional broadcasters struggle in the face of decreasing advertising revenue and decreasing eyeballs. We must do something to ensure that regional media diversity is sustainable going forward.


The reality for regional Australians, though, in the way we access information is different, culturally and technologically. We don't necessarily have access to the same communications infrastructure. It's not as easy for many regional Australians to interact with Netflix—yet; it will be, but right now it's not. So we needed to ensure in this package that regional media diversity and local content was secured, and I believe that we have a mechanism within this media reform package to ensure that. We have incentivised those companies who have boots on the ground in our communities, who have cameramen at our sporting events, who have journalists living and working amongst us, telling our stories, working with us to promote community events and sharing in the reporting of emergency broadcasts during bushfires, floods, cyclones and drought. This is the reality. Reporting on somebody's lived experience is very different than having it as part of your own. So, ensuring that this package incentivises media companies to keep that physical commitment to regional Australia—to have the journalists, the cameramen and the cadets locally to train up—is something that I am very pleased is part of this reform initiative.


In the two Senate inquiries that went to the heart of this bill there were issues around whether the reach rule would be repealed. Some of the concerns raised were that online streaming services—straight into peoples' homes, not those that require a broadcasting licence—don't have to include any local regional news, don't need to include any local regional advertising, don't include any local community service announcements and are not subject to the commercial television industry code of practice. So it's very rich for senators to come into this place and try and tell senators that live and work and represent regional communities that keeping the current system in place is better than dealing with the fact that right now regional capitals that have the technology infrastructure, like Bendigo, Sale or Pakenham, those live streaming suites and broadcasters, if you like—I mean, it's a very poor definition of what a broadcaster is, but that's a whole other issue which I think I raised in my additional comments to the Senate report—but don't actually have those sorts of requirements on them that we do put on our TV broadcasters right now. Our TV broadcasters, our WINs, our Prime 7s, are often competing against the mother ship, the mother company of 9, 7 or 10, streaming right into the living rooms with the evening news, without those requirements about backing regional small business and backing regional news. 


In addition to the video-on-demand services and online streaming of metropolitan broadcasts, Prime, in its evidence to the committee, added that the regional television industry is facing several other significant structural challenges, including: a reduction in the size of regional advertising market; encountering a loss of $65 million over the last three years; a decline in actual audience numbers year on year, with the aggregated markets of Queensland, northern and southern NSW and Victoria losing 6.9 per cent of total audience; affiliation fees payable by regional broadcasters to metropolitan networks, which increase every year. You can't get MasterChef, you can't get Survivor unless you do the deal with the metropolitan affiliate. The fact that those affiliation fees go up and up year on year, despite declining revenue and declining eyeballs, is a significant issue for our regional broadcaster. That is why Mitch Fifield, as minister, has been able to perform the miraculous event at which all media outlets have come together as one to say, 'We need this change. We need this change to be sustainable to compete in the current media environment.' 


I want to briefly make comments around the importance of meaningful local content for people living in regional areas. That was emphasised to the committee by the President of the NSW Farmers' Association, Mr Schoen:


It is vitally important to maintain local content in delivery of media services to country areas. It is a little bit like if I went to go to Sydney I would find the news there very alien to me. And if you came to Corowa, I am sure you would find the media that we dish out fairly alien to you. It is vitally important that the content is applicable to the audience that is going to receive it.


I can't back those comments more. That is why I was disappointed by Senator Lambie's comments around the ABC. I am a huge backer of the ABC, particularly local radio, which plays such a vital role in my regional communities—community service announcements; emergency service broadcasts; making sure we have local news and weather; local entertainment. In particular, some of our presenters can be very humorous and keep us laughing. It's the first dial most regional Australians go to. To see, over time, the ABC denuded of its regional voice and staffing, under Mark Scott in particular—I do note the current managing director and board's commitment, through the minister's focus, to actually increasing the level of staffing in regional areas. That is a great thing. It goes to the heart of ensuring local content is available for regional communities. 


I want to go to the three-point system. Currently those senators that are opposing these changes are very happy for regional communities to have someone in Canberra read out Senator Urquhart's media releases, Senator Hanson-Young's media releases, Senator Smith's media releases—




Senator Smith:
  I don't do media releases!




Senator McKENZIE:
  I shouldn't have taken that interjection, but unfortunately I did! But to read out members and senators' media releases and to say that that actually counts as local content—that is appalling. What this bill has done is incentivise those that have employed locally and have maintained that local journalistic commitment to the community. They will receive a points incentive. The regional broadcasters argued that the proposed inclusion of the three-point category for local content would not lead to a reduction in local content, as some others argued, but was indeed something that they very much supported. Prime Media Group said:


…we have committed to a local news bulletin in Western Australia, where we had no licence requirement to do it, says that we are not looking to cut back the amount of local content. We would much prefer to produce more local content.


Again, Mr Lancaster from WIN said:


From a practical perspective, if you as a broadcaster are going to go to the trouble of putting a cameraperson or a journalist … into a market to capture that footage to be locally relevant, why would you give it a reduced amount of time? It is good content. If you are going to invest in the capturing of that content to get that video content, you would not reduce the amount of minutes …


It doesn't make practical sense to those people involved in producing local content that the points system, as envisaged by the legislation, would result in a reduction of local content.


I also want to touch on the negotiations that seem to have been going on around this particular piece of legislation. I note Senator Hanson is in the chamber, and I recognise her support for the ABC rural and regional advocacy bill changes. In exchange for her support for the ABC media reforms, Senator Hanson and One Nation have seen the value in having a change to the ABC's charter, for it to reflect what community thinks it should do. That is: it should have a specific obligation to reflect the geographic diversity of our nation. She sees the value in having two people from rural and regional Australia with embedded experience on the board of the ABC. She sees the value.


Senator Xenophon and I worked on his short wave bill, and we went up with Senator McCarthy and Senator Urquhart to Darwin to talk to the Northern Territory community about the ABC's decision to cut broadcasting through short-wave technology to those communities of the Pacific and northern Australia. It was simply because the board did not consult with the communities affected, and the amount of information given to the board to make that decision was appalling. I would recommend the committee's report into that. Senator Xenophon is very concerned about that particular issue, and he knows the importance of the ABC consulting and having an advisory committee from rural and regional Australia on which to test their ideas around service delivery and the type of technology being used to service regional communities.


Finally, there are just some simple changes to the annual reporting of the ABC around staff and where they are located, to ensure that the ABC is delivering for regional communities. I would encourage and thank Senator Hanson for her support, particularly for those measures in my private senator's bill; I appreciate that very much.


The regional Australia media market is about our people telling our stories to our community—to live amongst us. And this suite of measures, aside from the gambling advertisement issues, sits around the review of children's content and removing and making sure the ownership laws of our media market actually reflect the reality of the 21st century. They give our media owners the flexibility to be nimble and innovative. It is an incredibly tough, disrupted environment out there right now.


In a liberal democracy like ours, you need a multitude of voices for the citizens to consider. Look at the public spend of local governments—and this is one of the issues raised in my private senator's bill, but it is instructive for this particular debate. When you look at the amount of public money being administered by local councils, often the only overseers, the only ones actually examining that spend and the decisions of local governments across this country, are newspapers like the Benalla Ensign, the Riverine Herald up in Echuca and what they look at with the Campaspe Shire, and the Bendigo Weekly, looking at how the Bendigo council administers its funds. It's very important—fundamental to the secure functioning of our democracy indeed—that we have a robust, diverse, sustainable local media. 


I think our reforms are very thoughtful. The minister has widely consulted to ensure that the reform package being delivered here to the Senate tonight, and hopefully to be supported by the Senate this week, will deliver on the promise for Australia. We don't want to be a nation where American TV companies own our regional broadcasters and own our big broadcasters, where we have a diminishing amount of broadsheets available and everything moves online. It is rural and regional communities, and indeed the broader community, who will suffer. I have gone to the heart of ensuring that local production and local content is important. 


The New South Wales Farmers' Association, in their submission on the bill, wanted to look at concerns around the footprint, expanding what definitions around 'local' entail. I know that ACMA will be looking at that. The New South Wales Farmers' Association wanted to request that ACMA be diligent in ensuring effective compliance activities in policing local content. They also recommended that consumer protections in voice and data and telecommunications be upgraded to ensure that regional people have equal access to both voice and data, because, as the media environment changes, it will be more and more important that all Australians are able to access a variety of media voices using a variety of technologies. Right now, in regional Australia, we are going ahead in leaps and bounds. The over 750 mobile phone towers that the coalition government has delivered to regional Australia are going a long way towards that. But the Productivity Commission's USO paper and indeed the government's deliberations around the universal service obligation will go quite deeply to how regional Australians will be able to access news content and information. 


I did have a lot more to say around how ACMA can work with regional Australians' online footprint and ensure local content, but I know there are many other senators who need to speak on this. I commend all those who submitted to the Senate inquiries into this issue over a long period of time. I commend the minister for having a suite of arrangements which try and strike a balance between ensuring our media environment is forward looking, where our media owners are able to be nimble and innovative enough in this 21st century to deliver the content that we need to function, but also ensuring that they are financially sustainable going forward and that we have some rigour around the journalists who keep us all honest every single day of our lives in this job—and you wouldn't want it any other way. I would just like to see it across all levels of government. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2017-09-12,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (18:48):  I rise to speak to the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Bill 2017. The premise underlying broadcasting ownership laws—that government can decide who can and who can't own sections of the media—is little more than nanny state nonsense. It reminds me of countries that don't believe in free speech and where there is no right to hear points of view that are not approved. On top of that is aunty state nonsense, in which the government owns and operates multiple TV, radio and online media behemoths itself. These cost taxpayers a lot of money and compete with the commercial sector, making it less viable. 


This bill reduces restrictions on commercial broadcasting ownership so that the nanny state is a little less intrusive and, hopefully, the commercial sector is better able to withstand the marauding aunty. Probably more significantly, the changes mean that some of the artificial restraints on traditional Australian media that have left them at a competitive disadvantage compared with international internet based businesses such as Google and Facebook will be removed. Global internet based media are expected to attract $4 billion to $5 billion worth of advertising revenue next year. This represents 35 to 40 per cent of the Australian advertising market, and this is only expected to rise, eroding ad revenue available to traditional media faster than any overall advertising growth.


The bill abolishes the two-out-of-three rule. This rule prevents someone from controlling a television station, radio station and non-national newspaper in the same region. Abolishing the rule would allow someone to control all three platforms in the region. This change is supported by most of the media and was specifically requested by the Ten Network in the face of major losses, because declining market share due to online competition has placed them under strain. We now see Ten will be taken over by the US company CBS, because local businesses are unable to do so because of the current legislation. 


While I have no concerns about foreign investment in our media sector, I wonder whether those who have held up this legislation, in particular, Senators Xenophon and Hanson, believe they have done the right thing. Yes, some of the smaller and less efficient media organisations will be swallowed up by larger and more efficient companies, but that is how markets are supposed to work. Takeovers and bankruptcies are the means of selection in the commercial world. Survival depends on offering the cheapest, best value or greatest range to the benefit of consumers. Capitalism without bankruptcy is like Christianity without hell. Why be good if there is no consequence from doing otherwise?


Some oppose the reduction in ownership restrictions based on a view that wicked media barons might somehow take over our news and turn us into brain-washed zombies. This reflects a dated view of news and information. Tradition free-to-air television, radio and print media no longer control our access to news and entertainment because more and more of us are getting this from a wide range of sources on the internet. Media barons already own commercial broadcasting in Australia, so if media barons are a threat to our democracy, that threat exists as much under the current law as under this bill. Whenever people raise fears about media barons determining the news and controlling our minds, they fail to mention the continuing presence of the ABC and SBS. Zombies, indeed. 


The bill will also amend the reach rule by removing the ban on owning licences that cover more than 75 per cent of Australia's population. The 75 per cent reach rule is generally regarded as redundant by the industry, given the availability of online content, which transcends geographic boundaries. These reforms are aimed at allowing Australian television, radio and newspaper companies to operate across more media platforms. However, the bill also inserts a requirement on anyone with more than 75 per cent coverage to air more regional and local content than they are currently required to do. Arguments that the relaxation of ownership laws will hurt Australians in our regions and that regional and local content rules are required to protect precious local content are a complete furphy. 


The simple question is: which would you rather watch? A media conference by the Prime Minister or self-promotion by the local, political blowhard? The State of Origin match or amateur hour at West Wyalong school hall? A gripping US drama or an interminable fishing show about the local waterhole, where hardly anyone ever catches any fish? India versus Australia in the cricket or an interview with a crazy cat lady who lives in a dump bin at the edge of town? The latest movie blockbuster or a drawn-out tourist promo on the world's second largest ball of string? Just because you live in a regional area doesn't mean you are only interested in trivial local issues and want to be left in a low-budget, fly-blown, regional time warp. 


Fortunately, the increased content rules in this bill are a mere blemish in an otherwise laudable bill. Not only does the bill reduce ownership restrictions, but it also changes the so-called antisiphoning rules that prevent pay television from bidding for certain sporting events, unless the event is also to be broadcast on free-to-air or the event starts within the next three months. The bill will allow pay television bids, where the event starts in the next six months, and delists all golf, some rugby league, soccer, rugby union, cricket, tennis, netball and motor sport. The effect of the antisiphoning rules is to reduce access to sports by pay TV. This depresses the prices paid for broadcasting rights, which, in turn, hurts sportsmen and women from the affected sports. It also hurts the sports fans who prefer pay TV, which can often offer a better, less interrupted viewing experience. If pay TV were able to bid for more sports, the pay TV market in Australia could expand, facilitating further improvements in the quality of viewing on offer. Expanding the pay TV market could even support the competition for Foxtel in subscription-based sports broadcasting. 


We, in the Liberal Democrats, would like to go further than this bill; we would like to see an end to all restrictions on commercial media ownership, the abolition of local content rules, the abolition of restrictions on what pay TV can bid for and the privatisation of the ABC and SBS dinosaurs to boot. This is because the bottom line is that it is not the business of government to say who owns what and who broadcasts what. Both nannies and aunties are private matters, not matters for the government. However, insofar as this bill is a step in the right direction, I will be supporting it.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2017-09-12,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (18:56):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Bill 2017, especially in relation to regional media. My chief of staff, Greg Kachel, is pretty well known around this building and he has been here with me for nine years, since I started my job on 1 July 2008—that's going back a while now, Senator Smith. I have the same four staff I started with—it means either jobs are scarce or I am a good boss; probably the former, I would think. I couldn't believe it when I moved from South Australia in 1979 to Inverell to find that, wow, they had their own local radio station. Greg had 32 years there—14 years working on the radio and 18 years as its manager. There were about 17 people employed at 2NZ and later on they brought in GEM FM. I think today they probably have five or six employed there. 


What a great and essential service this radio station gives. For example, on 7 February 1991 we had a severe flood in Inverell. The staff were outside on the roof of the local radio station; they set up the transmitter out on the Glen Innes road and they broadcast for four days, relaying messages from the police and informing the community of what was going on with the clean-up et cetera. This is an essential service. This radio station has trained so many people. For example, Ashley Brown from Channel Seven started at 2NZ; Janine Toohey is at 2GB; Kelly Fuller is at ABC Tamworth. Kelly has just had time off on maternity leave, and I wish Kelly all the best when she returns to work. I'm glad she and her husband have the pleasure of a young baby boy. Luke Grant at 2GB spent many years working at 2NZ Inverell. He's a very humorous man; I've enjoyed his company very much. The local radio station is there to serve. I've mentioned my chief of staff, Greg Kachel. He was named best sports presenter in country radio one year and he also won the award for the best news event coverage for the 1991 Inverell flood. For years, 2NZ has had the best sports coverage, including the Grafton to Inverell Cycle Classic. 


Then there's the humour of the local radio station. Years ago, there was a breakfast announcer named Terry Harkins. Come April Fools' Day, the jokes would often come out of the local radio station. One morning—1 April it was—Terry Harkins had a recording playing and the window was open. He said a livestock truck with a load of sheep had tipped over at the end of the town and the street was full of sheep. He was playing, 'Baa, baa,' and out of the window, through his microphone, he was calling for the local farmers: 'Jack, could you bring your sheep dog? We've got to round up these sheep up.' Of course, when Jack rolled in with his dog and his four-wheel drive Hilux, or whatever it was, there was no truck turned over; it was just an April Fools' Day joke. That was one of the many things that happened at the local radio station. There was the year that Pete Diskin was hosting breakfast on April Fools' Day. He said, 'Our chief-of-staff, Greg Kachel, the boss, has gone out to Copeton Dam to go camping and he's got the key to the music room,' so he didn't have any music; he kept playing the one track. He asked, 'Will you bring some music down?' and people were rolling up to the station with their CDs of music, saying, 'Here. Give these a run and play these.' Of course, it was simply an April Fools' Day joke, but people had a laugh out of it. This was the local entertainment by the local station. Greg was telling me that many years ago, when he started—about 41 years ago—there were about 17 people employed. Now there'd be five or six.


The point I make is that, for many in the media, businesses are doing it tough. I know that for a fact. For example, my wife, Nancy, worked for 10 years at The Bingara Advocate newspaper. For the last 20 years or so, she's owned that paper and a couple of years ago bought The Warialda Standard as well when that came on the market, because there was a risk that the The Warialda Standard would close down. If you lose your local paper in your local community, your country town, to a certain extent you lose the heart of your town—the communication—especially the towns with many elderly people who want to know where the meetings are and where the best bargains are at the IGA, et cetera. Nancy's worked hard in her business. I'm very proud of the work she's done. She doesn't make a lot of money, although in the 2015 financial year she made more than $1 billion. Yes, $1 billion more than Fairfax. Nancy made a profit and Fairfax lost a billion dollars. She still didn't make much money, but it was $1 billion more than Fairfax, which is a pretty good story, don’t you think?


All the media—newspapers, radio and, of course, television—are so essential to regional communities. Prime Television in Tamworth has the local news at 6 o'clock every night. Anyone who works in country television will tell you there is an enormous cost to putting local news together. The cameramen and the journalists travel around the community for hundreds of kilometres a day to various towns to do stories and put them together. This legislation makes it easier for television stations like Prime, NBN and WIN to survive financially. I'm quite amazed that those opposite are not supporting this legislation. When you've got Channels Seven, Nine and Ten, Foxtel, Sky, Southern Cross, Prime, NBN and WIN—all the media mobs—supporting it, I can't understand why it's being opposed by the Labor Party and others in this chamber.


I commend my good friend and colleague Senator Bridget McKenzie, who has done so much work on the issue of communications, especially in regional Australia. And I commend Minister Fifield for the great work he's done working with people throughout the coalition to come to a great result.


This legislation removes the reach rule of 75 per cent so that broadcasters can go further than 75 per cent of their audience. It also does away with the two-out-of-three ownership, which means that, if you own a television station and a newspaper in an area, you can't own a radio station as well. It allows people to expand. The reason they're doing that is to allow businesses to survive. I remember when I was a very young fellow in the sixties, we were fortunate to have television in South Australia. We had two television stations, GTS4 at Port Pirie and the ABC from Adelaide. If you turn on free-to-air now, there are many stations: ABC, ABC 1, ABC News 24, 7Mate, Seven, Ten, Nine—you name it. There's probably a selection of 10 to 15 free-to-air stations. Of course, that means that competition for a certain limited market is very tough. Of course, media is one of those industries where the costs continue to go up and up and up—whether it's the cost of employing the people or the cost of the licences. You have such a limited, restricting audience; people just don't flow in the door all the time; and there's only so much advertising that can be carried out. So here is the problem.


The key elements of this package are repealing the 75 per cent audience reach rule. The abolition of the broadcasting licensing fees for television and radio, currently totalling about $130 million a year, will allow broadcasters to better compete with other media platforms. I will give you an example. Prime television may buy programs from Channel 7 and show those programs in Tamworth, for example, through the New England area, but you can't go onto Prime and stream; you have to go to Channel 7. Then of course, Channel 7 in the city gets advertising for that very issue. This will free it up to allow streaming and will make it more competitive. There will be the introduction of a price for the use of spectrum by broadcasters that better reflects its use, a bit like a fuel tax—the more fuel you burn, the more tax you pay. That's fair enough because you're wearing out the roads more et cetera. 


It is also protecting Australian children by banning gambling advertising during sports broadcasts in children's viewing hours. I think that's essential, and I'm sure Senator Xenophon would agree with that immensely. There are amendments to the antisiphoning scheme and list, which is simply there to create a level playing field for so many. I'm a big supporter of that level playing field, and I know it's one thing we don't have in the energy industry. It includes a broad-ranging and comprehensive review of Australian and children's content and a $30 million package for subscription television to support the broadcasting of women's and niche sports.


Revenue for radio and television is flat or declining in real terms. As I said, it's a tough game, as online and on-demand services draw audiences away from the traditional broadcast content. This is the new world that we live in. It's not so much that you have to be within the TV reception area—that was basically a monopoly, as it was in the sixties. Where I grew up, in Port Pirie in the mid-north of South Australia, there was one commercial station, GTS4, and the ABC. As I said, the costs are rising and audiences have the greatest choice ever in what they want to watch. The competition is there, big time. We've seen through technology that you can go on your computer and download any movie or watch whatever you want. It is just open slather to view whatever you want to these days. There is so much competition.


Regional radio, as I mentioned—and I talked about radio 2NZ at Inverell—has faced rising challenges. That is why, unfortunately, you see an owner, who may hold several licences around rural and regional areas, elect to run network programs at parts of the day and at weekends to save costs. Let me expand on that: 2NZ at Inverell was owned by farmers out at Moree, along with 2VM, another great radio station at Moree. Along came the buyers, who bought them up, and now 2NZ is one of 50 or 60 radio stations linked with 2SM in Sydney and the satellite is there. The one I know most about is 2NZ, thanks to Greg Kachel. They used to commence at 5.30 in the morning and they would close at midnight. They wouldn't broadcast from midnight through to 5.30 in the morning. That was shut-down time. Of course, now it's a 24-hour station. They can do that because of satellite and networking keeping the costs down. If you wanted to do that in the old days, you would have had to simply employ more radio announcers to be able to keep the doors open and the station broadcasting longer. 


With the advent of satellite, a city radio station can send its programs live to many stations in regional areas, and that's what happens. With technology, the announcer in a city station can activate a regional station's commercials and weather, and that's exactly how it happens. Someone sitting in a studio in 2SM in Sydney, when it comes to an advert break, simply presses a button and runs the local adverts at local stations, not the city adverts, and likewise with the local weather. Of course, this obviously saves costs because the owner is paying for one announcer's wages rather than having announcers sitting in studios at all of the regional stations. There's undoubtedly a cost element to this.


Broadcast licence fees for radio and television will be replaced by a spectrum price for television and radio that will be set at a total of around $40 million. The first spectrum payment will be made in 2017-18. Unlike broadcast licence fees, a spectrum fee is not based upon revenue; rather, the price takes account of the type of transmitter used, the amount and type of spectrum used, and its location. This is a similar approach to that which applies to other spectrum users. Overall, the vast majority of broadcasters will pay considerably less in spectrum fees than they currently pay in licence fees. This fee relief will enable broadcasters to better compete with online competitors, invest in their businesses and produce Australian content. In June, in relation to the interim relief of $20 million announced in the 2016-17 budget, Joan Warner, the chief executive officer of the industry body Commercial Radio Australia, said:


We welcome the removal of broadcast licence fees for the 2016-17 financial year. It will allow radio to invest more in Australian jobs and content. However, we continue to call on the parliament to support the total media reform package which provides much needed long-term relief for local Australian radio.


That's what this package is about: long-term relief for local Australian radio. The government hopes to deliver permanent financial relief with this reform package.


In relation to the restriction of gambling advertising, the government has listened to the concerns that regular exposure to gambling advertisements during live sport normalises gambling in the eyes of children and encourages vulnerable persons to gamble, simply promoting it too much. In light of these concerns, the government has decided that existing rules are not meeting community expectations and that additional restrictions are required to provide appropriate community safeguards. It is about those safeguards for the community and not overdoing the advertising of gambling. The new restrictions will prohibit all gambling advertising and promotions from five minutes before the scheduled start of play of all live sporting events to five minutes after the conclusion of the play in the period between 5 am and 8.30 pm. The new restrictions are to be implemented, commencing from March 2018. Importantly, the restrictions will apply to commercial television, commercial radio, subscription television, the Special Broadcasting Service and online services showing live sport aimed at Australian audiences. The new restrictions will establish a clear and practical safe zone on any platform for children watching live sport, which will be straightforward for families to observe. The restrictions will apply to all broadcast gambling promotions, including advertising, in-program promotions of betting markets and odds, and sponsorship announcement.


The government will continue to work with industry to ensure the new restrictions are implemented effectively and in a timely manner. There are some existing restrictions in place that will reassure viewers who are worried that they will be saturated with gambling advertisements after this time. Appendix 3 of the Commercial Television Industry Code Of Practice already restricts when betting advertisements or the promotion of odds are permitted. For example, during a live sporting event, gambling advertisements may only be shown at designated times, such as before and after play and during scheduled and unscheduled breaks in play. The promotion of odds is not permitted during play, scheduled breaks or in unscheduled breaks during a live sport event. That is what this package is about: protecting the young from gambling—and not only the young but also the elderly, who may, unfortunately, have a gambling problem.


In regard to amending the antisiphoning scheme and list, the government supports the principle that nationally significant sporting events should be available on free-to-air television—that is most important. We all want to watch the Sydney Swans take out the AFL grand final this year, or even, in two weeks time, when they beat the Adelaide Crows—wouldn't you agree, Senator O'Neill? Are there no South Australians here? Yes, Senator Hanson-Young is here. The government is taking action to modernise the antisiphoning scheme. This includes updating the list of events to remove a modest number of events that no long warrant inclusion on the list. Most of these events coming off the list are those which are no longer broadcast on free-to-air, garner small audiences or where the relationship to Australia is remote or non-existent—for example, the FA Cup final and the US Masters golf. Iconic events like the Olympics, the Commonwealth Games, all AFL and NRL Premiership matches, including finals, the Australian Open tennis and the Melbourne Cup will remain on the list—and so they should. These changes will enable greater competition between subscription broadcasters and free-to-air television, while retaining significant cultural or sporting events on the list to ensure they remain widely available for Australian audiences. Importantly, this does not mean that these events will necessarily end up on pay TV. There are currently events that are broadcast on free-to-air TV that are not and have never been on the antisiphoning list. 


I want to say something about funding for under-represented sports on pay TV. This is very important. The government is providing $7.5 million per annum in funding over four years to subscription television to increase coverage of sports that receive low or no broadcast exposure—women's sports, niche sports and sports that command high levels of community involvement and participation. Women's sports, in particular, remain substantially under-represented in terms of overall coverage and news reporting relative to male sports. In 2013, dedicated television coverage of women in sport made up only seven per cent of all sports coverage. This package includes a promotion of women's sport. It is fair. It is reasonable. It looks after our children. It looks after the gambling issue as far as advertising goes. Most importantly, it provides a mechanism for those many battling media organisations, whether that they be local radio, local newspapers or regional television, to financially survive. We cannot see those great Prime, NBN and WIN television networks go under. That would be a huge loss to our community. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (19:16):  Over the past few months, since the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Bill 2017 was brought forward to be introduced into the parliament, One Nation has had quite extensive talks with people in the industry, interest groups, media outlets and corporations, and they have stated that they wish to see this bill passed. The two-out-of-three rule and the 75 per cent reach rule need to be changed. It's very important to people. The media has changed. TV was first introduced in Australia around the 1950s, and it has changed quite considerably over the period of time since then. We must move with the changes that have happened. As has been stated in the chamber by other speakers, we are seeing that the internet has made a big impact on media. The money that media organisations were making is now taken by internet sales, so the current situation is not reflective of what is happening in newspapers and television. 


This bill is very important to a lot of people. We're hearing that a lot of media outlets are shutting down and journalists are losing their jobs. This needs to be addressed. It concerns me that those on the other side of the chamber, the Labor Party, agree with the two-out-of-three rule and are supportive of it, and yet they won't work towards helping media organisations that are struggling and people who are losing their jobs with regard to this. As I said, we have had extensive talks with the government. What we have brought to their attention, I think, will make a big difference with some of the organisations. What we've raised before is to do with the ABC and community radio, which needs a helping hand. It is struggling. People in rural and regional areas need assistance as well. One Nation will be raising the issues in my further discussions on the floor of parliament with regard to this bill. 


I have a grave concern with the American company CBS buying up Channel 10, if that be the case. Foreign ownership of our media is of grave concern to me. I will talk further about that later on. Information on the remuneration packages of ABC presenters over $200,000 needs to be made available to all Australians, because the taxpayers are paying for this. We will also be addressing the $12 million going into community radio stations over the next four years.

Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (18:27):  The media landscape is changing fast. The industry is changing and the industry's regulation needs changing too. It's ridiculous to say that the only way to defend a struggling industry is to defend the regulation that's preventing it from defending itself against new and enormous threats. But concerns around the potential loss of media diversity as a result of the changes posed are real and valid. It is important that any deal to change regulation also protects media diversity in the process. Nobody wants any one media baron to have excessive power over the political landscape, and the best way to address concerns about private media ownership is to invest in publicly owned media. The government, with courage, would put whatever it's proposing to a vote. That's not what it has agreed to. Instead, reports suggest that the government has made some sneaky handshake deal in a back room somewhere to undermine the operations of the ABC, and it has gone behind the back of the Senate to do it.


I won't be supporting the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Bill 2017, and I'm disappointed that I can't. I'm disappointed that I can't support this bill because I support in principle what it's trying to achieve, but I will not be a part of taking a pitchfork to the ABC.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2017-09-12,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (18:28):  I did have a prepared speech but I want to address that contribution from Senator Lambie. The media reform as presented in this suite of initiatives by the government on a very vexed and difficult issue, which befuddled the opposition when it was in power—I remember under Senator Conroy trying to find some way to ensure the sustainability and diversity of our media in the face of incredible disruption—does not mean a pitchfork to the ABC and does not mean media barons. I'd much rather an Australian own a media company in this country than a foreign company own a media company in this country, which is exactly what can occur, Senator Lambie, under current arrangements. I'm happy to walk you through it if you'd like.


What we have in front of us for this debate is a bill with a comprehensive suite of measures to bring the Australian media landscape out of the 1980s, the era of Michael J Fox, Back to the Future, Duran Duran—you might remember it, Senator Seselja and Senator Smith—before mobile phone companies outbid broadcasters to stream the Ashes or other cricket games, netball games, as we've got at the moment, or indeed AFL. That has always been the purview of our TV broadcasters, but they're being outbid for those sorts of rights and initiatives, and increasingly Australians are using their mobile phones in new and innovative ways that mean that the old regulation, the old way we regulated and the framework in which our media environment exists, is no longer tenable.


I was part of the joint committee in 2013 that made very similar recommendations, and I remember that the National Party then refused to support certain changes to aspects of our media laws because we too were concerned about local content in regional areas. We were worried about large media companies swamping our smaller newspapers, radio broadcasters and TV broadcasters. But five years down the track the reality is that I would rather have some Australian media outlets in regional areas than none, and that is what we're staring down the barrel of if we don't give them a fighting chance to deliver the type of diversity that we need and that technology can deliver us over time even.


This was before we had Netflix, Stan, Facebook or Google. The media environment in this country has been severely disrupted, and we've seen a very direct result and impact of that disruption as journalists face job losses, as Australians turn away from broadsheets to Facebook for their news and as regional broadcasters struggle in the face of decreasing advertising revenue and decreasing eyeballs. We must do something to ensure that regional media diversity is sustainable going forward.


The reality for regional Australians, though, in the way we access information is different, culturally and technologically. We don't necessarily have access to the same communications infrastructure. It's not as easy for many regional Australians to interact with Netflix—yet; it will be, but right now it's not. So we needed to ensure in this package that regional media diversity and local content was secured, and I believe that we have a mechanism within this media reform package to ensure that. We have incentivised those companies who have boots on the ground in our communities, who have cameramen at our sporting events, who have journalists living and working amongst us, telling our stories, working with us to promote community events and sharing in the reporting of emergency broadcasts during bushfires, floods, cyclones and drought. This is the reality. Reporting on somebody's lived experience is very different than having it as part of your own. So, ensuring that this package incentivises media companies to keep that physical commitment to regional Australia—to have the journalists, the cameramen and the cadets locally to train up—is something that I am very pleased is part of this reform initiative.


In the two Senate inquiries that went to the heart of this bill there were issues around whether the reach rule would be repealed. Some of the concerns raised were that online streaming services—straight into peoples' homes, not those that require a broadcasting licence—don't have to include any local regional news, don't need to include any local regional advertising, don't include any local community service announcements and are not subject to the commercial television industry code of practice. So it's very rich for senators to come into this place and try and tell senators that live and work and represent regional communities that keeping the current system in place is better than dealing with the fact that right now regional capitals that have the technology infrastructure, like Bendigo, Sale or Pakenham, those live streaming suites and broadcasters, if you like—I mean, it's a very poor definition of what a broadcaster is, but that's a whole other issue which I think I raised in my additional comments to the Senate report—but don't actually have those sorts of requirements on them that we do put on our TV broadcasters right now. Our TV broadcasters, our WINs, our Prime 7s, are often competing against the mother ship, the mother company of 9, 7 or 10, streaming right into the living rooms with the evening news, without those requirements about backing regional small business and backing regional news. 


In addition to the video-on-demand services and online streaming of metropolitan broadcasts, Prime, in its evidence to the committee, added that the regional television industry is facing several other significant structural challenges, including: a reduction in the size of regional advertising market; encountering a loss of $65 million over the last three years; a decline in actual audience numbers year on year, with the aggregated markets of Queensland, northern and southern NSW and Victoria losing 6.9 per cent of total audience; affiliation fees payable by regional broadcasters to metropolitan networks, which increase every year. You can't get MasterChef, you can't get Survivor unless you do the deal with the metropolitan affiliate. The fact that those affiliation fees go up and up year on year, despite declining revenue and declining eyeballs, is a significant issue for our regional broadcaster. That is why Mitch Fifield, as minister, has been able to perform the miraculous event at which all media outlets have come together as one to say, 'We need this change. We need this change to be sustainable to compete in the current media environment.' 


I want to briefly make comments around the importance of meaningful local content for people living in regional areas. That was emphasised to the committee by the President of the NSW Farmers' Association, Mr Schoen:


It is vitally important to maintain local content in delivery of media services to country areas. It is a little bit like if I went to go to Sydney I would find the news there very alien to me. And if you came to Corowa, I am sure you would find the media that we dish out fairly alien to you. It is vitally important that the content is applicable to the audience that is going to receive it.


I can't back those comments more. That is why I was disappointed by Senator Lambie's comments around the ABC. I am a huge backer of the ABC, particularly local radio, which plays such a vital role in my regional communities—community service announcements; emergency service broadcasts; making sure we have local news and weather; local entertainment. In particular, some of our presenters can be very humorous and keep us laughing. It's the first dial most regional Australians go to. To see, over time, the ABC denuded of its regional voice and staffing, under Mark Scott in particular—I do note the current managing director and board's commitment, through the minister's focus, to actually increasing the level of staffing in regional areas. That is a great thing. It goes to the heart of ensuring local content is available for regional communities. 


I want to go to the three-point system. Currently those senators that are opposing these changes are very happy for regional communities to have someone in Canberra read out Senator Urquhart's media releases, Senator Hanson-Young's media releases, Senator Smith's media releases—




Senator Smith:
  I don't do media releases!




Senator McKENZIE:
  I shouldn't have taken that interjection, but unfortunately I did! But to read out members and senators' media releases and to say that that actually counts as local content—that is appalling. What this bill has done is incentivise those that have employed locally and have maintained that local journalistic commitment to the community. They will receive a points incentive. The regional broadcasters argued that the proposed inclusion of the three-point category for local content would not lead to a reduction in local content, as some others argued, but was indeed something that they very much supported. Prime Media Group said:


…we have committed to a local news bulletin in Western Australia, where we had no licence requirement to do it, says that we are not looking to cut back the amount of local content. We would much prefer to produce more local content.


Again, Mr Lancaster from WIN said:


From a practical perspective, if you as a broadcaster are going to go to the trouble of putting a cameraperson or a journalist … into a market to capture that footage to be locally relevant, why would you give it a reduced amount of time? It is good content. If you are going to invest in the capturing of that content to get that video content, you would not reduce the amount of minutes …


It doesn't make practical sense to those people involved in producing local content that the points system, as envisaged by the legislation, would result in a reduction of local content.


I also want to touch on the negotiations that seem to have been going on around this particular piece of legislation. I note Senator Hanson is in the chamber, and I recognise her support for the ABC rural and regional advocacy bill changes. In exchange for her support for the ABC media reforms, Senator Hanson and One Nation have seen the value in having a change to the ABC's charter, for it to reflect what community thinks it should do. That is: it should have a specific obligation to reflect the geographic diversity of our nation. She sees the value in having two people from rural and regional Australia with embedded experience on the board of the ABC. She sees the value.


Senator Xenophon and I worked on his short wave bill, and we went up with Senator McCarthy and Senator Urquhart to Darwin to talk to the Northern Territory community about the ABC's decision to cut broadcasting through short-wave technology to those communities of the Pacific and northern Australia. It was simply because the board did not consult with the communities affected, and the amount of information given to the board to make that decision was appalling. I would recommend the committee's report into that. Senator Xenophon is very concerned about that particular issue, and he knows the importance of the ABC consulting and having an advisory committee from rural and regional Australia on which to test their ideas around service delivery and the type of technology being used to service regional communities.


Finally, there are just some simple changes to the annual reporting of the ABC around staff and where they are located, to ensure that the ABC is delivering for regional communities. I would encourage and thank Senator Hanson for her support, particularly for those measures in my private senator's bill; I appreciate that very much.


The regional Australia media market is about our people telling our stories to our community—to live amongst us. And this suite of measures, aside from the gambling advertisement issues, sits around the review of children's content and removing and making sure the ownership laws of our media market actually reflect the reality of the 21st century. They give our media owners the flexibility to be nimble and innovative. It is an incredibly tough, disrupted environment out there right now.


In a liberal democracy like ours, you need a multitude of voices for the citizens to consider. Look at the public spend of local governments—and this is one of the issues raised in my private senator's bill, but it is instructive for this particular debate. When you look at the amount of public money being administered by local councils, often the only overseers, the only ones actually examining that spend and the decisions of local governments across this country, are newspapers like the Benalla Ensign, the Riverine Herald up in Echuca and what they look at with the Campaspe Shire, and the Bendigo Weekly, looking at how the Bendigo council administers its funds. It's very important—fundamental to the secure functioning of our democracy indeed—that we have a robust, diverse, sustainable local media. 


I think our reforms are very thoughtful. The minister has widely consulted to ensure that the reform package being delivered here to the Senate tonight, and hopefully to be supported by the Senate this week, will deliver on the promise for Australia. We don't want to be a nation where American TV companies own our regional broadcasters and own our big broadcasters, where we have a diminishing amount of broadsheets available and everything moves online. It is rural and regional communities, and indeed the broader community, who will suffer. I have gone to the heart of ensuring that local production and local content is important. 


The New South Wales Farmers' Association, in their submission on the bill, wanted to look at concerns around the footprint, expanding what definitions around 'local' entail. I know that ACMA will be looking at that. The New South Wales Farmers' Association wanted to request that ACMA be diligent in ensuring effective compliance activities in policing local content. They also recommended that consumer protections in voice and data and telecommunications be upgraded to ensure that regional people have equal access to both voice and data, because, as the media environment changes, it will be more and more important that all Australians are able to access a variety of media voices using a variety of technologies. Right now, in regional Australia, we are going ahead in leaps and bounds. The over 750 mobile phone towers that the coalition government has delivered to regional Australia are going a long way towards that. But the Productivity Commission's USO paper and indeed the government's deliberations around the universal service obligation will go quite deeply to how regional Australians will be able to access news content and information. 


I did have a lot more to say around how ACMA can work with regional Australians' online footprint and ensure local content, but I know there are many other senators who need to speak on this. I commend all those who submitted to the Senate inquiries into this issue over a long period of time. I commend the minister for having a suite of arrangements which try and strike a balance between ensuring our media environment is forward looking, where our media owners are able to be nimble and innovative enough in this 21st century to deliver the content that we need to function, but also ensuring that they are financially sustainable going forward and that we have some rigour around the journalists who keep us all honest every single day of our lives in this job—and you wouldn't want it any other way. I would just like to see it across all levels of government. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2017-09-12,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (18:48):  I rise to speak to the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Bill 2017. The premise underlying broadcasting ownership laws—that government can decide who can and who can't own sections of the media—is little more than nanny state nonsense. It reminds me of countries that don't believe in free speech and where there is no right to hear points of view that are not approved. On top of that is aunty state nonsense, in which the government owns and operates multiple TV, radio and online media behemoths itself. These cost taxpayers a lot of money and compete with the commercial sector, making it less viable. 


This bill reduces restrictions on commercial broadcasting ownership so that the nanny state is a little less intrusive and, hopefully, the commercial sector is better able to withstand the marauding aunty. Probably more significantly, the changes mean that some of the artificial restraints on traditional Australian media that have left them at a competitive disadvantage compared with international internet based businesses such as Google and Facebook will be removed. Global internet based media are expected to attract $4 billion to $5 billion worth of advertising revenue next year. This represents 35 to 40 per cent of the Australian advertising market, and this is only expected to rise, eroding ad revenue available to traditional media faster than any overall advertising growth.


The bill abolishes the two-out-of-three rule. This rule prevents someone from controlling a television station, radio station and non-national newspaper in the same region. Abolishing the rule would allow someone to control all three platforms in the region. This change is supported by most of the media and was specifically requested by the Ten Network in the face of major losses, because declining market share due to online competition has placed them under strain. We now see Ten will be taken over by the US company CBS, because local businesses are unable to do so because of the current legislation. 


While I have no concerns about foreign investment in our media sector, I wonder whether those who have held up this legislation, in particular, Senators Xenophon and Hanson, believe they have done the right thing. Yes, some of the smaller and less efficient media organisations will be swallowed up by larger and more efficient companies, but that is how markets are supposed to work. Takeovers and bankruptcies are the means of selection in the commercial world. Survival depends on offering the cheapest, best value or greatest range to the benefit of consumers. Capitalism without bankruptcy is like Christianity without hell. Why be good if there is no consequence from doing otherwise?


Some oppose the reduction in ownership restrictions based on a view that wicked media barons might somehow take over our news and turn us into brain-washed zombies. This reflects a dated view of news and information. Tradition free-to-air television, radio and print media no longer control our access to news and entertainment because more and more of us are getting this from a wide range of sources on the internet. Media barons already own commercial broadcasting in Australia, so if media barons are a threat to our democracy, that threat exists as much under the current law as under this bill. Whenever people raise fears about media barons determining the news and controlling our minds, they fail to mention the continuing presence of the ABC and SBS. Zombies, indeed. 


The bill will also amend the reach rule by removing the ban on owning licences that cover more than 75 per cent of Australia's population. The 75 per cent reach rule is generally regarded as redundant by the industry, given the availability of online content, which transcends geographic boundaries. These reforms are aimed at allowing Australian television, radio and newspaper companies to operate across more media platforms. However, the bill also inserts a requirement on anyone with more than 75 per cent coverage to air more regional and local content than they are currently required to do. Arguments that the relaxation of ownership laws will hurt Australians in our regions and that regional and local content rules are required to protect precious local content are a complete furphy. 


The simple question is: which would you rather watch? A media conference by the Prime Minister or self-promotion by the local, political blowhard? The State of Origin match or amateur hour at West Wyalong school hall? A gripping US drama or an interminable fishing show about the local waterhole, where hardly anyone ever catches any fish? India versus Australia in the cricket or an interview with a crazy cat lady who lives in a dump bin at the edge of town? The latest movie blockbuster or a drawn-out tourist promo on the world's second largest ball of string? Just because you live in a regional area doesn't mean you are only interested in trivial local issues and want to be left in a low-budget, fly-blown, regional time warp. 


Fortunately, the increased content rules in this bill are a mere blemish in an otherwise laudable bill. Not only does the bill reduce ownership restrictions, but it also changes the so-called antisiphoning rules that prevent pay television from bidding for certain sporting events, unless the event is also to be broadcast on free-to-air or the event starts within the next three months. The bill will allow pay television bids, where the event starts in the next six months, and delists all golf, some rugby league, soccer, rugby union, cricket, tennis, netball and motor sport. The effect of the antisiphoning rules is to reduce access to sports by pay TV. This depresses the prices paid for broadcasting rights, which, in turn, hurts sportsmen and women from the affected sports. It also hurts the sports fans who prefer pay TV, which can often offer a better, less interrupted viewing experience. If pay TV were able to bid for more sports, the pay TV market in Australia could expand, facilitating further improvements in the quality of viewing on offer. Expanding the pay TV market could even support the competition for Foxtel in subscription-based sports broadcasting. 


We, in the Liberal Democrats, would like to go further than this bill; we would like to see an end to all restrictions on commercial media ownership, the abolition of local content rules, the abolition of restrictions on what pay TV can bid for and the privatisation of the ABC and SBS dinosaurs to boot. This is because the bottom line is that it is not the business of government to say who owns what and who broadcasts what. Both nannies and aunties are private matters, not matters for the government. However, insofar as this bill is a step in the right direction, I will be supporting it.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2017-09-12,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (18:56):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Bill 2017, especially in relation to regional media. My chief of staff, Greg Kachel, is pretty well known around this building and he has been here with me for nine years, since I started my job on 1 July 2008—that's going back a while now, Senator Smith. I have the same four staff I started with—it means either jobs are scarce or I am a good boss; probably the former, I would think. I couldn't believe it when I moved from South Australia in 1979 to Inverell to find that, wow, they had their own local radio station. Greg had 32 years there—14 years working on the radio and 18 years as its manager. There were about 17 people employed at 2NZ and later on they brought in GEM FM. I think today they probably have five or six employed there. 


What a great and essential service this radio station gives. For example, on 7 February 1991 we had a severe flood in Inverell. The staff were outside on the roof of the local radio station; they set up the transmitter out on the Glen Innes road and they broadcast for four days, relaying messages from the police and informing the community of what was going on with the clean-up et cetera. This is an essential service. This radio station has trained so many people. For example, Ashley Brown from Channel Seven started at 2NZ; Janine Toohey is at 2GB; Kelly Fuller is at ABC Tamworth. Kelly has just had time off on maternity leave, and I wish Kelly all the best when she returns to work. I'm glad she and her husband have the pleasure of a young baby boy. Luke Grant at 2GB spent many years working at 2NZ Inverell. He's a very humorous man; I've enjoyed his company very much. The local radio station is there to serve. I've mentioned my chief of staff, Greg Kachel. He was named best sports presenter in country radio one year and he also won the award for the best news event coverage for the 1991 Inverell flood. For years, 2NZ has had the best sports coverage, including the Grafton to Inverell Cycle Classic. 


Then there's the humour of the local radio station. Years ago, there was a breakfast announcer named Terry Harkins. Come April Fools' Day, the jokes would often come out of the local radio station. One morning—1 April it was—Terry Harkins had a recording playing and the window was open. He said a livestock truck with a load of sheep had tipped over at the end of the town and the street was full of sheep. He was playing, 'Baa, baa,' and out of the window, through his microphone, he was calling for the local farmers: 'Jack, could you bring your sheep dog? We've got to round up these sheep up.' Of course, when Jack rolled in with his dog and his four-wheel drive Hilux, or whatever it was, there was no truck turned over; it was just an April Fools' Day joke. That was one of the many things that happened at the local radio station. There was the year that Pete Diskin was hosting breakfast on April Fools' Day. He said, 'Our chief-of-staff, Greg Kachel, the boss, has gone out to Copeton Dam to go camping and he's got the key to the music room,' so he didn't have any music; he kept playing the one track. He asked, 'Will you bring some music down?' and people were rolling up to the station with their CDs of music, saying, 'Here. Give these a run and play these.' Of course, it was simply an April Fools' Day joke, but people had a laugh out of it. This was the local entertainment by the local station. Greg was telling me that many years ago, when he started—about 41 years ago—there were about 17 people employed. Now there'd be five or six.


The point I make is that, for many in the media, businesses are doing it tough. I know that for a fact. For example, my wife, Nancy, worked for 10 years at The Bingara Advocate newspaper. For the last 20 years or so, she's owned that paper and a couple of years ago bought The Warialda Standard as well when that came on the market, because there was a risk that the The Warialda Standard would close down. If you lose your local paper in your local community, your country town, to a certain extent you lose the heart of your town—the communication—especially the towns with many elderly people who want to know where the meetings are and where the best bargains are at the IGA, et cetera. Nancy's worked hard in her business. I'm very proud of the work she's done. She doesn't make a lot of money, although in the 2015 financial year she made more than $1 billion. Yes, $1 billion more than Fairfax. Nancy made a profit and Fairfax lost a billion dollars. She still didn't make much money, but it was $1 billion more than Fairfax, which is a pretty good story, don’t you think?


All the media—newspapers, radio and, of course, television—are so essential to regional communities. Prime Television in Tamworth has the local news at 6 o'clock every night. Anyone who works in country television will tell you there is an enormous cost to putting local news together. The cameramen and the journalists travel around the community for hundreds of kilometres a day to various towns to do stories and put them together. This legislation makes it easier for television stations like Prime, NBN and WIN to survive financially. I'm quite amazed that those opposite are not supporting this legislation. When you've got Channels Seven, Nine and Ten, Foxtel, Sky, Southern Cross, Prime, NBN and WIN—all the media mobs—supporting it, I can't understand why it's being opposed by the Labor Party and others in this chamber.


I commend my good friend and colleague Senator Bridget McKenzie, who has done so much work on the issue of communications, especially in regional Australia. And I commend Minister Fifield for the great work he's done working with people throughout the coalition to come to a great result.


This legislation removes the reach rule of 75 per cent so that broadcasters can go further than 75 per cent of their audience. It also does away with the two-out-of-three ownership, which means that, if you own a television station and a newspaper in an area, you can't own a radio station as well. It allows people to expand. The reason they're doing that is to allow businesses to survive. I remember when I was a very young fellow in the sixties, we were fortunate to have television in South Australia. We had two television stations, GTS4 at Port Pirie and the ABC from Adelaide. If you turn on free-to-air now, there are many stations: ABC, ABC 1, ABC News 24, 7Mate, Seven, Ten, Nine—you name it. There's probably a selection of 10 to 15 free-to-air stations. Of course, that means that competition for a certain limited market is very tough. Of course, media is one of those industries where the costs continue to go up and up and up—whether it's the cost of employing the people or the cost of the licences. You have such a limited, restricting audience; people just don't flow in the door all the time; and there's only so much advertising that can be carried out. So here is the problem.


The key elements of this package are repealing the 75 per cent audience reach rule. The abolition of the broadcasting licensing fees for television and radio, currently totalling about $130 million a year, will allow broadcasters to better compete with other media platforms. I will give you an example. Prime television may buy programs from Channel 7 and show those programs in Tamworth, for example, through the New England area, but you can't go onto Prime and stream; you have to go to Channel 7. Then of course, Channel 7 in the city gets advertising for that very issue. This will free it up to allow streaming and will make it more competitive. There will be the introduction of a price for the use of spectrum by broadcasters that better reflects its use, a bit like a fuel tax—the more fuel you burn, the more tax you pay. That's fair enough because you're wearing out the roads more et cetera. 


It is also protecting Australian children by banning gambling advertising during sports broadcasts in children's viewing hours. I think that's essential, and I'm sure Senator Xenophon would agree with that immensely. There are amendments to the antisiphoning scheme and list, which is simply there to create a level playing field for so many. I'm a big supporter of that level playing field, and I know it's one thing we don't have in the energy industry. It includes a broad-ranging and comprehensive review of Australian and children's content and a $30 million package for subscription television to support the broadcasting of women's and niche sports.


Revenue for radio and television is flat or declining in real terms. As I said, it's a tough game, as online and on-demand services draw audiences away from the traditional broadcast content. This is the new world that we live in. It's not so much that you have to be within the TV reception area—that was basically a monopoly, as it was in the sixties. Where I grew up, in Port Pirie in the mid-north of South Australia, there was one commercial station, GTS4, and the ABC. As I said, the costs are rising and audiences have the greatest choice ever in what they want to watch. The competition is there, big time. We've seen through technology that you can go on your computer and download any movie or watch whatever you want. It is just open slather to view whatever you want to these days. There is so much competition.


Regional radio, as I mentioned—and I talked about radio 2NZ at Inverell—has faced rising challenges. That is why, unfortunately, you see an owner, who may hold several licences around rural and regional areas, elect to run network programs at parts of the day and at weekends to save costs. Let me expand on that: 2NZ at Inverell was owned by farmers out at Moree, along with 2VM, another great radio station at Moree. Along came the buyers, who bought them up, and now 2NZ is one of 50 or 60 radio stations linked with 2SM in Sydney and the satellite is there. The one I know most about is 2NZ, thanks to Greg Kachel. They used to commence at 5.30 in the morning and they would close at midnight. They wouldn't broadcast from midnight through to 5.30 in the morning. That was shut-down time. Of course, now it's a 24-hour station. They can do that because of satellite and networking keeping the costs down. If you wanted to do that in the old days, you would have had to simply employ more radio announcers to be able to keep the doors open and the station broadcasting longer. 


With the advent of satellite, a city radio station can send its programs live to many stations in regional areas, and that's what happens. With technology, the announcer in a city station can activate a regional station's commercials and weather, and that's exactly how it happens. Someone sitting in a studio in 2SM in Sydney, when it comes to an advert break, simply presses a button and runs the local adverts at local stations, not the city adverts, and likewise with the local weather. Of course, this obviously saves costs because the owner is paying for one announcer's wages rather than having announcers sitting in studios at all of the regional stations. There's undoubtedly a cost element to this.


Broadcast licence fees for radio and television will be replaced by a spectrum price for television and radio that will be set at a total of around $40 million. The first spectrum payment will be made in 2017-18. Unlike broadcast licence fees, a spectrum fee is not based upon revenue; rather, the price takes account of the type of transmitter used, the amount and type of spectrum used, and its location. This is a similar approach to that which applies to other spectrum users. Overall, the vast majority of broadcasters will pay considerably less in spectrum fees than they currently pay in licence fees. This fee relief will enable broadcasters to better compete with online competitors, invest in their businesses and produce Australian content. In June, in relation to the interim relief of $20 million announced in the 2016-17 budget, Joan Warner, the chief executive officer of the industry body Commercial Radio Australia, said:


We welcome the removal of broadcast licence fees for the 2016-17 financial year. It will allow radio to invest more in Australian jobs and content. However, we continue to call on the parliament to support the total media reform package which provides much needed long-term relief for local Australian radio.


That's what this package is about: long-term relief for local Australian radio. The government hopes to deliver permanent financial relief with this reform package.


In relation to the restriction of gambling advertising, the government has listened to the concerns that regular exposure to gambling advertisements during live sport normalises gambling in the eyes of children and encourages vulnerable persons to gamble, simply promoting it too much. In light of these concerns, the government has decided that existing rules are not meeting community expectations and that additional restrictions are required to provide appropriate community safeguards. It is about those safeguards for the community and not overdoing the advertising of gambling. The new restrictions will prohibit all gambling advertising and promotions from five minutes before the scheduled start of play of all live sporting events to five minutes after the conclusion of the play in the period between 5 am and 8.30 pm. The new restrictions are to be implemented, commencing from March 2018. Importantly, the restrictions will apply to commercial television, commercial radio, subscription television, the Special Broadcasting Service and online services showing live sport aimed at Australian audiences. The new restrictions will establish a clear and practical safe zone on any platform for children watching live sport, which will be straightforward for families to observe. The restrictions will apply to all broadcast gambling promotions, including advertising, in-program promotions of betting markets and odds, and sponsorship announcement.


The government will continue to work with industry to ensure the new restrictions are implemented effectively and in a timely manner. There are some existing restrictions in place that will reassure viewers who are worried that they will be saturated with gambling advertisements after this time. Appendix 3 of the Commercial Television Industry Code Of Practice already restricts when betting advertisements or the promotion of odds are permitted. For example, during a live sporting event, gambling advertisements may only be shown at designated times, such as before and after play and during scheduled and unscheduled breaks in play. The promotion of odds is not permitted during play, scheduled breaks or in unscheduled breaks during a live sport event. That is what this package is about: protecting the young from gambling—and not only the young but also the elderly, who may, unfortunately, have a gambling problem.


In regard to amending the antisiphoning scheme and list, the government supports the principle that nationally significant sporting events should be available on free-to-air television—that is most important. We all want to watch the Sydney Swans take out the AFL grand final this year, or even, in two weeks time, when they beat the Adelaide Crows—wouldn't you agree, Senator O'Neill? Are there no South Australians here? Yes, Senator Hanson-Young is here. The government is taking action to modernise the antisiphoning scheme. This includes updating the list of events to remove a modest number of events that no long warrant inclusion on the list. Most of these events coming off the list are those which are no longer broadcast on free-to-air, garner small audiences or where the relationship to Australia is remote or non-existent—for example, the FA Cup final and the US Masters golf. Iconic events like the Olympics, the Commonwealth Games, all AFL and NRL Premiership matches, including finals, the Australian Open tennis and the Melbourne Cup will remain on the list—and so they should. These changes will enable greater competition between subscription broadcasters and free-to-air television, while retaining significant cultural or sporting events on the list to ensure they remain widely available for Australian audiences. Importantly, this does not mean that these events will necessarily end up on pay TV. There are currently events that are broadcast on free-to-air TV that are not and have never been on the antisiphoning list. 


I want to say something about funding for under-represented sports on pay TV. This is very important. The government is providing $7.5 million per annum in funding over four years to subscription television to increase coverage of sports that receive low or no broadcast exposure—women's sports, niche sports and sports that command high levels of community involvement and participation. Women's sports, in particular, remain substantially under-represented in terms of overall coverage and news reporting relative to male sports. In 2013, dedicated television coverage of women in sport made up only seven per cent of all sports coverage. This package includes a promotion of women's sport. It is fair. It is reasonable. It looks after our children. It looks after the gambling issue as far as advertising goes. Most importantly, it provides a mechanism for those many battling media organisations, whether that they be local radio, local newspapers or regional television, to financially survive. We cannot see those great Prime, NBN and WIN television networks go under. That would be a huge loss to our community. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2017-09-12,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (19:16):  Over the past few months, since the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Bill 2017 was brought forward to be introduced into the parliament, One Nation has had quite extensive talks with people in the industry, interest groups, media outlets and corporations, and they have stated that they wish to see this bill passed. The two-out-of-three rule and the 75 per cent reach rule need to be changed. It's very important to people. The media has changed. TV was first introduced in Australia around the 1950s, and it has changed quite considerably over the period of time since then. We must move with the changes that have happened. As has been stated in the chamber by other speakers, we are seeing that the internet has made a big impact on media. The money that media organisations were making is now taken by internet sales, so the current situation is not reflective of what is happening in newspapers and television. 


This bill is very important to a lot of people. We're hearing that a lot of media outlets are shutting down and journalists are losing their jobs. This needs to be addressed. It concerns me that those on the other side of the chamber, the Labor Party, agree with the two-out-of-three rule and are supportive of it, and yet they won't work towards helping media organisations that are struggling and people who are losing their jobs with regard to this. As I said, we have had extensive talks with the government. What we have brought to their attention, I think, will make a big difference with some of the organisations. What we've raised before is to do with the ABC and community radio, which needs a helping hand. It is struggling. People in rural and regional areas need assistance as well. One Nation will be raising the issues in my further discussions on the floor of parliament with regard to this bill. 


I have a grave concern with the American company CBS buying up Channel 10, if that be the case. Foreign ownership of our media is of grave concern to me. I will talk further about that later on. Information on the remuneration packages of ABC presenters over $200,000 needs to be made available to all Australians, because the taxpayers are paying for this. We will also be addressing the $12 million going into community radio stations over the next four years.


Debate interrupted.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2017-09-12,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (19:20):  I rise to speak on matters of importance to all creatures great and small. Last week I had the pleasure of joining Jason Wood MP, the member for La Trobe, to relaunch the Parliamentary Friends of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the RSPCA. Also with us was Gary Humphries, the chair of RSPCA Australia; its CEO, Heather Neil; RSPCA chief scientist Dr Bridda Jones; and veterinarian Dr Bronwyn Orr, who was there to answer all our animal and pet related questions. Their generosity with their time and expertise was critical to the success of the event—that and, of course, the animal-shaped cupcakes!


The Parliamentary Friends of the RSPCA existed in previous parliaments under the chairmanship of then Senator Gary Humphries, among others, but had lapsed in recent times. So Jason Wood and I have committed the newly relaunched friendship group to some important goals, including supporting the prevention of cruelty to animals, both in Australia and internationally; promoting in parliament the work of the RSPCA and raising community awareness regarding the humane treatment of animals; encouraging the Australian government to promote animal welfare nationally, enact new legislation where required, and work with industry and RSPCA Australia to establish appropriate standards for animal care.


While Parliamentary friendship groups of the RSPCA have a long history in this place, it is as nothing compared to the history of the RSPCA in Australia. The RSPCA's Australian beginnings date back to Victoria in 1871, where a public meeting held to discuss the ill-treatment of horses led to the formation of the society. The RSPCA was established to promote animal welfare. It is an extraordinary organisation created by the community and driven by strong community support. This is no doubt partly because, at 63 per cent, Australia has one of the highest rates of pet ownership in the world. Thirty-nine per cent of Australian households, like Jason's, own a dog, while 29 per cent of households, like mine, own a cat.


Today the RSPCA is one of the most trusted and respected charities in Australia. Amazingly, despite running shelters across the country and employing some 1,000 staff, the RSPCA is funded almost entirely through community donations. It does not just take in and care for lost, abandoned, and abused animals; it also investigates complaints of animal cruelty and provides information to millions of Australians about animal welfare and responsible animal care and pet ownership.


For me, as the lucky owner of Benny, the world's most wonderful cat, it pains me to acknowledge that cats remain the biggest issue for the RSPCA. It was an issue brought home to me during the launch as we listened to the presentation of Dr Jones. We heard that over the last two decades around 55,000 cats per year have been brought into Australian RSPCA shelters. That is enough cats to fill an Olympic swimming pool every five years. It is far and away the largest workload for shelters. Unfortunately, although numbers have been substantially reduced, many of these cats are still being euthanased.


Cats also remain a major threat to Australian wildlife. According to research by Edith Cowan University, they are implicated in the extinction of at least 20 Australian mammal species or subspecies. The RSPCA has been working hard to reduce this threat by promoting responsible cat ownership through desexing, proper registration, microchipping and containment.


I commend the work of the RSPCA in Australia and all of its divisions across the country, and I look forward to the Parliamentary Friends of the RSPCA's next event, where we will bring back the iconic Hounds on the Hill!
