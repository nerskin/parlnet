Leave granted.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,3,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2006-09-14,"—I have spoken to Senator Minchin this morning about this. Previously when we have dealt with very complex issues that are the subject of conscience votes by the major parties there has been strong consultation and involvement to deal with process so that we end up arguing about the issue, not the process. Labor has been at pains to ensure that all senators have the opportunity to participate in the debate, that they are happy with the process, that they have their views heard and tested and that the views of those members of the public who are interested in the debate are aired and tested. As Labor leader in the Senate, I was unaware until this morning that two motions were to be brought forward—one from Senator Humphries and one from Senator Patterson—seeking to refer bills not yet introduced into the chamber to a committee that was required to report by 27 October. Both came as a surprise to me. I understand they were discussed by the whips last night. This obviously implies there is some agreement on the government side about how the government is handling these matters.
I think that, out of respect to the chamber, all the senators ought to know what has been determined by the government for the handling of the process. While some senators may have been consulted by the proponents of the various resolutions—and some of them may come from various sides of the chamber—those responsible for the management of the chamber need to be in the process. For instance, in terms of the motions moved today, Labor senators may want to amend one or more of them—I do not know. I do not know whether they were all aware this was coming on today, other than having the opportunity to see it on the Notice Paper.
The point I made to Senator Minchin this morning—and I accept that he accepts that this is not meant as a shot against anybody—is that the reason the Senate has in the past handled these matters with a great deal of dignity and respect for different views, and has allowed really well-formed and polite, civil debates about really difficult issues, is that we have agreed on the process and all senators have felt that they have had the opportunity to contribute and participate. Of great credit to the parliament is the way in which we have dealt with the RU486 debate, the euthanasia debate and the original stem cell debate.
My statement is a plea for us to consult and agree on the process before this occurs. I was unaware until this morning that the government had agreed on a timetable for considering the bill. Whether or not the government has agreed, I do not know, so why are we reporting on 27 October? As an individual senator, I might prefer to make it the middle of November, but I would do that on the basis of knowing when the government was prepared to allow the debate. Without that information I cannot make a sensible decision on Senator Patterson’s motion. I understand why it may not be appropriate to delay this resolution today, because it seems that there is some urgency now. The only reason there would be urgency is if there is an agreement that the bill will come on at some stage.
Anyway, these are all issues I am not privy to, but the important point I want to make is that all the Senate ought to be aware of the processes that are to occur. We all ought to be consulted about that and have the opportunity to express a view about it so that, when we debate the issue, we are debating only the issue and not, as with some recent government legislation, the process about whether the Senate has been allowed enough time and whether we have heard from the appropriate witnesses. So I think it is important that we agree on a better process. This morning Senator Minchin has agreed to hold a leaders’ and whips’ meeting, and I think that is a useful way forward.
I indicate that I am speaking only on behalf of the Labor Party about the process; we all have different views about the issues. But I think we do need to get this right, as we have in the past, and not be confronted with sudden resolutions about references et cetera, particularly about bills I have not seen. I presume this is an assurance that both Senator Patterson’s and Stott Despoja’s bills will be ready, available and open to discussion well before 27 October, but I have no reassurance or information on that. I think these are important issues in that the Senate and all senators ought to be treated with greater respect. I am not accusing anyone of poor intent, but I think this highlights the problem. On a personal level, I would much prefer one bill to come forward, not two. It has been suggested to me that government senators might prefer a bill produced by a government senator. Bully for them; this is an issue for all the Senate, and I would prefer—and this is not the Labor Party’s position; it is a personal view—that we dealt with one bill. As I say, I think we have to get the process right so that we end up discussing the very important issues that are at stake here, not the process.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,3,1
"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2006-09-14,"—by leave—I am somewhat puzzled by some of the detail of what Senator Evans has raised this morning. This has been a matter of consultation between the two whips and, as I understand it, in the committee. There have been meetings within the committee and all members of the committee have been present. Certainly at the whips’ meeting last night and yesterday, when Senator Patterson was giving notice of motion, there was an outline of this process, and I am somewhat puzzled that members of the committee and the opposition whip have not kept their leader informed. It is certainly not from the government’s position that there has not been consultation on this matter.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,3,1
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2006-09-14,"—by leave—I am a bit bemused by the statement just made by the Government Whip, because the only discussions that occurred at the whips’ meeting last night was the fact that there were two proposals from different government senators and an indication, which I gave at the meeting, based on information from our shadow minister, that we would be supporting No. 2, not No. 1, which is the normal process. There was no discussion in respect of the detail of either of the proposals or how the debate would be handled. As Senator Evans has correctly indicated, we have known nothing; we have been told nothing about what the government intends to do in respect of this bill from this point onwards.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,3,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2006-09-14,"—by leave—I hope we do not make a mountain out of a molehill here. I accept in good faith what Senator Evans has said. I accept that it is very important that on the significant conscience issues the Senate debates from time to time we get as much goodwill and consensus about how they are handled—that is important. There is a point at which matters are dealt with on a government-opposition basis and they then become fully conscience issues. For my part, I want to seek to avoid any dispute about how the matters are handled but, with great respect, it is a little difficult, because they are private members’ bills dealing with conscience matters. The bills have not actually been presented, so we are feeling our way forward on this, but I accept that we do need to get clarity on the process as soon as possible. That is why I have suggested that we have a leaders’ and whips’ meeting today straight after question time to ensure that there is no confusion or misunderstanding about how we should deal with this and that we get some consensus. Perhaps we can proceed on that basis. Accept our apologies if there has been any misunderstanding. Hopefully we can start from a clean sheet from today and deal with this as best we can. It is not going to be easy for any of us.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,3,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2006-09-14,"—by leave—The Democrats are happy to support the motion before us. Our understanding as of last night was that it may be an amended motion as part of a compromise. Whether or not that is the case, we are still happy to support this inquiry. In relation to the matter of a bill, Senator Evans, I will be happy to oblige and get you something by close of business today.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,3,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2006-09-14,"—by leave—As Senator Minchin has said, this is a difficult situation because it is a private member’s bill. I had actually mentioned in the first meeting of the Community Affairs Committee that the government had a timetable and would like to get it through. It is, as I said, difficult because I am not the whip; I am presenting the private member’s bill. I did indicate that it was the government’s wish to have it through and that we would need to try and integrate the days. I have set the date for the 27th on the basis of all the other things that the committee has to do. It has a huge load. I would like to know with whom I can consult on the other side. It is difficult to consult with the whole of the Senate. I did consult with Senator Stott Despoja and I thought I had indicated the government’s wish to the committee. As Senator Minchin said, if anybody has felt that they have misunderstood or not been informed, I apologise for that and I hope we can find a mechanism for dealing with it. It is a private member’s bill and quite a long and difficult bill.

I presume this is an assurance that both Senator Patterson’s and Stott Despoja’s bills will be ready, available and open to discussion well before 27 October, but I have no reassurance or information on that. I think these are important issues in that the Senate and all senators ought to be treated with greater respect. I am not accusing anyone of poor intent, but I think this highlights the problem. On a personal level, I would much prefer one bill to come forward, not two. It has been suggested to me that government senators might prefer a bill produced by a government senator. Bully for them; this is an issue for all the Senate, and I would prefer—and this is not the Labor Party’s position; it is a personal view—that we dealt with one bill. As I say, I think we have to get the process right so that we end up discussing the very important issues that are at stake here, not the process.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,COMMITTEES,3,2
"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2006-09-14,"—by leave—I am somewhat puzzled by some of the detail of what Senator Evans has raised this morning. This has been a matter of consultation between the two whips and, as I understand it, in the committee. There have been meetings within the committee and all members of the committee have been present. Certainly at the whips’ meeting last night and yesterday, when Senator Patterson was giving notice of motion, there was an outline of this process, and I am somewhat puzzled that members of the committee and the opposition whip have not kept their leader informed. It is certainly not from the government’s position that there has not been consultation on this matter.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,COMMITTEES,3,2

There was no discussion in respect of the detail of either of the proposals or how the debate would be handled.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2006-09-14,"—by leave—I hope we do not make a mountain out of a molehill here. I accept in good faith what Senator Evans has said. I accept that it is very important that on the significant conscience issues the Senate debates from time to time we get as much goodwill and consensus about how they are handled—that is important. There is a point at which matters are dealt with on a government-opposition basis and they then become fully conscience issues. For my part, I want to seek to avoid any dispute about how the matters are handled but, with great respect, it is a little difficult, because they are private members’ bills dealing with conscience matters. The bills have not actually been presented, so we are feeling our way forward on this, but I accept that we do need to get clarity on the process as soon as possible. That is why I have suggested that we have a leaders’ and whips’ meeting today straight after question time to ensure that there is no confusion or misunderstanding about how we should deal with this and that we get some consensus. Perhaps we can proceed on that basis. Accept our apologies if there has been any misunderstanding. Hopefully we can start from a clean sheet from today and deal with this as best we can.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2006-09-14,"—by leave—As Senator Minchin has said, this is a difficult situation because it is a private member’s bill. I had actually mentioned in the first meeting of the Community Affairs Committee that the government had a timetable and would like to get it through. It is, as I said, difficult because I am not the whip; I am presenting the private member’s bill. I did indicate that it was the government’s wish to have it through and that we would need to try and integrate the days. I have set the date for the 27th on the basis of all the other things that the committee has to do. It has a huge load. I would like to know with whom I can consult on the other side. It is difficult to consult with the whole of the Senate. I did consult with Senator Stott Despoja and I thought I had indicated the government’s wish to the committee. As Senator Minchin said, if anybody has felt that they have misunderstood or not been informed, I apologise for that and I hope we can find a mechanism for dealing with it. It is a private member’s bill and quite a long and difficult bill.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2006-09-14,"—Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent him moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion no. 546.
I was prepared to simply have a count of the voices on that motion but, seeing as formality has been denied, I hope whoever denied it—Senator George Campbell—will let us know why. It is a very simple motion about the right of Australians to die with dignity. I particularly wanted it dealt with today because we are approaching the 10th anniversary of the death of Bob Dent, the first person to have a legally assisted and compassionate death under the Northern Territory euthanasia laws. There were four such people before there was as override from this parliament. That happened in March 1997 finally, with the passage of a private member’s bill known as the Andrews legislation.
It is high time that we revisited this issue, because we as a mature nation ought to be moving to allow Australians to die with dignity. The obvious alternative viewpoint is that Australians do not have the right to die with dignity, and to block a vote on the matter is to lead me to now call for a debate on the matter. That, of course, will be determined by the vote that is going to follow after this very short debate. It is an important matter. It should not be swept under the carpet and it is a matter for debate. I know that there will be the argument that this is not the way to do it, that it should be done in some other forum or that we should be debating it in some other way. But, if you look at the record, nobody brought it forward in the long intervening period until I did now.
As a former doctor, I am aware through the Medical Journal of Australia that there are some 4,000 assisted compassionate deaths by doctors in Australia at the moment. We ought to legalise the matter. We ought to ensure that those Australian citizens who are dying from a terminal illness without chance of a recovery, who are suffering and who find indignity in the long process of death in an age when the dying process as well as the living process in our society is becoming longer, have a right to a determination to end the indignity and the suffering and, with their families and with the backup of proper medical authority, are able to have a release from that suffering.
The matter is important. I will listen carefully to the debate. I suspect there will be statements that this is not the proper way to do it. Senator Allison has a bill on the Notice Paper. I have spoken with her about that, and I support that bill. In fact, I was moving for the same legislation to be brought forward on the Notice Paper. We will be moving to have that brought up for debate, and let the debate be enjoined. The worst thing is to have our heads in the sand—to be trying to deny that as we sit here comfortably today there are people in very undignified circumstances in a slow, prolonged dying process in this nation of ours who should be given an option but who are not being given that option. Since the debate in this place, other countries, including Catholic Belgium, have moved to give people that right. Australia should be doing the same.
I feel very strongly about this because, as a doctor, I have been involved in the process of people being in a long dying process who do not want to continue their suffering, their indignity. And only they can determine that. Of course there have to be proper rules and forms, and we know all about those in Australia. We have the wit and wisdom to do that and not to leave the situation where doctors have to make decisions without proper conversation with their patients—and to do it every day in Australia. This motion is just the start of a process. I suspect we may get a vote against having a debate on the matter. I think that is a sad reflection on the courage of us all to take on this important issue, debate it and come to a better result than we have so far.",SENATE,<title>EUTHANASIA</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,MOTIONS,12,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2006-09-14,"—We are debating why this motion should be declared urgent and why this debate should come forward. Senator Brown did not address that, but I was not going to call a point of order on him. Senator Brown—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—this is shorthand for euthanasia. If you want to put up a euthanasia motion, at least be honest enough to call it euthanasia, not ‘the right to die with dignity’. Of course everyone wants the right to die with dignity, but if you are honest with the Senate and with the Australian people you will put up the right motion. But you do not want to frighten the horses, so you are making it a horse of a different colour, if I can use that expression. We had this debate a number of years ago. It was divisive; it divided the community. In fact, I have never had such hate mail from certain sections of the community.

Senator Robert Ray interjecting—

—I do not have 13 staff.
 (Senator Ferguson)—Order! Senator Boswell, ignore the interjections.
—Let us not go down that road, but that is completely untrue. This has been on Senator Brown’s mind for a number of years, and he persists in bringing it up against the wishes of the Senate in general. Recently in South Australia a Democrat in their state parliament produced methods of suicide. The speech was eventually struck off the Hansard because it was feared that it contained advice that would have triggered deaths. You, Senator Brown, received a gong from Dr Nitschke’s organisation—if we can call him a doctor; Dr Death—for services to the right-to-die movement. I hope you were proud when you received that medal on supporting euthanasia. In 1997, the Greens introduced into the Tasmanian parliament the Medical Treatment and Natural Death Bill. That bill was written by you, Senator Brown. One thing that we can say about you, Senator Brown, is that you are certainly consistent. You certainly want doctors to have the ability to—
—I wasn’t in the parliament and I didn’t write the bill.
—Order! Senator Brown, you were heard in silence; let Senator Boswell continue.
—It was written by Senator Brown in 1985. Senator Brown, if you are determined to keep pursuing euthanasia then be honest about it.
—We have a bill coming.
—Be honest about it. Don’t try to put up some sort of subterfuge in this parliament where you call it ‘the right to die with dignity’. Be honest and say ‘euthanasia’. I do not see any reason why we should proceed with this debate. I do not think in the mind of the Senate that we want to bring on this very divisive debate. We had the debate four years ago. That was considered over a two- or three-month period when people could actually make their decisions, have Senate inquiries and call witnesses. But, no, today you want to jump up and hijack the parliament so you can pursue this stupid ideology that you have—you want to get this parliament to back you in euthanasia when it is opposed by the majority in this parliament.",SENATE,<title>EUTHANASIA</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,MOTIONS,12,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2006-09-14,"—Labor voted not formal on this motion because we think it is an inappropriate way to bring on a debate that is much more complex and is intended to reflect something that is not honestly put in the motion. Quite frankly, Senator Brown, in speaking to the motion, you very much let the cat out of the bag. On the face of it, the motion says:
That the Senate supports the right of Australians to die with dignity.
No-one could disagree with that. Everyone hopes that everyone gets the opportunity very late in life to die with dignity. But when you spoke you talked about the 10th anniversary of Bob Dent’s legally assisted death. You talked about the override and the Northern Territory legislation. Be honest enough to put it in the motion. Be honest enough to be up front about it. I think this was quite sneaky and does your reputation no good at all, Senator Brown. I have respect for you, but this is not the way to behave. This is not the way to use the Senate. You make speeches, as I do, about the appropriateness of Senate process, about treating the Senate and senators appropriately.
—Where’s your motion?
—I do not have to bring on a motion. I do not believe we should consider euthanasia with a one-line motion moved in the Senate without debate. I think that is a really inappropriate way to deal with a complex issue. How I vote on euthanasia will be on the record when we have a proper debate by virtue of a bill, where people get to express their views. Quite frankly, this does you no credit at all. Not only is it a blunt instrument but also complex issues are allegedly brought down to one simple line which, at first blush, appears inoffensive, but when you speak you make it clear that you want de facto to have a debate about euthanasia. You expect to put through the Senate without debate a motion about euthanasia.
—You are about to block the debate.
—Leave me alone! This is a cheap political stunt and you know better.
—You know better.
—No, Senator Brown, you know better. As I said, quite frankly this does you a disservice. Those motions and that process are designed to deal with things that are expressions of the Senate view. If you expect the Senate to express a view on euthanasia without debate, with a one-line motion that is not even honest, I think you ought to think again because you have not treated us with respect and you have not acted in a way that brings you any credit at all. If you want to bring on a bill about euthanasia, I will vote for us having the capacity to debate it as individuals. You know this issue is a matter of conscience, that both major political parties have allowed their senators to vote on the basis of their own conscience, but you think that you can pull a stunt on a Thursday morning that somehow we are going to pass a resolution about euthanasia. As I said, it is breathtaking and it does you no credit.
No senators were consulted. Until you spoke today, I did not honestly know what was intended by this motion. Thankfully, you were honest about what you intended, but in reading the motion we would not have known that. Quite frankly, I am confirmed in my view that we should have voted no to the formality request. I am angrier now than I was before about this stunt. If you want to debate serious ethical issues, do it properly. As I said earlier today, this Senate has a good record of dealing with these things in a mature and proper way, allowing senators the respect they deserve—to articulate their views and examine issues properly. We did that with the euthanasia bill last time. I voted against the Andrews bill and I was unsuccessful, but I did that after examination of the issues, a proper debate in the Senate and a proper community debate. Stunts such as this are not appropriate and do you a disservice, Senator Brown. They treat the Senate with a total disrespect. We will not be supporting this sort of stunt. That is not the way to have a debate on euthanasia. If you want to debate euthanasia, do it properly: put up a bill, inform the public, inform the Senate and treat your fellow senators with a bit more respect.",SENATE,<title>EUTHANASIA</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,MOTIONS,12,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2006-09-14,"—I want to indicate that my colleagues and I will not be voting on this matter. I think it is a great shame. I stand in this place as someone who is very supportive of reform of our laws to ensure that people can die with dignity, if that is what they choose. As has already been mentioned, my bill would have overturned the Andrews bill. Things have moved on since we last had that debate, and it is appropriate for us to discuss it. We cannot do this in a shorthand way; we cannot vote on a very simplistic statement. It is disappointing that it has come down to this. I would welcome a proper debate on the subject of voluntary euthanasia because many people feel it important to have that opportunity available.
We need to recognise that voluntary euthanasia does happen. Sometimes with their consent, sometimes at their insistence, people are euthanased in this country. We need to talk about it, but I would prefer that we did that with a bill or indeed with a general reference. I would be delighted if we were to refer this matter to a committee for consideration. There is no urgency at this point for us to vote on this. It is not going to take us anywhere. It does not say what will happen if we do vote on it. It will not progress the issue, and that is the problem that I have with it. In fact, it is more likely to get people’s backs up.
Senator Brown, I suggest that you withdraw this motion. As you are hearing, around the chamber there is an interest in us debating it, but debating it for half an hour on a Thursday is not my idea of an informed debate or a worthy way to treat such a profoundly important issue, one on which views are deeply held. This issue is rightly given a conscience vote because people hold very strong views on both positions.

"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2006-09-14,"—Family First believes the phrase ‘dying with dignity’ is really code for euthanasia. The reality is: every Australian wants to die with dignity but not everyone wants to deliberately end someone else’s life. Family First opposes deliberately ending a person’s life or helping them to end their own life. We have already seen how far the euthanasia agenda goes. Dr Philip Nitschke has already moved quickly to assisted suicide, as well as giving depressed and suicidal people the means to end their own lives. This is not something that the Australian community believes is right.
Suicide is a major issue in Australia. In fact, more Australians commit suicide than are killed on the roads each year. Family First believes we should be focusing on supporting those desperate people who are thinking about suicide. We should be treating their depression and their pain. Family First does not believe euthanasia is a solution. It certainly does not address the needs of Australians in crisis. What message are we sending our kids? Suicide is not a solution. We should be looking at helping people who are obviously in desperate need of help. We should be doing all we possibly can.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2006-09-14,"—The difficulty we have with a motion such as this is that it is an all-encompassing motion of great seriousness. How we could possibly have declared it formal and put it through without debate is beyond me. The Senate has shown a lot of forbearance in having a lot of motions declared formal and voted on without debate. It is an increasing trend—we know that. We are averaging about four divisions a day on these matters. It is not as though the Labor Party, by objecting to Senator Brown’s motion, has been at all spiteful. It has been consistent. The issues raised, and as explained by Senator Brown here today, are serious issues. You cannot just vote on them without debate. As to their urgency, Senator Brown let the cat out of the bag in interjecting on Senator Boswell, when he said that he had a bill coming in here to deal with it. Am I misquoting you?
—No—Senator Allison has a bill.
—Senator Allison has—so that is the appropriate time to debate this issue. It will be debated as an issue, I assume with a conscience vote. The one difficulty will be gathering enough time to do so; I concede that. It is not easy in general business to bring any of these things to a resolution, as we will find out later today with the ACT self-government bill. It is very difficult to do so. There was a bit of grumpiness initially from Senator Brown, who wanted to know who objected, who declared this not formal. We are saying it was us, and we are not apologising for it. We are not going to apologise for it, because it is a major issue that cannot be just voted on, yes or no. There is subtlety of positions to be explained on all sides. We will have an opportunity when Senator Allison’s legislation comes in to discuss it—maybe not to resolve it, but to discuss it. That is the appropriate time.

It is my view—from an interchange that Senator Sherry, on behalf of the opposition, and I, on behalf of the Democrats, have had with the minister at estimates and in previous discussions on this matter in superannuation bills—that the minister has made it clear to us that he personally wishes to advance this particular policy but that he needs to ensure that the government is able to cover off all the various issues. I will read into the record an answer which is somewhat more formal than the more encouraging remarks the minister has made by way of direct questioning. Question No. 1692 to the Minister for Finance and Administration read as follows:

Senator Allison asked the Minister for Finance and Administration, upon notice, on 11 April 2006:
With reference to the recent statements by the Prime Minister about the removal of discrimination against same-sex couples, and to the then Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan’s, second reading speech on 22 June 2004 in relation to proposed interdependency provisions in Commonwealth superannuation schemes:
(1)      What was the result of the review conducted by ministers responsible for the Commonwealth superannuation schemes, to ‘ensure consistency with these interdependency amendments’.
(2)      When is it anticipated that legislation ensuring this ‘consistency’ will be introduced in the Parliament.
Senator Minchin answered, with respect to (1) and (2):
The Government is committed to providing all Australian Government employees with equitable and flexible superannuation arrangements and has introduced the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan (PSSAP) to provide a fully funded accumulation scheme for new employees. Through the PSSAP, the Government provides for death benefits to be available to the dependant of a scheme member—which can include a person in an interdependency relationship. Members can also nominate a dependant or dependants or a legal personal representative to receive those benefits. The PSSAP applies to new Australian Government employees who commenced employment on or after 1 July 2005.
Most Australian superannuation schemes are accumulation schemes, like the PSSAP, which can be readily adapted to pay death benefits to people in an interdependency relationship with no cost to the scheme. The Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS) and Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (PSS) however, are closed, defined benefit schemes. They are more complex and have very prescriptive rules to determine eligibility for death benefits.
Unlike accumulation funds, benefits in the CSS and PSS are unfunded. This means that benefits in the CSS and PSS are funded by the Government from the Budget when they become payable rather than as they accrue, such as in accumulation funds. Unlike accumulation funds, benefits in the CSS and PSS are usually provided in pension form to eligible spouses and children and are payable for life in the case of a spouse.
Extending eligibility to death benefits from the CSS and the PSS to people in an interdependency relationship is likely to increase scheme costs and the Government’s unfunded liabilities because these changes may mean some people would qualify for a lifetime pension which they would not otherwise be entitled to receive. This could have a significant impact on the Budget. Unfunded superannuation liabilities are the Australian Government’s largest liability, currently amounting to more than $96 billion and are expected to grow to around $140 billion by 2020.
The Government has indicated that the issue of extending eligibility for death benefits in these schemes to persons in an interdependency relationship with a scheme member is being examined. However, because of the design of these schemes, a number of technical matters and also Budgetary considerations need to be fully examined before any decision could be made.
If I can recap: it is quite clear that the interdependency relationship has been accepted into law, as defined in section 27AAB of the Income Tax Assessment Act, and that the policy of addressing this issue has been accepted by the government with respect to the minister’s, the Prime Minister’s and Senator Coonan’s previous remarks. Therefore, in shorthand, my belief is that the concern is about money: what is it going to cost? Now, if there were very few people of a gay or lesbian persuasion, money would not matter. That means that not only is this an issue of discrimination but it is actually an issue of discrimination against very large numbers of people—because why would there be a budgetary consideration if there were just one or two people disadvantaged in this way scattered through the public sector? So that is an interesting perspective in itself, because the government obviously has a view that the numbers are quite large.
My suggestion to the minister—through you, Madam Chair—is that, if the minister is finding it difficult to get the cabinet to advance this all in one go across the range of superannuation schemes which the government has control of, perhaps the best thing would be to lay out a timetable and introduce these changes on a planned and phased basis. For the purpose of that remark, I wish to indicate to the chamber that, as far as I am aware, there are eight schemes that the government can deal with on this matter. I will go through them in order of numbers—I would assume the easiest and the cheapest ones to deal with are the ones with the lowest numbers, but perhaps that is not the case. The following are the fund or scheme names and the numbers affected: governor-generals, five—whether one of our former governor-generals might fall into the category we are discussing is neither here nor there, but the fact is that the scheme does discriminate against governor-generals; federal judges, 220; Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme members, 546; Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme members—the numbers I am giving are the estimated numbers of members as at 30 June 2005, so they are not exact—50,000; Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme members, 63,317; Australian Government Employees Superannuation Trust members, 150,000, which as we know is the fund under which new politicians since 2004 fall; Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme members, 157,821; and Public Sector Superannuation Scheme members, 252,025. So the total number of people affected as at 30 June 2005 is an estimated 673,934.
The government is aware that certainly the Democrats—the opposition can speak for themselves—are not going to let this issue go. The government is aware it is an issue of equity which must be addressed sooner or later. I think the government needs to have a plan. I think you have had enough time, over several years, to work out a plan and to work out where you should go with this. What I am suggesting to you, with respect, through the chair, is that you consider a defined time line and a phased introduction. It would be easiest for you, obviously, to introduce it to those schemes that have the lowest numbers, in my view.
So this amendment to item 1 is to specifically remind us of our own language in this matter, to keep the government honest—and we will continue to do so, because you have accepted the policy. You have accepted the policy. So what we are on about is its implementation and when it should occur. May I make it clear and put it on the record: I certainly see no mala fides on the part of the Minister for Finance and Administration; I accept his bona fides in this matter. But this is a government matter, it is a cabinet matter, and it is about time it was resolved. It is about time that due consideration was given to public policy that discriminates against a very substantial portion of our society, and it is about time that this genuine issue was resolved.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2006-09-14,"—Thanks, Senator Murray. Can I just make a couple of comments. I understand the historical perspective that Senator Murray has, and that his remarks apply more broadly than just to those in same-sex relationships. Interdependency covers a much broader range of relationships than just same-sex relationships. So I think his comments, which focused very closely on that particular sphere, perhaps need to be clarified. In fact, the government are not looking just at those in same-sex relationships; we are also looking at those in interdependency relationships—which, as I said, is a much broader issue.
I turn to Senator Murray’s comments in relation to the perspective of the minister and, of course, the government, and the information he has put into the Hansard that the government does remain committed to examining options to extend interdependency to members of Australian government schemes. The government has examined some options to further that process but, unfortunately, those options have not proved feasible. Senator Murray has already read into the Hansard an answer he received at estimates hearings which included a range of considerations that the government has been looking at in making that decision. Because the options we have canvassed at this point in time have not proved feasible, we are seeking further actuarial analysis on a much broader range of options to advance the issue of interdependency. We remain committed to doing that, as I think we are all essentially agreed.
I think it is worth clarifying that it is not just about same-sex relationships but about a much broader issue. We are looking at it in that context and we remain committed to doing so, as Senator Murray has already stated.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION SAFETY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,18,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2006-09-14,"—On behalf of the Labor Party, I indicate that it is our intention to support this amendment proposed by Senator Murray on behalf of the Australian Democrats. We believe this is an important issue that does need to be addressed somehow, and we congratulate Senator Murray on his persistence in raising this matter time and time again, trying to get the very complex issue of interdependency dealt with in a reasonable manner.
We heard in Senator Murray’s contribution to the debate that he is proposing a very reasonable timetable to be introduced as part of his proposal. We believe this is a bit like the elephant in the room which is not being discussed. We actually need to get on with it and find some way of resolving this issue.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION SAFETY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,18,1

27FA Procedures for merit selection of appointments
As the chamber is aware, well over 30 of these amendments have been moved over the last six or seven years and the message is the same every time: the government has to get with the program—as our friend Senator Vanstone likes to say—‘Get with the program, lads and ladies,’ because this issue of selecting people on merit is one being taken up all over the world in advanced democracies and our own democracy does not have a sufficiently robust system for the merit selection of appointments. In fact, recently there was another academic paper on the very issue. I forget the name of the person who wrote it but it was circulated, I think, in the democrat audit. That is not the Democrat party; that is the democrat audit section of the Australian National University—for those who are interested in these accountability matters.
I am not going to motivate this at length; the chamber has heard my arguments before. The government do not believe in appointments on merit. They believe in appointments of mates. Now and again, of course, the mates do have merit. They do not accept the argument that their processes need to be improved, so we will lose the vote and we will add one more to the list of the number of times they have opposed appointments on merit.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION SAFETY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,18,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2006-09-14,"—I rise to indicate that Labor will be supporting this amendment. As Senator Murray has said, this is an argument that we continue to have. It is a bit like the other elephant—bite by bite and bit by bit. Across the world the consideration of good governance includes the issue of merit selection of appointments for the kinds of positions that are incorporated in this amendment. That point was made most recently, and the concern about the lack of robustness in our processes was raised by Professor Meredith Edwards of the National Institute for Governance. Labor certainly believes that this is an important principle. We should have selection on merit. As Senator Murray said, we know this will not be agreed to by the government because they continue to appoint their mates.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION SAFETY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,18,1
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2006-09-14,"—Obviously the government does not agree with the final comment made by Senator Stephens. The government’s arguments in relation to this matter are probably as well known as Senator Murray’s arguments. If we are to continue to talk about eating elephants, I hope there are a few people who are relatively hungry, because it is going to be a big job. The government’s views on this issue are very well known. The government does have in place arrangements that require a licence under the Prudential Regulation Authority and trustees have to meet a fit and proper operating standard as determined under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. That standard is designed to ensure that the interests of superannuation scheme members are managed and overseen competently by honest and trustworthy individuals. So the government believes that it does have in place proper arrangements to deal with board selection appointments. Rather than prolonging the debate, I will just say that, as Senator Murray has indicated, his views are well known and I think the government’s are as well. We oppose the amendment.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2006-09-14,"—I rise to speak to the Labor amendment to the Health Insurance Amendment (Medical Specialists) Bill 2005. The Labor amendment provides an opportunity to reflect on how well Australia’s system of medical specialist accreditation ensures that Australian citizens have access to quality medical treatment and care. The fact that 90 per cent of the costs of medical services in Australia are funded from the public purse means that the senior levels of the medical profession have a collective responsibility to the Australian public with regard to the quality of medical care in this country. Australia’s system of postgraduate medical specialist training and accreditation has for decades been heralded by the medical profession as being highly successful and amongst the best in the world. It has been the repeated stance of many senior members of the medical profession that the current system of medical specialist training and accreditation should be touched only very lightly by the hand of government. Sadly, it seems to be the view of some members of the medical profession that it is the job of government merely to provide the money and to cop the blame for their mistakes.
In 1995 the Quality in Australian Health Care Study established that adverse medical events were involved in 16.6 per cent of hospital admissions at a cost to the nation of around $1 billion annually. The initial response to this study by many members of the medical profession was lukewarm at best, particularly as the findings of the study went to the very foundations of Australia’s medical specialist training and accreditation system. Since the publishing of the Quality in Australian Health Care Study report there has been the Campbelltown and Camden hospitals inquiry, the Canberra Hospital inquiry, the King Edward Memorial Hospital inquiry and the Bundaberg Hospital inquiry. All these inquiries have been initiated by governments in response to the public’s justified concern about the gross failures in the medical care provided by doctors to hospital patients.
Has anything really changed in recent times? No, not if you believe a recent Victorian university study into the rate of adverse medical events in Victorian public hospitals. That study, which looked at patient admissions to Victorian public hospitals in 2003-04, found that almost seven per cent of admissions to hospital had at least—I repeat: at least—one adverse medical event. In other words, one in 14 people who are admitted to a Victorian public hospital are injured by their medical treatment and care. The Victorian study estimated that the annual cost of adverse medical events in Victorian public hospitals was in the vicinity of $500 million. If we extrapolate this figure to Australia as a whole, the total cost to the Australian public hospital system of adverse medical events is now in the order of $2 billion annually. Where there are breakdowns in the standards of medical practice in this country, medical specialists as a group cannot avoid bearing a significant part of the blame for these breakdowns.
Over the past 10 years the Australian public has seen and experienced enough to be deeply sceptical about the degree to which some sections of the medical profession have an uncompromising commitment to high medical standards and patient safety. There are now volumes of documented evidence that medical error is far from rare. On any reasonable measure medical errors are commonplace. Because these are so commonplace, they appear to be regarded by many in the medical profession as a fact of life. This may explain the clamour of outrage we hear from the medical profession when there is any concerted effort towards greater individual accountability in respect of adverse medical events and of individual medical practitioner competency to perform particular procedures. Sadly, it seems that it is much easier to blame processes and administrative procedures than it is for the profession to audit the ongoing performance and competency of individual doctors. There appears to be a deeply rooted culture of denial that pervades some elements of the medical profession when it comes to accepting blame for medical error.
Representatives of the medical profession have often responded to independent inquiries that seek to get to the truth about medical practitioner error or negligence with fierce resistance. It appears that each time an inquiry finds evidence of a serious breakdown in medical standards, the public is told by representatives of the medical profession that the problems have long since been remedied and the inquiry is only documenting ancient history. However, year by year, new breakdowns in the quality and safety of Australia’s medical services continue to find their way to the surface.
In recent years we have seen the heroic actions of whistleblowers who have taken the lid off major incidences of gross medical incompetence and negligence that have led to major harm to patients and, unfortunately in some incidences, to the deaths of patients. Writing about a number of recent inquiries into breakdowns in hospital medical practice standards in the July 2004 edition of the Medical Journal of Australia, Thomas Faunce and Stephen Bolsin noted:
... none of the substantiated problems had been uncovered or previously resolved by extensive accreditation or national safety and quality processes; in each instance, the problems were exacerbated by a poor institutional culture of self regulation, error reporting and investigation.
They went on to comment that:
... even after substantiation of their allegations, the whistle blowers, who included staff specialists, administrators and nurses received little respect and support from their institutions and professions.
The head of the special commission of inquiry into the Campbelltown and Camden hospitals inquiry also wrote:
This inquiry to date discredits the notion that individual accountability through professional disciplining is inconsistent with the systemic improvement of clinical care and institutional administration.
It is instructive that these inquiries were not demanded by the medical profession; they were demanded by the public. Almost invariably, they were resisted by senior elements of the medical profession.
This was demonstrated in Western Australia when the state government initiated an inquiry into clinical standards and procedures at the King Edward Memorial Hospital. The King Edward Memorial Hospital inquiry found that clinical errors were very common amongst very high-risk obstetric cases. One or more clinical errors occurred in 47 per cent of cases at the hospital. More than half these errors were regarded as serious. Let us be totally clear about this: this situation occurred under the supervision of, ostensibly, Western Australia’s most skilled obstetricians.
Since that inquiry, enormous efforts have had to be made to lift the overall standard of the hospital’s clinical services to a level that can be claimed to emulate best tertiary hospital practice. The response of the medical profession to the formation of the inquiry was regrettable. Before and throughout the inquiry the medical profession, through its peak body, the AMA, did everything it could to denigrate its findings in advance of publication. The Western Australian branch of the AMA was particularly vocal on the matter. It denounced the inquiry as a farce. It is hard to believe, but on 5 October 2005 the AMA put out a press release with the title ‘King Edward inquiry a farce’ in which it complained that the inquiry was a ‘costly, time consuming and stressful episode’. The then state president of the WA branch of the AMA had this to say about the King Edward Memorial Hospital inquiry:
... adverse cases should have been sent to the WA Medical Board rather than wasting taxpayers’ money in this way.
And again, the AMA state president claimed the King Edward Memorial Hospital inquiry findings should be made:
... to a university anthropology unit because they would be outdated and totally irrelevant.
Despite the views expressed by the president of AMA WA, the King Edward Memorial Hospital inquiry report has since become a landmark document and has been used as a template for change and improvement in the quality of hospital medical practice elsewhere.
In November 2005, the Western Australian government released a report titled WA sentinel event report October 2003—June 2005. For the benefit of senators who do not know what a sentinel event is, it is a term similar in its clarity of meaning to the phrase ‘collateral damage’. The term ‘sentinel event’ covers a range of tragedies, including occurrences when a medical procedure is performed on either the wrong patient or the wrong body part, procedures where instruments are left inside patients, requiring further surgery, or medication errors resulting in patient death.
According to the report, in Western Australian hospitals in the 2004-05 financial year, there were 10 procedures performed on either the wrong patient or the wrong body part, six occurrences of instruments left inside patients that required further surgery to retrieve them and, unfortunately, two deaths from medication errors. These events were tragedies for the patients, their families and the medical staff involved.
I searched the AMA WA’s website for any comment on the sentinel event report, but I found nothing. The AMA WA put out seven media releases in November 2005, but not one of them mentioned the sentinel events report. There was a press release welcoming the appointment of a doctor to the Medical Indemnity Policy Review Panel. Another press release warned people to be careful of snakes in the hot weather. The advice warning people about the dangers of snakebites was helpful and timely; 66 people presented to Western Australian hospitals in 2004-05 to be treated for snakebite, and any effort to reduce this number is commendable. But, during that same time, 45 sentinel events were reported to the Western Australian Chief Medical Officer.
I am disappointed that there were no suggestions forthcoming from the AMA WA to reduce the number of times doctors leave surgical instruments inside their patients. As things stand today, it remains extremely difficult to obtain an independent and authoritative picture of whether the circumstances and events that led up to the inquiries into medical care standards at Campbelltown and Camden, Canberra, King Edward Memorial and Bundaberg hospitals are unique to those hospitals or represent a much broader problem in Australia’s hospital system.
Nonetheless, these inquiries have shown that the current system of specialist medical training, supervision and accreditation is, unfortunately, far from perfect. It requires urgent attention, as does the ongoing monitoring of specialist medical practice. The most serious and troubling concern is a reluctance of medical professional bodies to embrace the concept of accountability to the Australian public at its most fundamental level.
In summing up, the medical professional bodies must be willing to exercise discipline over their members, who receive considerable monetary benefits and privileges from the community by virtue of the professional recognition bestowed on them by the individual medical colleges. The Australian people deserve nothing less.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (MEDICAL SPECIALISTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,20,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2006-09-14,"—The Health Insurance Amendment (Medical Specialists) Bill 2005 implements changes to the prerequisites for the recognition of certain medical specialists and consultant physicians. The changes will remove separate processes that these medical practitioners must undertake to access Medicare. Currently, there are three ways in which medical practitioners can apply to the HIC to provide Medicare services. These processes vary depending on the circumstances. Firstly, if a medical practitioner lives in Australia, if they are a fellow or if they have a relevant qualification from a specialist medical college they are able to seek automatic recognition. This recognition occurs after the HIC receives confirmation from the medical college that these qualifications have been satisfied. Secondly, consultant physicians and other medical practitioners who do not meet these criteria must seek recognition through the specialist recognition advisory committees. These committees exist in every state and territory and meet every two months to perform this task. They are appointed by the minister. Thirdly, all other medical practitioners not domiciled in Australia must seek recognition through a ministerial determination.
The government is of the view that these committees present an obstacle to practitioner recognition because they rely on the advice of specialist medical colleges and have the effect of delaying recognition for the purpose of Medicare because the committees only meet every two months. In their place, this recognition will come from a delegate of the minister in the Health Insurance Commission. This bill tidies up an administrative process associated with the recognition of medical practitioners for the purposes of Medicare and Labor supports this. However, the bill demonstrates that the government is happy to play around the edges of our medical workforce policy but not to look at the big picture and focus on the larger and longer term issues facing the sector.
The first of these is the shortage of GPs and specialists in rural, remote and outer metropolitan areas. Australia is facing many challenges with regard to the supply of medical practitioners. The absolute number of medical practitioners or doctors is important, but their concentration, distribution and working behaviour is becoming even more important to the way we shape our medical workforce policy. Over the 30 years to 2001, the rate of growth for medical practitioners grew faster than the population. In the 1980s and 1990s this rate of growth slowed. This was largely due to the number of medical graduate places being held stable over the 1980s and 1990s relative to previous decades. It also reflected policies aimed at streaming students into specialist places rather than into general practice.
At the end of 2002, there were nearly 22,000 primary care practitioners employed in Australia, of whom 64 per cent were males and 36 per cent were females. The majority of the group, around 87 per cent, covers vocationally registered GPs who are essentially Medicare licensed GPs. A critical aspect of the changing nature of the medical workforce is the increased number of women practising general medicine and the number of hours worked by GPs, both male and female. This has resulted in a declining contribution of males to the GP workforce and an increasing contribution of women practising general medicine, while the total number of doctors in the population is beginning to decline.
An important measure of the medical workforce is FTE, full-time equivalents. Measured in FTE, there were 101 primary care practitioners per 100,000 people in Australia, based on a 45-hour standard, which is a decrease from 108 in 1997. So we have gone from 108 to 101 in quite a short period of time. While the number of women in the primary care workforce has increased, their average number of hours worked is significantly less than the total average, while men work slightly more hours than the 45-hour standard full-time week. The policy response has to be that the overall workforce level must increase if the growing trend of women in the workforce continues. The days of the single practitioner, particularly in a country town, working from 8 am till 6 pm in a surgery from Monday to Friday, 8 am till 1 pm on Saturday and on call 24/7 are over. We welcome of course the increase in the number of women doctors. I remember that, when I first went back to Cairns in 1985, finding a woman doctor was a very hard thing to do. It is much easier now and that is terrific, but the reality is that women are more family focused than the traditional male GP in a country town and therefore they see fewer patients. As a community, we should welcome that. We should be welcoming the fact that we have a GP workforce that are increasingly focused on their quality of life. This is in no way casting any aspersions on the role of women GPs—quite the contrary, women GPs are far more welcomed—but the government has a responsibility to recognise that the contribution they make in hours of operation is less than the traditional male GP in a country town of bygone years.
Another phenomenon at the heart of the medical workforce trend is the ageing of the health workforce. About 39 per cent of people employed in health were aged 45 years or over, up from 31 per cent in 1996. The proportion of workers aged 45 and over increased faster for females than for males, which reflects the fact that our nursing workforce is rapidly ageing. Parity in access and distribution of GPs is also very important, considering that about a third of all Australians live in rural and regional areas. Generally, these Australians have higher mortality rates and higher health risk levels than their counterparts in the city, due to their greater tendency to develop chronic illness and their likelihood of working in physical employment which can be hazardous—for example, mining and forestry—and not to mention that Indigenous communities are far more concentrated in rural, regional and remote areas.
In 2002, the AMA commissioned Access Economics to investigate the extent of the shortage of GPs that we will face in the future. They found that the availability of Australian trained doctors is falling well below both the demand and the requirements of the health sector, with the shortfall being partially covered by a major increase in the recruitment of overseas trained and temporary resident doctors.
The Access Economics report found that there is a declining participation rate by GPs, that female GPs and younger GPs are only prepared to commit to a working life of well under the 50 to 60 hours per week traditionally worked by GPs, that Australian medical schools are not graduating enough doctors to fill all of the available training places and that there are not enough training places to meet demand. The availability of training places is increasingly becoming an issue, as there has been a slight increase in the number of undergraduate places in very recent years.
The Access Economics report also found that the GP workforce shortage is greatly exacerbated by the restriction on the number of training places to some 450 per year. In 2001, Access Economics estimated that the overall shortfall of GPs—both Australian trained and overseas trained doctors—was between 1,200 and 2,000 full-time equivalent GPs. The rural shortage is estimated at approximately 700 full-time equivalent GPs and the urban shortage at around 500.
As a result of the government’s negligence we have seen these trends emerging, and the government has failed to act. Unfortunately, this problem required a response many years ago, and failure to keep track of the changing nature of the medical workforce has seen policy turn to overseas trained doctors for a quick fix. Overseas trained doctors have an important role to play in our medical workforce; there is no doubt about that. However, even the AMA has acknowledged that we cannot rely on an overseas supply and that an investment in the local workforce is required to meet current and future challenges.
Why is this the case? It is the case because not only is our medical workforce ageing but the medical workforces of other countries, which are facing their own demographic challenges, are ageing as well. Surely we have a responsibility to train Australian doctors—not just for Australians but to export to those countries that require medical assistance in times of need and emergency. As a developed nation, surely we have a responsibility to be a net exporter of doctors, not an importer as we are now.
Another key issue which requires timely government attention is the regulation of specialists by the colleges, and in particular their ability to restrict the supply and distribution of specialists. In an environment where the rights of all other workers are being attacked, it strikes me that the Howard government—and in particular the health minister, previously known for his hard stance on workplace relations—sees no need to reform the way in which the colleges control the supply and distribution of specialists. While the government does all it can to stop legitimate unions from representing their members on basic issues of pay and entitlements, the colleges continue to dominate the health workforce debate.
The Productivity Commission’s current work on the medical workforce will hopefully lift the lid on longstanding regulatory and structural elements of the medical workforce. This is not just because we are facing a medical workforce shortage but because, like other sectors of the economy, we should be applying ongoing reforms to improve productivity to enhance our overall economic performance.
While demarcations which existed in traditionally union dominated sectors of the economy have been gradually reformed and modernised, unfortunately this has not happened in health. In addressing the issue of demarcation and regulation, there is little doubt, given the submissions received by the commission, that issues related to role and task substitution will be on the Productivity Commission’s agenda for comment. Given the advances made in medical technology, it would not seem surprising that other types of health workers are very capably performing tasks which were seen solely as being in the general practitioners’ ambit in the last decade.
We should be examining ways in which other highly qualified healthcare workers can remove the burden on GPs so they can focus on providing the advice patients seek. For example, in Canada the medical association has lobbied for task substitution, in the past, as a means of transferring process orientated aspects of examinations to other healthcare professionals within a group or team structure. Rather than seeking to mark a line in the sand, the Canadian Medical Association has sought to use this reform as a means of better positioning GPs to focus on the value-add aspect of the consultation. The move to employ nurses in general practice has gone some way to increasing the use of health professionals other than GPs in processes that happen in a GP’s surgery but which do not necessarily have to be undertaken by that highly trained individual, the GP.
Another area of the medical workforce in which this government has failed to show leadership is in the area of managing quality and safety—Senator Sterle spoke very strongly about this issue this morning—and, in particular, the very fragmented approach to the accreditation of medical professionals. The Productivity Commission, in its health workforce report, has highlighted this as a key area warranting further attention. As an example, it uses the accreditation of nurses and the sorts of problems which can arise as a result. Nursing registration processes vary from state to state. Some run single registers while others run multiple branch registers which register a specialisation in nursing. When moving across jurisdictions, nurses have to prove that their existing qualification is the equivalent of that in the state or territory they are moving to. This situation discourages mobility, despite the high demand for nurses across Australia. As the Productivity Commission highlights, uniform accreditation will not just address mobility issues but may also improve quality and remove problems which lead to adverse issues.
Labor will support this bill but in doing so we move the second reading amendment which has been circulated. I move the following amendment:
At the end of the motion, add:
         “but the Senate condemns the Government for:
              (a)    failing to address the medical workforce shortage affecting our rural, remote and outer metropolitan areas;
              (b)    failing to invest in the future of the medical workforce and its over reliance on importing skilled medical practitioners;
              (c)    failing to show leadership in the area of the uniform standards for medical professionals; and
              (d)    failing to address the impact that regulation of medical professionals by the colleges has on supply and distribution of specialists”.
Australia is facing a health workforce crisis, especially in regional, rural and remote Australia, in some specialties and, as I know only too well, in aged care. I urge the government to do more to curtail our reliance on overseas trained doctors. As valuable as they are, our reliance on them raises serious questions about Australia’s commitment to education and training of the medical profession.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (MEDICAL SPECIALISTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,20,1
"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2006-09-14,"—I rise today to speak on the Health Insurance Amendment (Medical Specialists) Bill 2005. This bill represents a minor procedural change to the Health Insurance Act 1973. The reason for this amendment lies in the current cumbersome and time-consuming process by which some medical practitioners are recognised as specialists or consultant physicians for the purposes of Medicare. It will streamline the procedures for the recognition of some medical specialists and consultant physicians so that their patients can access Medicare rebates at the specialist or consultant physician rates. With Australia experiencing shortages in the medical workforce, this amendment will ensure that specialists and consultant physicians can enter the workforce as quickly as possible without compromising safety and quality standards.
This legislative amendment does not bestow specialist or consultant physician status on medical practitioners. Medical practitioners are identified as specialists or consultant physicians by medical boards when they are registered and by specialist medical colleges. Currently, a medical practitioner is recognised as a specialist for Medicare purposes via one of three pathways. The first pathway is automatic recognition. Applicants can seek automatic recognition if they are living in Australia, have a fellowship with a specialist medical college and have the relevant qualifications from a specialist medical college. Recognition is then provided by the managing director of the Health Insurance Commission, following advice from a relevant specialist medical college that the criteria have been met.
The second pathway is alternative recognition. For those Australian trained medical practitioners who are unable to meet the criteria for automatic recognition an alternative pathway is available. In the alternative pathway the minister’s delegate must refer the medical practitioner to an appropriate state or territory specialist recognition advisory board. State and territory specialist boards are administered by the Health Insurance Commission and meet every two months. The Minister for Health and Ageing appoints committee members from panels of nominees put forward by the relevant professional bodies and colleges. For those medical practitioners who are seeking recognition as consultant physicians, which are a subgroup of specialists with qualifications as physicians, rehabilitation specialists and psychiatrists, this is the only pathway for recognition.
The third pathway is for non-domiciled medical practitioners. Medical practitioners not domiciled in Australia at the time of application may seek recognition through a determination of the Minister for Health and Ageing. Applications for temporary residence were previously considered by an overseas specialist advisory committee. These committees were abolished in July 2004. The government was able to do this administratively because there was no mention of the overseas specialist advisory committees in the act. The government is abolishing the specialist recognition advisory committees for much the same reason that the overseas specialist advisory committees were abolished: these committees have become redundant. Since the committees were first established, specialist medical colleges and medical registration boards have been developed and they have implemented assessment processes which are used by the specialist recognition committees in making their determinations.
That the specialist recognition committees have relied on the assessment advice of specialist medical colleges and medical registration boards in making their decisions means that the specialist recognition committees have become a redundant administrative layer in the processing of applications. This unnecessarily extends the time between the registration of specialists and when they provide services under Medicare. According to an official at the Department of Health and Ageing, the Health Insurance Commission is reporting that since the abolition of the overseas specialist advisory committees it has been processing applications within a shorter time frame than was previously the case. Applications are now usually processed within 28 days, as opposed to the previous time frame of two to three months.
It is intended that the decision-making powers of the disbanded specialist recognition advisory committees will pass to the delegate for the Minister for Health and Ageing in the Health Insurance Commission. This will streamline the application processes for special recognition by avoiding the necessity to meet cut-off dates for applications to the specialist recognition advisory committees and then wait for up to two months for the committees to meet.
The amendments proposed in the bill include the recognition of the consultant physicians domiciled in Australia in the alternative method of recognition. Because the specialist recognition advisory committees have been the only means by which medical practitioners could be recognised as consultant physicians, disbanding these committees will remove the provision for them to become recognised. To correct this, consultant physicians will be included along with specialists in the alternative method of recognition. Transitional arrangements have been provided to ensure that specialists and consultant physicians previously recognised by the specialist recognition advisory committees will continue to be recognised under Medicare. Arrangements have also been made to allow the delegate to immediately consider existing applications with the specialist recognition advisory committees at the time of abolition.
This bill involves minor changes to existing procedures. The objective of these minor changes is to reduce the complexity and time currently involved in the recognition under Medicare of medical specialists and consultant physicians seeking to enter the Australian medical workforce. According to Dr Felicity Jefferies of the Western Australian Centre for Remote and Rural Medicine, commonly known as WACRRM, anything that streamlines the process of recognition of specialists is an excellent idea. As Director of WACRRM, Dr Jefferies has an intimate understanding of the medical needs of rural Western Australians and is at present greatly concerned about the lack of general physicians practising in rural and regional Western Australia.
According to Dr Jefferies, there is currently only one general physician practising in each of the three major population centres in rural Western Australia. There is one general physician in Albany, a city that services the specialist medical needs of towns as far afield as Katanning, Narrogin and my own hometown of Kojonup. There is one general physician in Geraldton, a city that services a huge area of the northern wheat belt in Western Australia. There is one general physician in Kalgoorlie, which is one of the most remote cities in the whole of Australia. These general physicians need support and, more importantly, they need to be able to pass on their knowledge to the next generation of country medical specialists.
General physicians are an interesting class of medical practitioner. They have undergone an enormous amount of training, including some of the hardest exams faced by any medical student. They are not surgeons and they are not specialists such as the cardiothoracic or ENT specialists that we are used to finding in our capital cities; rather, they are a highly trained general medical consulting physician with a detailed understanding and knowledge of most human symptoms, complaints, ailments and diseases. They are exactly the sort of medical practitioner that country regions need, and we are running out of them very fast.
Rural and regional Australia cannot generally support highly trained and specialised surgeons, as small populations generally mean practices such as these are not profitable. However, the practice of a general physician who can advise patients on a wide variety of medical problems can be supported in regional areas. Any change in legislation, whether technical in nature or not, any removal of barriers to entry and any scheme that facilitates more doctors and general physicians moving into rural and remote Australia is a positive step.
The Rural Doctors Association of Australia, RDAA, has supported calls for better measures to encourage specialist physicians to practise in rural Australia, adding that there is a desperate need for all types of medical specialists in the bush. The Internal Medicine Society of Australia and New Zealand and the Royal Australasian College of Physicians launched a position statement in September last year which recommended that Australia’s governments implement various strategies to attract general physicians to rural and remote areas, including improved financial arrangements, better access to training and continuing professional development.
I cannot overstate just how important that is. Continuing professional development is absolutely essential for people who go to work in rural and remote areas, and they must have improved conditions of work. Dr Sue Page, President of the Rural Doctors Association of Australia, said:
Medical specialists, including general physicians, are a critical part of the multi-disciplinary rural healthcare team ... But as with the rural GP procedural workforce, many rural specialists are now nearing retirement, with few younger specialists moving to rural areas to replace them.
Coming from rural Western Australia and having been very involved with health and health service provision over a number of years, I cannot overstate how strongly people out in rural areas feel about being unable to access medical specialist services. Another thing I feel very strongly about is that, if the specialists cannot move to the rural areas, at least we should have a better system throughout Australia for the Patient Assisted Travel Scheme. Every state in Australia is having problems with this scheme. I think we have to do something about rural people being second-class citizens in not being able to access specialist medical services, and I intend to move in that direction when I can. Dr Page went on to say:
Urgent recruitment and retention strategies are required to reverse this trend, before specialists become all but extinct in the bush and rural patients are subjected to the very serious consequences of this decline. In its recent submission to the Productivity Commission’s Health Workforce Study, RDAA’s Rural Specialists Group highlighted key actions for increasing the number of specialists in rural Australia, including:
improving rosters and locum arrangements, so that rural specialists are not required to be on-call for after-hours duties more than 1 in 4 days and can take much-needed recreation or education leave. In cases where a 1 in 4 roster is impossible to achieve, doctors must be supported by triage back-up, special locum relief and additional recreation leave;
increasing the infrastructure available to support specialists in rural areas, including information and communication technology, medical infrastructure, and additional healthcare and administrative staffing support;
strengthening connections between regional specialists, metropolitan hospitals and metropolitan specialists. Rural specialists rely on these connections for clinical CPD, ready access for second opinions on clinical cases, access for the referral of patients requiring higher level services, and an avenue for locum support;
encouraging and supporting the specialist colleges to provide enhanced rural training; and
resolving rural specialist dissatisfaction with inadequate payments and unresolved financial anomalies between metropolitan and rural practice. For example, recent Medicare changes that allow obstetricians in private practice to charge a significant ‘booking-in fee’ do not benefit their rural colleagues who practise overwhelmingly in the public sector. Additionally, there is currently very poor remuneration available for rural doctors (whether GPs, GP proceduralists or specialists) who make a significant commitment to provide after-hours care in the bush, and a rural after-hours loading should be provided in this regard.
Importantly, the more complex caseload undertaken by all rural doctors—GPs, GP proceduralists and rural specialists (including non-procedural specialists)—must be recognised through higher remuneration structures such as rural complexity loadings. The increased complexity of rural patients’ healthcare needs, coupled with less access to additional medical support locally, often means longer consultations for rural doctors and hence reduced incomes compared with their metropolitan colleagues.
Our governments must work together urgently with the medical profession and its colleges to widen measures to support general physicians and other medical specialists currently working in the bush, and to entice more of these specialists to the bush, before there are no specialists left in rural Australia at all.
I would like to continue with some of the National Rural Health Alliance policy statements. For seven years, I was a member of the National Rural Health Alliance representing the Australian Healthcare Association. I have followed and worked very closely with the National Rural Health Alliance. This general statement really fits in with this bill:
The Alliance ... has a particular interest in:
the enhanced infrastructure, and broader system, for placement and postgraduate training of the extra medical and nursing students;
increased rural exposure in the training of medical specialists;
the references to special incentives for the training of dentists (the Alliance wants to see the Commonwealth involved in this as well as the States);
the promise of “better consultation” between the States and Commonwealth on health-related university places;
a single national registration scheme for health professionals …
I must say, having been involved with nursing and also at the moment working for Navy nurses on this issue, for the Defence Force this is one of the most difficult things as far as registration goes for nurses. Each state has its own registration scheme. As you can imagine, when Defence people are so mobile and shifted at short notice, this is causing huge problems for them. The statement continues:
a single national registration scheme for—
all—
health professionals and the fact that “other professional groups (including Aboriginal Health Workers) may be added over time”;
a single national accreditation scheme for health education and training;
a national process for the assessment of overseas-trained doctors …
Once again, this is very difficult with each state doing their own assessment through their medical boards. The statement continues:
the Commonwealth’s intention to provide rural medicine with formal recognition under Medicare as a generalist discipline; and, most importantly,
the initiatives relating directly to improving the health and wellbeing of Indigenous people, such as governments’ “long-term, generational commitment” to overcome Indigenous disadvantage, the commitment to closing the health, education and learning gaps between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children, and further measures to address alcohol and substance misuse, including through additional resources for treatment and rehabilitation services in regional and remote areas.
Having been involved in the petrol-sniffing inquiry with the Senate Community Affairs References Committee, I cannot stress enough just how important it is to have rehabilitation services in regional and remote areas—they are very important services. Once again, we need a very different sort of specialist to be able to handle and cope with these areas.
In conclusion, I commend this bill to the Senate. It is very important that the legislation is put into practice as soon as possible so that specialists are not waiting for two to three months before being recognised to practise. We cannot afford this time.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (MEDICAL SPECIALISTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,20,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2006-09-14,"—It is indeed a pleasure and an honour to follow a speaker like Senator Judith Adams. I am always very proud of the people in this parliament, mainly from this side, regrettably—regrettably in that there are not more—who have a real interest in and understanding of these issues. As Senator Adams indicated, she has practised as a nurse and worked in the health area in many other ways over a long period. The parliament and the people of Australia are all the better for the input that people like Senator Adams bring to debates such as this. Whenever I am uncertain about things in country areas, I refer to Senator Adams to get the real story. I have a general understanding of the situation and some of the needs which exist in country Australia, but it is always useful to refer to people, and to Senator Adams in particular, to get technical and accurate input to debates on issues.
As well as Senator Adams, on this side of the parliament we are very fortunate to have the input of Senator Eggleston, a very well-regarded medical practitioner from Port Hedland in his former days before he came to the Senate; Dr Mal Washer, a doctor from Western Australia; and Senator Patterson, who was a health professional. I have named only a few; there may well be others. It is certainly good to see parliamentarians with those sorts of skills and expertise coming into this chamber and lending the parliament and through the parliament the people of Australia their expertise on these issues.
With Australia experiencing the sorts of shortages we have in the medical workforce, it is important that the administrative processes are made more efficient and timely to ensure that appropriately qualified specialist and consultant physicians enter the workforce as quickly as possible. The purpose of the Health Insurance Amendment (Medical Specialists) Bill 2005 is to reduce unnecessary red tape for medical practitioners seeking to provide those specialist and consultant physician services under Medicare. It is proposed to do this by disbanding the state or territory specialist recognition advisory committees and allowing medical practitioners to make direct application to the minister or his delegate for approval for Medicare purposes. Under the new processes, registered medical practitioners will apply in writing directly to the minister through his delegate in the Health Insurance Commission for recognition as specialists or consultant physicians for the purposes of the act.
I recently attended an AMA gathering in Parliament House, and I was told that the specialist colleges had increased by 40.6 per cent training places in the colleges. But, whilst the training colleges for specialists are increasing their activities, all of the states are, regrettably, cutting training positions. There is no point in the colleges training specialists if the specialist positions in the hospitals are no longer there. It is with great sadness that I report that in my own state this situation is enormously difficult and underresourced by the state government.
I do not want to sound like a bad loser, but, regrettably, the people of Queensland have returned the Beattie government—a government which has done more to destroy the health system in Queensland than any in history. During the recent election campaign, I found some old posters that we were using at the election three years ago. We were able to use them again this year. The posters said: ‘Don’t reward Labor, with the mess they’ve made of the Townsville Hospital. Fix the Townsville Hospital now.’ They were posters we used three years ago. Unfortunately, the people of Queensland did not take the message then. We used them again this year and, regrettably, for any number of reasons—I guess it is because the people of Queensland did not have a great deal of confidence in the coalition leadership this time around—the administration that for eight years has just about destroyed the public health system in Queensland has been returned to government. It is particularly galling to me that Mr Beattie, in the pre-election advertising, would smile nicely at people and say: ‘Yes, it is a problem. I promise to fix it.’ The people of Queensland have been gullible in yet again falling for Mr Beattie’s promises.
—Did the voters get it wrong?
—He promised to fix the problems three years ago and nothing happened. In fact, they got worse—Senator McLucas will be well aware of that. The problems in North Queensland that she and I are intimately aware of have got worse in the three years since Mr Beattie promised he would fix them. Again this year Mr Beattie has smiled at everyone and said: ‘Yes, dear. Isn’t this a terrible problem? I will fix it.’ But what has he been doing for eight years? Accordingly, I have no confidence in the proposition that the health problems we have in Queensland will be fixed so long as Mr Beattie and his cronies are there. More bureaucrats will be put into it and more advertising will be done. Mr Beattie has been running huge full-page advertisements for the last six months. I suspect they will stop now, the election being over. These advertisements were paid for by the taxpayers. Instead of putting the money into medical services, where it should have been put, it was put into advertising. We have had all the promises. We have had the nice pictures. We have had the announcements. But mark my words: in three years time things will not have improved. You only have to talk to anyone in the health areas to know this.
I have been approached by any number of nurses who say to me: ‘Because of the Commonwealth government we have been able to get places in universities, but we cannot get training places in Queensland hospitals.’ The training places are essential for those nurses to complete their work. I have doctors coming to me who are also grateful to the federal government for providing all these additional university places for would-be medical practitioners. But, once they finish, they have nowhere to go for their training in the Queensland hospitals. The Queensland hospitals, according to the AMA, and the hospitals in all other states, are cutting those training positions. That is of great concern to me.
The federal government has, over the 10 years that it has been in power, made a significant difference to medical services in country Australia. It has done this in so many ways that time today does not permit me to go through them all. I just want to mention one aspect of where the federal government has improved considerably the prospect of better medical treatment in country areas of Australia, and that is the introduction of a medical school at James Cook University, in Townsville, the city where I have my base. The James Cook University medical school is a real success story. I certainly give credit to Professor Bob Porter AC, who was the planning dean. When he first joined JCU in 1997 he was responsible for getting Australian Medical Council accreditation for the MBBS—that is, the Bachelor of Medicine Bachelor of Surgery. He originally came from Monash University, where he was the leading light in the development of the university’s medical school. Professor Ian Wronski, who is the executive dean of the Faculty of Medicine, Health and Molecular Science at JCU, also deserves significant credit for the great successes the James Cook University medical school has achieved.
The first-year numbers this year of Commonwealth funded places at JCU’s medical school were 83, which is a creditable contribution. Last year, in December, I was privileged to attend the graduation of some 58 students from the first MBBS program at James Cook University. I am delighted to hear that 64 per cent of graduates indicated that they were going to work in rural areas of Australia. That is absolutely fantastic, and it will certainly arrest the drain over recent years resulting in a paucity of medical practitioners in country Australia and certainly in country Queensland.
Fifty-six per cent of the graduates said they would remain in North Queensland, which means they will stay in Townsville, Cairns and Mackay. Even so, it shows the wisdom of the Howard government’s approach to problems in the bush. It is a long-term solution, but the long-term solution had to be undertaken. The thought was—and it is justified by the statistics—that there is a greater likelihood of country young people who enter medical schools in a non-capital-city university staying out of the capital cities. In the past, too many country kids would go to a capital city university to do their medical course and would get involved with a partner from that area, resulting in their staying in the capital cities. Very few of them went back out to the country.
This initiative of getting medical schools into regional areas—Townsville is just one of them but it is the one I am most familiar with—is already paying dividends. It means that the citizens of country Australia—which is where I live, in a country town in North Queensland—will have better prospects of getting a doctor in the years ahead. So congratulations to James Cook University medical school and all credit to Dr Wooldridge, who initiated this program, and the health ministers of the coalition government over the last 10 years.
This program has been very significant in getting a better deal for country people but, whilst the Commonwealth government continues to look after country people and to help the medical profession, regrettably all of the state governments—and my state of Queensland in particular—seem to be working against country people. I again mention the cut in the training positions. I urge the Queensland government to do something about that. There have been comments about the Commonwealth taking over the hospital and health systems in the state. It is an appealing thought, because the states have made such a botch of health, but the set-up—the infrastructure and the way it works—makes it impossible for the Commonwealth to take that over in the foreseeable future. One would hope that the states would learn from the disasters that have occurred.
I do feel sorry for those Queenslanders who, over many years, have approached me and my colleagues in tears about their health problems, which in many cases have been terminal and could not be treated because they could not get into the state hospital system. Whilst the leadership of the coalition might not have been what Queenslanders wanted, certainly the state coalition has an excellent policy that, if you cannot get into a public hospital and you have a life-threatening disease, the government will pay for you to go to a private hospital. I would hope that the new Queensland government will take that up. I think that is a vain hope, because the Queensland government has shown no interest over the last eight years in addressing the disaster that has overtaken public health in Queensland.
I will very briefly mention the need for increased technology in the provision of medical services. I was at Palm Island recently, and a new system was demonstrated to me. It could be technically explained, but I will not even attempt to do that. I will explain it in the way it appeared to me. Palm Island is a remote place. It is not all that far from Townsville but it is across the sea and it is difficult to get to. The medical people there do a fabulous job in difficult circumstances. They are working on a system whereby the local practitioner can, by means of television and telecasting, get the advice of specialists in Townsville to deal with problems that arise unexpectedly.
There has been something like this in place for some time in western Queensland, but I am told that this is a more interactive approach. A GP in a remote area who is faced with a life-threatening situation can look at the television screen and get advice from a specialist and even some help from the specialist to show how it is done. I know the Commonwealth government has been very much involved in the provision of these improved technological aids to allow the expansion of good medical treatment right throughout Australia.
I conclude my remarks by commending this bill to the parliament. The bill represents a minor procedural change, but the objective of the change is to reduce the current complexity in recognising medical specialists and consultant physicians under the Medicare system. It is anticipated that this amendment will significantly reduce the time taken between receipt of an application from a medical practitioner and the recognition. That will help the health system improve. It is an initiative which deserves commendation, and I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (MEDICAL SPECIALISTS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,20,1
"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2006-09-14,"—I thank all contributors to this debate: Senators McLucas, Sterle, Ian Macdonald and Adams. I express appreciation for the constructive and cordial way in which this debate has taken place. I could be tempted to follow on from the contribution by Senator Ian Macdonald in relation to Queensland matters with great ease, but I suspect that I would be taking a point of order on relevance from Senator McLucas and perhaps you, Madam Acting Deputy President Troeth—maybe question time would be a more appropriate time—so I shall sum up. I will make some general statements in relation to the Health Insurance Amendment (Medical Specialists) Bill 2005 and then address some of the specific contributions made by senators opposite, particularly those by Senator McLucas, who is representing the shadow minister in this place.
The proposed amendment will reduce unnecessary red tape for medical practitioners seeking recognition as specialists and consultant physicians under the act in order to provide services which attract Medicare benefits at the appropriate rate to their patients. Currently, the administrative process for recognising medical practitioners can involve unnecessary duplication and lengthy periods. This has been the source of regular complaints from medical practitioners, specialists, medical colleges, employers and recruitment agencies. Applications for specialty recognition by certain medical practitioners must be referred to state or territory specialist recognition advisory committees, known as SRACs. All applications seeking recognition as consultant physicians must also be referred to an SRAC.
Referrals to SRACs may have been effective in the past by providing a structure for the assessment of specialists who are not eligible for automatic recognition. However, since these committees were established, specialist medical colleges and medical registration boards have developed and implemented assessment processes which are now used by the SRACs in making their determinations. Because SRACs rely on the assessment advice of specialist medical colleges and medical registration boards in making their decisions, the committees now add a redundant administrative layer for processing applications. This unnecessarily extends the period of time between the registration of specialists and when they can provide services which attract Medicare rebates.
The amendment will disband the SRACs in order to streamline the recognition process. Applicants will apply to the Minister for Health and Ageing’s delegate in Medicare Australia for recognition as a specialist or consultant physician. Transitional arrangements have been provided to ensure the continued recognition of specialists and consultant physicians previously recognised by SRACs. Provision has also been made for the delegate to immediately consider applications that are with SRACs at the time they are disbanded.
This bill represents a minor procedural change. The objective of the change is to reduce the complexity currently involved in the recognition of medical specialists and consultant physicians under the Medicare system. It is anticipated that the amendment will significantly reduce the time between the receipt of an application from a medical practitioner and the granting of recognition for the purpose of Medicare. The legislative amendment does not bestow specialist or consultant physician status on medical practitioners. Medical practitioners are identified as specialists or consultant physicians by medical boards when they are registered on the advice of specialist medical colleges.
With Australia experiencing shortages in the medical workforce, the streamlined administrative process will mean that the specialists and consultant physicians enter the workforce as quickly as possible. I note that all of the speakers generally expressed support for the legislative amendments that we are making, and I thank them for that indication of support.
Senator McLucas in her substantial contribution made mention of several aspects of the medical system, including her contention that there is a lack of formal planning by the Australian government. She made comments in relation to her belief that the government fails to show leadership on quality and safety, especially with regard to the accreditation of GPs. She also made some comments in relation to overreliance on overseas trained doctors. I will briefly make some comments about those three contributions.
In response to Senator McLucas’s suggestion that there is a lack of formal planning by the Australian government: she would obviously be aware that, since 2000, there has been an increase in the number of medical schools. In fact, we now have 15 medical schools. The number of medical graduates will increase from 1,500 in 2003 to approximately 3,400 in 2015. As part of the 2006-07 budget, 400 medical school places were announced and, following the COAG meeting, another 205 places were announced. I will come back to that and outline in a little bit more detail the increase in the number of medical school places.
Senator McLucas also suggested that the government failed to show leadership on quality and safety, especially with regard to the accreditation of GPs. The recent COAG announcement included new processes for the accreditation and registration of medical professionals, and my advice is that those announcements were very well supported by all governments, including state governments, represented at the COAG meeting. That is something that can be recognised in this place as a step forward.
I am sure that Senator McLucas would acknowledge that the government takes its quality and compliance responsibilities for aged care very seriously, as demonstrated by measures that I have previously announced for which we are currently drafting legislation and which we have funded to the extent of approximately $110 million. We take our responsibilities seriously. I always say that there is always more that one could do, but that statement is made within the context of the very heavy competition for government funds.
In relation to a point that I think was made by Senator Sterle on the reliance on overseas trained doctors, honourable senators would appreciate that it can take up to 11 years before a student can become fully qualified to practise. Given that that is the case, we also need measures to boost doctor numbers in the short term. I am sure that all senators would welcome the range of measures which the Howard government has put in place in order to address the short-term situation.
The government has started addressing that short-term situation by increasing the number of appropriately qualified overseas trained doctors practising in Australia, through international recruitment strategies. It has reduced red tape in the approval processes and also changed some of the immigration arrangements. I think all senators would welcome into the medical system in our country the arrival of overseas trained doctors who are able to assist in taking care of the health of Australians.
We have had unfortunate cases, such as that of Dr Patel, but we will not dwell on that situation at this point in time. I, like Senator Ian Macdonald, have been visited by a number of overseas trained doctors since the Dr Patel situation came into public focus, stressing that they regard it as an honour and a privilege to be in Australia and to work with their Australian colleagues. They believe, I believe and the government believes that they make a very valuable contribution to the health and welfare of Australians.
In addition to that, the government is supporting more than 1,600 general practices to employ practice nurses and is allowing all GPs to claim Medicare items for certain services undertaken by practice nurses. Again, feedback I have received, particularly in my local area of North Brisbane—I live in the North Brisbane area and have come into contact with GPs, including with my own GP—is that this is a very welcome move. I think that can be put on the record with some justification and pride.
The government is also assisting by making funding available for 280 short-term placements each year for junior doctors to work under supervision in general practices in outer metropolitan and rural and regional areas. When the government made the decision, it again demonstrated its commitment to Australians who live outside the major cities, including and in particular the major capital cities. I am a proud member of a government that does not forget that Australia does not stop at the boundaries of our major cities, including our capital cities. I am sure all senators in this place believe that the food baskets and the great economic, cultural and social hinterlands that rural and regional Australia represent need and deserve attention such as that shown by the Howard government in its emphasis on improving medical services within regional and rural Australia. Increased support has also been provided for rural general practitioners who provide procedural services such as obstetrics and minor operations.
Only a few months ago I visited several centres in western Queensland, and it was very clear to me that some of the measures I have just mentioned in this summing-up speech were appreciated. They were commented upon certainly to me, and to some of my other senatorial colleagues, including Senators Ian Macdonald, Mason and Brandis, who accompanied me on that trip. The measures were appreciated, and vocally so, by many of the people we met.
I would like to conclude by again bringing to the attention of senators that, at its 14 July 2006 meeting, COAG announced its support for the key directions of the Productivity Commission report Australia’s health workforce. COAG agreed to a range of health workforce reforms to address key issues raised in the report. I will not go through all the components of that agreement, because to outline that would go beyond the scope of the bill we are considering here today. But I think it is important to again acknowledge in this place that the Australian government’s contribution to the package of reforms is $300 million, and it includes funding for 605 new medical places, with 220 going to Victoria, 150 to Queensland, 110 to New South Wales, 60 each to Western Australia and South Australia, and five to Tasmania. As an aside, a commitment was also made at that COAG meeting for 1,000 new nursing places.
I listened very carefully to the contributions to the debate, particularly those of opposition senators. I think it is fair that they do raise issues of concern to them in terms of what they perceive to be deficiencies within Australia’s medical system. But I also think it is important to acknowledge that the Howard government does provide as much as it can to the improvement of health services right across Australia and, through this bill, is eliminating what is now considered to be unnecessary red tape which has hitherto hindered the efficient processing of matters related to the registration of doctors. I commend this amendment bill to the Senate.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2006-09-14,"—I wish to indicate that the Labor Party will support the passage of the National Health Amendment (Immunisation) Bill 2006. The reason we are dealing with this matter is that there was an error in the drafting of the National Health Amendment (Immunisation Program) Act 2005 which particularly affected the operation and delivery of a number of vaccines. It was particularly concerning to me in North Queensland and for people associated with the cattle industry and the delivery of the Q-Vax, so we are pleased to support it.

In summary, this amendment will ensure that such goods and services can continue to be funded by the Australian government under the act. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2006-09-14,"—The Social Security and Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2006 is a minor housekeeping bill that will make various technical and similar amendments to social security, family assistance and related legislation. These amendments are to improve the operational effectiveness of that legislation. The amendments will remove anomalies, clarify the legislation in line with established policy and make technical corrections and refinements. Notably, the bill introduces no significant new policy and has no or negligible financial impact.
The bill includes several measures to do with childcare benefit. One of these makes sure that childcare benefit customers who use registered care for their children cannot be paid childcare benefit that exceeds the actual fee that they have paid for that care. This common-sense rule mirrors the current limit on childcare benefit for care provided by an approved childcare service. Similarly, a new rule for care provided by approved childcare services replicates the existing rule for registered carers. This measure will clarify that neither registered care nor approved childcare service care will attract childcare benefit if the care is provided as part of a compulsory education program. Clearly, childcare benefit should not be payable while children are in the care of their teachers as part of their normal schooling.
The bill makes numerous refining amendments to social security legislation, including a measure to confirm that two members of a couple who are living apart on a temporary basis may generally be regarded as a temporarily separated couple whether they are legally married or a de facto couple. The temporarily separated classification gives couples access to a higher rate of certain payments such as rent assistance and remote area allowance. At present only legally married couples fall within the definition and it is anomalous that de facto couples are not treated in the same beneficial way.
The income test for the low-income healthcare card has also been refined by this bill. A rule inadvertently repealed from the legislation in 2001 is being reinstated so that a social security pension or benefit is clearly income under the low-income healthcare card income test as intended. It is also made clear that two veterans’ entitlement payments, the Defence Force income support allowance and the income support supplement, which are of a similar nature to the current components of income, are income for the purposes of the card.
A further measure aligns the definition of homelessness that currently applies for special benefit with the similar definition that applies for the larger customer groups of Youth Allowance and young disability support pension recipients. This corrects an inequity between the two groups of customers. To tidy up the statute books, seven acts relating to housing that are no longer operational are being repealed by this bill. Most of the remaining measures of this bill are technical corrections and refinements, many of these consequential to the commencement of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 and reflect new concepts and arrangements established by that act. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2006-09-14,"—I wish to speak briefly on the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Bill 2006. While Labor support the bill, we feel the need to point out just how long a time it has been between the period in which the Howard government announced it was seeking to take some action in this matter and the presentation of this legislation. We say that the Howard government is characterised by its complacency and neglect when it comes to making Australia a more attractive environment for innovative companies.
Labor understands that appropriate intellectual property arrangements are critical to creating an environment which supports Australian innovation and the commercialisation of Australian ideas. These arrangements must strike the appropriate balance between protecting the rights and returns of innovators and facilitating an open and competitive market. The amendments contained in this bill will improve the intellectual property regime, enhance efficiency and maintain an appropriate balance between innovation and competitive outcomes. But they are long overdue.
The amendments made by this bill give effect to some of the outstanding recommendations of the Intellectual Property and Competition Review Committee, which produced its final report in September 2000. It took six years to get to this point. I cannot for the life of me understand why it took so long. I have had a keen interest in this matter for some time. When I had responsibility for these issues as shadow minister these were questions which were at the forefront of the manufacturing industry in this country. There were demands being made right across the country for action to be taken with regard to these questions, yet this government failed to respond to a report of this importance for some six years. The bill gives effect to some outstanding aspects of the March 1999 report of the Advisory Council on Intellectual Property on its review of the enforcement of industrial property rights. So it has taken 7½ years for the government to act on that particular report.
The bill proposes to: broaden the springboarding regime for pharmaceutical patents; clarify the rights of a prior user in the granting of patents; add a competition test to the compulsory licensing of patents; allow for exemplary—in fact, punitive—damages to be awarded in patent infringement actions; amend provisions relating to the revocation of trademarks and public access to trademark files; and make minor and technical amendments to the Patents Act 1990, Trade Marks Act 1995, Designs Act 2003 and Plant Breeder’s Rights Act 1994.
Intellectual property rights and arrangements are an important issue as, for many Australian companies, IP is not just their only asset but their only product. As a nation, we have significant weaknesses in the commercialisation of Australian ideas and innovation, and the intellectual property regime in this country ought to have been strengthened some time ago. The reality is that the Howard government is anti research and anti innovation. The latest OECD figures make the point, with regard to research and development, that in 2003 Australia ranked 18th of all OECD countries in terms of investment in research and development as a percentage of GDP.
Where Australia spends 1.65 per cent of its GDP on research and development, other OECD countries are up around three per cent. Our major industrial competitors in the north of Asia and the north of Europe leave us for dead on these issues. In today’s Age there is a report on page 8 quoting Monash University Vice-Chancellor, Professor Richard Larkins, as saying:
Everything that is happening is pointing to Australia being more and more of a research and development and high tech backwater.
According to the Age, government figures responded to this criticism by arguing that the strong local economy meant it was not as important to keep up with international research standards. I find it an extraordinary proposition that the spin doctors in the government would say that this is not important. It is an amazing proposition. The same article says:
Eminent medical biologist and former Australian of the Year Gustav Nossal said that industry investment was well behind overseas levels.
The article went on:
But Sir Gustav said the Government also needed to increase its funding and continue to encourage business investment through tax incentive, start-up grants or “plain old jawboning”—talking up the importance of science.
So, at every level, criticism is coming forward of the government’s appalling performance on these issues. In fact, I would argue that there is no better evidence of the Howard government’s failure to secure Australia’s economic future than its failure to invest in research and innovation, which drives productivity.
Intellectual property rights and arrangements, both legal and financial, are a key lever in the pursuit of better commercialisation outcomes and thus, by extension, are an integral feature of the broader innovation debate. They are critical to high-skilled, high-wage jobs in manufacturing in this country. This bill does make the situation a little better but it fails to deal with the fundamental problem—that it has taken the government the better part of seven years just to get this far. Such a lag in the implementation of important legislation is simply unacceptable and it is symbolic of this government’s complacency and neglect.",SENATE,<title>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,28,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-09-14,"—The Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Bill 2006 is largely a consequence of the review of intellectual property legislation under the Competition Principles Agreement, which resulted in a report produced by the Intellectual Property and Competition Review Committee chaired by Henry Ergas, which led to the establishment of an interdepartmental committee by the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources.
Perhaps it is a mark of the complexity and the extent of the commercial interest involved in this field that it has taken so long for this to reach Senate approval. It is a pity it has taken so long because the matter needs to be addressed. We have to be careful of believing that just because this is in a non-controversial section of the Senate agenda—which means that all parties support it—we can take the view that this is a relatively minor or insignificant bill. It is not. This is quite a substantive bill. It has 16 schedules and it has 41 pages but, unusually, the explanatory memorandum is longer, at 54 pages, indicating that this is a field which requires careful explanation.
Those of us who are familiar with the ways in which laws are developed know that an explanatory memorandum is relied on as part of the view a court should take with respect to particular issues. Perhaps that is one of the reasons that the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee has started, in recent years, to pay such attention to the quality of explanatory memorandums and to encourage the government to lift their game in that respect.
Schedules 5 to 10 of the bill amend the Patents Act 1990 to broaden the springboarding regime for pharmaceutical patents, allow for awards for exemplary damages in patent infringement actions and clarify prior users’ rights in the granting of patents. Schedules 1 to 4 amend provisions of the Trade Marks Act 1995 relating to revocation of trade marks and public access to trade mark files. Schedules 11 to 16 make minor technical amendments to the Patents Act 1990, Trade Marks Act 1995, Designs Act 2003 and Plant Breeder’s Rights Act 1994.
Schedule 1 revokes the registration of trademarks. Schedule 2 relates to the nonpayment of fees relating to trademarks. Schedule 3 concerns the registration process for the certification of trademarks. Schedule 4 relates to the availability of documents about trademarks. Schedule 5 covers exemplary damages. Schedule 6 concerns the prior use defence. Schedule 7 covers springboarding and patents. Schedule 8 concerns the compulsory licensing of patents. Schedule 9 and 10 have the minor technical amendments on innovation patents. So it is a comprehensive bill. It is very apparent to me that for those involved it is an area which, because it impacts on their businesses in an integral way, is in fact quite controversial. This field is of massive commercial significance.
Those people who took the time to write submissions and appear before the Senate Economics Legislation Committee had a keen interest in the outcome and there were a number of well-argued views presented to the committee. I think it is unfortunate the committee inquiry was a short one. I think it is unfortunate the committee was only tasked with examining a couple of schedules, because this is the sort of field where you have to be on your toes on a more holistic basis.
I was pleased to receive a fax from the Hon. Bob Baldwin on 12 September to advise me that the government was, to an extent at least, taking up the recommendations of the Senate economics committee, in particular in relation to schedules 7 and 8, which cover the springboarding and patents area and the compulsory licensing of patents. It was heartening to see that the government agency, IP Australia, has initiated a consultation paper to gather a wider range of views concerning the issue of springboarding so that it can have input from a diverse range of industries. This is a rapid response, largely to the submission by Nufarm to the Senate economics committee.
As I said, amendments in schedule 7 initiated a range of responses. Medicines Australia submitted to the committee that the proposals in the bill were likely to undermine Australia’s reputation for encouraging, supporting and rewarding innovation and had the potential to further weaken Australia’s intellectual property framework relative to its competitors. It is important to note, because of that remark, that there are sectors of business and industry that do not view this bill in a wholeheartedly supportive manner. However, the Generic Medicines Industry Association supported the amendments and argued that the proposed section 119A should apply retrospectively and were supported by Nufarm.
These are obviously matters which are hotly contested by different groups in Australia with different financial and commercial interests in the application of intellectual property law. It should be increasingly clear to everyone why one of the most hotly contested and integral parts of the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement and the subsequent debate in this place was the protection of American versus Australian intellectual property rights internationally. They recognise it as the way of the future. It is time that Australia caught up in this field. It is no longer where something is manufactured or what the physical product is which generates a high level of income; it is where the ideas come from and how well they are protected in domestic and international law which is of growing importance in many fields, including that of genetic and DNA research.
With respect to schedule 8, I was also heartened to hear from the Hon. Bob Baldwin in response to the recommendations of the Senate economics committee that IP Australia had had discussions with Professor Corones from the University of Queensland. The professor had made some erudite and effective points about the interaction between the proposed amendments to the Trade Practices Act and the proposed amendments to the Patents Act.
The outcome of those discussions are that IP Australia has prepared—and it has been tabled—an amended or supplementary explanatory memorandum and has more clearly set out the relationships between the provisions of the Trade Practices Act and the Patents Act to assist in any dispute about their interaction. I would make the point, however, that if there is ambiguity you are far better off clarifying it in the statute than in a supplementary explanatory memorandum. I do hope you have not taken the easy way out and that this one is not going to come back and bite us on the posterior.
This process is a reminder that the parliamentary scrutiny system and the interaction with the bureaucracy can work at a very effective level. The Senate economics committee made recommendations, they were promptly acted upon by the responsible parliamentary secretary and his department and an outcome has been achieved, prior to the Senate voting on this bill today. If only this could happen in relation to the Trade Practices Act and the recommendations of the Senate Economics Reference Committee report of March 2004, The effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act 1974 in protecting small business—but of course that concerns another minister, not this one.
Although the committee did not make any recommendations in relation to schedule 4, I will make some brief comments on this. As many senators are aware, I am an advocate for a stronger Freedom of Information Act and I have a private senator’s bill on the Notice Paper to strengthen that act. I mention this because schedule 4 of this bill amends the Trade Marks Act to make documents relating to trademark applications publicly available. Currently, people have to make applications under the Freedom of Information Act to achieve this.
However, the way in which the amendment is structured has meant that IPTA, the advocacy group in this area, have argued that it is unclear what standard the registrar will be using to determine whether a document should be held confidentially. They point out that, if the applicable standard is unknown or below the standard that is currently applied under the Freedom of Information Act, applicants could be reluctant to lodge commercially sensitive material with IP Australia, and this in turn would make registration difficult. Further, the IPTA argue that, if a trademark applicant claims confidentiality for certain documents and the registrar does not agree that they should be held confidentially, it is unclear from the amendments to the legislation what recourse the applicant has against such a decision. IP Australia has acknowledged that it will be consulting further on this matter, which is prudent and advisable, but it is concerning that legislation is passing prior to the finalisation of the consultation process and without resolving this concern.
Intellectual property is often the lifeblood of corporations, and in this information age it is something which business must be willing to fight to preserve even more than before. Unfortunately that leads to a ‘deep pockets’ mentality. It is a substantial limitation to the effectiveness of the provision I have just outlined that there is a lack of clarity about what is confidential material, and those without deep pockets may be unable to pursue the matter effectively. A lack of clarity about the recourse a company may have if they disagree with the registrar’s decision may result in effective denial of justice. IP Australia have informed the committee that they are in the process of undertaking further consultation on how this will operate, and I assume that IP Australia will then report back to the Senate economics committee on this matter. I am quite sure from my knowledge of the chair and my understanding of the members of the committee that the committee will remain interested in this matter and will be pleased to hear the advice once it is available.",SENATE,<title>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,28,1
"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2006-09-14,"—The Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Bill 2006 implements a suite of amendments to Australia’s intellectual property system as recommended by two independent reports—one from the Intellectual Property and Competition Review Committee, known simply as the Ergas report, and the other from the Advisory Council on Intellectual Property. In addition, a set of amendments to the Patents Act 1990, the Trade Marks Act 1995, the Plant Breeder’s Rights Act 1994 and the Olympic Insignia Protection Act 1987 will further fulfil the expectation of the two reports that Australia formulate a succinct intellectual property law that is able to balance the rights of competitors with enforcing the right of innovators over their patents.
An important change will be to the Patents Act 1990. This will see a broadening of the capacity of Australian generic pharmaceutical companies to undertake more comprehensive springboarding activities. This important amendment will provide many benefits to Australia through a more internationally competitive pharmaceutical industry and an increased self-sufficiency of Australia’s medicines industry. Springboarding is a term that refers to using the subject matter of a patent to collect the data required to obtain regulatory approval of a generic version of a patented drug when the patent is still in force. Since the introduction of the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Act in 1988, in Australia springboarding has only been permissible once a patent has had its term expended.
Only once a patent reaches this stage can pharmaceutical companies begin research and preparation to undertake the production of generic medicines and substitutes. This has held back the potential of our businesses to compete in the international market with overseas competitors who are allowed to undertake springboarding from the commencement of the patent provided that it is for research purposes only and in accordance with World Trade Organisation regulations. This bill addresses the current Australian competitive disadvantage by providing our generic pharmaceutical companies with the capacity to undertake springboarding from the time a patent is initially introduced. This amendment will bring Australian legislation into line with that of America and the European Union on springboarding thereby providing a more competitive and sustainable Australian generic pharmaceuticals industry. Clearly the introduction of this piece of legislation will bring a range of benefits to the Australian economy by providing more incentive for generic pharmaceutical companies to remain in Australia.
The importance of Australia’s pharmaceutical industry cannot be underestimated. Its economic role and the role it plays in national security are both essential. The generic companies make up a third of the pharmaceutical industry export trade and contribute to our economy through strong investment and providing highly skilled employment. This legislation is necessary to ensure these companies do not withdraw their operations from Australia. It provides them with an equal platform to match it with their international competitors. In addition, the broadening of our springboarding laws will encourage generic pharmaceutical development in Australia. This will ensure that in times of national crisis we have an effective regime of pharmaceutical research that will be able to satisfy the needs of all Australians. This expectation that the industry remain sustainable is a responsibility outlined in the national medicines policy, which exemplifies the government stance on developing intelligent policy on patented products within the pharmaceutical industry.
The Senate economics committee—of which I am a member and to which Senator Murray referred—examined the bill and reported on 17 August. The committee recommended that the government pass the legislation but with a couple of qualifications: firstly, that the government consider initiating an interdepartmental committee to consider whether springboarding provisions should be extended to other industries, and in particular to agricultural chemicals. It is pleasing that the government has responded favourably to this recommendation. This week the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, the Hon. Bob Baldwin MP, responded that IP Australia has initiated an interdepartmental committee to formulate the government’s response to the report of the Advisory Council on Intellectual Property entitled Patents and experimental use. The issue of springboarding was raised by Nufarm Ltd in a submission to this Advisory Council on Intellectual Property inquiry, as it was in their submission to the Senate economics committee. Through the interdepartmental committee, IP Australia has recently released a consultation paper which will gather a wider range of views concerning issues from affected industries.
Another recommendation of the Senate committee was that the government reconsider schedule 8 to the bill in order to clarify the relationship between the patent-licensing provisions of the bill and the Trade Practices Act 1974 in light of the concerns raised with the committee by Professor Corones and Mr Clapperton. Again, Mr Baldwin has advised this week that officers of IP Australia have held discussions with Professor Corones to consider this issue in more depth. In those discussions it has been agreed that amendments to the bill are not necessary but a further explanatory memorandum should be tabled to provide greater clarity around this issue. This further explanatory memorandum clarifies that the provision to be inserted in the Patents Act is intended to complement the remedies available under the Trade Practices Act and is not intended to limit the court’s powers under the Trade Practices Act. It also clarifies that a compulsory licence for a patent is available as a remedy under the Patents Act 1990 for any breach of part IV of the Trade Practices Act in addition to any other remedies that are currently available under the Trade Practices Act. As a result, a party affected by a patent holder’s anticompetitive conduct will have a great number of options—either seeking any of the remedies that are currently available under the Trade Practices Act or seeking the remedy of a compulsory licence under the Patents Act.
The government’s positive response to the work of the economics committee again highlights the willingness of the Howard government to consult widely with interested parties on issues before the parliament and also reinforces the value of the work of legislation committees in the Senate.
Legislation that honours our international obligations, especially on such an internationally sensitive issue as intellectual property law, is also important. Australia is a signatory to the World Trade Organisation Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, generally known as TRIPS. This agreement does not allow generic pharmaceutical companies to manufacture, stockpile for later sale or export quantities of pharmaceuticals while patents are still in place. This legislation is an appropriate step towards honouring this agreement while remaining sensible about our right to research and develop a sustainable pharmaceutical industry which is able to satisfy our needs. This piece of legislation will keep important knowledge companies in Australia, employing young Australians to undertake research work of the highest strategic importance, whilst not violating our international commitments.
This bill is also an example of the effective ways in which we can balance the rights of the innovator with the expectations of the community to receive the benefits of innovation through competition. It was found by the Ergas report that, although intellectual property law and competition policy were more often than not complementary, as they recognised in recommendation 15:
While conferring intellectual property rights encourages investment in creative effort, it can allow the owners of the results of this effort to unduly restrict the diffusion and use of these results.
The potential for anticompetitive behaviour following patenting requires that we have legislation in place that provides adequate rights and entitlements for all parties involved. This has been satisfied in the bill through a competition test to be undertaken between parties at the Federal Court if it is believed that one who owns their patent is not fully utilising it for the benefit of the broader community or is using it for anticompetitive purposes such as stifling further innovation.
Schedule 6 includes the provision that if one is deemed by the trademarks office to have satisfied the requirements of being a prior user of the patent then they will not be licensed to continue their work but instead assigned that right, provided that they undertake it themselves within Australia. This legislation is effective in its provision for parties who have a genuine claim to prior use recognition. It gives them the potential to continue their work throughout the life of the patent whilst also providing to strategic industries, such as the generic pharmaceutical industry, the concession to research and therefore remain competitive in their industry. This upholds the recommendations of the Ergas report by ensuring a balance between the innovator and their competitors.
In addition, as was recommended by the Advisory Council on Intellectual Property report, intellectual property will now have more effective mechanisms of enforcement to ensure the rights of innovators are respected. The bill provides in schedule 8 that the trademarks office will be able to revoke trademarks due to administrative error or oversight. In addition, schedule 5 outlines that the judicial system, through the Federal Court, will have the capacity to order punitive damages in addition to financial recuperation against those who are in violation of patent law. These considerations made for the rights of the innovator will, however, be regulated by the introduction of further competition tests to ensure patents are being fully utilised as decided by the Federal Court.
Therefore the intellectual property bill that is currently before the Senate is an important piece of legislation that will improve our national health by securing a sustained pharmaceutical industry that can fulfil our requirements in times of emergency and that is also capable of raising investment, employment and training opportunities as well as providing other important reforms with regard to intellectual property. However, it also achieves this while still sensibly balancing the rights of innovators and competitors in a succinct way which will improve the benefits of intellectual property law for all Australians. Therefore I commend it to the Senate, as was recommended by the Senate economics committee.",SENATE,<title>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,28,1
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2006-09-14,"—I rise to make some brief remarks on Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Bill 2006, also as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Economics. First I would like to place on record my thanks to the committee secretariat and members of the committee for what, as Senator Murray has outlined, was a very useful and informative process. As is often the case with the Senate economics committee, we were able to come to a fairly unanimous view in recommending some changes to this legislation.
As a member of that committee, I was particularly moved by the representatives of Nufarm Ltd about the need to progress the issue of the use and manufacture of generics in their industry as well as in the pharmaceutical industry. I was made aware of the large number of Australians who are employed by Nufarm and other companies, and I must say I was therefore a little concerned at the slow progress that has been made through the bureaucracy when it comes to addressing similar issues for that industry. The committee was informed that there is a paper around that addresses similar issues for the agricultural and fertiliser industry. However, that has been with the agency since August last year but as yet we have not had meetings with relevant agencies and actually progressed any draft legislation.
The committee was informed that there was a hope that we might get to see something that addresses the concerns of that industry by the end of this year. It would seem that we make very slow progress when it comes to dealing with these issues. I just want to place on record my concern that we do seem to hasten very slowly in this area—it is an area that is worthy of some reform—and put in a plea that we try to deal with this a bit more quickly than we dealt with the issues that are before us today.
I would also like to thank Professor Corones, who appeared by teleconference before the committee. He pointed out that he had become aware of our inquiry at a very late stage. In fact, it was his evidence that pointed out some of the inconsistencies that we had to deal with; hence the change in the explanatory memorandum. It is useful to note that the government did take the committee’s recommendations on board and gave us a new explanatory memorandum to address our concerns.
However, as Senator Murray has outlined, I do hope that that is all that is needed to address those particular concerns. Not being a lawyer I cannot guarantee that, but I do hope that we are getting this right. It was of some concern to me that it was Professor Corones who knew about the two pieces of government legislation—the proposed bill that we are now dealing with and the amendments that the government were making to their national access regime bill. However, agencies of government did not know about the inconsistencies between the two pieces of legislation. It took members of the economics committee and an outside academic to point out the inconsistencies in approach. When you are looking at aspects of trade practices reform, I think it is really important that all agencies pay attention to what is being done in that area because it affects all of us. Who knows what would have happened if Professor Corones had not got hold of the issue at such a late hour? Who knows what mess we may have ended up in?
I thank him for his evidence and I thank the members of the committee. I put in a plea hoping that we will progress the next stage of this reform for companies like Nufarm perhaps quicker than we have addressed this reform. I hope the new explanatory memorandum does in fact achieve everything that the government claims it does in addressing the committee’s concerns.",SENATE,<title>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,28,1
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2006-09-14,"—Firstly, I table further explanatory memoranda relating to the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Bill 2006. In addressing some of the issues that have been raised in the debate, I thank senators for their contribution to the debate on this piece of legislation. I would just like to correct a couple of things that have been put on the record, particularly by Senator Carr, in relation to the Ergas report and the report of the review of enforcement of industrial property rights of the Advisory Council on Intellectual Property.
It is important to note that, contrary to what Senator Carr said, the key recommendations of the Ergas and the ACIP reports were enacted in 2001 by the Patents Amendment Act 2001. These changes to the patents legislation have operated effectively for some years now, and this bill implements the majority of the residual recommendations of those two reports. It is important to put on record that there has in fact been progress since those two reports were brought down in 2000. In 2001, the initial work was done. The implementation of these recommendations that we are looking at today was delayed by the negotiation of the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement and by other competing government priorities, so there is a legitimate reason for the process that has occurred to this point.
As has been indicated during the debate, there are some recommendations that are outstanding at this point, but that is because recommendations of some other recent reports into the intellectual property system affect the implementation of some of the recommendations. The government continues to do further work on progressing these outstanding recommendations. They are on the government’s legislation program and will be implemented in the near future. Having said that, I commend the bill to the Senate.

What a demonstration in the last 24 hours of the arrogance and out-of-touch behaviour of a 10-year-long government. I am hoping Senator Eggleston will stay and join in this debate because he has a crucial role to play in the next few weeks. Yesterday we saw Senator Coonan on behalf of Senator Eggleston announce the date and the timing of a Senate committee. There was no consultation whatsoever with members of the committee, including Senator Eggleston. I am willing to bet that the first Senator Eggleston knew about the deadline was when he read it in the press release. What an extraordinary abuse of process. Senator Ronaldson is on this committee and I bet he did not know anything about this deadline either. As we have seen in documents circulated today, the Senate is going to be allowed a grand total of three days of hearings in Canberra. Originally, it was said that there would be some meetings around the country, but no: three days in Canberra—nothing more. What has Senator Barnaby Joyce got to say about this? What has Senator Ron Boswell got to say about this? What has Senator Fiona Nash got to say about this? What has Senator Eggleston got to say about this?

Senator Heffernan interjecting—

—They can all read and write, Senator Heffernan. They are on our committee. What we have here is another smash and grab, another situation where the government is simply going to say: ‘We don’t care what the parliament thinks. We don’t care what the people of Australia think. We are just going to ram this through as fast as we can because we’ve got the numbers.’ Ten long years and the arrogance is shining brightly. The Prime Minister promised there would not be abuses of the Senate. The Prime Minister really has changed since he got control of both chambers. He has tossed all the promises out—no surprise to those of us on this side: just tossed them away. We are going to have a whitewash of a committee and a whitewash of a report, rushed through with no genuine consideration and no genuine interest whatsoever. It is not surprising because the scam that the government is trying to pull on the Australian public is to deliver Australia one of the most concentrated media industries in the world. Only probably North Korea is going to have a more concentrated media than we are going to have after this. North Korea or maybe Lebanon, I do not know.
—Albania.
—I think I am being unfair to Lebanon, Senator Ferguson. But in Sydney and Melbourne the number of owners could halve. In places like Albury, Dubbo and Bundaberg the number of owners could fall from six to four. These changes will undermine media diversity. Newsrooms will be merged, reporters will be sacked and local content will be reduced. Radio and TV news will just become a rip and read of the local newspaper. In regional Australia, local stories will be squeezed out by cheaper content from the big cities. These changes are demonstrably not in the public interest. To give credit, there is at least one member of the government on whom what is going on here is slowly dawning. It is, in fact, Mr Paul Neville, the chairman of the backbench communications committee of the government. This morning he went on radio and he said that, philosophically, his position is very similar to Paul Keating’s. He said, ‘We have to start considering why we are doing this.’ That is the trick. Why are we doing this?
He went on to say that you could not argue that there was not the potential for an interventionist proprietor or for a zealot editor to run a totally single stream point of view in a particular community. That is what he told ABC Radio. I think that I have almost unanimous support from National Party members and rural Liberals on this issue. I do not think there would be one who would disagree with me that we need to have a more vibrant local media and more vibrant local programming. As Stephen Bartholomeusz said in the Age today:
Unless there are new entrants, new competitors and new and compelling content, where is the trade-off for less diversity of ownership and content?

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2006-09-14,"—Firstly, I welcome back, Senator Conroy. It is nice to have him back as a spokesperson again for today at least. I find it quite extraordinary that five months after Senator Coonan first announced these reforms, the day the legislation is to be introduced, the day the committee is meeting, we did not hear one word of policy from the Labor Party apart from some nefarious commentary on regional Australia, which Senator Conroy would have absolutely no idea about because he is, at best, an infrequent visitor. There has not been one discussion about where the Labor Party stands on media reform. They are the dinosaurs of communication reform in this country. The last time the Australian Labor Party talked about media reform was 20 years ago—the internet was the domain of academics, pay TV was in its infancy, there was no framework for digital radio, IP TV had not been thought of, let alone 3G, video ipods or television mobile devices.
This reform package is predominantly directed at one group of people in this great country, and that is the consumers. The Australian Labor Party have a very big decision to make over the next four weeks on this issue. Are they prepared to support—
—Order, Senator Ronaldson. A couple of us have formed the view that your microphone does not seem to be working properly, but we can still hear you in spite of that. Just be careful about the way you are facing, because I do not think you are feeding into the microphone.
—I am very grateful to you, Mr Deputy President, because I get unfairly accused of speaking too loudly in this chamber and I am very grateful for your support in this regard. I will face the right direction. Senator Sterle, you should take note of the Deputy President’s comments too.
This reform package is about delivering to consumers in this country a modern telecommunications system and a modern media ownership system that will allow the Australian people to get the benefits that will flow from media reform, such as investment in communications in this country, which has been sadly lacking for a long time. It is incumbent upon the Australian Labor Party to state where they stand on this. Five months after Senator Coonan floated these reforms in some detail, we have not heard one policy position from the Australian Labor Party. Is it fair that, because of the intransigence of the Australian Labor Party, Australian consumers are going to miss out on new services that are restricted now because of the lack of investment?
The big winners under this reform package will be consumers. It would take me some time to go through the full benefits to consumers of these reforms, but I will just go through some of them very quickly. In doing so, I will talk about the new services. Obviously, the new services will be digital services. The two channels, A and B, will be auctioned as separate national licences. Both licences will be issued for 10 years, with the possibility of a further five-year renewal. Consistent with the government’s intention that these channels be used for new and innovative digital services for consumers rather than replicating traditional television services, neither channel A nor B will be permitted to be used for traditional commercial free-to-air services or subscription TV services to fixed in-home receivers. The Australian Labor Party has got to tell the Australian public now, today, whether they are going to support them or continue to deny them modern telecommunications and a modern media ownership system. Today is the day for them to tell us where they stand. Are they anti-consumer or pro-consumer?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Media Ownership</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,33,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2006-09-14,"—I also rise to take note of the answers given by Senator Coonan. We all know that this media package introduced today is complex; it is multilayered. We have heard some comments this afternoon by senators about the television aspect of these bills, but I would like to address my remarks to the question that I asked of Senator Coonan, which was really about the concentration of media ownership in rural and regional Australia.
It would be very sensible to remind ourselves of something that was said in this chamber in 2003 by former Senator Brian Harradine who, when we were talking about this very issue, said:
Those who own or run media organisations are in a position of privilege and influence. They are members of an unelected elite which is not effectively accountable to the Australian people. It is our job as elected legislators to ensure not only that there are reasonable parameters set for the running of successful media businesses but, much more importantly, that these parameters serve the Australian people.
He also said:
The people do not want further concentration of power in the major players in the media.
It is very clear from the explanatory memorandum that rural and regional Australians will be the big losers, particularly in relation to local content issues. I asked the minister quite specifically about that and she regurgitated the second reading speech that comes with the bill, talking about local content licence conditions and local content plans.
I would like to draw senators’ attention to what is in the explanatory memorandum about this. For example, in relation to the issue of local news it says that there must be a minimum service standard for local news, that bulletins must be broadcast on different days of the week, and that bulletins must be broadcast during prime time and must adequately reflect matters of local significance. I wonder if you can guess the minimum number of news bulletins that is going to be required. Can you guess, I wonder? It is five bulletins—that is, a requirement for less than one news bulletin a day would be incorporated in this legislation.
And we have a guarantee from the minister about local community service announcements. Can you imagine what the minimum standard is for local community service announcements? The requirement is for one per day. This is what we are going to be reduced to when we have regional services amalgamated under this regime.
Already in Australia we have a concentration of ownership that is a problem. Fifteen of the 28 regional dailies are owned by large media companies such as Rural Press and APN. And most regional radio stations are owned by a few networks such as Macquarie Radio and ARN Clear Channel. The locally owned regional newspaper and radio station is very much a thing of the past.
So Senator Coonan’s so-called media reform proposal does nothing more than extend the existing oligopoly that the networks are enjoying. There has been no explanation from Senator Coonan about assurances that local news services will not have local content if these radio stations become part of a cross-media group. There is a simple explanation for that: Senator Coonan cannot give any guarantees that local news and radio services will not be cut in the bush. She could not outline what the so-called minimum standards would be—although I found them eventually in the memorandum—and she certainly could not give any comfort to her National Party colleagues who are very concerned about what is happening here.
Steven Bartholomeusz, writing in today’s Age, said:
Unless there are new entrants, new competitors and new and compelling content, where is the trade-off for less diversity of ownership and content?

The obvious answer is that there is no trade-off and the communications minister is treading on very dangerous ground. Terry McCann, considering this matter today said:
The reforms are all about ownership and nothing to do with the dynamic development of media.
It really is a huge issue that we are confronting and, as Senator Conroy so rightly said, the consultation process by the committee is a disgrace.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Media Ownership</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,33,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2006-09-14,"—I was pleased that Senator Conroy referred in his speech to Mr Paul Keating’s interview on Lateline last night. I, too, watched Mr Paul Keating’s interview on Lateline and all the memories came flooding back as I saw Mr Keating—a bit greyer than he was, his face a bit hollower than it was, and his voice a bit thicker than we remember it from the days of the Keating government. No doubt that air of ennui reflects 10 years of schadenfreude at the prospects of the Australian Labor Party and federal politics since the fall of the Keating government in 1996. And I couldn’t help thinking, ‘Is this what the Australian Labor Party has come to in their media policy?’
You see, I was second to none in being a critic of Mr Keating and the 17 per cent interest rates that he gave us. But there were certain aspects of public policy—it cannot be doubted—in which Mr Keating was ahead of the game, and he kept a reluctant, mulish, recalcitrant, pervicacious Australian Labor Party ahead of the game in reforming certain sectors of our economy. In particular, we remember financial deregulation. And my side of politics has always given full credit to Mr Keating for his achievements in that field. They were achievements which, as the journalist George Megalogenis recently wrote in his very good book The Longest Decade, were the precursors of the fuller reforms that the Howard government has undertaken.
But sadly that reforming zeal, which in some respects marked Mr Keating’s approach to certain sectors of the Australian economy, has been completely lost both on him and on the party he once led when it comes to cross-media laws. We have the sorry spectacle of the opposition in this country, engaged in a debate of national importance about media policy, saddled with a policy that was written before the digital revolution, and represented in this place—though you would not know it, so seldom is he given the opportunity even to ask questions about policy at question time; today was an exception—with a spokesman on communications, Senator Stephen Conroy, of whom we know from Mr Latham’s diaries, when offered the portfolio of communications after the last federal election by Mr Latham, his then leader, said, ‘I don’t want to be the shadow minister for communications because I’m not interested in the area. I know nothing about it. I’m not interested in it; let me do something else. It has no appeal for me.’
Nevertheless, Senator Stephen Conroy did end up being the shadow minister for communications and, my goodness, hasn’t his lack of interest or knowledge in the area been on embarrassing display for the whole of the Australian people in the two years or so since? That is a fact not lost, I might say, on Mr Lindsay Tanner, the member for Melbourne, who one might think really was the shadow spokesman for communications. So, Senator Conroy, I say to you, through the chair: it does not matter how abusive your language, it does not matter how inflammatory your rhetoric, it does not matter how confected your outrage, it does not matter how sesquipedalian your language and it does not matter how ideological your intent—none of the political theatre in which you engage matters one iota. It does not camouflage from the Australian people your lack of interest in this area of policy. Nor does it camouflage from the Australian people that the Australian Labor Party’s attitude to cross-media ownership laws predates pay TV, predates the digital revolution and predates the further internationalisation of the telecommunications sector of the Australian economy.
To this day—not more than a year before the next federal election, after 10½ years of policy laziness and being asleep at the wheel on this, as on so many other areas of public policy—the Australian Labor Party still cannot find a consistent, coherent, understandable, modern position on cross-media ownership laws. What a lamentable failure. What a disgrace, Senator Forshaw. What a disgrace. (Time expired)

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2006-09-14,"—I listened to the speech of Senator Brandis, and I have to say that the emasculation of the English language that we have just heard from Senator Brandis suggests to me that a number of members of the government benches today have swallowed a thesaurus. But let’s get away from the literary game that is being played over there—the number of big words you can get into a five-minute speech. Let’s go to a member of the government who understands this issue, a person whom I have the very highest regard for, and that is Mr Paul Neville, a National Party member from Queensland—a member of the National Party who, unlike most of the rest of that fast-fading rump, makes a contribution to debates in this parliament.
Mr Neville is the chair of the backbench communications committee of the government. How did he describe the proposals put forward by Senator Coonan, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts? He stated that they are:
… the exact opposite of competition. It’s centralising and consolidating regional markets, it’s not creating a more vibrant and competitive market.
He went on to say:
If you can’t stand your ground on issues like this, you may as well not be here.
What a condemnation of all of the other members of the government parties, toadying along on these proposals to destroy the cross-media ownership laws. Mr Neville is on the money on this one. Mr Neville and those other few people on the government benches hopefully will continue to stand up against these outrageous proposals put forward by the minister, Senator Coonan.
Senator Ronaldson started his contribution by claiming that the Labor Party did not have any policies. Let me remind Senator Ronaldson that on the issue of media ownership the Labor Party has had a consistent policy for years and years, going back to the days when we were in government. It is a pro-consumer policy. It is an anti-media-monopoly policy. It is a policy which is pro media diversity. It is a policy that is anti the concentration of media ownership.
It was very instructive and indeed enjoyable last night to watch Paul Keating interviewed on the Lateline program, because if ever any member of the parliament in those years of the Labor governments took on the issue of protecting the cross-media ownership laws it was the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating. And he was right. The policy of the Labor Party is to maintain the cross-media ownership laws so that we maintain diversity in this country, so that we prevent the two large media organisations, the Packer empire and the Murdoch empire, from effectively taking control of the print media, the television media and the multimedia in this country—both free-to-air and pay TV.
The minister today, in answer to the first question from the opposition, said that the government had no plans to weaken the media laws. I think Senator Coonan may actually believe that, because the minister does not know. This policy of destroying the cross-media ownership laws is not being run by Senator Coonan. This is being run straight out of the Prime Minister’s office, because he has always wanted to do this. Now that they have control of the Senate, they believe they can achieve it. It was always the Senate that prevented them from destroying the cross-media ownership laws.
If you think that the scandals that surrounded the cash for comment saga, which the Prime Minister’s pet journalist and commentator, Alan Jones, was involved in, then you have not seen anything yet. When it comes to what will happen once the two media organisations gain virtually total control of the media in this country, it will be a scandal and it will lead to far less diversity and far less accountability.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2006-09-14,"—I am pleased to open this debate on my private senator’s bill, the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment (Disallowance Power of the Commonwealth) Bill 2006, which amends the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act of 1988. As senators will know, not too long ago we were dealing with the override of the Australian Capital Territory legislature by the executive of the national government, the Howard government. The national government overrode the civil union legislation passed by the Australian Capital Territory’s Legislative Assembly. That outcome gave rise to today’s bill.
I have been in the Senate long enough to have seen both the Northern Territory legislation on euthanasia overridden in 1996—but that was by the passage of a bill through the parliament—and then the consequential override of the ACT legislature’s civil union legislation, a very different matter indeed. In the latter case the executive—that is, essentially, the Prime Minister’s office—effectively regulated under the terms of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 to override a bill that had passed through the legislature of the Australian Capital Territory into law in the territory. It needs to be stated clearly for the record that the Stanhope government went to the last ACT election with a platform of bringing in the civil union law. The government was duly elected to office by nearly a quarter of a million voters of the Australian Capital Territory.
The Stanhope government was elected on a commitment to introduce legislation. It then introduced that legislation, which passed through the assembly and duly into law. The executive of the federal government, the Howard government, decided—without reference to the national parliament—that it would in turn regulate to override that legislation enacted by the Legislative Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory.
The problem here is that effectively that overrides section 122 of the Constitution, which gives this parliament the right to override laws of territories. The matter ought to have been referred to this parliament by the Howard government. But the Howard government did not do so. It took a disallowance motion from the Greens to cause a debate here in the Senate. The federal government, the Howard government, which has a majority—which Mr Howard assured us would not be used with hubris—then proceeded to use that majority to override the ACT’s law.
This bill is to prevent that from happening in the future. I want to make clear to senators who may not have looked at this as closely as I have that we cannot go outside the Australian Constitution, and the Constitution gives the parliament the right to override the laws of a territory. But in the modern era, in this year of 2006, where a territory legislature—be it the Northern Territory or the Australian Capital Territory—makes laws for its citizens, in consultation, as ever, with those citizens and subject to their rebuke at a future election, we can ensure that those laws cannot be overridden by the executive, by the Prime Minister, effectively deciding in his office that he will send a regulation to the assured signature of the Governor-General of the day to override the laws of the territories.
Senators will note that my bill refers only to the Australian Capital Territory, but it is my opinion that the same protection from the arrogant and high-handed intervention on their law-making process by a future executive here in Canberra should be given to the voters of the Northern Territory. The process ought to be that, if the national government of the day does not like a territory law, then it should refer it to the parliament. It should prepare a bill, and it should refer it to the national parliament for passage through both houses of parliament. If it gets assent there, then the territory law will be overridden. This is not a complicated matter. This is about two things: one, honouring the Constitution of this country; second, honouring democracy as practised by people wherever they are in this country, be they in the Australian Capital Territory or anywhere else.
It is far from democratic for a government—in this case the Howard government, which had no authority from the people of Australia, who had never been to an election on the matter of civil unions—to regulate to override the express wishes, the voting outcomes, of the people of the Australian Capital Territory without reference to the parliament. Let me anticipate an argument or two. Firstly, it will be argued: ‘What about the states? What about the Franklin campaign? Didn’t the federal government override the state there?’ Two things: firstly, that matter went to the High Court, and the High Court ruled that the external treaties power, which binds Australia to international law, empowered the Commonwealth over the state and its domestic laws that enabled it to build a dam. There was a competition between authorities, and the Constitution was read by the High Court to enable the federal government to protect World Heritage properties in this country from the destruction that would have come from the Franklin Dam.
The High Court was not ruling whether or not that was a good thing; it was ruling that the Constitution gave that power to the federal government. What I am saying here is consistent with that honouring of the Constitution. Section 122 of the Constitution says that, if a federal government wants to override a state, it should do so through the parliament—not, as I said, through the arrogance of an executive decision by a government in an interparliamentary period, hoping that there will be no reaction to that.
The second thing is in the matter of some future emergency. It is very careless—indeed, I think it is irresponsible—to put an argument that you must defend an abuse of the spirit of the Constitution because there may be some emergency situation which would warrant that. Let those who argue that case state exactly what they mean. It is a specious and fatuous argument to bring before this place. Let me say to those such as Senator Humphries, who may argue that they should have been consulted more about this: no, sir. He should have consulted more about this himself. Primarily, he should have consulted with his own electors and should have taken note of the voters of the Australian Capital Territory, who empowered the Stanhope government in the matter of civil unions, and a whole range of other matters, for the good governance of the Australian Capital Territory.
Senator Humphries has been in the position of Chief Minister and will know that an ACT assembly will be closer to the people of the ACT than a federal government can be. That is the nature of the democratic process. So it is very much a matter about which Senator Humphries knows full well the ins and outs. He has had my second reading contribution with him since this bill was brought in in June this year, and I am now putting the argument that is so strongly in favour of this legislation passing through the parliament.
I am very aware that this legislation ought to pass the Senate this afternoon with the support of Senator Humphries and at least his National Party colleagues, who are quite devoted to empowering regional Australia and to not allowing the concentration of power to go more and more into the hands of fewer and fewer people. So there is a real test here of consistency of argument, of honouring ideals put forward by those voted in on the other side to look after regional representation.
Let me reiterate that the overriding of the civil unions legislation—which had been passed by the ACT—by the Howard government executive was arrogant and undemocratic. It was a ruthless use of power, without consultation with either the people of the ACT or either house of this parliament. It would be extraordinarily inconsistent for any member—Senator Humphries or anybody else—to have voted against that override under those circumstances yet vote against this bill, which would prevent that happening in a future circumstance.
—It’s unconstitutional.
—We have a poorly informed transferee from the National Party to the Liberal ranks saying that it is unconstitutional. He should read section 122 of the Constitution. I would expect not much better from him; I do expect better from representatives of the ACT.
This is important democratic legislation; this is safeguard legislation; it is quintessential Senate legislation. The Senate was set up to defend the interests of the states and ipso facto the interests of the two territories which have emerged since the formulation of the Commonwealth by the founding fathers now more than 100 years ago. This is the Senate’s business. The Senate should be upholding the interests of people at state and territory level. This legislation does just that. I recommend it to the Senate and look forward to support from both sides of the Senate in seeing the passage of this legislation this afternoon.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY (SELF-GOVERNMENT) AMENDMENT (DISALLOWANCE POWER OF THE COMMONWEALTH) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,34,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2006-09-14,"—The opposition will be supporting the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment (Disallowance Power of the Commonwealth) Bill 2006 on the basis that we believe that, if self-government is to mean anything, local parliaments have to be held accountable for the actions they take and that it is inappropriate for governments to seek, in a burst of political populism, to slither down to Yarralumla in the dead of night to have executive fiats imposed upon the people of the Australian Capital Territory. I say that in a context where it is abundantly clear that the actions taken by this government were aimed at the broader domestic political agenda in regard to debates on the question of homosexuality rather than on any serious discussion of the legal or the constitutional issues that were posed by the legislation that had been passed by the Australian Capital Territory government.
The nature and context of the controversy have to be understood if we are to examine the base political motives of the government in seeking to use this particular dispute as a means of exercising its executive power. I say that because it is my firm belief that the government lacked the courage to pursue its agenda through its own party room. If the government had been serious about the claims it was making in regard to the civil unions legislation of the government of the Australian Capital Territory, it would have moved a bill in the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia and it would have allowed its own members to vote on that bill. I am of the opinion that such legislation was not proceeded with because the government was not confident that it could rely upon its own members. It was a device that was being pursued by Mr Ruddock, in my judgement at the behest of the Prime Minister, with a view to extracting momentary political advantage on the question of whether or not civil unions could be pursued, when the real bottom line on this was the government’s hostility to homosexuality. The government would not be so crude as to come out and put that case formally and publicly because that is not the way this government operates. It operates on the basis of seeking to exploit fears and insecurities in the community, rather than debating issues of fundamental human rights.
The government of the Australian Capital Territory took a position to the electorate; it had a mandate to act and it sought to pass legislation acting upon that mandate. Furthermore, the government of the Australian Capital Territory sought to make very clear that it was not seeking to breach the Constitution. It said to the Commonwealth of Australia: ‘If you can demonstrate that that case is incorrect, we will amend the legislation still further.’ Those offers were never taken up because it did not suit the political agenda of John Howard for there to be legislation in the Australian Capital Territory concerning civil unions. It suited his political purpose for there to be this dead-of-night ambush by way of a governor-general disallowing ACT legislation, which, of course, the government sought to exploit for its base political motives.
In this particular legislation the objects of the bill are straightforward. This bill seeks to remove the Governor-General’s power to disallow an act passed by the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly and seeks to reiterate the principle of the primacy of the Australian Capital Territory’s Legislative Assembly in making laws for the Australian Capital Territory. I take the view that, where the territory’s powers are exercised in accordance with the Constitution and in accordance with the appropriate legal framework, it is entitled to make those laws. We have a very basic principle here, however, that the government in the Australian Capital Territory has to take responsibility for the laws it passes. It has to defend its own actions. It does that on the same basis on which all other parliaments in this country operate—that is, they have to face elections. That is how questions of accountability are resolved. There is an appropriate mechanism, so long as the parliament acts within the parameters of its normal powers. I take the view that, if a democratically elected parliament runs the gauntlet of an electoral process and acts within power, then it is entitled to hold itself accountable at the next election in that jurisdiction. That is a proposition which, frankly, I find unarguable.
If the argument genuinely was that the government of the Australian Capital Territory had exceeded its powers, then legislation should have been brought into this chamber and into the House of Representatives and then we could pass judgement on that basis. I think that is an appropriate course of action. If that is what the government genuinely believes, if it believes there are fundamental human rights, for instance, that are being put at risk or there is a matter of urgency, legislation can still be moved through the two chambers quite quickly. But it does not give any justification for slipping off down to Yarralumla to stick the shiv into the local government, put out a press release and make out what big fellows you are in an attempt to search out particular views, homophobic views, within this country.
The self-government act here has been in operation now for 20 years, and it is entirely appropriate that elements of the legislation should come under review and their continuing utility be examined. There are a number of standard measures that seem to me to be of use in evaluating the continuing benefits of the clauses empowering the Governor-General to disallow Australian Capital Territory legislation. I will mention just three. Firstly, you could argue whether or not particular legislation or a section of legislation is equitable and based on the recognition of the rights of citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia. It could be argued, secondly, whether or not it meets the spirit as well as the letter of particular pieces of legislation and, thirdly, whether it serves to promote good public policy and governance. But it is my contention that the disallowance powers of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-government) Act fail on all those tests. That is what needs to be assessed.
It has to be the case that under the present legal arrangements some Australian citizens, the citizens of the Australian Capital Territory and the citizens of the Northern Territory, are operating on a different standard of governance from the rest of the country. There are sanctions that can be applied to their local parliaments that are not applied to the rest of the Commonwealth. It strikes me that the present legal framework effectively discriminates against citizens in the Australian Capital Territory. If Senator Brown’s bill were carried by this chamber and of course the House of Representatives, it essentially would provide for genuine self-government of the Australian Capital Territory. If self-government of the Australian Capital Territory is to have any meaning at all, then the Australian Capital Territory legislature must have the right to determine its own policies within the parameters of its own authority. It strikes me that the present arrangements do not allow that to occur.
If we look at the sorts of interventions that have jeopardised the right of Australian Capital Territory electors to consider issues of social, cultural or economic importance and subsequently to collectively express their judgement on such matters through the ballot box, then we see we have a situation where the current law does not allow Australian citizens in the Australian Capital Territory to do that. Equally important is the point that needs to be made time and again: such power that currently exists compromises the rights of citizens in the Australian Capital Territory to hold their own governments accountable for actions that are taken.
It seems that the golden vote that is being reserved for the Governor-General—and I think Senator Bob Brown is quite right when he says that effectively means that the Prime Minister and government invoke their own discretionary, discriminatory capacities—is a matter of deep concern. It is a very lazy way to govern. It is a lazy way to hold governments accountable.
We are in the situation where the Howard government is increasingly seeking to interfere in the rights of the parliaments around this Commonwealth, but this is above and beyond that. We see it in the actions taken with regard to hospitals and schools, through to all aspects of the constitutionally legitimate functions of state governments. This is probably one of the most centralised or centralist governments in Australian history. It is an irony, because it is well known on this side of the parliament that there is quite considerable sympathy for national programs, for national consistency, for nation-building.
I must say that what I have seen in recent times, in terms of the interventions this government has made on what are traditionally regarded as the legitimate functions of state governments, is beyond all comparison with previous governments. There is hardly an area of state government activity in which the Commonwealth of Australia is now not seeking to intervene—hardly an area that I can think of. But we have a situation here in the Australian Capital Territory where, as I say, you can slither off down to Adelaide Avenue, out to Yarralumla, and put in a quick fix in the middle of the night without trying to actually address any serious public policy debate.
If the Commonwealth is genuinely concerned, if it thinks that the actions of a territory are inappropriate or outside its due legal powers, there are avenues that ought be available to it. I say: if the government felt that the marriage provisions of the Constitution—which everyone acknowledges are a Commonwealth responsibility—had genuinely been challenged by the ACT, it should have had the guts, the courage of its convictions, to bring a piece of legislation into this chamber.
When the situation arose with the euthanasia debate, the government made arrangements for a private member’s bill to be brought in. I did not support that private member’s bill, because I thought the Northern Territory was entitled to make laws on euthanasia. But I will say this about that piece of legislation introduced some years ago: at least there was a debate and a vote in the two chambers of this parliament. A case had to be made for why the override existed. It was a situation in which the Australian government and the Australian parliament could be held accountable for their actions. The government had to make a case—and it said, of course, that it was a private member’s bill; we all know what the view of the government was—and win a vote in this parliament.
Frankly, that is not the style of this government of recent times. We have seen a deterioration in standards over the 10 long years of the Howard government. They are much better now at doing the backroom deal to put in the quick fix than they are at public debates and trying to bring the public with them. What they are seeking to do is to exploit an emotive response and abuse the process available to them.
It is true that the need to invoke the power of disallowance is premised on the presumption of a failure of discussions and negotiation. I also take the view that the government went out to deliberately ensure failure of the discussion, debate and negotiation with the Stanhope government. You would expect that there would be a presumption of rational debate, but there is no way that that case can be made in terms of the correspondence that is now publicly available between Minister Ruddock and various ministers of the government of the Australian Capital Territory.
It is abundantly clear from the history of the past decade that this government has increasingly sought to impose its will upon the states and territories for the most mercurial of reasons. Time and time again we have seen an unwillingness to debate the benefits of legislation, or even of national programs. Whether it be flagpoles in schools or other forms of divisiveness—incitement, in fact—across a range of programs, the government does not actually want to see debate unless it registers in the focus groups first. Increasingly that is where the debate happens. It is through polling and focus-group responses so that the government seeks to pursue agendas it believes will enhance its overall political position.
The bill Senator Bob Brown has put before us today, in my opinion, does not compromise the capacity of the Commonwealth parliament to exercise its authority and its judgement in its legitimate spheres of influence and responsibility; nor does it compromise the ability of this parliament to operate, as it should, as the national guarantor of the human rights and wellbeing of Australian citizens. These are our fundamental responsibilities: to ensure the protection of citizens no matter where they live.
I fully acknowledge the possibility that, from time to time, governments do the wrong thing and do abuse human rights and may well in the future abuse human rights. There has to be protection to ensure that the legitimacy and equality of Australian citizens are protected. I say the way to do that is through deliberative legislative instruments.
The political compact that we call the Australian system of government must extend to allowing Australians the right to elect their governments—state, federal and territory—and to allow those governments to implement the platforms on which they are elected within their province of power. There cannot be a double jeopardy arrangement whereby the Governor-General has the right of disallowance over territory legislation without reference to parliamentary debate or parliamentary instruments. The fact that such a provision exists means there can be a partial and discriminatory exercise of executive power. Such a circumstance is incompatible with our legitimate right to protect the citizens of this country. Labor supports this proposed bill to remove the disallowance power over the Australian Capital Territory.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY (SELF-GOVERNMENT) AMENDMENT (DISALLOWANCE POWER OF THE COMMONWEALTH) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,34,1
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2006-09-14,"—I want to contribute to this debate by making the observation that the appropriate approach to issues like these is to consider whether one believes in an essentialist approach to the exercise of power in a democratic society or whether one takes a federalist approach, which accepts and supports the idea that there should be a range of centres of power in a federal system.
I unashamedly say to this chamber that I am a federalist. I am a great believer in a system that engineers a range of sources of authority and power within a democratic society, so that it is rarely or never the case that any one person or group or even government is necessarily able to exercise complete control and say over the lives and fortunes of the citizens of a particular community or nation.
In saying that I recognise what many others in this place have recognised: there is great genius in the Australian system of government, which despite many shortcomings and not being without the potential to be reformed in some way does nonetheless provide for there being two levels of government, with powers that are protected in the federal Constitution. Those levels of government have the capacity to stand their ground against any forbearance or paramount control by the other level that might override the wishes of a community that has elected that particular first form of government.
I think I am able to say in this debate that I am a federalist and I do generally support the exercise of power by state and territory governments, properly elected and properly mandated to reflect the wishes of their citizens against the wishes of even a federal government if that breaches the understood concept of federalism in Australia. I think I am able to make those comments with somewhat more of a history of support for federalism than some of those people today who will be supporting the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment (Disallowance Power of the Commonwealth) Bill 2006, introduced by Senator Brown.
I dare say that there are some members opposite—on the Labor benches, for example—who will be supporting this bill even though, presumably, they did not hesitate to support the legislation back in 1997 or 1998 that overrode the Northern Territory’s and, indeed, the ACT’s power to legislate with respect to euthanasia. I do not support euthanasia, but I strongly oppose the exercise of that power because I believe in the right of territories to legislate in those areas. I wonder whether some of those on the other side of the chamber who will be voting for this legislation today might ask themselves whether those positions are particularly consistent.
I also supported the right of the Tasmanian government back in 1983 to make decisions about its hydro-electric needs. I know that Senator Brown, although not a member of parliament at that stage—at least not a member of this parliament—certainly did not support that particular exercise of state power. So there are circumstances in which all of us are prepared to discard this idea of balance between the two levels of government and let one level of government step into an area which we might regard as being the preserve or the prerogative of another level of government in Australia—if the circumstances are right. None of us are holier than thou in that respect in a debate like this.
If we are honest about it, we will admit that we all understand there are circumstances where limits need to be placed on the bald concept that here is an area where a state government has the right to make decisions and here is an area where the federal parliament has the right to make decisions and there is never any grey area, never any overlap, never any question where the simple rules need to be reconsidered, modified or bent a little to accommodate the needs of the community or what is right in particular circumstances.
The fact is that there are limits on those federal concepts. Those limits are particularly relevant in the case of both the ACT and, to some extent, the Northern Territory. A very good example of the limits of that concept was provided only recently when it became obvious that the ACT government was at least contemplating legislating with respect to antiterrorist measures in a way which was inconsistent with the position of every other Australian state and the Northern Territory. That was a very good example of where, in the national interest, it was appropriate for the federal government to consider the exercise of a power to override the Australian Capital Territory’s law-making capacity with respect to—and, of course, this is the classic definition—peace, order and good government.
You might well argue that terrorist legislation is about peace and order, so you might argue that the ACT had the right to legislate in those areas. But, no, it was widely accepted in the community—and I would not be surprised if it was widely accepted in this chamber—that there is a prima facie right, an a priori right, by the federal parliament to make sure that Australia has consistent antiterrorism legislation. These principles might be baldly stated as being absolutes, but in fact they need to be carefully considered in each particular context in which they arise.
Another limitation that arises from that model of federalism, particularly as it applies to the Australian Capital Territory, is that the ACT and the federal government share the one home. The federal government’s headquarters, its parliament and its federal agencies are largely based in the national capital, and the ACT government, of course, administers the municipal and state-level services provided to the ACT community. So that need to ensure that federal interests are not compromised by the working of ACT self-government is a particular consideration that applies in the case of the ACT—perhaps not so strongly in the case of the Northern Territory, but it does clearly apply here.
I acknowledge that the ACT and the Northern Territory are in a slightly different constitutional position to the states. The rights of the states to exercise certain powers are enshrined in the federal Constitution, whereas the rights of territories are defined under legislation which itself is passed by the federal parliament. But I would say that, generally speaking, we should move to a situation where we equate as much as possible the right of territory governments to legislate within the areas assigned to them under that federal legislation as freely as is possible within the values, the traditions and the constitutional conventions that apply in Australian political life to state governments.
Having stated that principle and having stated that sometimes we need to compromise on it, I state very clearly my view that I think in this particular case Senator Brown’s legislation takes too far the principle that the territory government ought to exercise this power untrammelled by intervention from the federal government in this way—that is, that, as a reaction to the case of the federal government overriding the ACT with respect to civil unions legislation, it is not appropriate to throw the baby out with the bathwater and exclude any circumstances where the executive can exercise such a power against the ACT government.
I do not think that is sustainable. I do not think that position is consistent with a balanced view of what the federal government and/or the federal parliament may need to do with respect to administration of this territory and the protection, in its role in the federal territory, of the national interest. I make it clear that a key issue here is that the federal executive’s power to make a regulation with respect to acts of the ACT parliament under section 35 of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 does not exclude or prevent parliamentary involvement in that decision. It does not prevent either house of this parliament from debating, and if necessary overturning, the exercise of that power by the federal executive.
Indeed, after the legislation of the ACT was overridden by an executive instrument of the Governor-General after taking advice from the executive, there was a motion of disallowance moved on the floor of the Senate. The motion attracted considerable interest. I am on the record as having supported that motion of disallowance. But the fact remains that parliament had its say. It was able to debate the issue. Had the numbers been different, it could have overturned the decision made by the executive.
The issue that Senator Brown is raising here is not so much about whether there is a role for parliament in these decisions but at what point in the process the role falls. I would not for one instance suggest that parliament should not have the right to consider this issue and decide it did not agree with an exercise of power, but I am not sure I can agree with Senator Brown in saying that in all circumstances the executive should not be able to act, particularly if there was a matter of national interest at stake, because we do not exclude the role of parliament in that process.
Senator Brown made reference to the dams case in 1983 and pointed out that the High Court upheld the power of the federal government to intervene in Tasmania’s affairs and overturn its scheme to dam the Franklin River. That is the case, but it is also the case that constitutionally—and there is no doubt here—the federal government can exercise power over the workings of the ACT Legislative Assembly on such matters.
—The federal parliament.
—The federal executive clearly has that power.
—No; it says ‘parliament’ in the Constitution.
—Senator Brown wants us to affirm that it is only the federal parliament. He would be arguing that it is both chambers of parliament. Senator Brown is arguing that only the parliament should exercise that power. I acknowledge that is what he wants, but there is nothing to stop the federal parliament from passing laws which delegate that power to the federal executive. Indeed, that is precisely what the federal parliament has done. In 1988, when it passed the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act, it delegated to the federal executive, under section 35, the power to disallow ACT enactments in whole or in part or to even recommend amendments to the Legislative Assembly to legislation that it might pass. So it does have that power. That is outlined in the act which the federal parliament has passed. It is a well-understood constitutional principle that if the Constitution grants a power to the federal parliament it has the capacity to delegate that power, and it has done so in this case. If Senator Brown believes that there is a constitutional argument against section 35 of the self-government act being invalid, I would be interested in hearing it, but he did not make that case in his presentation speech.
—I am arguing that you should take back that executive power.
—You want to take it back, but it has not been given illegally in the first place. It has been legally granted. It is within the power and the competence of the parliament to say, ‘We will delegate this power to the executive of the Commonwealth to overrule legislation.’ That is my argument anyway. If Senator Brown has a different argument I would love to hear it. When Senator Brown talks about the arrogance of government in exercising such powers, I have to say to him that it really is a matter of what you believe about the way in which that power is exercised. If he believes it is arrogant to override a territory parliament in these circumstances, I have to say to him that I think it was arrogant of the Hawke government to override the Tasmanian parliament in those circumstances.
—It was abiding by international law.
—It is a question of what attitude you bring to the decision, isn’t it, Senator? If you are overriding another government in an area where they have legislative competence—and there is no doubt that in that case they did; they had the power to build those dams—and you agree with their decision, you are acting in the national interest in accordance with international treaties; but, if you do not agree, you are being arrogant. It is a matter of your perspective, I think.
—No. You would have breached international law not to have done that.
 (Senator Marshall)—Order! It is time that remarks were addressed through the chair.
—I will do that, Mr Acting Deputy President. Senator Brown said that he had not approached me to discuss this legislation, despite my obvious tendency towards considering it favourably, based on my voting record, because he believed that it was me who should have consulted with him, not the other way round, and that I should be listening to the people of the ACT. I want to place it on the record that, since this legislation was introduced back in June, nobody in the ACT community has approached me, other than journalists, to express any view about the matter.
—It’s your job!
—I make a point of asking people what they think about these issues. I have approached plenty of people to ask them what they think about this, but the point I make is that nobody has come to me and said, ‘You ought to support Senator Brown’s legislation.’ I note that the ACT government, which was very happy to lobby me on the disallowance motion, has not bothered to express a view about this one way or the other. No doubt if I ask them they will tell me they support it, but I meet with members of the government regularly and there has been no indication of any view whatsoever on this legislation.
The fact is that I do not think this is a matter that greatly agitates the people of the ACT. Senator Lundy might report that she has had deputations, emails and letters on the subject, but I would be very surprised if she truthfully told us that that was the case. Frankly, I am very wary about adopting anything that the Greens put to me in the first place. I recall during the disallowance debate on the civil unions that I was urged earnestly by Senator Brown in the debate to support him. He particularly pointed me out and said, ‘You should do this, Senator Humphries; you should support this disallowance motion.’ I did and was promptly attacked by the ACT Greens for taking that position. They immediately doubted my sincerity and bona fides in taking the decision. So Senator Brown can understand why I am a bit hesitant to take his advice on this occasion. I wonder what sort of trap I am being led into by the Greens in such circumstances. I look forward to being assured that I am not, but he will understand that I am a little wary of the promises he makes.
Both Senator Brown and Senator Carr have repeatedly referred in this debate to the civil unions episode as justification for this course of action, but I believe that what they are doing is overreacting to that situation and that they are phlegmatically responding to that incident without thinking through the consequences of what they propose. What they propose is to exclude the possibility that in the national interest it might be appropriate for the federal government to exercise a power over a government and a parliament that it itself created through its own enactment. It is the child of the federal parliament, do not forget. I cannot foresee many circumstances where this would happen; I also cannot exclude the possibility that it could. If it were in the national interest, on a national security issue, for example, it could be appropriate in those circumstances. We ought not to exclude the capacity of the executive to act in accordance with section 35, particularly given that we have the safeguard or protection that the decision of the executive can be, and almost certainly would be, reviewed by the federal parliament in a debate of the kind we had not long ago.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY (SELF-GOVERNMENT) AMENDMENT (DISALLOWANCE POWER OF THE COMMONWEALTH) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,34,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2006-09-14,"—I welcome the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment (Disallowance Power of the Commonwealth) Bill 2006, the amendment to the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 that is being proposed here today. As you have heard from my colleague Senator Carr, Labor will be supporting it. This amendment would remove the Governor-General’s power under the ACT (Self-Government) Act to disallow ACT laws.
I recognise the Commonwealth parliament’s power to make laws for the Australian territories pursuant to section 52 and section 122 of the Constitution. However, I seriously challenge the legitimacy of a law that allows for parliament or the executive to override the laws of a democratically elected territory government. This proposed amendment would abolish the power of the Commonwealth to disallow any act of the ACT government, thus ending this unsatisfactory and undemocratic state of affairs.
Section 35 of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government Act) enables the Commonwealth to disallow otherwise legitimate ACT laws. Section 35 of this act has only ever been used once. It was used in June this year to overturn ACT laws relating to civil unions. The government’s use of section 35 of the self-government act was unprecedented and an unwarranted interference in the governance of the ACT, and it should never be allowed to happen again. This bill, if successful, will make sure it will not.
The ACT government was duly elected by the people of the ACT. The elected government had promised the ACT community that it would introduce laws recognising same-sex relationships if elected and sought to deliver on that promise. Chief Minister Jon Stanhope led the Labor team into majority government in 2004 for the first time since self-government, which was quite an achievement, and one of the Labor commitments, as I said, was to introduce the law that recognised same-sex relationships.
Under public pressure as to his stance on this issue, ACT Liberal Senator Humphries admitted to the Canberra Times on Friday, 16 June 2006 that:
I acknowledge that Jon Stanhope won a clear majority in the 2004 election ... I also acknowledge that Jon Stanhope went to the election with an explicit promise to legislate to recognise in law relationships between people of the same sex and to remove legal discrimination against gay and lesbian Territorians.
Senator Humphries then continued on to say that the obvious ‘democratic process’ would be to allow the ACT government to deliver on its election promise—a democratic process his Liberal colleagues in the Howard government clearly failed to respect and follow. Consistent with its election commitment, the ACT government held extensive consultations on how to proceed with introducing laws to recognise same-sex relationships. The outcome of these consultations was the Civil Unions Bill, a bill that enjoyed extensive community support.
The Howard government’s use of section 35 of the ACT (Self-Government) Act to overturn the Civil Unions Act was a triumph of the Howard government’s arrogant disregard for established democratic processes. They did it because they could. They used their majority plus the Family First senator, which meant that the vote of Senator Humphries was unable to change the outcome—and I do acknowledge that Senator Humphries crossed the floor on that occasion.
The Commonwealth executive—in this case, the Howard cabinet or, for that matter, the Governor-General—cannot pretend to represent the views of the people of the Australian Capital Territory. They have no right to use this power to substitute their views for the elected representatives of the people of the Territory. It was particularly offensive that the Howard government used the representative of the British monarchy in Australia to do the overriding of ACT law. It harked back to colonial times when an autocratic approach was used to govern allegedly wayward new colonies. It was highly condescending and completely inappropriate. It was also a triumph for the Prime Minister’s offensive and extreme ideology. I make the critically important point that the ACT Civil Unions Act did not infringe on the Commonwealth’s exclusive legislative rights over marriage, nor did the ACT bill conflict with existing Commonwealth legislation relating to marriage.
Many people will remember that the Prime Minister was desperate to say this was not so. He repeatedly asserted that there was some crossover or conflict but, when pushed on this point, he could produce no evidence because, in fact, none existed. It was, in my opinion, homophobia, front and centre. I will continue to support the ACT government’s attempt to formally recognise same-sex relationships in the ACT. It should have happened then. It should still be in place. It is important in principle and in practical application. It is very important to the community as a whole.
The ACT Civil Unions Act intended to ensure that everyone received equal treatment under ACT law. The act would have allowed a couple to establish a domestic partnership by making a formal declaration of their intention to do so. The act was non-discriminatory in that anybody could have accessed a civil union in the ACT regardless of gender. In contrast, the federal government’s, the Howard government’s, refusal to formally recognise same-sex couples is blatantly discriminatory.
The ACT Civil Unions Act clearly intended to stamp out the discriminatory treatment of same-sex couples under ACT law, and was entirely consistent with the obligations under the ACT Human Rights Act. The ACT Civil Unions Bill 2006 showed the ACT Labor government’s commitment to ensuring that everyone has the respect and dignity that they are entitled to and deserve—that is, a commitment to protecting everyone’s right to participate in society and to receive the full protection of the law regardless of their gender or chosen partner. All these aspirations have been undermined by the Howard government.
I would now like to make some comments with respect to the treatment of the ACT as a territory under the Constitution compared with the states. If the ACT were a state rather than a territory, the Commonwealth government could not have overturned this important new law, as is evident by the Tasmanian Relationship Act. The fact that this could not have happened to a state is further evidence that the government was ideologically driven to overturn this important and practical legislation rather than letting it stay in place.
Perhaps one of the most disappointing aspects of this matter is the Howard government’s complete unwillingness to talk with the ACT government. I am disappointed that the Howard government refused to engage with ACT representatives and find a constructive solution. They could have discussed what they found so offensive about the act. They could have discussed how the ACT law fitted in with Commonwealth laws and perhaps amendments could have been made so that the majority of the bill could have come into effect
Finally, I formally call on my ACT Senate colleague, Senator Humphries, to support this amendment bill. I heard his contribution in the chamber today and I was very interested to hear his opinion on this important amendment. I would like to remind the Senate that Senator Humphries did cross the floor in June to vote for the disallowance motion that would have allowed the territory law to prevail. I would also like to remind the Senate of Senator Humphries’s comments to the Canberra Times on Friday, 16 June, 2006:
Here the democratic process—which of course was conferred on the ACT 17 years ago by this Parliament—provides a clear formula for what happens next: the ACT Government is entitled to pass laws, in an area of its legislative competence, to effect an explicit promise made to the ACT community.
Senator Humphries says he is a federalist. He waxes lyrical about its virtues and the limitations he thinks appropriate on a centralist approach to government, but the bottom line is that his support for federalism stops short of curtailing the long arm of centralism being used by his government colleagues to deny democracy in the ACT. He now extols the virtues of what he calls ‘necessary limits.’ Senator Humphries even resorted to the example about the antiterrorism legislation as an example where the ACT government ought not to be trusted and ought to be overridden—a double standard if ever I have seen one. A double standard that shows Senator Humphries is far less concerned with principle and far more concerned with the politics, in this case the politics of fear and the politics of the threat of terror attack as was espoused during that particular debate.
Finally, as I think several senators have acknowledged, Senator Humphries could easily resolve to support this bill and the federal parliament would always retain its capacity to legislate with respect to the territories as per the constitutional power. We all know that, so why does he squib on this bill? There is only one answer: he lacks principle on this matter.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY (SELF-GOVERNMENT) AMENDMENT (DISALLOWANCE POWER OF THE COMMONWEALTH) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,34,1
"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2006-09-14,"—Time and time again since I have been here I have said to remind myself, lest I forget, what a great honour it is to be in this place, the Australian Senate, where I try to represent the conservative views of decent, hardworking, mainstream Australians. Today, I have looked at the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment (Disallowance Power of the Commonwealth) Bill 2006, brought to the Senate by Tasmanian Senator Bob Brown and wondered, ‘Who is right—Senator Brown with his distinctly different lifestyle or me?’
This bill of Senator Brown’s for an act to abolish the power of the Commonwealth executive government to have the constitutional power to disallow any act of the Legislative Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory, and for related purposes—I look forward to returning to that phrase ‘and for related purposes’ in a moment—this bill by the different Greens, calls for the disallowance of the self government act’s provision for the parliament or the executive, in this case the Governor-General of Australia, to disallow any act of the ACT’s Legislative Assembly. Everyone knows that. This bill of Senator Brown’s seeks to remove that fundamental power of the executive of the federal government, a power integral to a Westminster system involving federal, state and territory systems. Section 122 of the Australian Constitution provides the Commonwealth with law-making powers over the territories. Specifically, section 122 reads:
The Parliament may make laws for the government of any territory surrendered by any State to and accepted by the Commonwealth, or of any territory placed by the Queen under the authority of and accepted by the Commonwealth, or otherwise acquired by the Commonwealth, and may allow the representation of such territory in either House of the Parliament to the extent and on the terms which it thinks fit.
What does this section of the Australian Constitution mean in terms of this bill? It means, without any ambiguity, that the Australian government or its executive, the Governor-General in this case, as I have said, has the power to override any legislation made by that territory that is not in the national interest.
The power to override, or disallow, legislation enacted by territory governments is subject to approval by the Governor-General and may also be disallowed by the Australian parliament which was alluded to by my colleague Senator Humphries. Also, I would point out that Section 35 of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988, which was also alluded to by Senator Lundy—an act with its genesis in this place—provides that the Governor-General may, within six months of an ACT enactment being made, disallow ACT enactments in whole or in part or recommend amendments to the relevant act to the ACT Legislative Assembly.
The Australian government does not generally intervene in the process of our democratic, self-governing, albeit limited, territories. In fact, this disallowance power has been exercised only once. I think Senator Lundy may have mentioned that also. It was disallowed by the executive concerning the Australian Capital Territory’s short history, and it is the single instance of the enactment of this disallowance power that has apparently so incensed Senator Brown that he wishes to have these powers completely removed from the executive.
What is this bee in the senator’s bonnet and to what exactly does ‘and related purposes’ refer? It was the disallowance of the Australian Capital Territory’s controversial civil unions legislation that was to give statutory recognition to same sex couples. The disallowance power that was used in respect of this legislation occurred on 13 June this year. Senator Brown did not agree with the exercise of these constitutionally supported disallowance powers, so this bill seeks to remove those powers as bestowed on the Governor-General by both the Australian Constitution and the ACT (Self-Government) Act 1998. Senator Brown’s bill would therefore require that the Australian government draft legislation to override inappropriate ACT law, the bill would then be debated through the parliament and it would be subjected to the normal parliamentary processes. The subsequent development of such a bill could take well in excess of the current six-month period that is currently available under the time limitation to disallow ACT enacted legislation.
The use of the section 35 powers of the ACT (Self-Government) Act is quick and relatively simple, particularly when compared to the process of passing a bill through this parliament, and disallowance must take place within six months as mandated in section 35. It is clear that the existing process of disallowance is more rapid, but Senator Brown wants to chuck out the existing workable laws that permit disallowance by the executive of unacceptable territory laws. He wants the Australian government to make new laws to override unacceptable territory laws. The appropriate laws already exist; Senator Brown just does not seem to like them. This afternoon we are in this chamber debating yet another Greens bill about introducing new laws to repeal other new laws, all because Senator Brown supports same-sex marriages. What a waste of the parliament’s time. Would it proceed to the lower house? I doubt it—there are too many decent people in this chamber for it to do so. I have no doubt about that. I have to wonder what this has to do with representing and upholding the values of hard-working, mainstream, decent Australians.
Senator Brown’s second reading speech refers to the quarter of a million ACT voters, which was actually only 227,000-odd in the 2004 election. Then again, Senator Brown was recently outed as being a little lax on accurate reporting of actual figures; $20,000-odd is neither here nor there, is it, Senator Brown, in your reporting to senators’ interests. Senator Brown’s second reading speech refers to these electors as though they all voted in favour of the civil union legislation, or as if the number of voters in the ACT should somehow exempt its legislators from the constitutions under which they preside. What is the relevance of voter numbers in the ACT 2004 elections? Why not look at the total population of the ACT, which incidentally is 326,700 compared to Western Australia’s more than two million; or the total kilometres of roads in the ACT, which is 2,645 compared to Western Australia’s nearly 150,000; or the number of people using public transport on a daily basis in the ACT, which is 7,500 compared to 25,000 in Western Australia; or the ACT’s 24,800 university students across its four major campuses—and they are good campuses; or something really worthy of the interest of this chamber: the number of hospital beds available in the ACT’s two public hospitals, which are only 1,068, making availability of hospital beds in the ACT the lowest of any state or territory in Australia?
Let us not be side-tracked with figures and issues that are of no interest to Senator Brown. Let us refocus on what is important to Senator Brown—the fact that the ACT’s same-sex marriage legislation was subjected to constitutional disallowance powers. How awful that constitutional powers should have been used in this fashion. What a lot of rubbish. Senator Brown conveniently forgets or totally disregards that, subsequent to the disallowance of the ACT legislation, a bid was made in the Senate on 15 June this year. It was moved, incidentally, by Senator Brown’s colleague Senator Nettle and Senators Stott Despoja and Ludwig. It was a bid to overturn the disallowance and it failed. It failed then and it will fail if and when it is put to the test this afternoon. This failed bid in the Senate is proof that Senator Brown’s proposal to remove certain powers of the Governor-General and site that power within parliament is nothing more than another attempt to grandstand and to waste the time of this chamber and the money of Australian taxpayers. The best thing that could happen is this place is for someone to undertake a survey of the time wasted by the fatuous motions of the Greens.
That aside, Senator Brown already knows what the outcome would have been had the parliament been the sole arbiter of that particular disallowance. There is nothing at all to indicate that any future decision made under the same processes would have a different outcome were it instead subjected to the scrutiny of the parliament. No—the outcome would be the same. Senator Brown would have ample opportunity to procrastinate, posture and pontificate. However, the problems that could be created during the interim—bearing in mind that this process would have to be accomplished within the prescribed six months of enactment of legislation—are immense. Currently, inappropriate legislation can be overridden in a relatively short time simply using constitutionally mandated processes. Why on earth would we want to wait six months?
Really, one would have thought that Senator Brown had better things to do and that the ACT was capable of looking after its own interests, particularly given that the ACT Legislative Assembly, on average, has one elected representative for every 19,000 residents. Presumably Senator Brown feels some sort of empathy with this statistic given that Tasmania is very similar, with one legislative assembly representative for every 19,488 electors. Each of our lower house folk back in Western Australia struggle along representing nearly 36,000 residents. I know you find these statistics riveting, Acting Deputy President Marshall. Presumably those elected representatives are kept busy with matters of greater importance than the failed legislation that brought about this fatuous bill of Senator Brown’s.
The ACT is not Chief Minister Jon Stanhope’s sole bailiwick, nor is it the sole bailiwick of his fellow Labor members. The ACT is not Monaco to France; it is not Lichtenstein to Switzerland. The ACT is an integral part of the Commonwealth of Australia and as such it is subject—and should be—to the Commonwealth laws and the Commonwealth veto.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY (SELF-GOVERNMENT) AMENDMENT (DISALLOWANCE POWER OF THE COMMONWEALTH) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,34,1
"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2006-09-14,"—I, too, join this Thursday afternoon general business debate. I have always thought that this period of the parliament, at the end of the week, is a real dead rubber period. It is not broadcast. No vote is ever taken on this. No divisions are ever allowed, according to standards orders. We know that out there—outside this chamber—there is a dash for the airport going on at this very moment.
Having been a whip in the past I know how hard it is to get people to speak in the afternoon of a Thursday. This period is a real indulgence of the opposition and the minor parties. I notice that even they do not take much advantage of it because most of the motions are Senator Carr’s. They always give Senator Carr a big say on Thursday afternoons because, I guess, he never wants to go home to his own state of Victoria; he is so notoriously known in his state.
Senator Lundy is always here on a Thursday afternoon. She will speak on anything, let alone move her own motions. I should say that while this is an opportunity for the opposition to move motions, debate and speak, I notice that the real heavy hitters—like Senator Conroy, Senator Ludwig and the like—are never here to debate anything on a Thursday afternoon.
So it is very much a dead rubber. But could it be any deader than today? Could a Thursday’s general business be any deader than today’s? This is one of the weakest speaking lists—
—So why are you here? What does that tell us about you?
—I am always here. Quite frankly, Senator Lundy, I am always here on Thursday afternoon. Senator Trood is going to speak after me—
 (Senator Marshall)—Senator McGauran, please address your remarks through the chair. I will take this opportunity to remind you of the question before the chair.
—Yes, indeed, Acting Deputy President. I have a lot to say about the motion of Senator Brown. But the point has to be made that even Senator Brown, whom we all know never misses an opportunity to speak in this chamber, let alone to his full limit, could not even do his 20 minutes. It is a rare occasion when Senator Brown does not take his—
—I rise on a point of order. Will Senator McGauran get back to the relevance of the order of the day that we are debating instead of just waffling on?
—Senator McGauran, I remind you of the question before the chair.
—I will be reading the question before the chair. For the benefit of those on the other side of the chamber, what I am trying to establish here is that the weight and importance being placed on this motion is minimal. It really is not as important as the strutting of Senator Brown would have us believe. That is the point I am trying to make. The government have supplied five of the eight speakers. This is the weakest speaking list I have ever seen for general business.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—It is not just the three that they have supplied. Senator Bartlett, who speaks on documents, has not even come in.
—Senator McGauran, please, I would rather you did not stand up and point across the chamber. I ask you to direct your comments through the chair. I ask other senators to cease interjecting.
—With respect to you, Acting Deputy President Marshall, as the chair, with respect to the standing orders of the parliament on relevancy and with respect to the parliament and the Senate, I will attempt to take this matter seriously.

Senator Sterle interjecting—

—Yes, I will try to take this matter seriously. It is difficult but I will attempt. Senator Ludwig, it really surprises me that you are not on an aeroplane out of here. One of the more important members of the parliament—
—Senator McGauran, I have now asked you three times to address your remarks through the chair. I ask you to do that.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I have been following this debate for some time but I wish to take a point of order in respect of Senator McGauran. Senator McGauran knows better than to use the language and to make the inferences that he has been making this afternoon. I ask Senator McGauran that if he was making accusations about people’s presence or otherwise he withdraws them.
—I rise on a further point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. My first point is that Senator Ludwig knows that he should not address Senator McGauran across the chamber like that. My second point is that I have listened to the debate and I have heard nothing that is of an unparliamentary nature that Senator McGauran has used in his contribution here this afternoon.
—Further to my point of order, and on that point of order, I ask, Mr Acting Deputy President, that if you think there is an issue to be taken, the transcript of the proceedings be reflected upon by the President. Senator McGauran can always, in due course, if the President so rules, deal with it accordingly. If there is no point of order in respect of that, and if there is no matter apparent in the transcript, then I accept Senator Lightfoot’s contribution.
—In order to steer a way forward, I will remind Senator McGauran of the standing orders, in particular standing order 193, with respect to the rules of debate, and particularly paragraph (3), about reflecting on other senators. I will simply at this point remind you of that, but I do ask you again to address your remarks through the chair and consider the standing order that I have referred to.
—I will read out the object of Senator Brown’s bill before the Senate. It reads:
The objects of this Act are to—
—We know what it says!
—Order!
—Well, here I am, Mr Acting Deputy President, trying to read what is—
—Yes, Senator McGauran, and I was calling the interjecting senators to order. If you would please let me manage the chamber, I will attempt to do so, if you would cooperate with that. I would ask other senators to cease interjecting.
—The bill reads:
In a nutshell, it is—
—One minute!
—Just get on with it! You really are struggling.
—Senator McGauran, you are able to ignore the interjections.
—I have read religiously from Senator Brown’s bill. I read word for word its object and all I get is interjections on that alone. I am struggling with all the interjections that are being thrown across the chamber. I have plenty to say on constitutional matters and precedents about this particular bill. I just cannot seem to get past page 1, because Senator Sterle, who happens to be off duty now—you are off duty as whip—is hanging around just to annoy me on this particular bill. Mr Acting Deputy President, I will plough on, through you.
—I would be most grateful.
—The essence of the object of this bill is to strip the federal government, and indeed the parliament, of the right to override territory laws. I would be right in saying that, wouldn’t I?
—No, you’re wrong.
—I am all-inclusive in this particular debate this afternoon, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President. I seek to take it seriously. So the first point I wish to make, having read the objects of the bill, is that the federal government, indeed the Australian parliament, has the constitutional power to make laws to govern the territories—that is, the Northern Territory and the ACT. That is under section 122 of the Constitution, which is in everyone’s drawer in the parliament here. I will read it in full. I know the previous speaker did also, but it is worthy of repeating because it is black and white constitutional law. Sometimes in this Constitution there are parts open to interpretation. We know that only too well. People make their careers on constitutional laws. The High Court often makes good or bad decisions with regard to their interpretations of constitutional law, but nothing could be more black and white than section 122 on this particular matter. I will read it:
122. The Parliament may make laws for the government of any territory surrendered by any State to and accepted by the Commonwealth, or of any territory placed by the Queen under the authority of and accepted by the Commonwealth, or otherwise acquired by the Commonwealth, and may allow the representation of such territory in either House of the Parliament to the extent and on the terms which it thinks fit.
Backing up this section of the Constitution, of course, are sections 51(xxi) and 51(xxii), which state:
51. The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to:—
                  …           …         …
(xxi)    marriage;
(xxii) divorce and matrimonial causes; and in relation thereto, parental rights, and the custody and guardianship of infants …
Again, this law, section 51, has been tested in the High Court and the Commonwealth has been supported in its acts. By the way—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—while we are on section 51, Senator Brown in his address and the other speakers failed to mention the precedents set relating to section 51. They have been twice tested and twice passed by the High Court. The first example was the Franklin dam issue, where the government used its external powers under section 51(xxix) to override the state of Tasmania.
The second time that section was used was when we were in opposition, under the Hawke government again. So the Hawke government used this section of the Constitution twice—first on the Franklin River dam issue and, second, on the Tasmanian gay rights issue. On both occasions they overrode laws of Tasmania, which is the state that Senator Brown comes from. He did not mention either precedent in his address, most of all the gay rights issue. In about 1993 or 1994, I think, it was an issue in this parliament. So he does not mind when the issue suits him—

Senator Sterle interjecting—


Senator Santoro interjecting—

—I apologise, Senator Santoro, if I am becoming a little passionate about this issue that, when I opened it up, I thought was as dull as dishwater and most unnecessary. I suddenly realised there is a lot of inconsistency, if not hypocrisy, in this particular issue. Why didn’t Senator Brown mention the gay rights debate and the vote we had in this parliament, where the Labor Party government and Prime Minister Hawke overrode the laws of the state of Tasmania with regard to gay rights? I will tell you why: because it suited him not to, and that is what this debate is all about. The other side know that this parliament or the executive government has the right to override the states on certain issues, as it does the territories—more so the territories, of course.
—And you support that.
—Yes, I do—to the hilt.
 (Senator Marshall)—Senator McGauran, please ignore the interjections.
—They know they have the constitutional rights but they only want to use them when it suits them. I have just read out what is black and white constitutional law. It is no doubt one for the constitutional lawyers, it always is, but I would venture to say that if Senator Brown’s bill was ever tested—if it ever so much as made it to the High Court—I think it would be deemed unconstitutional. You cannot pass legislation through here that overrides the Constitution. It is tested in the High Court—just as we have at the moment with the industrial relations laws being tested by the states in the High Court. This is another matter which the other side failed to mention. You can test legislation which goes through this parliament in the High Court.
If I may be helpful to Senator Brown on this issue, if he wants to achieve his end then he would need to initiate a referendum. The whole thing is hypothetical and ridiculous, but let us just assume that he seeks to achieve his end and the only way to do it is by referendum. He would require a majority of the people to support him in this referendum. I know that that is something that Senator Brown and the Greens are not versed in—seeking a majority of the people for anything at all. He knows this only too well and that is why he would never test it. He always avoids the hard question in regard to referendums because referendums simply do not have a good record in this country at all. We know that since Federation there have been some 44 referendums and only eight have been successful. We know that the last referendum held in this country in regard to a republic failed miserably. The last time a referendum was held during a Labor government was in the bicentennial year when some four referendums were put up at the general election in 1990. They all went down in a screaming heap. So referendums do not have a good record. It is simply not in the national interest that this ever go to a referendum. The people would wonder why you would put such a lightweight issue up to a referendum anyway.
Another avenue for the Greens would be to create a state—the state of Canberra or the state of the Northern Territory. We know that many people in the Northern Territory for many years have sought to turn the Northern Territory into a state. If it were a state, they would have greater freedom to make their own state based laws. But of course we know that in the Northern Territory when they held a referendum—it was actually more like a plebiscite—in 1998 where they expected there to be a landslide of support for the Northern Territory to become a state they got a real shock. The majority of the people rejected the referendum to have the Northern Territory become a state. I would venture to say that if you tried the same thing in the ACT you would get an even more overwhelming rejection of any such proposition.
In the ACT they live a very comfortable life, some would say even a ‘Tattslotto style lifestyle’, and they would be very loath to separate themselves from mother’s milk. When they look up from their homes in Forrest or wherever and see the parliament on the hill, they feel very comfortable. They feel very comfortable that the federal government, sitting on the hill looking down on their most junior of parliaments, as a last resort, have the authority to override—let alone the prestige that they see in us all; I do not single myself out, I stress, in that. So, Senator Brown, I have attempted to bring some common sense and some reality to your bill—to try and bring it some grounding. You can see that it has no grounding at all. Whatever avenue you take, the best shot you have is a Thursday afternoon broadcast. The truth of the matter is—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I remind the honourable senator to address his remarks through the chair.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise to speak on the point of order. That is no point of order. It is not up to Senator Sterle to direct you to direct Senator McGauran to address his remarks through the chair. If you wish to do that, Sir, that is your prerogative.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise to speak on the point of order. Clearly Senator Sterle was raising the point of order that Senator McGauran was not addressing his remarks through the chair. Senator Lightfoot may wish to be pedantic about the terminology used but I think the intent of the point of order was manifestly clear and I would ask you to draw Senator McGauran’s attention to it.
 (Senator Barnett)—I draw the attention of all members of the Senate to the standing orders.
—One feature of my address to the Senate, before I get back to the substance of it, is that I notice that Senator Sterle was off duty some 15 minutes ago or thereabouts but has decided to stay on, to listen to my contribution to this debate, to interject, and to become very stimulated by it. I am very pleased to say that we have finally got Senator Sterle to do an extra shift—a bit of overtime and a bit of work. I think the other side ought to give me a medal for that because they know that they have to drag him into this chamber at any time to do any sort of work because he is an old unionist who has never known the real substance of work—
—Oh, pull your head in, you pompous—
—Order! Senator McGauran, I would ask you to address your remarks through the chair.
—On a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President: Senator Sterle made an unparliamentary remark. I would ask that you direct him to withdraw that unparliamentary remark.
—I did not hear an unparliamentary remark. I would ask Senator McGauran to continue his remarks.
—Further to that point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President, would you consider reviewing Hansard and, if that remark made it this time and was unparliamentary, directing Senator Sterle at another time to withdraw the remark?
—Absolutely. I am happy to review the Hansard and, if there is anything unparliamentary, we will deal with it in the appropriate manner.
—This has been a fiery debate, and for no reason at all. We have to put everything in perspective about the debate we have before the chamber at the moment. First of all, this is the Australian parliament. More people vote for this parliament than for any other in this country. Let us put in perspective what we are talking about with the ACT—and we should bring the Northern Territory in on this too. The Northern Territory has a parliament of some 25 members, each representing between 4,000 and 5,000 electors. It has a population of around 205,000 people. The ACT has a little more in population—about 325,000 people. It has an assembly of 17 members.
Let us put this perspective. Which parliament has the greater national interest at heart? I think on every occasion it would be seen to be this parliament. Yet, sparingly, and with judgement and with the national interest in mind, we have acted on only two occasions that I recall since we have been in government for some 10 years. The first one was, of course, in relation to the Euthanasia Laws Bill, as far back as 1996, where we overturned the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act. Recently, of course, it was in relation to the Australian Capital Territory’s Civil Unions Act.
On the issue of the Northern Territory euthanasia bill, I would like to read what I said in my address—given the time, I will be ever so brief—about why I considered we should have overruled that act and why it was in the national interest. I said:
The insidious Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, which is the first in the world, operates on new tenets for our society—tenets of hopelessness and neglect as distinct from hope and care. There is something very chilling about a health system that normalises the act of suicide for those aged 18 years and over. That is what our society will be doing if it accepts the Northern Territory euthanasia act because, once we normalise the state of hopelessness, we will accept the broader concept of suicide. After all, suicide is only ever chosen when the state of utter hopelessness is reached.
I would have thought that everyone in this chamber would have thought the debate on euthanasia was of national interest and that the Northern Territory had not legislated just for their boundaries; it would be an act which was influential morally and socially throughout Australia. We ought to have intervened, and we did.
Equally, on the Australian Capital Territory’s civil unions legislation, I would like to quickly quote Senator Minchin, who sits here in front of me, but I am not going to have time. But I would recommend to anyone that they read his speech in regard to the reasons we sought, on these rare occasions, to overturn the ACT legislation—after much consultation, I should add. I urge the Senate to utterly reject this bill. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY (SELF-GOVERNMENT) AMENDMENT (DISALLOWANCE POWER OF THE COMMONWEALTH) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,34,1
"Trood, Sen Russell",LP,2006-09-14,"—It is a delightful opportunity to be able to speak on this matter. Senator McGauran, my colleague from Victoria, has drawn attention to the lateness in this sitting period. It is late on Thursday afternoon. Any bill which says, in the explanatory notes, that it is ‘a bill for an act to abolish the power of the Commonwealth’s executive government to disallow any act of the Legislative Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory and for related purposes’ seems at least on the face of it to be a matter of some significance, some importance and in fact some might even say profound importance, since it would seem to touch the power of the Commonwealth in relation to one of its territories.
But I think we all know that this is a rather tawdry exercise by Senator Brown on behalf of the Greens. It is an exercise in trying to harvest populist votes from the good citizens of the Australian Capital Territory and to try to expand the Greens’ domain, if you will, in the territory. It is an effort to try to appeal to the people of the Australian Capital Territory on a matter which is hardly of core importance to the Greens. I have not had the opportunity to look at this in the time I have had available to prepare my remarks in this debate, but I would be very surprised if one of the core platforms of the Greens is that it wishes to extend democratic rights, as they might be described, for the good citizens of the Australian Capital Territory. Rather, this seems to me to be something of a spasm response to the Greens’ disappointment with the fact that the government earlier in the year made a regulation disallowing the legislation with respect to civil unions in the Australian Capital Territory.
In relation to that particular piece of legislation, the parliament took the view—and rightly, in my view—that marriage should not be redefined in the way in which the piece of legislation from the ACT legislature proposed. I still think that that was a correct decision. But that is the past, and I do not want to revisit that matter again this evening. There are other, and rather important, things to examine.
Indeed, there has been a great deal of fallout from that piece of legislation and it is manifest in the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment (Disallowance Power of the Commonwealth) Bill 2006, which is before the chamber this evening. It is a short bill. In fact, it is a disarmingly short bill with respect to the impact it may have on the constitutional arrangements of the Commonwealth. Essentially, it seeks to remove the Commonwealth’s power to override legislation in the ACT legislature. It is deceptive because we are engaged in a rather simple proposition here but, in my view, it seeks to unravel a very important—perhaps even profound—constitutional compact that exists between the Commonwealth and one of its component parts, which of course is the Australian Capital Territory.
In the time available to me, I want to take a little time of the Senate to explain, as I see it, the unravelling of this particular compact and what the consequences would be if this bill were to ever see the light of day—if it were ever to be passed by parliament—and I trust that will not come to pass. But, before I do that, I will just make a couple of quick observations about the bill. The first is, I think, a natural one and one made by other speakers in the debate, which is that the power we are talking about here is not one that is often used by the Commonwealth. In fact, one could say it is used sparingly. I have been in this place a relatively short period but, in the time I have been here, there has been only one occasion that I can recall when this particular power has been used. It is not as though this is something that the Commonwealth engages in every day of the week or every sitting session or on a particular, regular basis. It is a power which is used, and rightly so, infrequently when circumstances demand that it should be used. In that context, it is proposed that we should change a profound principle of constitutional practice for a power which is hardly ever used, and that does not seem to me to make a great deal of sense.
The second proposition I make is that the Australian Capital Territory legislature is of course a unicameral legislature. I come from Queensland, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, and Queensland has a single legislature. It is a unicameral legislature. The Legislative Council in Queensland was abolished in the early part of the 20th century, and I think citizens of Queensland have had cause to regret that abolition on numerous occasions since then. I am not an advocate of unicameral legislatures. They seem to me to be unsound, as a matter of constitutional principle and practice. I would hardly be someone who would be coming into this chamber to encourage the idea that yet another unicameral legislature should have the power to make decisions which would have ramifications way beyond what has been decided by the constitutional arrangements that currently exist.
The third proposition I make is a very simple one—and I think it has been made by some of my colleagues—which is: even if this bill were to be passed by some minor miracle of constitutional activity, it would have no effect because we would still be left with section 122 of the Constitution and the power that that gives the Commonwealth to make laws for the government of the territory. So we could engage in a long debate, we could spend hours of the parliament’s time trying to work our way through the elements of this particular piece of legislation and, in the end, it would come to nothing. It would all be nothing more than a great deal of constitutional hot air, because we would be back where we started. We would pass the bill and we would find ourselves confronted, as Senator Bob Brown must surely know, by the realities of section 122 of the Constitution, which of course gives that power to the Commonwealth. So, unless we were to change that particular clause in the Constitution, this bill would have absolutely no impact or import.
I will return to the matter of the constitutional design that I alluded to at the very start of my remarks. There are two clauses in the Constitution which are relevant to this particular matter. They have been cited by other senators in this debate. But they are important clauses, and I think it is important that one draws the parliament’s attention to them. The first clause is section 122 of the Constitution, which states:
The Parliament may make laws for the government of any territory surrendered by any State to and accepted by the Commonwealth …
It then goes on to make some other remarks about various aspects of the government of territories. The second clause which is of particular relevance is section 52 of the Constitution. It reads:
The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have exclusive power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to
(i.) The seat of government of the Commonwealth …
Here we have a very specific kind of constitutional design. We have an arrangement whereby the Constitution provides for the states to give up territories, should they voluntarily decide to do so, and in doing so the Constitution then gives power to the Commonwealth to make laws for ‘peace, order and good government’—a phrase that resonates in my own mind, from the days when I was at law school, and in the minds of most lawyers as one which relates to the exercise of Commonwealth power. Here we have a very specific and very clear arrangement on this particular matter and what is important is that the Australian Capital Territory is the Commonwealth’s seat of government.
Perhaps I can make, as an aside here, an observation which I think Senator Brown will no doubt find interesting about this matter, which is that the Constitution—and I give him the benefit of the doubt of being familiar with this particular provision—also gives power of representation in the federal parliament in relation to territories, and that particular right is contained within section 122 of the Constitution. And, of course, the Commonwealth has provided in relation to that particular power; it has provided the opportunity for two territories to have two senators sitting here and for members to take their places in the other place.
What is interesting about this particular power, what is, I think, noticeable about this power, in terms of comparative constitutional law, is that the United States, one of the great democracies on the planet and one often held up as being the exemplar of democracy, is a place where the territories do not have that right of representation in the federal parliament. So here we have, in relation to our own constitution, our own parliament, a right of representation for the territories. So they already have a particular democratic advantage, which is not given to people who reside in territories in the United States and in other places.
Let me return to my main theme, which is this compact that I alluded to. For a long period of time, the Commonwealth parliament was the parliament of the Australian Capital Territory. It made laws which were relevant to the people in the territory. It was the place where decisions were made about the direction and the future of the citizens of the capital territory and, for the most part, that was a reasonably happy arrangement.
Of course, it was decided in 1988 that this arrangement should be changed. The Hawke government obviously resolved that there should be a change in these matters and so we then had the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act, which provided for the folks of the Australian Capital Territory to have certain kinds of powers in relation to their own governance.
But this was a qualified self-government. These were not powers given to the Australian Capital Territory as being the same as the states’; these were not powers which were given to create sovereign states, of the nature of Queensland or Victoria or Tasmania or Western Australia or other states of the Commonwealth; these were essentially qualified powers. Very specifically, clearly, from the constitutional design, from the design of that particular act, they were qualified powers given to the territory legislature; essentially—and I do not mean to be ungenerous in making this remark—they were the kinds of powers that might be available to a local government, and I say this without wishing to offend the good citizens of the Australian Capital Territory.
And, of course, there was good reason for this. It was not just a coincidence that this occurred; it was not just a serendipitous use of powers; it was not just a casual part of a constitutional design. This particular decision, with regard to the powers of the ACT legislature—and this reflects the wider point that I was making earlier about the Commonwealth having the power to make legislation for the territories—was made in a purposeful way. It took a particular point of view. It was part of a specific intention.
The ACT is not just any territory of the Commonwealth. The Australian Capital Territory is not just any piece of geography on the Australian continent. It is the seat of the Australian government. It is the place from which the Commonwealth is governed and that gives it a unique quality. It gives it a unique character. And we know from the debates in relation to the formation of the Commonwealth, the constitutional debates of the 1890s, how fundamentally important this idea was to the founding fathers. We know, from reading the constitutional debates—with which, I am sure, Senator Brown is very familiar—how anxious they were to find a place somewhere between Sydney and Melbourne which could be appropriately identified as the seat of government.
Indeed, a specific provision was included in the Constitution on this particular issue. It is section 125 which alludes to this particular point, and section 125 says:
The seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be determined by the Parliament, and shall be within territory which shall have been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth, and shall be vested in and belong to the Commonwealth ...
The point is that the seat of government ‘shall be vested in and belong to the Commonwealth’. So it is very clear from the constitutional design: this was not just, as I said, happenstance; it was not just serendipitous; this was a specific part of the constitutional design of the founding fathers—that they wanted a place of government and they wanted it to be a unique place in the context of the Commonwealth. And, in reflection of that particular proposition, they made Canberra the seat of government and they made specific provision for it.
The logical constitutional consequence of that view was that the Commonwealth should have power in relation to the seat of government, as provided for in section 52 of the Constitution, because it recognised the unique nature of the territory and the unique significance within the Commonwealth of this particular part of the country.
The 1988 act in a way compromises that idea. It compromises that unique constitutional situation. It allows the Australian Capital Territory legislature to make laws for its citizens on a wide range of issues, as we all know—on housing matters, transport matters, social security, parks and various other things. It has the right to do that, and I do not have any reason to quarrel with that. I think there is no reason on God’s earth why that opportunity should not be given to the local legislature.
Indeed, the citizens of Canberra have many privileges from living in this part of the Commonwealth. I think we would all agree that Canberra is a most charming city, a place of rural disposition and, perhaps, urban pretension on occasions. It is a wonderful place to live, a great place to bring up a family. I enjoyed living here for five years myself during my earlier years. Citizens of the Australian Capital Territory have the benefit of many privileges. They have access to all the great national institutions of the country, to all the great public buildings, of which Parliament House is but one. But one thing they do not have is legislative sovereignty over their affairs.
Senator Brown is clearly troubled by this—not substantively, but, as I said at the very beginning of my remarks, for what I regard as rather tawdry political purposes. He sees this—presumably the Greens see this—as a stain on the fabric of Australian democracy. I do not. I see this as one of the very few costs that the citizens of the Australian Capital Territory must bear for living in this very privileged part of the Commonwealth, the seat of government, the place identified within the Constitution as being specifically designed to create a unique environment for the national parliament and for the administration and governance of the Commonwealth.

",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY (SELF-GOVERNMENT) AMENDMENT (DISALLOWANCE POWER OF THE COMMONWEALTH) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,34,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2006-09-14,"—I am delighted to enter this debate on the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment (Disallowance Power of the Commonwealth) Bill 2006. I support most of the arguments that my colleague from Queensland Senator Trood has very carefully and eloquently delivered to the chamber. I had a glance at Senator Brown’s second reading speech; I have to say that it goes down in history as quite the shortest speech that Senator Brown has ever made. It is strange that, when we are trying to get important government legislation through this parliament, we continually have not only long speeches from Senator Brown at the second reading stage—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. My second reading speech was delivered here in this senator’s absence. It was by no means the shortest speech; it was one to be listened to, and he ought to have been here to have heard it.
 (Senator Barnett)—There is no point of order.
—I have here what is said to be Senator Brown’s second reading speech, which is in Hansard and which comprises five paragraphs.
—You don’t understand the forms of this place.
—Is this not your speech, Senator Brown? Perhaps we should conduct an inquiry into who has fraudulently put in this speech as your second reading speech.
—It is your inability to understand the processes of the Senate on Thursday afternoons.
—Order! Senator Macdonald, please address your remarks through the chair.
—I am being attacked by Senator Brown in the course of my speech, and it has distracted me. Certainly, his speech was very short. When we are trying to get important legislation through the parliament, Senator Brown speaks not only for 20 minutes in the second reading debate but for the maximum allowable time in the committee stage. Back in the days when we were introducing the regional forest agreement legislation, Senator Brown detained the chamber for 48 hours—was it, Senator Brown?
—I think it was two weeks.
—Two weeks, was it? Your arguments in that case were even more puerile, if I might say, with respect, than your arguments here. At least I can understand what you are getting at here. But I think your arguments on the regional forest agreement demonstrated that you had no interest whatsoever in sustainable forestry, no interest in forestry at all and, in fact, very little interest in the environment. The only significant thing in that debate was that Senator Brown was actually talking about something that was related to the environment. Most of the issues he talks about in this chamber have nothing to do with the environment. I always think it is a bit of a fraud on the Australian public that Senator Brown masquerades under the name of the Australian Greens, when most of his contributions to this place have little to do with the environment, certainly little to do with sustainability.
I quite clearly oppose Senator Brown’s bill. Shock, horror, one might say; there is one thing I think Senator Brown and I might have agreed upon, which is vaguely related to the bill before us today—that is, the issue of euthanasia. We had a similar disallowance debate some years ago on the question of euthanasia. At that time I agreed with the substance of the debate. I think Senator Brown and I in that instance might have curiously been on the one side. I think at the time I was the federal minister for the territories, and there were two reasons which led me to Senator Brown’s side of the substantive debate. One was that, as territories minister, I thought we should at least have some regard for the Northern Territory parliament. Perhaps more importantly, in a substantive way, for all the reasons I mentioned in that speech, I agreed with the proposal to effectively allow euthanasia. In speaking on this debate, I certainly do not want to rehash the arguments surrounding the controversies in the euthanasia debate. Suffice to say that, in that instance, Senator Brown and I were on the same side insofar as the substantive issue was concerned.
The bill before us at the moment is not one that I think should be supported by the chamber. The Constitution is a document that was brought together over a substantial period of time by some of the best minds that were then available in what I can only refer to as the continent of Australia; it was not the Commonwealth of Australia, because that was created by the Constitution. Mr Acting Deputy President, as you would well know, there were some colonies that came together, and representatives of those colonies met for many days, over a period of many years, to get a constitution that would suit what was to become the Commonwealth of Australia. Rather than having six colonies, we were joining together in one nation.
Our founding fathers had to carefully consider the best form of arrangements for running what would become the Commonwealth of Australia—and this constitution was put together. No-one just woke up one morning and said: ‘A constitution is a good idea. Let’s write this down and make it the rules for our country into the future.’ This written document, the Constitution, was the subject of many hours, many days, many weeks, many years of intense scrutiny, debate and very careful legal drafting. Of course, it has stood the test of time. On many occasions, there have been attempts to change the Constitution. There have been some occasions on which the Constitution has been changed, but almost invariably the Constitution has not been changed.
One change did happen—and one might say that the constitutional fathers were not quite right in this—to allow Indigenous people to have, put simply, the rights that other Australians had. One might say that demonstrated that the founding fathers did not have the best document for the Constitution of our nation but, of course, things were quite different in those days. I suspect that, in the days when that clause was originally introduced, people would have thought it was the right thing for everyone involved, including Indigenous people. I am delighted that a Liberal government led the charge to have that changed. That is one instance in which the people of Australia, under the leadership of a Liberal government, brought about a change in the Constitution of Australia.
That change occurred because attitudes had changed dramatically. It is a bit like the debate we are having about the 457 visas, which, it seems, the Labor Party are totally opposed to. Some of their rhetoric—certainly, Mr Beazley’s rhetoric—has shades of the old White Australia policy, which, as you know, was introduced and supported—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I know the government wants to filibuster so that no vote is taken on this before six o’clock—and they may do that—but the senator has drifted right away from the topic of executive power over the ACT, and I ask you to call him back to it.
—There is no point of order.
—I am talking about the Constitution, which, as I understand it, is the subject of Senator Brown’s motion. I am talking about the powers given to this parliament and the territories under the Constitution. I am simply describing how a Liberal government led the charge to change the Constitution to treat Indigenous Australians like every other Australian—and I am very proud of that. I am just making an observation on how attitudes changed between the late 1800s and the mid-1960s, when that was changed. Back in the earlier part of our nationhood, the Labor Party and the unions were totally opposed to bringing coloured labour into Australia. I think the unions in those days did that for what they thought were the right reasons, but it was a fairly disgraceful episode in our history. Again, I am delighted that a Liberal government did away with the White Australia policy, which had been supported by the unions for so long—and by the party the unions supported.
Senator Brown is correct in that I have digressed just a little, and I will return to my comments on the Constitution. The Constitution was put together by people who had the best interests of Australia at heart. It was an exercise that went very carefully into every single element of every single section or clause of the Constitution. One of the sections dealt with at that time was section 122, which gave power to the Commonwealth to make laws over the territories. Again, Senator Brown, with his bill, wants to change that arrangement. He has explained why he wants to do so, as I say, in the shortest speech I have ever heard him make. However, that particular provision resulted from the work of some of the best legal minds in the country at that time—and I think those legal minds would have stood the test of time. Were our founding forefathers here today, they would still be recognised as some of the finest legal minds in the world. Those great lawyers and great statesmen of their time, including Sir Henry Parkes and Sir Samuel Griffith—a great Queenslander; I think I can say proudly that he comes from my state—would have gone through this very carefully. They would have looked at section 122 and would have decided that the Commonwealth should have law-making power over the territories.
—It says ‘the parliament’, not ‘the Commonwealth’.
—Does it? Thank you, Senator Brown. I stand corrected. It provided for the parliament. I do not have the Constitution in front of me, so I am doing something that is always dangerous to do and taking you at your word. However, let me say either the Commonwealth or the parliament—or whoever. The parliament should have law-making power over the territories. Why would that have been? Of course, I was not around at the time those debates were had, but one can imagine—and from my reading of history—that the founding fathers put section 122 into the Constitution because there was a belief that only fully fledged states of the new Commonwealth should have law-making power that was sacrosanct and that could not be challenged.
However, the territories—as I say, as a former territories minister, I have been a great supporter of the territories over the years—are relatively small. Their budgets are supported very substantially by the national government. The numbers of people in those territories, certainly at the time the Constitution was adopted, were—even as they relatively are today—smallish. Arrangements were put in place for those territories—again, all in the best interests of territorians, one might say—which provided, amongst other things, that the Commonwealth should have law-making power over the territories. There was this arrangement that the Governor-General could exercise the disallowance power. However, the Governor-General’s exercise of that power was always challengeable in parliament, so it was an instrument that could be disallowed by the parliament. We have been through this in an instance I mentioned previously, but this disallowance power has been used rarely by the Australian government and, even then, only where the national interest needed to be protected.
Senator Brown and I might wonder whether in the last instance, when the issue was euthanasia, which I have spoken of, the national interest needed protection. However, we had our vote on it at the time. As I recall, in that particular instance, the issue was not being determined by a government; it was being determined by a free vote. So, if Senator Brown and I wanted to blame someone there, we could not blame the government—and that would be the first time ever that Senator Brown would not have blamed the Howard government. When it rains, I think Senator Brown blames the Howard government. However, in that instance, it was a free vote.
—I’d be happy to blame the Howard government for rain.
—If it rained now, we would be heroes. Joh Bjelke-Petersen always used to claim that whenever it rained, particularly in a drought time, it was his doing. I was not a great fan of Bjelke-Petersen’s, I might say, and I knew that that was not true. However, certainly that disallowance power has been used by the Australian government only where the national interest needed to be protected by this parliament. I was just making the point that it was not even the Australian government in that instance; it was the free vote of all parliamentarians here. Senator Brown and I happened to be on the wrong side then, but the result of that vote resulted from the will of those who had been elected by all Australians to represent them in this house and in the other place. The exercise of that disallowance power, as I say, is subject to approval by the Governor-General. It is a disallowable instrument and it can be disallowed by parliament.
Senator Brown’s reason, as I understand it from his very brief speech, is that he wants parliamentary scrutiny of these disallowance powers. However, what Senator Brown is proposing will not in any way increase parliamentary scrutiny. The debate I referred to previously and other debates that we have had where there has been an overriding of a territory power that has been subject to a disallowance motion have been long, heated, passionate and emotional. However, you could not for a moment suggest that they have lacked the parliamentary scrutiny that the disallowance power has. I think it is probably a good thing too that we do have this ability to have parliamentary scrutiny. But this proposal of Senator Brown’s will in no way increase the parliamentary scrutiny of that disallowance power.
Under Senator Brown’s bill, the Australian government would have to make laws to override unacceptable territory laws. Having new laws passed to repeal other new laws will be confusing for citizens, it will extend the time for doing these things and it will make the whole process much more drawn out. However, under the current system, you can get a decision. It may not be a decision that we all like. As I say, there has been an instance where Senator Brown and I probably did not like the outcome. However, it is there. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY (SELF-GOVERNMENT) AMENDMENT (DISALLOWANCE POWER OF THE COMMONWEALTH) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,34,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2006-09-14,"—I am delighted to follow Senator Ian Macdonald in this debate. He has so eloquently put the case against this bill, and I commend his contribution to the Senate. Given the experience that Senator Macdonald has had as a former Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, he does speak with great experience and knowledge of this area.
We are debating the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment (Disallowance Power of the Commonwealth) Bill 2006, as proposed by Senator Brown. This is an intriguing bill because it involves a substantial diminution in the authority of the Commonwealth over the Australian Capital Territory. I notice it does not refer to the Northern Territory—it is a bill restricted to the power of the Commonwealth with respect to the Australian Capital Territory—but it does involve a very significant wind-back of the existing arrangements. For Liberals who, like me, are genuinely federalist in philosophical inclination, these sorts of debates are always not easy; indeed, my involvement in these matters has always tested my underlying commitment to a federal structure.
I do have a genuine philosophical inclination to subsidiarity—that is, the proposition that decisions should be made, in as many cases as possible, by those closest to the people most affected by those decisions. That is the essence of federalism, it is the essence of the Australian Constitution and the constitutional structure of which we have all been the beneficiaries. But that constitutional structure is a function of the six state colonies coming together to form the Commonwealth and by agreement. Their Constitution is an agreement under which the six state colonies agreed to hand over certain of their powers to a central government, the Commonwealth.
The Northern Territory was then part of South Australia. We South Australians sometimes regret that our forebears handed over the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth and wonder what might have been if the Northern Territory had remained part of the great state of ‘Central Australia’. But that was not to be, and now we have not only the Australian Capital Territory but the Northern Territory.
I made a contribution on the euthanasia bill, in which I distinguished a territory from a state on the basis that the Commonwealth had a very clear and distinct responsibility—ultimate responsibility—for the Northern Territory as a territory not a state. The Australian Capital Territory is very much in that vein. A clear constitutional responsibility rests with the Commonwealth for the Australian Capital Territory, and I think that would be true of every country in the world where there is a distinct governance arrangement for the capital city, whether it is the District of Columbia or the Australian Capital Territory.
Australia has gone a long way towards granting the elements of self-government to the seat of its capital city—further than many others. Certainly my party has been proudly involved in that. Many would dispute the arrangements that we have put in place for the Australian Capital Territory. Wherever I go, both in the ACT itself and around Australia, many suggest that the more appropriate arrangement for the Australian Capital Territory would be what you might call a city council type arrangement—for example, a Brisbane City Council type arrangement or some such other. However, we do have this form of self-government but always on the understanding and on the basis that the ultimate authority over the territory does, must and should continue to reside with the Commonwealth.
This is the capital city for all Australians; it is not just a city for its residents. It has had a huge investment in it by all Australians through the taxes that we collect. Many of the nation’s great institutions are in this city, so the proposition that the Commonwealth should absolve itself of its fundamental responsibilities through this act or any other act or bill that would seek to diminish those powers is contrary to the essential responsibility which the Commonwealth must have for the seat of national government—for the capital city that we in this country enjoy.
Having said that, it is worth going to the motivation for Senator Brown’s proposition. Clearly, as others have acknowledged, Senator Brown was motivated to bring this bill forward by the Governor-General’s disallowance of the ACT civil unions legislation. On my advice, this is the only time in which the authority of the Commonwealth over the ACT has ever been exercised. So what we are talking about here is a very rare, indeed singular, example of the exercise of this ultimate authority. It shows that self-government does work well and that, in the history of self-government, there has not been the need for the Commonwealth to exercise this ultimate authority. For Senator Brown to purport that we must immediately remove this authority simply because of the singular exercise of that authority in this one particular case is rather far-fetched. If we were dealing with a situation where the Governor-General was disallowing ACT bills at the drop of a hat—if this were the 100th time that it had occurred—then you might more closely examine the proposition that Senator Brown has put before us. But it is this one singular proposition.
The background to that proposition should be considered because we went to enormous lengths to work with the ACT to see whether a civil unions bill could be developed that was genuinely a civil unions bill. The point was made to the ACT repeatedly that anything that could properly and reasonably be seen to be a bill that impacted upon the Commonwealth’s prerogatives with respect to the institution of marriage would not be acceptable to the Commonwealth. That was said repeatedly. We gave the ACT every opportunity to restructure its Civil Unions Act to ensure that it did not contradict the Commonwealth’s responsibility for and its definition of the institution of marriage. Indeed, the ACT refused to accede to that. The bill says that a civil union is different from a marriage.

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2006-09-14,"—I stand tonight to speak about why Work Choices is working. In Australia we have around 2.5 million people, or about a quarter of the people of working age, on welfare. It was British Prime Minister Tony Blair who said to the British Trades Union Congress on 9 September 1997 that ‘fairness in the workplace starts with the chance of a job’. In Australia today we have 700,000-odd children growing up in a household where no-one has a job, and that is very sad. A job of course provides financial and personal benefits. It is why Work Choices will in my view, in due course, be seen as one of the great economic reforms in Australia of the early part of the 21st century. It is a job creator, it provides flexibility and it increases wages. It undergirds our economy, making it stronger.
Work Choices will pick up the underclass forgotten by the Labor Party—the unemployed. Under Labor, a million Australians were out of work. Under John Howard, 1.9 million jobs have been created, most of which are full time. Economic growth depends on keeping the reform process going. This approach has helped to build one of the strongest economies in the world. Changes to our workplace relations system since 1996 have been an essential contributing factor to the strong economy and low interest rates that Australia currently enjoys.
Work Choices replaces a system that has six different industrial jurisdictions, more than 4,000 awards and over 105,000 different job classifications. As the Hon. Joe Hockey recently said, in a workforce of roughly 10.2 million people, that means a different classification for every 100 workers. How ridiculous. Pay for employees doing the same job but under different awards can vary by up to $77 per week. The reforms include a set of minimum standards covering wages, annual leave, sick leave and the like. These standards cannot be undercut. They apply to up to 85 per cent of Australian employees.
In the union and Labor Party scare campaigns and criticism of Work Choices, they said two things: it will lead to fewer jobs and it will lead to lower wages. Indeed, AWU Secretary Bill Shorten said Work Choices was ‘a green light for slashing jobs’. Let us look at the facts, because the facts are on our side. The unions said that the sky would fall in, that there would be mass job losses under Work Choices. What has happened since Work Choices came into being? We have over 175,000 new jobs throughout Australia. That is since March this year. Indeed, since 1996, when the Howard government came into office, 1.9 million new jobs have been created. In Tasmania, my home state, since Work Choices started, unemployment has fallen four points, from 6.4 per cent to six per cent. Of course, unemployment reached 12.6 per cent in Tasmania under Labor.
Labor said Work Choices would lead to lower wages. What do the facts say? Real wages have actually increased nationally by 16.4 per cent in the past decade under the Howard government. In the June quarter this year, real wages growth shows projected annual-basis wage growth heading for 4.4 per cent. In Tasmania, between February and May 2006, average weekly ordinary time earnings rose by 1.5 per cent; that is an indicative six per cent growth over a full year.
In response to last week’s fall in unemployment in Tasmania, the state Labor Treasurer, Michael Aird, admitted that the sky had not fallen in. What did he actually say? He said:
... more people are looking for work because they are confident of getting a job in the current economic climate.
Indeed, there have been no mass sackings since April, no Armageddon and no mass purge of the workforce as the union-Labor scare campaign warned.
I want to turn now to the economy. Let’s have a quick look at the results. The number of Australians in work under Labor was 8.3 million in 1996; under John Howard, 10.2 million. Of those jobs, 7.3 million are full time. The number of long-term unemployed was 197,800 in 1996; it was 91,200 as of June this year. Labor’s $96 billion debt has been wiped out; now we are looking at a surplus. Average mortgage rates under Labor were 12.75 per cent; under John Howard they are 7.15 per cent. Average inflation under Labor was 5.2 per cent; under John Howard, 2.5 per cent. The number of working days lost per 1,000 under Labor was 193; under Prime Minister Howard, 64. This is a very important point: strike action in the 1990s peaked at 104.6 working days lost per 100,000 in the 1992 December quarter. Who was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training then? The Hon. Kim Beazley was the employment minister. Our standard of living was ranked 13th in the OECD in 1995; it is now ranked eighth. Individual workplace agreements in Tasmania are, on average, 48 per cent more than those on awards, and nationally it is 100 per cent more than those on awards, and 13 per cent more than those on a collective agreement.
Interestingly, four out of five workers have opted not to have union membership. Union members are some 17 per cent of the private sector workforce now. Unions have handed the ALP $47 million in party affiliation fees and other contributions since 1996, whether the membership voted Labor or not. In my view, that is the key to the scare campaign behind Labor and union efforts to date. Most of those opposite are former union officials, and they know the importance of the union affiliation fees and contributions used to prop up the Labor Party. And now we know how they hope to protect this political laundering of union membership dues.
In the Hon. Kim Beazley’s rollback he wants to abolish AWAs. He is threatening the income of 20,000 workers on approved AWAs in Tasmania, and almost 900,000 nationally. The plan of the Leader of the Opposition is a plan for collective bargaining which will enable workplace collective bargaining if more than 50 per cent of the workers in that workplace agree. Mr Beazley’s office has confirmed that, under a Labor government:
... unions would be allowed to call on the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to subject all existing individual agreements to change to fit a new set of yet-to-be-announced minimum standards, even if neither party in the agreement wanted to change.
But on Wednesday, just yesterday, at the National Press Club, ACTU Secretary Greg Combet claimed that Mr Beazley’s collective bargaining announcement had been misinterpreted. He said:
We are not putting and I don’t understand Mr Beazley to be putting a position such as it obtains in North America where before a collective bargaining process can take place, there’s a necessity to establish that a majority of workers in that workplace want the collective agreement. What we are putting is that, a much, I suppose more flexible approach to it, that the law provide that employers and employees and Unions can voluntarily enter into collective bargaining at any time ... That is not a system where the right to collectively bargain is predicated upon a majority decision of the employees. It’s a system where any party can enter into collective bargaining negotiation at any time.
What does the business community think about that, and what do other commentators think about it? The state chamber of the peak New South Wales industry group, Australian Business Limited, said:
The Beazley plan is about stripping away the right of any worker to negotiate directly with an employer ...
I refer to the Illawarra Mercury headline today, Thursday, 14 September, entitled ‘Labor keeps union IR plan at a distance’. The lead sentence says:
Labor has distanced itself from a union plan to compel workplaces to adopt collective agreements even where the majority of workers don’t vote for them.
The Financial Review today says ‘Choices for work are clear’, and goes on to make some very interesting observations, including:
While the labour movement’s high priests have been mulling their response to Work Choices, evidence continued to mount that the new workplace regime is not the horror they seek to portray.
And indeed it goes on. We have the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry expressing their concern, including on the front page of the Tasmanian Business Reporter, where they say that the union right of entry is ‘an outrage’, and Damon Thomas is quoted extensively in that regard.
