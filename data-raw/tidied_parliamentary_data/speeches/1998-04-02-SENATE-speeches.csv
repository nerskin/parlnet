"O'Chee, Sen Bill",NP,1998-04-02,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that, at the giving of notices on the next day of sitting, I shall withdraw business of the Senate notice of motion No. 2 standing in my name for seven sitting days after today for the disallowance of the Therapeutic Goods Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1997 No. 401. I seek leave to make a short statement.
Leave granted.

"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1998-04-02,"—I move:
That the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2]  be referred to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee for inquiry and report by the last day of sitting in September 1998 on the implications for the bill of the High Court's decision in the Kartinyeri and Gollan v the Commonwealth  (1998) (`the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Case').
I am well aware of the way in which the vote will go on this particular piece of legislation, but the Democrats feel that, at least in a brief debate this morning, we ought to consider the implications of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge 
 High Court decision yesterday and at least put our concerns on the record following that decision. Let me give you a brief summary of the case as we understand it.
We understand that two judges, Brennan and McHugh, gave no opinion on section 51(xxvi). They concluded that what the parliament enacts it has the power to repeal and as the bridge act merely repealed part of the operation of the heritage protection act the issue does not arise. So in two cases the judges did not rule on the issue which is the concern of this parliament, and that is whether or not parliament can pass laws which are detrimental to one race of people, namely, the indigenous people. So two judges did not rule on that at all, but on the other matter.
Two judges, Gaudron and Kirby, concluded that section 51(xxvi) does not allow discrimination against Aboriginal people, although for different reasons. However, Gaudron decided that the heritage protection act did not become invalid as a result of the bridge act and therefore the bridge act was valid. Kirby disagreed and said that the bridge act must stand alone and therefore was invalid.
Two judges, Gummow and Hayne, concluded that section 51(xxvi) could produce discriminatory laws so long as they were not a manifest abuse of the power. To be a law under the race power it must be necessary for the race concerned but that is a judgment for the parliament unless it is a manifest abuse. They reject the argument that the 1967 referendum authorised only beneficial laws and that the constitution should be read as subject to international law. But they do make the point that a law overriding common law rights needs to be clear and unambiguous. They did not elaborate on what constitutes a manifest abuse. Kirby, by contrast, provides a very detailed analysis of why the manifest abuse test is too weak.
So it is quite clear that the case did not create a binding precedent on the interpretation of 51(xxvi), which all of us expected may have been the result of that High Court decision. Although I understand and sympathise with the very great disappointment to the indigenous women involved in that case, we need to understand that the judgment 
 yesterday did not give us any clear indication in terms of the Wik Native Title Amendment Bill, which we are debating. So the Democrats believe that there ought to be the possibility of referring this legislation so that we can look again at the High Court judgment.
I know that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee has already spent a lot of time on this. But, of course, it did not have before it, at all the hearings that were held—which I know Senator Bolkus was certainly involved in—the High Court judgment. For that reason the Democrats believe that we ought to give these few minutes this morning to consider yesterday's judgment. I understand that we will not succeed in a vote on this motion I am moving, but I do believe it is important that we at least give this consideration to it.
I would like to also point out that, in the debate on the Hindmarsh Island legislation when it was before the parliament, the Labor Party voted against the legislation in the first instance but then allowed it through subsequently. I note that Senator Bolkus, in his speech on 12 May, said:
I must admit that, for my part, I only support this legislation because it will finish up in the High Court and those issues that we are so keen to ensure are clarified will be clarified in a way that could probably pre-empt some of the planks of your 10-point plan in response to Wik.
I know that was a noble sentiment you expressed, Senator Bolkus. Unfortunately, by voting for the Hindmarsh Island Bridge legislation when it came back to this chamber, you actually allowed that legislation to go ahead.
What we got yesterday was not a clarification at all. I do not know where that leaves indigenous people. I am sure you were genuine in your hope, on 12 May, that the High Court would give us a clarification. It has not done that, therefore the Democrats believe that the only way to resolve this would be for the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee to address the issue—to read carefully the High Court decision of yesterday and to take into account all the discussion that was held previously—in terms of the implications for 
 the Wik legislation before we proceed to debate that legislation any further.",SENATE,<title>NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Reference to Committee</title>,Bills,13,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-04-02,"—The opposition does not support this initiative by Senator Woodley and we do not support it for a couple of reasons. First of all, what Senator Woodley is seeking the Senate committee to embark on is something that, in a sense, has already been done. We have already examined the constitutional issues to the extent that we could. That process was initiated just a few months ago by Senator Margetts and it was quite useful at the time but, at the end of the day, the view that was held was that the best assessment one could make as to the constitutional power was that one was uncertain as to the outcome in the court. At the same time there was a desirability, I think by all of us, to ensure that parliament would not act in a racially discriminatory way.
It has already been done. The strong view of opinion was that any High Court focusing directly on the issue of race power and the beneficial or detrimental nature of it would come to the conclusion that a court would make a ruling either that the power could only be used beneficially or that it could be used in such a way as to provide a mechanism to ensure not just protection against manifest abuse but also protection to ensure that the legislation involved was a proportionate response to the particular issue facing the parliament.
I think it is fair to say that the High Court has not really advanced the position from where we were just a few months ago here. We do not really think anything would be gained from another Senate inquiry, Senator Woodley. The best you could say about the High Court's decision yesterday is that it leaves the constitutional position as clear as mud, and any parliamentary Senate inquiry would not help to clarify those muddy waters, as defined by the High Court yesterday.
Of course we have concerns. All Australians should be concerned at the fact that, over recent months, neither parliament nor the High Court has been prepared to rule a very clear and definite line against discriminatory legislation. This should be of concern to us 
 all, particularly given the diverse and multicultural nature of our society and that so many of us come from different ethnic backgrounds. Also, as Australia is trying to develop its identity in a global social and economic market, the way we behave at home is going to be important in terms of how we are seen abroad and also how we see ourselves. We are a long way from achieving reconciliation with our indigenous people. To achieve reconciliation there needs to be a platform of non-discrimination before they can be treated as equal partners in the process. As I said, the High Court decision yesterday leaves the constitutional position as clear as mud and no Senate committee, we think, can clarify that.
In terms of the constitutional position, it is fair to say that we should not focus on just one aspect of the constitutional problems this legislation might have. Yesterday morning there were at least five arms available to indigenous Australians wanting to contest this legislation. Firstly, they could contest it on the assertion that it did not satisfy the beneficial arm of the races power, or the proportionate or supervisory requirements set down by the High Court. Secondly, they could challenge it in a sense that it did not provide procedural fairness in compliance with the requirements to do so under the just terms provisions of the constitution. Thirdly, they could challenge it because, in many instances, there is acquisition of property retrospectively, contrary to the requirements to provide just terms under the constitution. Fourthly, in some respects there is acquisition of property for other than Commonwealth purposes and there are imperatives in the constitution that property acquired by the Commonwealth needs to be for Commonwealth purposes, not for the benefit of third parties. That is a strong argument that can be pursued. Finally, there is the argument raised by the Clerk of the Senate that the requirements to satisfy the double dissolution trigger have not been met.
I am not saying that any one of those five arms is conclusive as against the legislation; what I am saying is that those five arms allow for indigenous Australians to pursue this matter again. Those five bases still remain after yesterday's decision. They were avail 
 able yesterday morning and I think that most people would agree they were still available to appellants yesterday afternoon. They are available now.
I do not want to talk much longer other than to stress those two points and to make the point that the obligation, in a sense, is not on this parliament. If we want fairness and if we want certainty then the only way to achieve that is to ensure that there is a genuine compromise on the issues. That compromise should ensure, for instance, that indigenous Australians can walk away realising and recognising that they have got something out of the process: respect in particular for their access to native title through a meaningful right to negotiate, and also fairness and certainty through an application of the Racial Discrimination Act amendment, which was passed by this parliament last time.
Contrary to the false assertions that have been made about that RDA clause, it does provide a greater degree of certainty than there would be if it were absent and, secondly, it provides a benchmark for fairness for indigenous Australians. So, going back over those two points, the constitutional situation is murky but we do not think that going through a process we have already been through is going to clarify it any more.",SENATE,<title>NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Reference to Committee</title>,Bills,13,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-04-02,"—What happened yesterday in the High Court was both very sad and very telling. In some ways it still, as has been pointed out, leaves the situation in relation to the race power in the constitution of Australia uncertain. The issue that is going to come on stronger and stronger and which must be addressed by this parliament and by the community of Australia is: when are we going to clarify that position in the constitution? I think that most people would agree that having that power in the constitution in that manner, in such an uncertain way—and `uncertainty' has probably been one of the most misused words in the vocabulary in recent years—is not helping the current situation.
Unless you can have people arguing that the race power in our constitution can be used to harm a particular group of people, I think we 
 should be moving as a nation, or as a collection of nations, to clarify that and make it absolutely beyond doubt that the race power in the constitution is there, is designed, and should be used, for the benefit of any particular race of people. I can just imagine the Australian government going out onto the international stage and saying, `We are arguing that we could clarify it the other way.' At the moment, that is almost what they are doing. They are saying, `We believe it is not just for the benefit but we believe our measures are beneficial anyway.' So, in reality, we see the awful spectre of this government potentially going to the High Court—when the inevitable challenges occur to the Native Title Amendment Bill [No. 2]—to argue in it that that power can be used to the detriment of Aboriginal people in Australia and, of course, the criticism that that move will attract in the international community will be immense, and it will be justified.
I know that, during the inquiry that I managed to get up on the constitutionality of the Native Title Amendment Bill, many people referred to the Hindmarsh Island Bridge case. Some said that they thought it was potentially relevant and some people said it was less relevant. Many people believed that it would help in that the arguments would be clarified a little or it would help in the way that we saw the constitutional issues in relation to the Native Title Amendment Bill, and we ended up with an argument that went so far and no further during that inquiry—and a very useful and interesting inquiry it was, considering how few of the people who were asked to give evidence were actually supporting the government's position.
Obviously, I believe that any ability that we have to further examine the bill would be useful. I also think, obviously, that any ability for the bill to actually go out for consultation with indigenous Australians would be terrific—essential, in my terms—but this has not happened in any real sense at all.
The debate on the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill was, if you like, an echo of what we are seeing at the moment. Honourable senators will recall that a South Australian election was looming. We voted on this bill the first 
 time and the second time it came back I felt strongly that the argument of the ALP—that the Racial Discrimination Act was the saving factor, that you could put through a rotten bill, whack a Racial Discrimination Act amendment on it and that would make it okay—was flawed.
—It proved to be.
—And it proved to be, as Senator Woodley has just interjected. So the Greens (WA) thought long and hard and chose to vote against putting that amendment on the bill at that stage because we believed that it was the wrong thing to do and would give a signal to the community that putting a rotten bill together, a bill that damages Aboriginal people, and then sticking a Racial Discrimination Act amendment onto it was not the right thing to do. At that stage the bill was defeated, with the Labor Party voting against it.
The bill was dead at that stage and that was a great step forward, we believed, for positive action for indigenous rights in Australia. But a little time later, as we got closer to the proposed South Australian election, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, decided that he would make a public statement and, in fact, he called the bill back. He said, `Look, give it to us again. Go on, give it to us again and this time we will vote for it whether or not it has the Racial Discrimination Act amendment on it.' By that stage we thought it might be marginally better with the Racial Discrimination Act amendment, but the Labor Party have clearly decided that the election was much more important than any ethics or principled position in relation to indigenous Australians in South Australia and throughout Australia, as we clearly see now.
What we are seeing in the Native Title Amendment Bill [No. 2] is an echo of what particular Racial Discrimination Act amendments do or do not do and what we can rely on them to do or not do, and what in fact can give any relief to people to think in relation to a rotten bill, `Is the bill substantially detrimental to Aboriginal people?' I gave a list of the massive removal of rights that have occurred so far as a result of the debate which Labor and the government do not want to 
 revisit. We are having a debate on the margins of dispossession, as I mentioned yesterday.
So here we are; we do need a dose of reality and supporting this reference would assist in providing this dose of reality. I know that the numbers in the Senate are such that this will not happen, but we all need a dose of reality.
Senator Bolkus said that false assertions have been made about the Racial Discrimination Act amendment. Senator Bolkus made certain assertions during the debate on the Hindmarsh Island bill. I do not think any of us are in a position to make absolute assertions about what the High Court will or will not do in relation to a particular amendment.
If he is saying that we are making false assertions, all I can say is, `We told you so and so did a lot of other people.' The same kind of confident assertions are being made right now in relation to what we believe is an inadequate Racial Discrimination Act amendment in the Native Title Amendment Bill [No. 2]. The same kinds of assertions are being made all over again by the same party who believe that they can stick something in the bill and pretend that they can make a thoroughly rotten bill appear to be okay. If there is no other reason for supporting this amendment, this is the reason to support it. Those people who are standing behind those false assertions should be exposed.",SENATE,<title>NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Reference to Committee</title>,Bills,13,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-04-02,"—I have problems with this particular proposition. I thank Senator Woodley for bringing it forward. It is important that he did bring it forward and it is important for the chamber to have the opportunity of discussing the decision. Even for that reason, I am grateful that he has put it forward. It must be remembered that Senator Woodley has been involved in these particular areas for longer than most of us.
But a recitation of what the court decided in the judgments delivered yesterday would indicate to the chamber that support for the reference of the matter to the legal and constitutional committee would not get us very far. It would be interesting, but it would not get us very far.
I was given a briefing on the judgment by legal advisers some hour after the judgment was delivered. I am referring to notes of that briefing. The fact is that the High Court held by a majority—that is, Brennan, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne, with Kirby dissenting—that the Hindmarsh Bridge legislation is valid. Brennan and McHugh held that the effect of the bridge act was to repeal the Heritage Protection Act in so far as it related to the Hindmarsh Island bridge.
Since the subject matter of legislation which repeals another act is that of the act which is repealed, the repealing legislation is within power. Therefore, they said that it was not necessary to consider the extent of the races power. It is not unusual for judges at whatever level to determine matters without going to one of the key issues in which people are very interested, but they are to do a job and determine whether the legislation is valid or not.
Gaudron agreed with the repeal argument made by Brennan and McHugh, but did consider the races power. She held that, although the races power is wide enough to authorise laws to the advantage or disadvantage of people of a particular race, it is difficult to perceive a current circumstance pertaining to Aborigines which could support a law operating to their disadvantage. She said that the issue is not whether the law was beneficial, but whether the law is reasonably capable of being viewed as appropriate. Given the serious disadvantage of the Aboriginal people, prima facie, the races power presently only authorises laws which operate to their benefit.
Gummow and Hayne did not accept the repeal argument, but considered the races power was wide enough to authorise the bridge act. They rejected the view that the races power could only be exercised to the benefit of a race. They said, however,—and this is interesting—that legislation to infringe fundamental common law rights had to be clear and unambiguous, that the High Court had a supervisory role to ensure that legislation was within constitutional power and that the constitution was based on certain traditional assumptions, such as the rule of law. 
 Mr Justice Kirby gave a detailed analysis of the extent of the races power. He held that the power could be exercised only for the benefit of a race, and he rejected the repeal argument.
The end result is that the judgment gives no clear indication as to how the Wik legislation is likely to be dealt with by the High Court. I have noted some comments by the government, but the government should bear in mind that in fact the judgement did not give an indication as to how the Wik legislation would ultimately be dealt with by the High Court, if it goes to that extent.
Two of the judges said in effect that, in respect of Aborigines, the races power could only be exercised for their benefit; two said that it could be exercised for both benefit and disadvantage. However, the High Court would closely examine any legislation. Two judges did not examine the issue of the races power. It should also be noted that three judges supported, and three judges opposed, the repeal argument. The government would have been relying on that argument to support the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997. That issue is still open. The comments by the government that I have seen I believe are not really warranted. If I were a betting man—well, I will not go into my betting habits—
—Unless you've got any good tips.
—Even when I owned a racehorse, I did not have too many good tips. I am inclined to the view that has been expressed by Senator Bolkus: that, given those particular facts, it would not help us further with our understanding of the current legislation before us if we were to have a long reference before the Legal and Constitutional Committee.
I do respect that committee and benefit from its deliberations. But also I do not think it is appropriate to delay the legislation, the Native Title Amendment Bill [No. 2]—and I assume that is what the mover of the motion is indicating—any further, because I think we do have an opportunity to settle the issue, to have an outcome of deliberations within the next few days which will be fair, just, reasonable and honourable—and with certainty, as 
 far as we can possibly achieve certainty. We are the legislators; the courts are not.
I think also that the government would do well to think about clause 7(1) relating to the RDA; it ought to understand that the Senate's position on that was not one to suggest that clause 7(1) should be used as a clause buster for every other clause in the legislation. That is not the Senate's position; it has been misunderstood. I do believe that, whatever it takes, the government should consider that situation and accept that clause 7(1) is not meant as a clause buster.
If, with the position taken by the Senate, some sort of wording additional to that which is in 7(1) is needed, then so be it; I would be inclined to go along with that particular aspect. But let us at least have that provision there, because I think it is important not only symbolically but also for interpretive purposes to achieve some certainty. I thank the Senate.",SENATE,<title>NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Reference to Committee</title>,Bills,13,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-04-02,"—The government will oppose this motion moved by Senator Woodley. It would have the effect of referring the Native Title Amendment Bill [No. 2] to the Senate References Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and ensure that that committee not report back to the Senate until September 1998, therefore also having the effect of delaying the passage of the so-called Wik legislation or Native Title Amendment Bill until obviously extremely late in this year, if not into the year after.
The government is keen to have this matter resolved. We would have liked to have seen the legislation passed in its original form prior to the adjournment for the summer recess at the end of last year. There are thousands, probably tens of thousands, of people across Australia who want to see these matters resolved; they want to see this legislation passed. Those tens of thousands of people come from all walks of life—they are pastoralists, miners and Aboriginal people from virtually all states of Australia.
—Workers.
—`Workers', Senator O'Chee interjects. I think Senator 
 Harradine has given a good rebuttal in relation to the details of the Hindmarsh Island bridge case that was handed down by the High Court yesterday. But the government believes that this legislation should be dealt with. We seek to continue the second reading debate on that bill this afternoon and move to the committee stage tomorrow, and to have the Senate deal with the legislation prior to the Easter adjournment of the Senate. This would have the effect of delaying it.
I know very well that the vast majority of Australians do want to see this legislation dealt with—dealt with properly, dealt with thoroughly, but dealt with nonetheless. And the government has facilitated that debate. For those reasons, we would oppose the motion.
Question resolved in the negative.

I would like to speak to the explanatory memorandum which was circulated on 10 March and which has just been tabled. The  amendments insert a new section 51ACA in schedule 1 to the bill. The key addition is subsection 51ACA3, which declares that franchising is an industry. Views were divided in the business community as to whether 
 franchising can be called an industry. The government was of the view that it did, but this amendment seeks to remove any doubt. It is quite explicit in saying that franchising is an industry and that franchisors and franchisees are participants in that industry.
The other definitions in the new section 51ACA already appear in the bill at proposed new section 51AD in schedule 1. For convenience, those definitions have been relocated to the new section 51ACA proposed by amendment No. 1. The second point is that it is making it easy to understand, which is one of the philosophical and practical objectives of the government in assisting small business. Mr Chairman, are we dealing with government amendments 3 to 8 as well?
—On the running sheet we have 1 to 10.
—I will keep talking, then. This group of amendments numbering 3 to 8 inserts proposed new provisions in section 51AC in schedule 1 of the bill. The amendments add to the existing activity of supply of goods and services to a business consumer and the corresponding activity of acquisition from a small business. It includes supply of goods and services and it adds the concept of acquisition from a small business.
The amendments recognise that a number of small businesses sell goods and services to other businesses. This can include the acquisition from small businesses of fresh fruit and produce for supermarket chains, manufactured items, such as furniture, and a variety of services. The amendments dealing with acquisition of goods and services are drafted in a form which corresponds to those already specified in the bill dealing with supply of goods and services to a small business. These are factors which a court may have regard to for the purposes of determining whether unconscionable conduct has occurred. The key amendment is No. 4.
I now refer to amendments 9 and 10. Firstly, amendment No. 9 removes an anomaly in the existing $1 million threshold limit applicable to the price of a small business transaction. That limit is found at proposed 
 new subsection 51AC(8) in schedule 2 to the bill. In certain loan transactions price is taken to mean the interest, fees and charges but does not include the capital value of the loan. In contrast, a property transaction will include the capital cost or value of the item. This amendment at proposed new paragraph 51AC8E will ensure that both forms of small business transactions are treated the same. The other provisions in this replacement of subsection 51AC8 of the bill are drafting requirements. The main purpose is to reword the current provision which applies at subsection 4B2 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 to the meaning of price.
I now turn to government amendment No. 10. This amendment is a drafting refinement to continue the link between the proposed new remedy for unconscionable conduct of section 51AC with the definitions used in the proposed new part 1B industry codes in schedule 1. The amendment is consequential upon the modifications made by the bill by government amendment No. 1.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-04-02,"—The opposition supports government amendments Nos 1 to 8 and 10, but does not support amendment No. 9, which is the further amendment to the definition of the transaction. We have our own amendment in that area and, with the Democrat amendments, we believe it is too restrictive. The further amendment may actually make it even more restrictive by putting in the definition of `capital' in certain circumstances. The definition that the government has for `transaction' is, as I understand it, $1 million over five years. Am I correct in that?
—No. It is $1 million, but not over a time period.
—Even with $1 million, we are advised—and I would like a response from the minister on this—that because of the turnover in, for example, petrol station proprietors, which is very large, this $1 million limit may cut them out. As the minister would know, one of the bedevilling areas of franchising operations is petrol stations. To put it bluntly, the petrol stations and the petrol companies have been brawling for almost as long as this parliament has been 
 meeting—since petrol and cars were first put together.
—Not just here either.
—I know. Those of us who, as former ministers, have had the experience of trying to negotiate an oil code arrangement on a voluntary basis between the petrol companies and the petrol retailers—the franchisees—know the feeling of frustration it engenders. It was one of the most exasperating periods of my time with small business when agreement could not be reached—basically because there was no trust between either side. In the end, when we were in government, we said that, on the oil code side, we would not agree to abolish the franchise act and the sites act in the petroleum industry until there was an agreement that the Trade Practices Act had been strengthened to ensure that the voluntary code which would outline best practice arrangements between the companies and their franchisees was in place and operating properly. To try to get agreement in that area was extremely difficult. By the time we left office there had been no agreement, and I am not sure what stage the government is at on reaching agreement on a voluntary oil code between the petrol retailers and the companies.
One thing is for certain: unless the petrol retailers, through their industry association, are satisfied that they are covered by this act, the brawl will continue and the intervention of government will be required. This is not an ideological argument, that we necessarily want to be there because we are interventionists from the opposition position; this is a practical application to ensure that the economic power of the three or four big petrol companies is well balanced against the interests of an individual franchisee. I have to put it on the record here that the operation of the petrol companies in the last two or three years in introducing multisite franchising did not help the process of engendering trust in getting an agreement under the oil code.
So, first, I would like some explanation about the definition of the transaction arrangement, that petrol retailers are clearly able to be covered in this bill and do not accidentally fall out of its provisions. Secondly, by way of 
 background that would be useful to us all, where is the government at in reaching agreement on the voluntary oil code—a code that, if signed on to voluntarily by the companies and the franchisees, can be used as a basis under this amended Fair Trading Act to give remedy to the franchisees? Finally, what is the government's position on repealing the sites act and the petroleum franchising act? I know that is a triple-barrelled question, but I think that in the discussion the opposition would like some understanding on that position. I have to say that I am pleased to see that the minister is here in the advisers' box as well, because these are complicated issues that are consistently changing in negotiations around the place.
—He's a good fellow.
—I think it is very useful having the minister here because I suspect that, day to day, he is dealing with some of these issues and we can get some advice direct about where we are at with those negotiations.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-04-02,"—I think it is good to have such a qualified adviser in the advisers' box as well. Senator Schacht, you did ask a series of questions and, as I was taking advice on one, you asked another. So, to make it easier for my mind, which tends to try to deal with things one at a time, I will deal with the question as it relates to these 10 government amendments, many of which are just tidying up things and drafting refinements. Amendment No. 9, which you will be opposing, is a fairly crucial policy question where both you, on behalf of the opposition, and Senator Murray have amendments, and it does deal with this $1 million threshold.
You asked whether it is for five years. By interjection, I said, no, it is not. It is not restricted to that; it is $1 million per transaction. The courts, I am advised, will have to make decisions about that. They will also have a clear direction from the government that if companies are seeking to gross up transactions to get around that threshold then courts will have to make a decision about that being an artificial arrangement.
Furthermore, just on the policy question, the effect of the opposition amendment in relation to moving to the 20-person test, or the so-called ABS test, as opposed to the $1 million test—I am just talking about the core policy question, which I am sure we will debate a little later on—would be, as you would know, because you would have been lobbied on it, to potentially exclude thousands of small businesses from the benefit of this legislation. I know from people who have lobbied me, particularly the Property Council, they are very keen to have it restricted. Clearly the lobbying was not to benefit small businesses.
So the coalition does believe this $1 million threshold will work a lot better in terms of the interest of small businesses. I have just been handed a note. If a transaction goes over the $1 million and then falls outside new section 51AC, which is the new remedy, the business will still have section 51AA available to it.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-04-02,"—I, too, acknowledge the presence of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith). The fact that a minister of the Crown from the other House is present is a sign of the importance that he and the government attaches to this bill. I think that is very satisfactory. I am not going to add much to what Senator Schacht has said. We, too, support items 1 to 8 and No. 10. We will oppose No. 9 for pretty much the same reasons as outlined by the opposition. We will deal with the reasons more fully when our own amendments come forward.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-04-02,"—In the amendment that we and the Democrats have moved about the definition in No. 9, we have put in an alternative definition—not to supplant your own, but as an additional definition—to guide the court. We have put that in using the ABS definition of `small business'. Even though we have not got to moving our amendments in this general discussion, what is the minister's response to that amendment putting in the ABS definition of `small business' as well as the $1 million so that the court can see they have some flexibility?
No matter how you draw a definition and put an amount of money, you will always 
 have an argument from the person who is $1 over whatever the figure is. If you make it $2 million or $500,000, there will always be somebody—as we always know—who will feel aggrieved that their situation cannot be dealt with because they have fallen on the wrong side of the definition of the amount of money by a few dollars and therefore cannot get remedy.
The remedy you have mentioned under 51AA has to prove unconscionable conduct, as I understand it. We would be interested to hear the government's response to our amendment of adding in this further definition as an alternative for the court to look at. It may well give the court a chance to rule that, when someone accidentally falls under the line on a $1 million figure, they are able to get remedy under the `small business' definition of the ABS rule. You would probably say to me that even that definition of `small business' sometimes is in dispute. I would like to get a response from the minister on that particular point now, if he cares to, or we can wait until we get to our amendments on No. 9.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-04-02,"—If that answer is to be had, we have to refer to the fact that in our amendment we have given the ABS definition or the $1 million level, whichever is the higher. I appreciate the point that Senator Schacht is making. People will still argue about being slightly over and all that sort of thing. But, effectively, we have allowed whichever is the higher to be the determining item.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-04-02,"—There are a number of answers. I will give you the medium length one. I do not want to be too short, because it is a very serious question. It needs to be understood at the outset that this package, as I think Senator Murray and Senator Schacht know better than most, is best defined as a balance. It has found a balance which the small business people of Australia are very supportive of. They want this package. They have, I think as recently as February, put out a statement; it is probably more recent than that. 
The Small Business Coalition, which I think Senator Murray would respect, are a very representative organisation, even though they have bingles on issues within the organisation from time to time. They certainly are not having some disagreement on this. They want this package and they want it in the form that it is in. They do not want it to be fiddled around with.
If you went to the Small Business Coalition and said, `Do you want us to put in some extra definitions about what a small business is?' they would say, `No. Could you please get it through the Senate. If you can get it through before Easter, please get it through before Easter. We don't want any more delay. We don't want another eight or nine inquiries. We don't want to have an inquiry into the definition of a small business. We are happy with the $1 million definition.' The only people who have come to me who are not happy with the $1 million definition are my good and dear old friends who represent the top end of town in the property industry who own the big shopping centres. They want the definition which the original Labor amendment that is on the table was to propose.
So small business want the $1 million threshold. As Senator Schacht says correctly, you will always have arguments at the margin when you have an arbitrary figure. That applies in just about every piece of legislation the Commonwealth or any other government ever passes. So you will always have those arguments at the margin. We have said that, in cases, the courts will obviously make decisions about transactions and particularly artificial schemes to get around this limit to fall outside the bounds of particularly proposed subsection 51AC(8), I think it is.
So that is the answer in the overall scheme of things. The fact is small business want it. They are happy with the $1 million threshold. The only people who are not are the top end of the property industry, the big shopping centre owners.
—What did they want? They wanted less, did they?
—No, they would like to narrow the definition of a small business so the protections apply to a smaller 
 group of people. On our estimations, that could exclude up to two-thirds of retail traders on that definition. That is reality. If you want to exclude thousands of small businesses from the protections that these clauses bring in, you bring in the definition that, say, the Property Council are pushing. I know the question you are asking is whether we could have one or the other—
—No. You say the Property Council want a more restricted definition. Does that mean they want the $1 million threshold in transaction reduced to $500,000 or they want other amendments elsewhere? Do the Property Council have a view about the $1 million figure?
—I had the benefit of a meeting with the Property Council, and they made it quite clear to me—and my very learned adviser has said that my recollection is correct—that they want the ABS definition, which is the 20 employees business, and they have convinced the Labor Party to move that amendment. I think you would know from your own experience, Senator Schacht, that is a much narrower definition and it will exclude a lot of people. That is one of the reasons the government is opposed to it.
We think the $1 million test is fair. Small business want the test. There is no disagreement amongst the small business community. They are absolutely at one on this. They do not want this to be fiddled around with in the Senate. They would like to see this package proceed through the Senate this day. Practically speaking, as senators would understand, if we do put in amendments like this which the government argues are against the interests of small business the bill will have to go back to the House of Representatives and be listed, and the House of Representatives will have to come to a view about the amendments.
Senator Schacht interjecting—
—The two people handling this bill are the Manager of Government Business in the Senate and the Leader of the House (Mr Reith), and we both have two other hats that we wear. I can assure you that from a practical point of view—this 
 is not a threat in any way; it is a practical reality which I think you and Senator Murray would understand better than most—the Small Business Coalition and small business people across Australia have made their views known on this bill. They want this piece of legislation. They do not want any more inquiries or delays; they want it through.
The practical reality of Thursday, 2 April 1998 in the Senate is that we have the opportunity today to pass this legislation. We will be moving on, once the committee stage of this bill is completed, to consider the balance of the second reading debate and the committee stage of the Wik legislation and the government does not expect, with one small exception, to be able to deal with any other business.
As my adviser informs me, small business have waited over 20 years for this sort of reform. From my point of view as Manager of Government Business, if we do not get it through in this form today, we will be forcing on the small business people of Australia a further delay. That is not to say that we will not look at your amendments and debate them, but I say it against that background. Not only are the proposed amendments to the threshold test opposed by small business; those amendments will have the effect of delaying the legislation. Small business have been waiting for 20 years. They have waited year after year for this sort of protection. We are giving it to them, and we would like to see the legislation passed unamended in the Senate today.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-04-02,"—That was unnecessarily provocative. The first time the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997  came before the Senate was, I think, yesterday. This is the first time we have had the opportunity to debate this bill. It was not sent to a Senate committee. The Senate has not been obstructionist.
For the record, the coalition came into power on 3 March 1996. Four months later, on 26 June 1996, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, Geoff Prosser, issued terms of reference to the House of Representatives Standing Committee 
 on Industry, Science and Technology to investigate fair trading issues. Thirteen months after the coalition came into power, on 26 May 1997, that House of Representatives committee tabled its report. Four months after that, which is 17 months after the coalition came into power, the government responded to the fair trading report by tabling its `New deal: fair deal'. In month 19, two months later, on 3 December 1997, the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997 was debated and passed in the House of Representatives. On 4 December 1997 the bill was introduced into the Senate but was not presented to the Senate for debate, and the Senate rose on 5 December 1997. Meanwhile, the coalition is spinning the line that Labor are holding it up. It was a disgrace. They did not hold it up one bit. They were cooperative in every respect on this bill. Twenty-four months after the coalition came to power, it is now early April and the bill comes before us.
Please do not be rude to the Senate about the urgency of this bill when this is the second day the Senate has dealt with it and the government has had, on the account I have just given, 24 months. We will be cooperative with it, but please do not be provocative because we have not done anything to deserve that kind of remark.
The second remark I want to make goes to the views of small business on this bill and the provisions within it. There are 890,000 small businesses. There are, as Minister Reith knows better than anyone, a myriad number of small business organisations and a number of organisations with small business members who have been captured by big business, in my opinion. I am not naming the Small Business Coalition as one of them, but the Small Business Coalition is but one large organisation amongst many. We have had representations from the 40 to 50 small business organisations that I have written and spoken to who have asked us to attend to this definition because it does not meet their particular needs.
I believe we should debate the definition on the merits and not assume that out there 890,000 small businesses and 40 or 50 small 
 business organisations all say that this is a great definition for small business, because they do not. My approach would be to pick up the substantive issues concerning the small business definition when the appropriate amendment comes forward and in the meantime deal with the government's amendments 1 to 10.
I would suggest to the parliamentary secretary that he might like to look at the possibility of excising 9(e) from the amendments. We would see our way to passing amendments 1 to 10 without 9(e). We could then get on with debating further amendments.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-04-02,"—I will just make a short response. I was not seeking to be provocative. I certainly would never seek to provoke Senator Murray. There are probably a couple of people on the other side who provoke me from time to time and I provoke them back. But since Senator Conroy is not here I will not go any further.
I am pointing out to the Senate a pure practicality, which I am sure Senator Murray understands. We are not holding any threat over him. I think he understands well—and he makes that clear from his own contribution—that it would be very hard to find any proposal which would get the approval of every small business person in Australia. But this is an opportunity for the government and for the parliament to deliver something for them which can start up by 1 July. The government believes firmly that we do need the bill in its current form, otherwise you start unbalancing it, unpicking it, and creating uncertainty and putting at risk the potential for this to start up on 1 July.
It is just a practicality of the Senate sitting schedule and the fact that we have a massive amount of stuff to do. We are very pleased with the sort of cooperation we have had. We are seeking more cooperation. If my remarks, which were not meant to be provocative, put that in jeopardy then I apologise to you, the Senate and particularly the small business people of Australia. I am here to try to get this through unamended.
We do need government amendment No. 9. It is something that will improve the legislation and make the $1 million threshold limit clearer and make interpretation of it clearer. So we do seek your support for each one of those government amendments.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-04-02,"—Thank you for your gracious response. I did ask your opinion as to  whether you would consider dropping 9(e), in which case we would be able to then support your package.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-04-02,"—I thought Senator Murray might talk a bit longer so I thought I would have another couple of minutes privately with the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) in the advisers box. What I wanted to raise is this definition. In view of what the government has said—that this definition of $1 million is approved by the range of small business organisations, et cetera—what I wanted to raise with the minister is that I have a letter from one of the small business groups, which is the Australian Petroleum Agents and Distributors Association, which was sent to me and to many others signed by Gerry Watts, the general manager, making it quite clear that they do not support the limit of $1 million. They do not want that limit. They think many of their members, for various reasons, would be over the wrong side of the $1 million. I have to agree that APADA is not a big small business organisation, but it is in the petroleum industry which is bedevilled over issues of franchising and so on.
I will bring it to the attention of the minister that I have taken the trouble here in the last minute or so to contact the biggest small business organisation in Australia which genuinely represents small to medium sized business, the MTAA, and asked them their view about this definition. They have made it quite clear that for their members—and they represent 250,000, I am told—they do not want any limit of $1 million in here at all. They would seek the Senate to delete paragraph 7 of the original bill, which says:
A reference in this section to the supply or possible supply of goods and services does not include a 
 reference to the supply or possible supply of goods or services at a price in excess of $1,000,000, or such higher amount as is prescribed.
The advice from the MTAA, just two minutes ago, is that they want that deleted because they believe that, even with that and the ABS definition—because the ABS definition includes part time; and that is an industry with lots of casual employees—of 20, including casual employees, many of the small businesses in the MTAA industry will fall out because they are too big for the $1 million and they will fall out because they have more than 20 employees.
That was the direct advice I just had from the MTAA. I asked them whether I could raise this here on the floor of the Senate. So they are suggesting to the Senate that the definition of $1 million and even the ABS definition be excluded. They have actually said that they are rapidly preparing material to be circulated to all senators right now on this particular view.
I do not like coming in here and raising this. That is why I tried to talk to the minister privately about just where we are at with a range of small business organisations. The MTAA is a major small business organisation. Within the small business forum I think it represents over 200,000 small businesses in one form or another.
I must say that I do not believe we should write legislation according to the last lobby group that rings you or speaks to you, but in this case I would be nervous, to say the least, on behalf of the opposition, to move into this area if there is such a large small business organisation that believes this definition is far too limiting for their members. All that will mean is that within 12 to 18 months we will be back here having a blue, an argument or representations that the thing is too narrow. I know that the minister, certainly the opposition, would rather have this given a fair go for several years where there is not an immediate argument over demarcation or dispute over what that level is.
So, again, I seek advice from the government as to what exactly have you got as advice from the small business groups in the community—as diverse as they are—that they 
 are overwhelmingly willing to accept the $1 million. I accept the fact that the ABS definition might even, in some senses, be more restrictive, and I can see why the Property Council of Australia would favour that. That probably proves the point why the MTAA wants that knocked out as well. They think that the ABS definition would do them in but they also think that the $1 million limit would do them in. That is why Mike Delaney and his efficient organisation will now be rapidly sending faxes to everybody saying, `Drop the lot.' I would like to receive from the minister at the table the response to the range of small business views on this.
If we deleted your subsequent amendment No. 9, which you have circulated, plus the original subsection 7, which contains the $1 million limit, what would be the consequence if there was no definition? I know the first thing is that some other big business will claim that they are being hard done by, et cetera, and so you will end up with Coles-Myer challenging Woolworths or vice versa, which none of us want. This is for small business. I have to say that the more I here of this debate, I think the $1 million is not a large amount of money these days, and that is certainly the argument of the MTAA. But I would be happy to get a response from you. Can the advisers say more about what the position would be if there was complete excision of those definitions?",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-04-02,"—I am very happy to give leave for one of my advisers to go and talk to you privately behind the screen. With respect to the MTAA, there is clearly an issue there. That issue affects a significant number of people, but probably of the order of 1,000-odd. I think we are talking mostly of the intermediaries in that business. Can I just say at the outset that the MTAA has welcomed the package as a whole.
—We are not arguing that.
—They have made it very clear that they want the package. The Small Business Coalition, the SBC, said as recently as a month ago in a press release they put out after their meeting here in Can 
 berra on 27 February, that they want the draft bill passed and they want the start date to be 1 July. Senator Murray has made the point that the Small Business Coalition does not represent everyone—but all the other organisations do as well.
The MTAA has come out and supported the package. Marcus Kollington from the Service Station Association said, in relation to the oil code part of it, that:
Service stations will finally be able to obtain fuel supplies on equal and competitive terms so that they can compete with new entrants into the market like Woolworths.
He also said:
Services stations would also have a much stronger code of practice to protect them because of the government's proposal to add a new section 51AC to the Trade Practices Act. The new act will also ensure that there is protection from unfair conduct or exploitation for dealers and would mean that all small businesses are entitled to proper disclosure of information before they enter into agreements with oil companies or big business.
So this has clearly been raised with the MTAA, Senator Schacht, and I think you will be getting some private advice about that shortly. There is a group of people who, because they are intermediaries in the oil market, have a very high turnover and, as a matter of definition, have a small staff. So they are not going to be protected by this and they do have a concern there. But, under the negotiations going on in relation to the oil code—and that general process which may lead to arbitration—I understand and I am advised that those concerns can be dealt with through that process and they cannot be through this legislation, but that is an exception.
That brings me to amendment No. 9. Senator Schacht asked what would happen if you just pulled out all together the clause in relation to the $1 million threshold. If this were done you would then open it up for big business to use this as a weapon against small business—and we are trying to go the other way. Senator Murray, the importance of paragraph (e) in amendment 9 is that it includes the capital amount within the threshold. It clarifies that the $1 million transac 
 tion includes the capital amount and not just the loan, the interest and the fees.
Without the 9(e) amendment it could be interpreted that the transaction would include only the fees, the interest and any other items related to a loan in relation to the provision of either goods or services and would apply only to the repayments and not the capital. That would mean that you would capture, potentially, much larger businesses because, clearly, for repayments and fees of $1 million these days—with the historically low interest rates that the coalition has been able to engineer through its exceptionally good fiscal economic management—you can obviously borrow an enormous amount of money with repayments of $1 million. At six or seven per cent interest rates, it would bring in an enormous amount of capital. Paragraph (e) has been put in amendment 9 to ensure that this legislation is a weapon for small business—that it is part of their armory and not yet another part of the armory in the already well-stocked weaponry of big business. This is to try and even up the balance and 9(e) is essential to achieving that.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-04-02,"—I am going to have to repeat all this when Senator Schacht comes back, because I do not think Senator Schacht has fully grasped the alternative amendment we have put forward, and it is relevant to this discussion. There are four aspects to the definitional process. The first is the proposition as to whether there should be a threshold. It is quite plain that the government have made the determination that there shall be a threshold, that small business shall be defined, and for what we think are good reasons, so we are likely to support the threshold argument. The second aspect relates to an ease of definition with which the community as a whole and the business community are content, and that is the definition which is the ABS definition. However, that is unnecessarily restrictive in this instance. The government have introduced a $1 million threshold, but the $1 million threshold, unless it is limited, may not cover not only service stations but all the hundreds of thousands of tenants who have made application to us as falling under 
 neath that because over the 10-year span of a lease they could easily exceed $1 million.
That leads us to the question of making sure that the $1 million provision of goods and services should be further defined as 12 months, in other words, you have to receive in 12 months $1 million worth of goods and services supplied by a particular supplier. That can be in the form of rent, it can be in the form of fuel. There are many businesses with high turnovers and low margins which are small businesses which easily will receive $1 million worth of beer in a year or $1 million worth of fuel in a year, et cetera. So we cannot conduct the definitional argument without paying attention to the propositions put forward as I have outlined. The amalgam of amendments we have put together, namely, the ABS definition or the $1 million, whichever is the higher, but the $1 million has to be within a year, is the appropriate definition.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-04-02,"—I would like to indicate that the Greens (WA) have listened so far to the argument and have given some consideration to what is being put up by the Democrats when we come to it later under their amendment No. 6 as an alternative definition in conjunction with their amendment No. 7, which specifies the period of 12 months. I think that does address a number of the concerns that Senator Schacht was talking about in relation to the government's definition. What we then have to deal with, if Senator Schacht is actually in the chamber to hear the arguments, is that hopefully there might be a possibility of support in the Senate for that change of definition, and then the concerns of the Motor Trade Association are taken into consideration. If they have maybe half a dozen employees, they could still access the provisions that are provided under this bill. That is obviously important.
The issue of the loan is a little more problematic. It is a matter of whether or not that amendment 9(e) provides more access in total or whether the insertion of (e) cuts more people out. I think that is what we are debating at the moment, and that certainly has not been made clear by what the minister has been saying so far.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-04-02,"—I would like to respond to Senator Margetts and the point raised by Senator Murray a bit earlier. One of the things about this $1 million threshold is that it not the size of the business, it is actually the size of the transaction. By seeking to define it with a period of time you may seek to help the group of people from the MTA, but you may, when you are doing that, exclude thousands of other small retailers in shopping centres. That is why they are so happy with this definition, because it comes down to transactions.
One of the transactions might be the lease to get hold of their space in the shopping centre. That is why the shopping centre owners, the big property groups—who are probably going to kill me after I have said all this—want to try to narrow it. They would seek to try to narrow it in the way that you are describing in terms of putting a time limit on it, or they would seek to try to narrow it by putting a limit on the number of employees. They would love to do that because it makes it easy to exclude a lot of their tenants from the protections of the act, whereas the $1 million transaction test will ensure that more small businesses are included. I have said, in relation to the group of people whom the MTA have raised, that there is a process going on at the moment, and going to mediation is part of the process, the oil code and the franchise code, and we think that is the most appropriate way to do it. But, if you seek to alter this threshold in the legislation, you run the serious risk of losing the protection for potentially thousands of small business people, and it is a very real risk.
Another point should be made: I am informed that the $1 million amount, as set in the legislative framework, can be altered by regulation. Once the legislation comes into effect we will, of course, be monitoring to see whether the $1 million threshold is appropriate and that it does work in practice. If, as a result of that monitoring, some alteration needs to be made it can be done by regulation. But that only reinforces the fact that it is important to keep the threshold clear.
Senator Murray talks about the employee test. One of the problems with that—I have seen the amendments proposed by the Democrats and the opposition—is that you would have to seek to define how that test is applied. Does the definition refer to full-time, part-time or casual employees? What time in the financial year would you count the number of employees? You again get the definitional problem that Senator Schacht raised in his very first interjection in the debate: what if it is $1,000,001 or $999,999? You have the same problem—in fact much bigger problems—if you seek to add in some alternative tests. We believe that the $1 million transaction test is the best test. The Small Business Coalition and almost all of the other bodies that represent businesses in Australia support it and want this legislation in this form and do not want to tinker with the test as it is.
But, as we have said, the $1 million threshold can be changed by regulation. We would seek to get that in and if the $1 million needs to be changed for some reason then we can do so by disallowable instrument and see how it goes.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-04-02,"—I appreciate the fact that I had a chance to talk to the minister's adviser, who happens to be the minister in the other place, privately and the information he provided, which included the fact that the $1 million figure is a disallowable instrument and can be adjusted as a disallowable instrument from time to time. That does give further flexibility. As I said to Minister Reith, whatever the cut-off figure is it will be under review and there will be plenty of people in the industry rapidly making their points of view known if this figure means that too many people are falling outside the definition and cannot get remedy. There will be political pressure for it to come back here and be adjusted. As it is by disallowable instrument it will be much easier to do than put an amendment through the parliament again. So that does assuage one of my partial fears; there is a greater flexibility about the $1 million.
Senator Murray has again pointed out to me a very important point that the opposition gives weight to. He wants the $1 million to 
 be limited to a 12-month period, which means that under the definition more small businesses would fall into the category of $1 million than would under a definition that is not time limited. With the transaction period going over several years, a motorcar salesman would probably run into tens of millions of dollars of transactions and therefore clearly fall outside the $1 million definition. That Democrat amendment does seem to have considerable merit.
I agree with Senator Murray in that it is probably too late to move rapidly to the suggestion made by Mr Delaney a while ago that we have no limit at all and leave it open. We are too far gone to go down that track at the moment, and it can be changed by regulation. However, Senator Murray again makes the point in his amendment, which we are sympathetic to, that if you put the ABS definition in, whichever is the greater is an important point. Minister Reith did point out to me privately that they do not like the idea of having a range of definitions, but at least the court can decide. That is a reasonable process. I was a bit suspicious when we were advised that the Property Council of Australia was very keen on the ABS definition. I thought that this proves what a quagmire you are often in with small business—the interests of the Property Council are not necessarily the same as those of the small business community and retail tenancies in shopping centres, et cetera. So I accept that in some cases the ABS definition would, by itself, be more restrictive but by having the option of whichever is the greater overcomes that point.
—The MTAA concerns are dealt with that way.
—Yes. In particular, the 12-month limit on the transaction has some merit. The opposition does not want to delay the bill or play around, but one thing I do suggest to the minister is that maybe we could deal with other amendments and come back to this one at the end of the committee stage because there may be some position we can negotiate on as we get more information. I am not opening this up to have 100 small business organisations streaming down in here 
 to lob pieces of paper on top of us; that would only make it more confusing.
—That is the next debate.
—Yes. The opposition thinks that the Democrat amendment at the moment has considerable merit. I can certainly say that in the petroleum and motorcar industries, businesses that most of us would consider to be small businesses have transactions greater than $1 million, whichever way you try to add it up. Those industries have been bedevilled by franchising disputes. The minister can say, quite rightly, that the franchising code will cover a number of these and they have to get to an agreement. They have never been able to agree to a franchising code generally. In fact, the motor manufacturers have never even agreed to the view that their retailers are franchisees. That was my experience. Despite the extraordinary evidence that they were franchisees, they have always said that they were not. They went through a convoluted debate and discussion to prove, when I was minister, that their franchisees were not franchisees—because they did not want to sign onto a code.
Those issues make me a little nervous about saying, `Let us leave it until the code. They will sign on to the code, the code will be covered generally because of the fair trading provisions here and elsewhere it will give greater strength to that code to be used in the court.' I am also cognisant that there is such suspicion in this industry between the franchisees and the manufacturers, between the petrol retailers and the petrol companies, that it is extremely difficult to get them to agree on anything—even to meet. That is why I think giving the definition here some more latitude, so that more of those retailers and franchisees in the motor industry, in its various aspects, could fall inside the definition by using Senator Murray's amendment, has some merit. I raise that to get a response. It might be an idea if we do leave this particular amendment until later in the committee stage so that there can be a bit more discussion.
I have to say, Minister and your senior adviser, that we are not interested in having this hang around or in beating people to death 
 over it. I accept that there are a range of arguments and that this is a grey area. We accept that there is going to have to be a cut-off point and a threshold test, but we want to make sure that it is a reasonable threshold test. So far, the Democrats's amendment seems to deal with most of our concerns.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-04-02,"—I would like to give a practical reason as to why we think the either-or approach should work. If you were a small business and you had to go to court to prove that you qualified under the threshold test, you can imagine how you would have to scramble through your papers to establish that you bought a million dollars worth of goods or services from somebody. If you rang up the brewery or if you rang up the oil company you might well get an evidentiary piece of paper; but if it was from some wholesaler it would be very difficult to accumulate the information. If you happened to have five employees, which you might in a liquor store, or 15 employees, which you might in a service station, it would be very easy to go along to the court and say, `Here are my wage records. I employ 15 part-time and full-time employees, so I fall under the ABS definition.'
What you have to accept is that small businesses are not likely to rush off to the courts anyway—that is always a thing they try to avoid—but when they do have to they are often not as well organised or as well equipped as they might need to be. You need to make it possible for them to easily access the courts. That is why I have sought to give you the either-or definition with whichever is the higher, because accumulating the evidence that they fall under the $1 million goods and services cut-off might prove, evidentially, quite difficult to do.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-04-02,"—It seems to me that we could advance by asking for everything except government amendment No. 9, then deal with government amendment No. 9 after we have reached the point in the procedure where we are actually dealing with Senator Murray's amendments Nos 6 and 7. Then we would know what we were polishing off, if you like.
It seems clear from the debate in the chamber that everybody who has spoken has issued their notice of intent, if you like, that what they are trying to do is to include as many of the small businesses as possible. The earlier debate between Senator Schacht and Senator Ian Campbell was whether or not their definition was more inclusive. Of course, Senator Murray and I would argue that Senator Murray's amendment would deal with both of those and actually achieve what seems to be being asked for by both sides. I think we will serve our purpose better by doing it the way I have suggested. I move:
That further consideration of amendment No. 9 be postponed.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
—My suggestion is that we deal with government amendments Nos 1 to 7 and 10, and extract No. 8 from that group. We will deal with No. 8 when we deal with the Democrat amendment to government amendment No. 8. The question is that amendments Nos 1 to 7 and 10 be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-04-02,"—I just want to put on the record that the opposition is supporting these amendments. One reason we are particularly pleased to do so is that one deals with the definition of franchising as an industry. I think it is a significant step forward that, by legislation, that industry has got the recognition.
Some years ago, there was a major inquiry by the ABS on the size of this industry and, to many people's surprise, the franchising industry was found to have a turnover of $40 billion or thereabouts, which is by no means a small industry employing several hundred thousand people in full- and part-time work. With, I think, over a 1,000 franchisors operating and growing, the growth in the industry was found to be around 17 per cent in that survey by the ABS.
So the franchising industry—and its structure and operation—is an extraordinarily important part now of the Australian economy. It has not been given recognition in the past by the parliament, by governments and by political parties because it has always been seen as something a bit new that is not really 
 in the mainstream of industry policy—commercial policy—in Australia. But there is no doubt that a properly run franchising arrangement is a very good way for new people to join, and become adept at being in small business. If they have a decent arrangement with a franchisor, it can provide the framework of how to run their business and give them guidance. Many people have been successful in small business by entering it through a franchise arrangement.
Unfortunately, there have been lots of appalling cases in recent years where people have entered into franchising arrangements, firstly, without doing proper due diligence about what they were getting themselves into or, secondly, being misled quite deliberately by a franchisor. It was very unfortunate that in 1996 the then minister, Mr Prosser, allowed the voluntary franchising code in this country to collapse because, once it collapsed, there was no guidance at all left for potential franchisees to understand that they were dealing with a franchisor who had signed up to the then voluntary code. This was a retrograde step for the industry.
Mr Prosser, as I said yesterday in another debate, made an unfortunate judgment, to say the least, that the issues of the franchising industry could be best dealt with by the franchisors' association taking charge of running the code by being able to represent both franchisors and franchisees—a bizarre suggestion. That is a bit like saying the employer and the union would both get together and sort out the best interests of everybody. We all know that the interests of employees and employers are not always going to be exactly the same, and the interests of franchisors and franchisees are not always going to be the same. Fortunately in the end for the industry, the demise of Mr Prosser meant that those suggestions have gone off the table—thank goodness they have—and I want to congratulate the government because its policy is in line with what ours has been for a number of years: that there will now be a recognition of the franchising industry in the legislation as an industry and that there will be an opportunity to develop a franchising code that will be backed by the 
 legislation. This will be an enormous step forward.
The franchising industry in Australia, therefore, will be given the confidence to continue to grow without horror stories appearing from time to time in the media—as has occurred in recent times—of some new franchisee being diddled, being done out of their money. Unfortunately, we have had cases where people, who have taken a redundancy package in their forties, have sought to buy a franchise to invest in, to run it as their own business, and have found that the rules and the operation of the particular franchise have led them to lose their money because they were without proper protection. There have been too many of those cases.
The review that was done three or four years ago by the ABS found that about 20 per cent of all franchisors in Australia were in dispute with their franchisees, a figure that was far too high for the good running and good reputation of this industry. Therefore, this government's amendment should really be welcomed by the franchising industry. The opposition welcomes it. It provides a base for this industry to continue to grow even more strongly on the basis of encouraging, in particular and in many ways, the further development of small business in Australia.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1

51AE  Industry codes
(1)	 The Commission may make a code for a particular industry for the purposes of this part.
(2)	 The Commission must not make a code unless it is satisfied that: 

	 (a)	 interested persons in the industry have had an adequate opportunity to be consulted on the code and have had their submissions taken into account; and
	 (b)	 the code represents a fair standard of conduct for the industry.
(3)	 The Commission may accept a code proposed by the relevant industry bodies representing suppliers and business consumers if it is satisfied that the code meets the requirements of section (2).
(4)	 The Commission may amend or revoke a code after providing for interested persons in the industry to have an adequate opportunity to be consulted on the amendment or revocation.
(5)	 Codes made under this section are mandatory codes, unless the Commission determines that the public interest would best be served by the code being a voluntary code.
(6)	 Where the Commission determines that a code is voluntary, the code must specify the method by which a corporation agrees to be bound by the code and the method by which it ceases to be so bound (by reference to provisions of the code or otherwise).
(7)	 A code made by the Commission under subsection (1), and any amendment to a code, made under subsection (4), is a disallowable instrument.
These three amendments refer to the codes of conduct changes. Codes of conduct set standards of acceptable commercial behaviour, which can then be taken into account by the courts in interpreting the act. The Democrats regard industry-specific codes of conduct as absolutely essential if the new unconscionable trading provisions of the Trade Practices Act are to work effectively. Without such standards, the legal protection in the new provisions of the Trade Practices Act may be read very narrowly by the courts and therefore afford little protection to small businesses.
Experience with industry codes of conduct demonstrates the absolute necessity of such codes being mandatory on all participants in an industry and underpinned by legislation. Senator Schacht would know, from his period as a minister, that they tried voluntary codes and, in the case of the franchising council, it proved to be a disaster. I think the experiment was worthwhile but it failed.
This became apparent in the events leading up to the collapse of the Franchising Code 
 Council in January 1997. I remind those listening that the franchising industry is estimated to be worth something in the order of $42 billion. This was not a minor event in Australian commercial history.
The franchising code failed because of the lack of mandatory codes of conduct.
In its report of July 1997 the Reid committee on fair trading examined the events leading to the collapse of the Franchising Code Council and concluded that voluntary self-regulatory codes did not work. It was a unanimous decision from the members of the House of Representatives committee who were bipartisan, and in that case they were Liberal and Labor Party members. That committee called for national franchising legislation to regulate franchising. That is why Senator Schacht made his remarks. Further, it called for the ACCC to have the power to prescribe codes of conduct in other industries as well.
The government has rejected these recommendations, instead reiterating its belief in voluntary self-regulation as the best way forward. It has, however, proposed that the minister can by regulation determine a code to be mandatory and hence underpinned by the Trade Practices Act.
That might be alright if we had a minister who was warm to the proposition that most should be mandatory. However, in his `New deal: fair deal' statement—somewhat to our surprise—Minister Peter Reith said this would only occur if voluntary codes failed and there was continuing unfair conduct. Our view is that that is not good enough.
While the government had agreed to make franchising and oil industry codes mandatory, the Democrats are concerned that leaving the decision in the hands of the minister, rather than the ACCC, will make it almost impossible for further codes, such as those on retail tenancies—and that is the critical one—or those on small business finance to be made mandatory. Unless codes are mandatory or able to be pushed towards agreement by the ACCC, standards of acceptable behaviour may never be developed in key industries.
Voluntary codes tend to be extremely weak because they need the agreement of those most affected and, when interests are opposed, voluntarism just does not work. Without the movement towards mandatory codes of conduct, the unconscionable conduct provisions are unlikely to provide much assistance for small business because of the generality of the provisions.
The changes we propose will allow the ACCC to impose codes of conduct on recalcitrant businesses, thereby giving small businesses the protection they not only need but have made the case for, and which the report in the House of Representatives agreed with. Our amendments propose not only to fulfil the aims of the government, but to strengthen them by requiring codes of conduct to be enforceable and mandatory.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-04-02,"—There is much of what Senator Murray has just said that the opposition cannot in any way disagree with. We certainly have the same view that voluntary codes do not work. I went through the agony of that for three years and they do not work. There only needs to be a couple of hiccups and the whole thing collapses.
I went through the experience with the oil industry of trying to negotiate a voluntary code and for three months we could not even get both sides to agree to sit in the same room together. That was one of the most extraordinary performances by any industry that I have ever seen. The only reason they agreed to sit together in the end was a threat from the government that, if they did not agree to sit, we would take action on their behalf and they both might end up with an outcome that they would both hate. I am an absolute devotee of the view that voluntary codes do not work any more. If we want a decently run industry with proper and transparent rules, mandatory codes are the way to go.
This is not an ideological issue or that the opposition believes that this is government intervention, et cetera, simply because we believe in government intervention. It is as a result of practical experience that we know that voluntary codes do not work. We tried the voluntary code route in the early to mid- 
 nineties and it did not work. There was always someone willing to put a spanner in the works to stop the voluntary codes from working. There only had to be one person who said no, or who disagreed or was obstructionist for the whole thing to fall apart, despite endless meetings. Some of the disparate interests make it almost impossible to get a code together .
In the end, the only way to get a code is to say to them, `You have got a period of time to draw it up, but in the end, if you don't, the government will do it and it will be mandatory.' It is much better if they draw the code up, then the government implements it and makes it mandatory after they have drawn it up. But in the end, if they do not agree, then the government has to do it.
I want to say to Senator Murray that I have some concerns about this amendment. The reason why the opposition will not support it is this issue of the ACCC drawing up the codes rather than the minister. It is too early to tell whether the ACCC itself will be the best body to draw up and run the codes. It is a new body. It has only been going a couple of years. I have already had some experience in my other responsibilities and I think there are deficiencies in the ACCC. It may be because of lack of resources or it may be a lack of development of institutional skills, particularly in handling a range of codes.
I do not know whether the ACCC will handle it any more quickly. Being a statutory authority, their very nature is that they will often go to the lowest common denominator when trying to reach agreement and we might end up with a code that is not actually worth that much. They may themselves be obstructed by the various interest groups.
I have considerable qualms that the present ACCC is not well-resourced and does not have a developed institutional memory to handle this as well as being the gatekeeper on the legislation itself. I do not know whether there is some problem in law and whether, if they are drawing up the code but then they have to penalise somebody, there is a natural justice issue at stake here. I am not sure. That is probably not the case and I hope so, but one never knows. Some clever lawyer might 
 find a way of saying that, if the ACCC has drawn up the code, they then cannot impose it or carry out penalties on it.
I think the final issue is of much more importance, when we consider the present state of play of small business in Australia. It is: I believe that the minister has to take responsibility for drawing up the code and imposing it, using the resources of his or her department in consultation with the industry.
—That's what you said about Robert Hill and the Natural Heritage Trust.
—Absolutely, I agree. I am glad you interjected. That is because in here we can chase Senator Hill down every day about what he has or has not done in allocating the money. At least in here every day and at estimates we get a chance to ask him questions such as, `Why did you make this allocation?' That is what I have always argued. I would much rather have the minister answering questions at the table in the parliament or at the estimates committee than deal with a statutory authority that has some so-called independence from the parliament, whether it is Telstra or anybody else. The longer I am here, the more I come to the view that it is better to have the minister responsible than to have a statutory authority responsible.
In this case, if there is need for a mandatory code—and there will be—and the minister does not respond, we have a better chance here, politically, to put the heat on the minister to get it done and respond than through the ACCC or any other statutory authority. With a body such as that, the devices of obfuscation—being absent, not being seen in action, et cetera—are much greater than those of a minister. I have always had that view, and I have an even stronger view now.
Finally, the mandatory code should be a disallowable instrument. With the ACCC—and Senator Murray might clarify this for me—will a mandatory code be a disallowable instrument? In view of the debate we are having in the small business community, I would much rather it be a disallowable instrument for which the minister is responsible. 
 The parliament then can debate and disallow it, and tell the minister to come back and try again. That will make it much more open and transparent, and the minister will take the cheers or the jeers accordingly.
That of course means that lots of interest groups in the community will be through the minister's door, demanding this or that in the code; and they will be through the door of the opposition of the day, the door of the Democrats or of anybody else. That is a better political process than trying to nail Alan Fels at an estimates hearing about when he is going to produce the code? After my experience with Mr Fels over the Australis issue of telecommunications, I am not confident that you will not get other than obfuscation, unless he himself or the commission believes in a particular code.
 Senator Murray, I have to say that there is a view around in the bureaucracy that, by and large, the leading government departments—Treasury, Finance, PM&C—are against mandatory codes. They believe that it is government intervention; they would rather not have them. If you leave it to the ACCC, responsible to the Treasurer and the Treasury Department and being involved in that portfolio, I know the pressure they will be under: do not go the mandatory way, leave it to be done by the free market, leave it for a voluntary code. That means that small business gets done over.
That is the view held by Treasury, the Finance department and also their acolytes in PM&C. I can testify to that from my own experience as a minister for small business. That is the view of the free marketeers. We do not want to let them loose saying, `Let the free market help small business'—because it does not. The free market, without some rules and intervention through parliament, means that big business will always win.
Therefore, I am very suspicious of leaving it that way. For whatever shortcomings there are—and it may be Senator Hill with a heritage fund—at least we get to ask him every day, `How come that money went somewhere?' If the minister for small business is in the parliament, we get to ask him, `How come you haven't done a mandatory code for 
 the oil industry?' I think that is a very important principle that we in the opposition will argue, particularly with the state of small business in Australia today. The hand of government has to be involved in this, because I think that is the most transparent way to get the best outcome.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-04-02,"—To say this I think is probably very unkind of me, but I will say it anyway: Senator Schacht, where were you in 1995 when we were dealing with the issue of competition policy and the concerns that parties like the Greens (WA) had in relation to the set-up of the ACCC? I happen to think Allan Fels is a decent human being. But I think with the way the ACCC was set up—yes, exactly—it was unaccountable, it was amorphous, it was poorly resourced and it was unstructured. We set it a task to do which, quite clearly, was going to be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to do with any kind of assurance that it would be able to undertake it with the best interests of the wider community in mind.
So it is all very well, Senator Schacht, now admitting that the ACCC has some serious problems—yes, I have been talking to you for the last few minutes, Senator Schacht; however, you were missing in action. The ALP was in government in 1995 when everybody else was expressing their deep concerns about that amorphous mass, if you like, that the ACCC was being set up as and is now becoming. So it is nice that now it is being discovered what deep concerns many other people in the rest of the community have. It is still not too late, but I do wish that the ALP had been thinking more clearly before shoving it through onto the rest of the community in 1995.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1

 some points that do demand a response—and I will seek to make it more succinctly than Senator Schacht did.
The ACCC does already have a role in the making of these codes. I think it is important that people understand that the government—and Senator Schacht gave credit, which we thank him for, where it was due—is in the process of developing these codes for the oil industry and the franchise industry, as it will officially be known when this bill goes through. The oil code negotiations are being facilitated, as some honourable senators would know, by Andrew Rogers QC, and that process is under way. So we have them in the room, Senator Schacht. We hope that, when we get them out of the room, we will have a code and that that code will be a disallowable instrument.
The code will come here, and Senator Murray, Senator Schacht and all of us will be able to have a look at it. But it will be a disallowable instrument—and the minister will be responsible for it, as you have said.
Likewise, with the franchise code, the first draft is out there. I am informed that the second draft will be out next week for discussion. Ultimately, again, that will come through that process. We believe it will make this far more accountable. I join Senator Schacht in congratulating the minister and the government on achieving the significant steps down the process. The passage of this legislation will benefit that process.

In regard to the opposition amendments which have been circulated, we are moving in accordance with the Reid recommendation that the term `unfair' instead of `unconscionable' be used in the bill. This is directly in line with recommendation 6 of the Reid report.
The whole of chapter 6 of the Reid report details in a very convincing way arguments as to why the term `unfair' has a wider application than the term `unconscionable'. We have accepted the Reid recommendation, which was a unanimous recommendation, a bipartisan recommendation, from Labor and Liberal, and I think the National Party was represented on the committee as well. The Reid report in paragraph 6.70 states:
The word `unfair' has the strong advantage of being widely understood, being part of the everyday moral vocabulary of all Australians. Indeed, fairness is the social value central to the maintenance of social cohesion and the legitimacy of the social system. It has the added advantage of directly addressing the problem as it is usually articulated.
Indeed, Mr Aiken of the Attorney-General's Department advised the Reid committee:
To the extent that I do not think a court would singularly seize upon the words oppressive or unfair to set aside contracts which they personally do not agree with, then it is probably a fair comment that the courts would continue to act judicially.
We believe this is an important amendment. In my own experience in trying to explain the phrase when I was small business minister under my own package, the debate about unconscionable conduct was not an easy one in the general community. Though `unconscionable conduct' has been in the existing Trade Practices Act in various forms since its inception in 1974, I think the word `unfair', as recommended by the Reid committee, is a more appropriate term. Therefore, we support and ask the Senate to support the Reid recommendation for the use of the term `unfair' instead of `unconscionable'.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-04-02,"—How do I say to Senator Schacht that we both fully agree with you and disagree with you?
—That is just the usual part of being in small business I think, Senator Murray.
—Yes. I will tell you first why we fully agree with you. We fully agree with you because your amendment reflects the intent and the content of the Reid fair trading report. We agree with you because your amendment reflects the promises which I heard your small business shadow minister make to numerous small business meetings at which I was present, that you would put up the fair conduct provisions, and that was generally well received. The small business meetings which I attended were very responsive to that from us. I, too, made the promise that we would do so. As you will see in our later amendments, I have done so.
The government has chosen to disagree, and that is where we run into a problem. Earlier we were debating what small business feel about the definitional problem. Some are in support, some are against. I am afraid that not quite the same problem exists. But the same problem does exist to an extent with this definition because every small business is at least saying, `Let the government's amend 
 ment in this respect get through on unconscionable conduct.' No-one is saying, `Do not do that,' but there are a number of organisations—as you and I know—who are saying, `But we would prefer the unfair conduct provisions.'
The problem for me is that, whilst I personally and my party prefer the unfair conduct provisions, we are afraid that if we substitute one for the other when the government have explicitly rejected it, they will reject that decision in the lower house. We do not want to arrive at that situation. In my own amendment what I have done is to move the unfair conduct provisions but additional to the unconscionable provisions which may not be pleaded in the alternative. In other words, you have to choose one or the other. I do not intend now, unless called upon, to outline my arguments for that. I recognise, incidentally, some of the problems with that.
Despite our strong support for the Reid fair trading report, despite our belief that the fair conduct recommendations of the Reid committee are better than the government's solution, because of the way in which small businesses are expressing their need for this to go through, I regret that I am unable to support your particular amendment. If I have explained why I both agree and disagree, I have done my best.
—You mentioned you have a further amendment where you leave an option open for `unconscionable' or `unfair'. Can you tell me which amendment on the running sheet that is? I know we have not got to it yet.
—Senator Schacht, it is probably best seen if you refer to the items (1) and (2) on sheet 885, immediately following that which we are discussing now. Just to explain what I have just said, I draw your attention to item (1)(10) on sheet 885, which says:
(10)	 An application to the Court under this section cannot be made by a person if that person has already made an application under section 51AC—
This is the government's area. What I am trying to do is get the best of both worlds.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-04-02,"—I am sure that Senator Murray has listened to the argument, but I think I should place it on the record because it is a crucial part of the debate on the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997 . The government did look very closely at this issue. There is no doubt at all about where the Reid committee was leading on this and there is no doubt at all about the government wanting to achieve a better legal option for small businesses who are disadvantaged by unconscionable conduct and to give them a clear legal remedy in that case. We did look at it in the context of having received the Reid committee report and we sought a wide range of advice. We agreed and we recognised that, in principle, small business does suffer the same disadvantages as consumers.
Those disadvantages can be defined as things like information asymmetry—where bigger businesses obviously have more access to information which they can use to their benefit and small businesses do not have access to that information or do not have time to access the information because it is not worth their while. One of them is information asymmetry—which I am sure is a meaningless term for most people in the world. It basically means that, because of their resources, because of their legal departments, because of all of the advice that they can buy because of their very size, big business can gather together information and, as the old cliche goes, information is power. Big businesses have more access to information by dint of their size.
Small businesses suffer disadvantages in terms of access to expertise—I have already described that—and the cost of those sorts of things. The government recognises that. We also recognise the reality that consumers have had greater success in dealing with unconscionable conduct under section 51AB of the Trade Practices Act. We also recognise and we understand the argument that Senator Schacht made in relation to people's concept of what `unconscionable' is. It is a concept which I guess is harder for people in the 
 street to come to grips with, whereas if you tell someone, in layman's terms, `That is unfair,' they understand it. However, the courts, who have dealt with these matters, have a clear understanding and the common law in relation to `unconscionable' as a legal concept is a lot clearer than that of `unfair'. So, as much as the Reid committee, I am sure, having heard evidence from people around Australia, would have opted for `unfair', we believe you actually deliver better legal certainty and better remedies for small business under the option that we have got. By obviously going down the `unconscionable' route, we have picked up all of the conventional criteria for establishing unconscionable conduct—I quote from the Department of the Parliament Library's Bills Digest—which include:
.	 ignorance of material facts known to the other party
.	 illiteracy or lack of education
.	 poverty or need of any kind
.	 age
.	 infirmity of body or mind
.	 drunkenness
.	 lack of assistance or explanation where these are necessary
.	 emotional dependence (e.g. a spouse who is pressured to sign a guarantee for a partner's business loan).
Then we buttress those with a whole load of new guidelines; we boost it. Of course, they are included in 51AC(3) which says:
(3)	 Without limiting in any way the matters to which the Court may have regard—
And then it adds a whole load of other things. These do not have to be taken together; they can be taken individually or together. I will not go through them all because they cover two tightly typed pages, but they look at things like the relative strengths of the bargaining positions of the supplier and the business consumer. They look at whether, as a result of conduct engaged in by the supplier, the business consumer was required to comply with conditions that were not reasonably necessary for the protection of the legitimate interests of the suppliers. I will pick some others out at random:
(G)	 the requirements of any applicable industry code—
Let us pick (I) for a lucky dip. It states:
. . . the extent to which the supplier unreasonably failed to disclose to the business consumer:
(i) any intended conduct of the supplier that might affect the interests of the business consumer; and
(ii) any risks to the business consumer arising from the supplier's intended conduct (being risks that the supplier should have foreseen would not be apparent to the business consumer) . . . 
That gives a lot of support to the concept of unconscionable conduct, which is obviously clearly defined in the common law already. We believe that this does massively strengthen the hand of small business people in these things by, I guess, taking over the concept of the consumer under trade practices law and applying it to business. So we are classifying small businesses as consumers for the purpose of this law. We think the legislation achieves this. This is the reason we will be opposing the opposition amendments.

These amendments really follow on and to some extent mirror the earlier amendments put by the opposition, but with one crucial difference: we do not strike out the government's provision; we attempt to add to it. The difficulty with any new legislation, such as that which the Reid committee was proposing, is determining how the courts will interpret it. Senator Ian Campbell has clearly indicated the government's view on that matter.
When section 51AA was inserted into the Trade Practices Act in 1992, it was to outlaw unconscionable conduct in commercial transactions. But it never really worked, because the courts read the provisions very narrowly, modifying the long-established case law of unconscionability, which relies on some special disability of a contracting party in order to work. Indeed, there were even doubts expressed as to whether the unconscionability provisions were constitutional. We will not get into that one. For this reason, when the Democrats first proposed a replacement provision, we preferred to speak of a doctrine of economic duress. The then Labor government steered clear of unconscionability as well, outlawing harsh and oppressive conduct. But their proposal never made it into law.
The Reid committee's decision to come down firmly on the side of small business and argue that conduct which is in all the circumstances unfair should be outlawed was pilloried by many big business groups and their legal firms. They argued that it would lead to legal and contractual uncertainty and was likely to increase the contractual costs for businesses dealing with small business and make big business more contractually aggressive towards small business. These concerns may be valid in certain respects. Only the introduction of fair conduct law could test 
 such contentions. But the Reid committee was alert to these dangers and proposed a criteria to help set standards of fair or unfair conduct. Those were the very standards that the Labor Party put into their amendment and which we are putting into ours. They also proposed that industry specific codes of conduct be developed to further clarify what was fair.
The government has returned, however, to the concept of unconscionability and deliberately supports picking up existing case law and the narrow readings of the courts. The minister's deliberate restriction of the effect of the change to the law means that small business may not get everything—or even anything—that it expects from these changes. What the minister has done is to go a step further by adopting the Reid committee's approach of giving legislative guidelines on unconscionable conduct. He has gone further by moving in the codes of conduct area. So that should assist quite considerably.
But we remain concerned that, by setting the standard as `unconscionable conduct', we would end up with no real advance for small business and no enforceable standards. If Minister Reith has not provided a real improvement, big business is going to end up very happy and small business will have been deliberately deceived. Alternatively, if he has delivered an improvement, but only a modest one, it means that small business will be hammering on the doors of parliament yet again fairly soon.
We believe that the Reid fair trading report's recommendation should be given a chance to be tested in the courts. We recognise that there is an argument that presenting two standards—one of unfair conduct and one of unconscionable conduct—could provide for some confusion and some difficulty in determining exactly which provisions should be pursued and what each is intended to mean. It is for that reason, amongst others, that we have recommended in our amendment—in fact the amendment mandates it; I am reading from paragraph 10 of amendment 1—that `an application to the court under this section cannot be made by a person if that person has already made an application under section 51AC in relation to the same contravention, 
 whether or not that application has been finally determined or otherwise disposed of'.
Someone who wants to take this matter to court must choose either unconscionable conduct or unfair conduct. They may not plead them in the alternative. We hope that that method would provide the ability to begin to build up some case law on unfair conduct and some background in this area. I accordingly commend my amendments 1 and 2 to the committee.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-04-02,"—There is no doubt that what Senator Murray is seeking to do is extremely well intentioned, but it will run into the problem of creating legal uncertainty. We have gone to an enormous amount of trouble in relation to the existing common law and unconscionable conduct, which I think we have all agreed is a doctrine at law that has become well defined. Maybe it is not well defined enough. To the extent that it is not well defined enough, we have the amendments in 51AC(3). I have picked out at random some of the items there.
I think, Senator Murray, it is fair to say that, with the exception of the harshness clause, which I am told is wrapped up in the legal doctrine which relates to unconscionable and is there anyway, all of your points under your proposed addition are equivalent to what we have under our buttressing under 51AC(3). So we think that it is unnecessary. We think the only outcome of it is that it can add to confusion. We are seeking to make sure that the law is certain and clear. Again, small business have obviously taken a very close interest in pulling this package together to get it to the stage where it is here, ready to go, ready to be up and running on 1 July in the way that the minister and the government have structured it.
That is not to say that every small business group likes every part of it. Again, it is a balancing thing. I think all of us recognise that it is very hard to get agreement on these sorts of matters. Senator Schacht talked about the frustration that he as minister felt in trying to move the franchising thing forward, to move this forward. He blames the opposition 
 of the time for some of his failures—in preparing for this bill, I have read some of the transcripts of what he has said. It is very hard to get this. We appreciate the support that was given at the time the minister announced the package, and we would like to see that support flowing all the way through here for the next two hours so we can get it out that door and out there into the real world to benefit small business.
They accept and endorse the balance that we have struck. The government's view is that the concept of unfair is wrapped up in the unconscionable provisions, but it need not be put alongside it as an alternative. It can really, by definition, only add to the confusion. It can only add to uncertainty, whereas the provisions we have are quite clear, quite certain. People will not have to sit down with their lawyer and say, `Shall we pick this one out of here or pick that one out of there?' They will be able to move ahead with certainty. That is the reason the coalition will insist on seeing the provisions go forward as they are in the bill.

We think this amendment is a critical addition. It appears as item (4) on schedule 848. It takes the most important element of the unfair conduct recommendations and asks the Senate to approve the addition to the government's criteria for establishing unconscionability that they must have regard to `the harshness of the result'.

et cetera. It is that checklist of things the court must have regard to. It takes it directly from the Reid recommendations.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-04-02,"—I think it may be helpful if the government puts down its view as to why we would oppose this amendment. Firstly, I am informed that the courts already roll those concepts—that is, unfairness, harshness and unconscionable—in together and they are often seen as equivalent. So it does not add anything to the basic legal concept of unconscionable, which I have already said on a couple of occasions is enhanced by the specific buttressing in 51AC(3).
One of the problems, however, is that, once the courts have had a look at the things to determine whether there has been unconscionable conduct, they will ultimately determine what the result has been and they will then determine what the remedy is based on what the result has been—whether it has been harsh, whether it has cost the small business their business or cost them in terms of whatever they have lost. They may give a remedy in terms of an injunction.
We believe the harshness of the result should be the outcome of the process. Quite the contrary, you should not even need to turn to harshness. There are all these other matters—and I will pick them out again because I think it is a very important point. I refer to pages 6 and 7 of the bill. The courts will look 
 at the relative strengths of bargaining positions. They will look at whether the conduct engaged in by the supplier complied with conditions that were—

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-04-02,"—I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard  my speech on the second reading of these bills.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
Mirror Taxes Legislation Package
The 4 bills, the Commonwealth Places (Mirror Taxes) Bill 1998,  the Commonwealth Places (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1998,  the Commonwealth Places Windfall Tax (Imposition) Bill 1998,  and the Commonwealth Places Windfall Tax (Collection) Bill 1998  seek to deal with the issues raised in the 1996 High Court decision in Allders International Pty Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue (Victoria).
This case held that a state stamp duty on a lease covering part of a Commonwealth place—ie Commonwealth land and/or building—was constitutionally invalid. The reasoning employed in the case means that it follows logically that other state taxes may also be invalid.
Apparently the Commonwealth has been advised that, as well as the various types of stamp duty that are levied by the states, some of the other taxes raises at the state level such as payroll tax, financial institutions duty and debits taxes may also be constitutionally invalid. 

Clearly, this situation poses a threat to the revenue bases of the states. Unsurprisingly these other governments have accordingly requested the Commonwealth to enact this legislation.
The threat to the states involves both future revenue streams, and the more significant issue of the compulsory refunding of all taxes previously collected concerning Commonwealth places.
Accordingly, under this package of legislation the Commonwealth will impose ""mirror"" (ie identical) taxes on Commonwealth places to those that would prevail if the Commonwealth places were not owned by the Commonwealth.
The revenue from these mirror taxes (payroll tax, stamp duties, financial institutions duties and debits taxes) will be on-passed to the relevant states. That is, even though the Commonwealth will be raising the revenue, there is a commitment that all of the revenue will be raised for the financial benefit of the states
This is a fair and workable solution to the constitutional issues raised in the Allsop decision and will not be opposed by Labor.
The second important point to recognise about the mirror taxes regime is the extent of the regime. At the moment the legislation (specifically schedule 1 of the Commonwealth Places (Mirror Taxes) Bill) applies to only those state taxes which are individually listed.
Provision is also made to extend the scope of the mirror taxes regime by regulation should the need arise.
This is achieved by the definition of ""state taxing law"" in clause 3 of the Commonwealth Places (Mirror Taxes) Bill including any tax which is prescribed in regulations to the bill. At present there are no such regulations. However, Labor supports this situation as it will mean that if any state does introduce such a tax in the future then its addition to this package of legislation will be able to be achieved quickly and efficiently, without the need for the passage of specific legislation.
Of course, this regulation will be disallowable by either House and therefore this does not represent an unreasonable delegation of what is really a technical revenue issue.
The third major issue covered by these bills is the question of windfall refunds. Where the courts hold that taxes are unconstitutionally imposed, then all of the collections of the tax must be refunded to the relevant taxpayers. This means that all of the stamp duty considered in Allsops case ever collected from taxpayers relating to Commonwealth places must be refunded to the registered taxpayers.
The problems with refunds of this type are twofold.
Firstly, the cost to the various state governments of making tax refunds will necessarily impact on the 
 level of resources available to finance health, eduction, law and order and other essential services.
We do not know what the potential scope of the refunds would be if this legislation is not passed, but I assume that the figure is in the tens of millions of dollars across all of the states.
Secondly, the refunds will flow to the legal taxpayer. Normally businesses which pay taxes pass the economic effect of the tax on to their customers through their pricing structure.
Accordingly, if those taxes were then refunded to the taxpayer that would represent a windfall to those businesses because they have already passed on the tax to consumers.
So this legislation is fair, both for users of state services and to avoid an unfair windfall to be handed to some taxpayers.
To protect the states from having to refund all past tax collections relating to Commonwealth places, a 100% windfall tax is imposed by the Commonwealth on all such refunds.
This is achieved by the state deducting the windfall tax, at the rate of 100%, from the refund before it is paid. The taxpayer is notified in the refund notice that the windfall tax has been deducted. The refund tax is then remitted to the Commonwealth. The liability to make this payment to the Commonwealth creates a liability in the Commonwealth to pay an equal amount to the state.
Although being a complex process this means that no windfall gains will accrue to taxpayers at the expense of the states.
A similar windfall tax model was implemented to overcome the High Court decision in the Ha & Lim, and Walter Hammond cases last year which invalidated the business franchise fees collected by the states.
Accordingly, for all of the reasons I have just detailed the Opposition will not be opposing this package of legislation.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH PLACES (MIRROR TAXES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1998-04-02,"—The purpose of these bills is to correct technical faults in the national residue survey legislation which make a liability to pay a national residue survey levy dependent on liability to pay another primary industry levy. The original intention was that the national residue survey levies be imposed at the same point in the process as other levies to reduce collection costs but not to make them reliant on the payment of another levy. So the legislation is of a technical nature correcting faults in the legislation. The legislation also consolidates the 22 levy imposition acts into two acts for ease of access and administration, one relating to customs duties, the other to excise duties.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-04-02,"—The Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1997  adjusts for cost supplementation a range of grants payable under schedule 2 of the Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act. It also removes the requirement that at least 10 per cent of students in an educational institution be indigenous for the institution to be eligible for per capita payments under the supplementary recurrent assistance. Supplementary recurrent assistance is part of the Commonwealth's indigenous education strategic initiatives program—IESIP. IESIP has become outcome, rather than input, focused, a direction set by the previous government when it announced additional funding for this and other indigenous education programs in response to the 1994 review of Aboriginal education.
The announcement by the Labor government in September 1995 also flagged the change to per capita recurrent funding, which was put in place last year. In doing so, however, the coalition restricted access to funding by requiring non-government schools, preschools and vocational education institutions to have indigenous students make up at least 10 per cent of their total enrolments and also have a minimum number of indigenous students enrolled. For schools and vocational educational institutions, the minimum requirement is 20 indigenous students, and for preschools it is set at five students.
In his speech on the 1996 legislation, which introduced the current arrangement, Dr Kemp said:
The per capita element of the Aboriginal education strategic initiative program will provide an entitle 
 ment-based, equitable recurrent funding arrangement.
Yet this program has not operated equitably. It will not be truly equitable until it does not discriminate between one indigenous student and another. With a year 12 retention rate of some 33 per cent and three times the rate of primary school literacy problems as other students, indigenous students face massive problems. Yet, under the government's original proposal in relation to this bill, some 1,100 indigenous students would still be denied access to IESIP recurrent assistance. These are students in non-systemic schools with fewer than 20 indigenous students enrolled.
When this bill was debated in the House of Representatives, the opposition moved an amendment which would have removed the minimum enrolment requirement along with the 10 per cent rule. We questioned the reasons for the government's objection to allowing every indigenous student access to these funds. We also put forward ideas about how claimed administrative difficulties—the signing of around 260 extra agreements with the affected schools—could be addressed.
I am pleased to say that the response from the government has met the concerns of the opposition and will mean that no indigenous students need miss out on the per capita funding. Legal advice confirms that the Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act gives the Commonwealth the power to sign agreements with bodies representing groups of students whose individual enrolment of indigenous students is below the minimum specified in legislation or with a single school representing a group. National peak bodies representing the non-government schools sector have all expressed satisfaction with this outcome. Because of this, the opposition has been prepared to drop its amendments. We look forward to these funds helping indigenous young people benefit more from education.",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (SUPPLEMENTARY ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1998-04-02,"—The Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1998 seeks to make a number of amendments to a number of health related acts covering the following areas: firstly, approval of hedging contracts entered into by the Health Insurance Commission; secondly, the electronic payment of Medicare benefits; thirdly, enabling optometrists to charge fees above the scheduled fee; fourthly, the delivery of Medicare benefits in respect of services rendered outside Australia; fifthly, certain matters dealing with medical practitioners receiving payment for the provision of public hospital services; and, finally, the provision of pharmaceuticals by private hospitals and residential aged care services. The opposition does not oppose the bill.
I wish to draw attention to one aspect which has been a matter of concern and which we note the legislation seeks to deal with. That is, instances have arisen where medical practitioners have offered inducements to public hospital patients for the purposes of queue jumping, and, in doing so, have sought payment for such situations. The amendment will provide a penalty to be levied on medical practitioners who engage in that practice. That is something that we are strongly supportive of as that practice undermines the principles of Medicare.

The opposition supports the passage of the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill 1997 . The legislation protects commercially sensitive information that is provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers to the Therapeutic Goods Administration. That information is provided as part of the process of evaluating and listing the particular products on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, which in turn enables such goods to be put on sale in Australia.
The data is automatically protected for five years, and that in turn brings Australia into line with the position applicable in other countries, particularly the United States, the European Union and New Zealand. There are other aspects to the legislation, which include an amendment to close a loophole which allowed people convicted of offences under the act to continue to manufacture through another corporation or entity. Also, the legislation allows for the regulation of importing and exporting of therapeutic goods under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 as well as other Customs legislation.

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,1998-04-02,"—On 26 March Senator McKiernan asked me a supplementary question in my capacity of representing the Attorney. I undertook to seek some clarifying remarks from the Attorney and to provide them to the Senate. I seek leave to have those incorporated in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The remarks read as follows—
Senator VANSTONE: On 26 March 1998 Senator McKiernan asked me a supplementary question, in my capacity as Minister representing the Attorney General, concerning comments made by the Attorney-General about the Dietrich  decision and legal aid funding. I undertook to seek some clarifying remarks from the Attorney-General and to provide those to the Senate at a future date.
The Attorney-General has provided the following further remarks in response to Senator McKiernan's supplementary question:
What I have been saying is that it's in the hands of the judges and in the hands of the practitioners who practice in the courts, to curb the length and expense of trials.
We have got to have a system that takes into account the practical realities that there is not unlimited public money available to fund trials.
I believe there is a great potential for shorter and more cost effective trials through reforms in procedures which enable the identification of issues in genuine dispute, the dispensing with strict rules of evidence where appropriate, more disciplined trial management and the use of court presentation technology.
However, experience seems to show that these innovations are only effective where there is the will on the part of lawyers and judges to use them to full advantage for a fair and efficient trial.
The Dietrich  case has enormous implications for the legal aid and criminal justice system. In an effort to address the problems caused by increas 
 ingly long trials, a legislative response to the Dietrich  decision is only one of a number of possible responses to be considered by SCAG.
The challenge for the criminal justice system is to streamline its court proceedings and practices and restore public confidence in our legal system.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Australian Courts</title>,Questions Without Notice,26,1

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-04-02,"—While Senator Schacht is coming to the chamber, I will conclude the remarks I was making just prior to 12.45 p.m., which related to the Democrats amendment. As I recall, I was just concluding my remarks on the point that `harshness of the result' was not only unnecessary but also a little contradictory in that, ultimately, the court will have to decide, based on all of the tests—including the common law tests that exist at the moment plus the new test we are putting in—what the result is. In many respects, having to judge the harshness, or even having to have any regard to the harshness, is against the interests of small business when you are trying to find it.
You do not necessarily have to rely on the outcome being harsh; you really just need to meet some of those tests to prove that the outcome was unconscionable. The result of the unconscionable conduct could well be unfair, unjust or harsh. That would then lead the court to make a decision in relation to the remedy, be it an injunction or be it some remedy in terms of undoing a transaction—I presume they have the opportunity to do that—or be it the giving of a monetary award.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In committee</title>,Bills,31,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-04-02,"—Minister, are you saying that you believe that the `harshness of the result' in the amendment moved by the Democrats is covered anyway in the rest of the section of the bill which describes the issues the court has to take into account? I refer you to page 6 of the bill going into page 7. You say that if the Democrats amendment is not included, the determination of the issue of the `harshness of the result'—and that is the result of the unconscionable conduct, the oppressive conduct of which the small business is complaining—is covered in the definitions in 51AC(3)(a) down to 51AC(3)(k). Is that your argument?",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In committee</title>,Bills,31,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-04-02,"—No. I put an outline before lunch and I was just putting the last bit of it as you walked in. In my outline before lunch I said that my advice and understanding is that the concept of `unconscionable', as it has developed in the common law, includes the concept of `harsh' and `unfair', so it is already there. Also, once you look at all the other tests on pages 6 and 7 under 51AC(3) you have regard to all of these things.
As for the result, some people would argue—and I would support the argument—that to have to have regard to the harshness of the outcome is unnecessary—in other words, the outcome does not need to be harsh; it could be lots of these other things. There may well be a harsh outcome and, if that is the case, the court will have a look at the outcome. The importance of the court's looking at the result is the remedy which it brings to bear, which may be an injunction, an unwinding of the transaction or a monetary award.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In committee</title>,Bills,31,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-04-02,"—This is one of the grey areas in this amendment. I would always bend towards an amendment that I thought strengthened the opportunities for small business to get a remedy and I think that is the intent of Senator Murray's amendment. However, I think the proof of the pudding is going to be in its eating with whatever the parliament puts into this legislation, particularly under proposed 
 section 51AC—unconscionable conduct in business transactions. On balance, I would take the government's view at the moment, although I have to say that I have no doubt we are still going into new territory and that over a period of time it may well be necessary to revisit this clause.
The one thing I do like about `harshness of the result' is that it is a term that I think the community generally would understand as a definition. `Harshness' is a word that a lot of people would understand more clearly than `unconscionable' in general language, but this is a legal document that we are dealing with. I take the parliamentary secretary's point that there is a lot of law already established about the meaning of `unconscionable' whereas there is not about `harshness of the result'. On that balance, therefore, we will stay with the government's position although, Senator Murray, emotionally I have some attachment to what is raised.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In committee</title>,Bills,31,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-04-02,"—I accept the decision of the committee. For the record, that phrase is plucked from recommendation 6.1 of the fair trading report. Many of those recommendations have been reshaped and wound into your own section, Parliamentary Secretary. One obvious example is their 2L which referred to the good faith of the parties. You have included that and so on. It was a specific intention to carry over one that was left out. I accept your reasons and understand them, but I do think if ever this section is revisited that we should have a look at some of the case law and see whether the harshness of the result was not, in fact, attended to.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-04-02,"—Madam Chair, I am grateful that you have given me the call but in fact it will not be necessary for me to move my amendment. On the running sheet it is noted:
NB GWA (1) above similar but not identical to Democrats (5) [sheet 848] below.
In fact, Democrats amendment No. 5 incorporates all the points that are mentioned in Greens (WA) No. 1 so I will be supporting the Democrats amendment because it adds extra to the amendments that we were putting 
 forward.	 The reason I would be doing this is that whilst we have the government dealing on retail tenancy and industry codes, the government has absolutely failed to deal in a similar way with a fundamental issue and that is the issue of the difficulties small business has in accessing justice. Again, the fair trading report specifically highlights this point of view and notes the example of a small business taking on Lend Lease. The small business would run out of money before any action got to court. No-one would want to get involved politically and the small business owner would be left broke and in even further despair.
The provision of a legal action to address unconscionable conduct is next to useless in its current form. Yes, on paper the government can say, `There is a golden path of redress which we have built for you,' but is this a real remedy if small business cannot afford to commence an action? Small business owners generally do not have wads of money to throw into expensive litigation and top quality lawyers, and also do not have the time to be involved with inevitably drawn-out processes. Furthermore, isn't it ironic that with lots of drawn-out court cases in this country the only one we ask for extinguishment on is native title, but that is beside the point. They also do not have the time to be involved in inevitably drawn-out processes.
Furthermore, we are dealing with commercial relationships. Often there is much greater advantage to both sides to come out of any dispute resolution process with the business relationship intact. The very nature of the adversarial system results in winners and losers. The alternative dispute resolution procedures provide a much wider scope for creating a mutually satisfying resolution. ADR procedures give proposed section 51AC some true teeth. ADR procedures give small business real access to justice, not just some pie in the sky promise of a remedy. Consequently, I urge the committee to support the ADR measures that are incorporated within the Democrats' amendments which I am sure Senator Murray will now be moving.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In committee</title>,Bills,31,1

(4B)	 Subsection (4A) does not apply if :
	 (a)	 either party has already sought to use the dispute resolution procedures set out in the applicable industry code; or
	 (b)	 either party has already unsuccessfully engaged in or sought mediation with the other party; or
	 (c)	 further delay in resolving the matter would result in substantial damage to the business of the applicant or the respondent such that the matter should be resolved without delay.
(4C)	 The Court may, at the request of either party or of its own volition, terminate the mediation under subsection (4A) and proceed to determine the matter.
(4D)	 For the purposes of assessing costs in relation to an action for a contravention of subsection (1), the Court may have regard to the good faith in which parties have participated in a conference under subsection (4A) or prior to the application being made.
I thank Senator Margetts for her giving way on Democrats amendment No. 5 and I note for the record that I think we should regard this amendment as jointly moved by the Greens and us since it is the same. I cannot add much more to what Senator Margetts has said except that this sort of attempt to get away from the cost of litigation and the difficulties of litigation needs to be encouraged by the parliament as often as possible. I have sat as a tenant's representative on the Commercial Tribunal of Western Australia. I understand some of the methods and the needs that go with dispute resolution and how things should be resolved.
It is vital, I think, when you have unequal parties in a contest, where a small franchisee is dealing with a large franchisor, a small tenant is dealing with a multinational or at least a national landlord, or where a small customer is dealing with a multinational supplier, that in those unequal battles there is 
 some attempt to resolve them before really big money comes to bear in the litigious area.
So we think this is actually a very helpful contribution to small business in lessening costs, in lessening aggravation, in lessening the fear of taking on the very big in these matters. I am glad that Senator Margetts of the Greens (WA) had the same thoughts and I appreciate the opportunity, therefore, to have moved amendment 5 on sheet 848.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In committee</title>,Bills,31,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-04-02,"—Senator Margetts, you are withdrawing your amendment in view of supporting Senator Murray's amendment. Is that correct?
—My amendment is incorporated into his amendment.
—Into his amendment, okay. Could I just ask a couple of questions to either Senator Murray or to the parliamentary secretary. Do we know whether the Reid report made similar recommendations about this mediation process?
—We actually picked it up in the franchising debate. We will check.
—Thank you. Secondly, I take it that the point of Senator Murray's and Senator Margetts's concern is that, if there are lengthy legal proceedings, et cetera, small business does not have the resources to fight the big end of town. Back in 1995, we reached agreement with the ACCC and announced that we would provide resources to the small business unit or office of the Trade Practices Commission, as it then was, now the ACCC. That enabled the TPC itself, if it thought a case good enough, to take that case on against the big end of town. I want to know whether that provision is still there and resources available so that, where a case is appropriate, the ACCC can do that.
—Is that more of a test case?
—No, not a test case. It is just a matter of the ACCC from time to time taking a case because small business cannot afford to. As I am advised, once the ACCC has established a test case, if it is a good test case and the ACCC wins it, they 
 then get the precedent established. The big end of town may then well drop off trying to hold people out, knowing that the precedent has been established. I wonder whether the parliamentary secretary can give us any information in that area?
I would raise one final issue. From my own involvement years ago on the cost of justice inquiry, I was very strongly in favour of alternate dispute resolution procedures in an attempt to get the cost of justice down—and this is a relevant area here. But one thing I do not want to do, in one sense, is implement a delaying process whereby, if it is a tenancy matter, the landlord can start going through a mediation process and use it to delay an outcome.
After sitting through estimates hearings on these dreaded CoT cases for Telstra, even though there has been a mediation process now in place for several years, where Telstra—or, for that matter, either side—wants to, it can still delay endlessly and keep on going around and around, if it thinks it might lose the mediation. I am not sure that I want to vote for something whereby the mediation process can be used as a delaying device rather than for there to be a quick outcome, a decision from the court saying, `This is it.'",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In committee</title>,Bills,31,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-04-02,"—I will just answer one specific question, and then the parliamentary secretary, I am sure, will follow up. Senator Schacht asked me whether the Reid report made any recommendations on dispute resolution. I have quickly flicked through, and I have found three instances—and there may be more. One was recommendation 3.3 on franchising, where it states:
The legislation should provide for adequate disclosure documentation, the establishment of appropriate independent code administration bodies, and dispute resolution procedures funded through compulsory registration fees.
That is one area where they have picked it up. Recommendation 5.1, talking about small business finance, states:
The Committee recommends that small businesses be included in any client protection/dispute resolution programs established by the Treasurer . . .  

The third one I can find just with a quick flick through, and I think this might be the most relevant. It is in section 7, which is headed `Recommendations on access to justice and education'. Under 7.2 it states:
The Committee recommends the Attorney-General explore with the States and Territories low cost options for improving small businesses accesses to legal tribunals for commercial disputes.
There is one other, but that is all I can find for the moment. As I have said, there may be others.
—The main one is 7.2, is it?
—It is in 7.1. It states in 7.1(a):
. . . to provide for mandatory pre-trial mediation of actions under the new Section 51AA, prohibiting unfair conduct in commercial transactions . . . 
So the Reid report specifically recommended that this happen. We believe the government has not done that. I do not recall, in the explanatory memorandum, the government explaining why it has not done it. And I think it is a significant omission. That is 7.1, page xxviii.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In committee</title>,Bills,31,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-04-02,"—I would like to make a few comments. The government opposes the amendment. We have looked very closely at these recommendations and at alternative dispute resolution. I do not know whether honourable senators would have a copy of it, but I will certainly make it available to them; in fact, I will table page 5 of the exposure draft of the franchising code of practice from September 1997. This goes into dispute resolution, particularly in relation to franchising, and the government has encouraged the inclusion of alternative dispute resolution.
—But that does not cover retail tenancies, does it?
—No, it does not. Retail tenancies obviously have to be dealt with at the state level. The Commonwealth has undertaken to encourage cheaper access or more reasonable access to justice by way of alternative dispute resolution mecha 
 nisms at the state level—not only in terms of retail tenancies but also other small business disputes.
Senator Schacht, to answer your specific question in relation to empowering the ACCC to take action in relation to misuse of market power, I draw your attention to the minister's speech in the other place, where he specifically says that the government will seek to achieve these objectives through a legislative amendment of the Trade Practices Act in four areas. He refers specifically to, and undertakes to bring in, a new provision which will allow the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to take representative actions against misuse of market power.
—It's a separate bill.
—It is, yes. That is under discussion. I think you would recognise from your own involvement that it is not a simple matter but it is being done. I am informed that it is in train.
The dispute resolution mechanism is included in the franchising code of practice and I presume will be subject to whatever happens in the oil code. There would be dispute resolution mechanisms in that code and future codes. It does go down the line of what Senator Margetts and Senator Murray have been urging. I do not know whether it is necessary to read it all out. I will summarise it as quickly as I can so as not to delay the Senate's considerations. I know it is an important matter. It is a matter the government has given a lot of time to considering. Page 5 states:
If a dispute arises between the parties then the parties must agree to undertake the following steps:
(a) the complainant shall raise the matter with the other party setting out the background and issue in dispute and the outcome desired;
(b) if the dispute is not resolved in accordance with clause (a), the parties shall make every effort to resolve the dispute fairly. In doing so each party agrees to use his/her/its best efforts to (1) clearly communicate the background leading to causing the dispute . . . 
They are the provisions that I guess an alternate dispute resolution should contain in mediation processes. At the encouragement of the government, that is in the franchising code 
 of practice and will be in future codes. We believe that is the appropriate place to have it. As I have said, we have made a commitment to involving the ACCC in taking representative actions.
Furthermore, we see a downside along the lines of what Senator Schacht has referred to, and that is adding another layer to this regulation. You can see that if you create alternative dispute resolution mechanisms there is an upside in terms of cost of justice but there can also be a downside in terms of justice delayed. If you give anyone access to something like this, big businesses will probably use it as a form of delay and the delay can often take place and send the small business out of business.
The whole reason for strengthening the provisions in the Trade Practices Act—a historic increase in the powers under the Trade Practices Act specifically for small business—is to ensure that the legal remedy is just sitting there, that it is quite clear, that the tests are clear, so that people can access the Trade Practices Act quickly and the Federal Court can make a decision as quickly as possible. We believe we have the balance right here in making alternate dispute resolution mechanisms available where they are appropriate, committing to having the ACCC involved and, most importantly, ensuring that remedies to small business before the courts under this amended Trade Practices Act will be clear and readily available to small business.
We think we have the balance right. As I have said—and I will try not to repeat myself too much—small business and their representatives are very supportive of the package going forward as it is without amendment. They do want access to these provisions and they want them by 1 July. Passage in its current form would be helpful. The government is developing an alternative dispute resolution awareness package for small business, and that will be made very widely available on the Internet and in paper format for those businesses who do not have access to the Internet. I presume, if I were in charge of this, I would be making sure that that paper would bring together things that are 
 available for both the states and the Commonwealth. It was such a good idea that we have already adopted it.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In committee</title>,Bills,31,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-04-02,"—I thank the parliamentary secretary and Senator Murray for those comments and those questions I raised. On the previous amendment I thought there was a grey discussion and, on balance, I lent towards the government. Again, this is another grey area of discussion, but on the balance I lean towards Senator Murray's amendment. I believe the principles of alternate dispute resolution are very useful to enshrine.
I turn to the general issue of having mandatory code arrangements. We have a commitment that there will be a franchising code but we do not have a commitment for other codes. That leads me to believe that in the retail area we do not know what the subsequent vote will be on some amendments in that area. That is the one where the most disputes keep occurring, as I can recollect and have seen from the evidence. I believe the Reid committee, on balance, has got this right: that there should be encouragement that there be alternate dispute resolution methods.
I would hope that the court would not be so blind that if they could see that a major landlord was delaying the dispute resolution processes to a level that was denying justice or a reasonably quick remedy they would not intervene again and take over the case. I think that is clear in the amendment. I do agree, Minister, if this amendment does not get up, that what you have already put forward is a significant improvement. I also raise a general question. We are coming into this area where I think many of us agree that we are not quite sure in black-and-white terms of the outcome.
It would be useful by the end of this debate in committee if the government could give us some understanding that within a year or so there would be a genuine review of the operation of this to give all the parties in the community a chance to come forward with their view about it. I agree that I cannot be 100 per cent confident that the proposals I am putting on behalf of the opposition will work out the way we hope they will, just as I do not think the government can. All we know 
 is that we have made considerable progress with this bill. On balance, I lean towards Senator Murray's proposition.

(12)	 Subsections (7) and (8) cease to have effect at the end of 5 years after the commencement of this section.
Although this does deal with the definition, we may deal with it now because this is a sunset clause. I should really refer to it as the MTAA clause. This says that at the end of five years proposed sections 7 and 8 in the bill, which are on page 8 of the bill, would fall away. In other words, the threshold would no longer exist and any business would be subject to these unconscionable conduct provisions.
I think Senator Schacht's suggestion of a review is an excellent idea. It would obviously be open to the government of the day before the end of that five years to say, `We still wish to keep a threshold,' or, `Our review has thrown up some other things,' and to knock this over. But it has the effect, we hope, of concentrating the government's mind on the fact that after a number of years this unfair, unconscionable conduct provision will not just apply to those who fall within the definition.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In committee</title>,Bills,31,1

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-04-02,"—That is very nice of you, Senator Margetts, as usual. The government indicated in this morning's debate that this $1 million is available to be changed by regulation. I know that all parties—members of the Reid committee report; people like Senator Murray, Senator Margetts and Senator Schacht; and all the rest of us who take a close interest in small business matters—will keep a very close eye on how this works.
We can change it by regulation. I am sure this matter will be reviewed far more regularly than the five years that the sunset clause envisages. I, on behalf of the government, in the Senate today have made it quite clear that we will be keeping a close watch on this. If the $1 million threshold for some reason is not effective, it will be altered. It will be altered by regulation and it will be able to be discussed in this chamber because it will be a disallowable instrument.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In committee</title>,Bills,31,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-04-02,"—I am often attracted to sunset clauses, mainly because they keep people on their toes. Whether it is in the bureaucracy or it is in the parliament, when you suddenly have the guillotine about to drop on you, you then get cracking on finding out what you are going to do. So there is an advantage with sunset clauses. On balance, though, I think in this act a sunset clause is probably not necessary, particularly in view of the fact that we now have clarified that the cut-off point of $1 million is a disallowable instrument and can be changed without legislation. I agree with the parliamentary secretary that this bill will continue to have the closest of scrutiny in its operation in the next few years—not the least by Mr Delaney and the MTAA, being one of the most effective small business organisations in Australia.
The opposition will not support the amendment, although I do agree with some of the remarks made by Senator Murray. The parliamentary secretary has made some general remarks and of course the operation of this 
 act will be under close scrutiny. It would be useful, if possible, before we ended this debate, if the parliamentary secretary could get from the minister an undertaking that maybe in two years time or in 2½ years time there will be a review by an appropriate parliamentary committee equivalent to the Reid committee, or a Senate committee or an independent committee separate from the parliament. I do not think it does any harm to the government's position or to our position to say that that will take place.
The great advantage is that, if you, Parliamentary Secretary, indicate now that in 2½ years time there will be a transparent review of the operation of the act as carried here by the parliament this week, it means you can say to all those groups out there who have an interest, or an axe to grind or whatever, `Prepare your submission. In a couple of years time when we get some runs on the board or some wickets knocked over, whatever way you want to look at it, there is going to be a review and that is where you will put your view in an open, transparent process,' rather than having it come in dribs and drabs every couple of months when someone or some organisation that feels aggrieved makes representations.
I am not suggesting this as an ambush or anything like that. I do not even request that you put it in the legislation—that there will be a review by a certain date; I think that is unnecessary. I can say on behalf of the opposition that, although this has not been to our shadow ministry in this form, we would be very supportive of the idea that, say, in two to 2½ years time there would be an independent review of the act on these provisions and that the Michael Delaneys of the world and others would have a chance to put it there in that review. I am sure that could be a way forward, on this particular amendment anyway. On the balance, the opposition will not support it. But we would be very supportive of a statement from the minister that there be some sort of a review process in about two to 2½ years.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In committee</title>,Bills,31,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-04-02,"—The government has 
 discussed this issue. Clearly, the implementation of the new act will be a matter that is, we have all agreed, closely followed by a range of organisations and parliamentarians. The government is envisaging a review. It would certainly need to be independent, but it could be by an independent expert, an expert panel or even a parliamentary committee. If we do not do it a parliamentary committee would do it anyway, I would hope.
We were looking at a time frame. We thought that two years was probably a bit short; 2½ to three years is the sort of time frame we are looking at. The government is doing that and, in so far as I can make a representation on behalf of the minister, it is fair to say that that would occur in about that three-year time frame.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-04-02,"—I move:
(9)	 Schedule 2, item 2, page 9 (after line 5), at the end of section 51AC, add:
Note:	 The meaning of  unconscionable  is intended to be wider than in its common law usage and should be interpreted by reference to section 51AC as a whole.
Item 9 is the addition of a note. I am somewhat attracted to notes. Over the last number of years our legislation has adopted this practice of adding notes to amplify or clarify the intention of the legislation. We as legislators are all aware of the limitations of notes, but notes never take from the intent of legislation; they always add to it.
Senators would be aware, from the remarks made particularly by Senator Schacht and me earlier in the debate, of the fears we have that unconscionable conduct may continue to be narrowly defined by the judiciary. The government have been at pains to itemise their checklist of items under 51AC of those matters which they believe should be considered by the courts in reviewing unconscionable conduct in business transactions, but we want to be sure that the judiciary are aware of the intent of the legislature to ensure that `unconscionable' is not narrowly defined or narrowly viewed and that it must be viewed in reference to that section as a whole 
 and not with regard to any particular clause within it.
Accordingly, we have put in a note which we hope conveys that intention to the judiciary. The note would simply state what hopefully would be obvious but might not be to the judiciary:
The meaning of unconscionable is intended to be wider than in its common law usage and should be interpreted by reference to section 51AC as a whole.
We think that is relatively unexceptional and would hope that the government would support it.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In committee</title>,Bills,31,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-04-02,"—During my second reading debate contribution I did mention that one of the concerns of the Greens (WA) was that there was a very narrow definition of unconscionable behaviour under the act and that we were in favour of supporting a broadening of the definition to make that fairer and access to remedy easier for small business. Therefore, I will be supporting this method of drawing to the attention of the judiciary the desire of the parliament for them to read that element more broadly.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In committee</title>,Bills,31,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-04-02,"—The government believes that that would add a lot of uncertainty and impreciseness. To say that it is broader than the common law definition I guess is a statement of the fact that we are broadening it. We are broadening it to the extent that we are spending the best part of two pages of the bill buttressing the definition with what things can contribute to it.
My reading of it and my memory of studying this is that it is not just to be one of these things; it has to be a number of things. So it can be taken as a whole or as a part. We are adding that the court could have regard to one of 10 different matters, including relative strengths of the bargaining positions; the result of the conduct engaged in by the supplier; the business consumer being required to comply with conditions that were not reasonably necessary for the protection of legitimate interests of the supplier; whether the business consumer was able to understand 
 any documents; whether any undue influence or pressure was exerted; the amount for which and the circumstances under which the business consumer could have acquired identical or equivalent goods; the extent to which the supplier's conduct towards the business consumer was consistent with the supplier's conduct in similar transactions between the supplier and other business consumers; the requirements of an applicable industry code—so it brings in all of those codes, both mandatary and voluntary—and it goes on and on.
So it significantly broadens the tests for unconscionable conduct, but it ensures that they are all relevant. The defect of the Australian Democrat amendment is that it broadens it out to infinity.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In committee</title>,Bills,31,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-04-02,"—Section 51AC? The note says `interpreted by reference to section 51AC'. You have 51AC as a new section which you have put in. The Democrat amendment says that the definition of `unconscionable' is to be covered by the definition of what we have here in 51AC. So the court, in looking at the operation if someone is taking an action under unconscionable conduct, will say that the meaning of `unconscionable conduct' is covered in all of 51AC.
Is there a definition of `unconscionable' somewhere else in the Trade Practices Act? There is not. An adviser is shaking his head saying no. I accept his help. As I understand it, `unconscionable' is not defined in the Trade Practices Act. It is common law usage, which is the phrase Senator Murray has used.
Therefore, I do not think it is unreasonable to say that you have a common law definition of common usage. One might even say that that is a wider definition. But by being such a wide definition it is actually implemented in a very restrictive way. What we have here is confining it to the areas of our concern, of activity in business transactions as they affect small business.
It seems to me that there is something quite reasonable about this definition going in. I would point out that the heading of 51AC just says `Unconscionable conduct in business transactions'. The court then has to go off to common law usage—I presume by prece 
 dent—to find out what the term `unconscionable' in the heading of 51AC means. I presume there is no definition at the front of the act of `unconscionable' at all, is there?
—No.
—Therefore, the opposition is attracted to the amendment the Democrats have forwarded. I know there will be hundreds of QCs and lawyers jumping up and down about what this means and saying that this may be too radical. I accept what you say—that what could happen has all been listed. How can this meaning of `unconscionable', which says it is restricted to 51AC, make it more difficult for the court?",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In committee</title>,Bills,31,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-04-02,"—If you read the note carefully, as we have done, it says that the meaning of `unconscionable conduct' is intended to be wider than its common law usage and that it should be interpreted by reference to section 51AC. The court is already required by the law, if it gets passed into law, to have regard to those matters that I have been picking out like a lucky dip.
—No, it says it `may have regard' to those.
—Yes, it may have regard to those things. It draws attention to all of those things; it may have regard to those things. What the amendment that is before us says is that you basically take the common law meaning of `unconscionable' which we are saying is in the common law. We have not sought, by definition, to make it narrower or wider. It is part of the common law. We have said that the court may have regard to all of these other matters. What the amendment is saying is that the meaning of unconscionable is intended to be wider than its common law usage.
—But only with reference to 51AC.
—No, it says `and should be interpreted by reference to section 51AC as a whole'.
—Yes. That is the definition.   
—You could argue, if you are a small businessman, if you had to look at 51AC as a whole, that you are actually narrowing the potential for it. What we are trying to do is to give the court guidance in relation to the unconscionable conduct and to say, as it says at the beginning of 51AC(3):
Without in any way limiting the matters to which the Court may have regard for the purpose of determining whether a corporation or a person . . . has contravened sections (1) or (2)—
which are above it—
. . . the Court may have regard to . . . 
So it is giving it very clear guidance. But we contend that putting in a note such as this would be an absolute lawyer's breakfast. They would love this. They are just basically saying that you can make—
—They have not done too badly out of `unconscionable conduct' already!
—I know. That is right. They have done well from this parliament in the last few years with native title and this. It really is creating a feast. It is just saying that `unconscionable' can be as wide as you want and you can have reference to 51AC.
What you are trying to do with this is to say to small businesses, `This is your new remedy. This is something for you to pick up to take the unconscionable conduct to court. It is going to be a lot clearer and more assessable than it was in the past.' We have tried to ensure that there is a very clear guide there, that it is easily understandable and that it is in very plain English so that even bush lawyers like me can understand. What this would do would be to make it nebulous. We do not want this to be nebulous; we want it to be quite clear. The government is very strongly opposed to this amendment.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In committee</title>,Bills,31,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-04-02,"—That is exactly the point. We know that headings have no force at law, and we know that you cannot instruct the judiciary—that is why the words used there are `may have regard to'. We also know that any case brought to court may indeed only focus 
 on part of 51AC—it may be brought with reference to part or parts. It is unlikely that all or most cases will be brought with reference to the entire list of possibilities. That being so, there is the fear amongst some small business organisations that what the government has produced is a Clayton's bill. In other words, because it is focused on unconscionability, the real need of small business to have unfair conduct in business transactions reduced—and significantly reduced—will not result. I am prepared to give the government the benefit of the doubt. I do not believe that it is a Clayton's bill. But there is the danger and the thought that, because of the way in which the judiciary has previously dealt with unconscionability in law, they will continue to have a very narrow definition and that they will not significantly advance the cause which this bill is meant to serve.
That being so, it is intended for the court to have regard to the fact that unconscionability must be regarded in a broader sense than in its current case law form. As a guidance to the court, the way in which they should look at it in a broader sense is to interpret it by reference to section 51AC as a whole. In other words, unconscionability should not be related to just a paragraph or a section out of 51AC. We think that is helpful in enlarging the possibilities within section 51AC. The parliamentary secretary is quite right: it does serve to increase the opportunities afforded to small business under section 51AC. I do not think it is a major increase, but it certainly will make it more possible for them to get a better outcome under this section, and it is for that reason that I have moved the amendment.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In committee</title>,Bills,31,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-04-02,"—I want to draw the attention of the parliamentary secretary and the committee to paragraph 64 on page 159 of the Reid report. It states:
In relation to these concepts—
these concepts of unconscionable conduct—
Toohey J in Louth v Diprose 1992 had this to say: `Although the concept of unconscionability has been expressed in fairly wide terms, the courts are exercising equitable jurisdiction according to recognised principles. They are not armed with a general power to set aside bargains simply, because 
 in the eyes of the judges, they appear to be unfair, harsh or unconscionable.'
What I am concerned about—and I think this is why Senator Murray's amendment is attractive—is that, because there is this general common law usage definition, the judges—and I am not criticising the judges—are actually taking a conservative view about the use of the phrase `unconscionable conduct', and I think the quote I have just read out makes that point.
By taking up the Democrats' amendment, I think we will be making it clearer what we mean by unconscionable conduct. Judges will be guided by section 51AC and they will, therefore, be able to take decisions on matters not just because they appear to be unfair, harsh or unconscionable, but because this is covered in section 51AC. I think that is going to give a better remedy to small business.
After quickly glancing through this section of the Reid report, I commend the members of the committee on their work on the description and usage of unconscionable conduct. It is as good as any I have seen, and I think it makes the point of why the Democrat amendment has something to commend it here in this debate.

We believe this is the most important amendment that has been moved, or equally the most important one. I certainly believe that the threshold issue is important, and what we just voted on I think is reasonably important. What we are doing is putting a retail tenancy code into the legislation. This is in accord with the Reid recommendations, and that was the unanimous decision.
We all know that across Australia the most consistent complaint that small business raises is the relationship they have with their landlord in commercial tenancies. They have endless complaints, many of which have been exposed in television programs, about the way small businesses have been treated by their landlord and the way some of them have been gazumped, to use that phrase, have suddenly had massive increases in their rent or have been told to leave. If they do not want to accept an increase in rent, they find that they will be forced out of their location. After they have made a major investment in fitting out their shop, et cetera, this is something they just cannot walk away from.
So in every way the economic power between the landlord and the retail small business is certainly unequal. That is why every state parliament, every state government, as well as the federal government, has been bedevilled by arguments over retail tendencies. It has been going on now for decades, and it has got worse rather than better with the development of mega shopping centres where small business knows most of the customers will be. The whole promotion of those major shopping centres makes this an even more important issue.
We believe that there ought to be a national retail tenancy code with teeth in the Trade Practices Act. Some might say this is an unnecessary centralisation or too much power to the Commonwealth parliament or to the 
 Trade Practices Act; let each state have their own retail tenancy code legislation. I would have thought that by now, when you are dealing with national landlords, major companies that are operating at the national level, across all states, developing major shopping centres, it is time to have a national code. I think reasonable people in the legal profession and in business would say, `It will save us a lot more time if we know there is one set of rules which we all deal with, rather than having to negotiate under different codes and practices in different states.'
We believe that this is not an unnecessary centralisation of power to the Commonwealth. We believe that this is a very practical approach which puts into operation a set of rules that everybody knows and if there are breaches remedy can be obtained under the Trade Practices Act from the ACCC, we hope, cleanly and quickly. This is the way we believe commercial law in Australia should generally be operating.
We have heard complaints from big and small business about the unnecessary costs and delay involved when you have systems that vary from state to state. At the moment retail tenancies are almost the equivalent of last century's different railway gauges which bedevilled our transport system for 100 years—with each state developing a different railway system that did not match when it got to the border. Modern commercial retail activity is now overwhelmingly promoted as a national industry with national advertising and a national approach even given the variation in the size of our states. These major companies, whether they are direct investors or involved through the big insurance and life companies which are investing in shopping centres across Australia, are overwhelmingly run on not just a state basis. Therefore, this amendment we are moving is more than reasonable and is a practical approach.
I will not go through the amendment in detail but the disclosure statement is dealt with in the code. There are decent simple rules of disclosure so that the retail tenant knows what they are getting under the contract. There are no hidden or obscure clauses that later can be interpreted by the landlord in 
 any way they like against the interest of the retailer. All of that is outlined very clearly in our proposal. Nobody can argue with these definitions that will be in the interpretation of the code.
We believe that this is an opportunity for the national parliament under the powers of the Trade Practices Act to establish once and for all a national code. It may not be perfect; we can review it. There will be further arguments for adjustment from year to year as market conditions and certain practices change in the community. But people will know that in the future, rather than having to get six state and two territory governments to change they only need get one code changed at the national level and it will apply everywhere. We believe that this is a very sensible economic and micro-economic reform—if I dare use the phrase—that will reduce costs for both retailers and landlords. We commend the amendment to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In committee</title>,Bills,31,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-04-02,"—I advise senators that the standing orders of the Senate require that no divisions be taken after 6 p.m. on Thursdays. That means that it is impossible for this piece of legislation to be passed after that. I would appreciate being able to move it along. I think we can do that; we have debated most things. It is standing order No. 57.
—I would have thought we'd complete this before 6 p.m.
—I think so too. Very few people are aware of the WA provision, as we call it, in the standing orders which allows WA senators to get home on a Thursday night. It has been in effect for about 12 months.
The coalition will strongly oppose this. Firstly, we believe that because of the Australian constitution we can only possibly rely on the corporations power here and because many of the major shopping centre owners are not corporations under the Commonwealth law you simply cannot achieve it. I am  familiar with some advice that was provided to the Motor Traders Association by Blake Dawson Waldron that involves a scheme to put special taxation on organisations that do 
 not incorporate and thereby bring these organisations under the reach of the corporations power. We would be interested to know whether the Australian Labor Party supports the Blake Dawson Waldron proposal—under Denis Rose's hand, I think. I would be interested to know whether the Democrats propose forcing property companies to incorporate by using a tax to coerce them to do that. That is the only way you could possibly seek to give this proposal any teeth.
The Australian Labor Party as late as 22 April 1997 when Senator Schacht went on Mr Price's program on 3AW and said—
—In 1997?
—Yes, 1997. When Mr Price, who had obviously been campaigning on these issues, raised the business about the retail tenancy act—he actually said residential tenancy act but I think he meant retail—you said:
In . . . both. For the tenancy . . . under the Constitution retail tenancies themselves are a matter for the state, so there's a matter of getting good legislation at the state level.
Obviously the Reid report convinced you that that was not correct. More lately your leader, Mr Beazley, at a meeting on 31 August 1997 in Perth on the same issue said:
You have problems of the day to day experience of tenants that goes beyond the general propositions that are covered by Unconscionable Conduct. You need a good State Act to be able to deal with that.
And he referred the people at the meeting to my friend Doug Shave. So the Labor Party supported that up until a few months ago.
There is no doubt about the unconstitutionality of it and, in the meantime, under the `New Deal—Fair Deal' legislation, the Commonwealth government undertook to use all of its efforts to ensure that we achieved higher standards of retail tenancy legislation in the states. As recently as 5 December 1997, all state ministers responsible in this area, including the Hon. Sandra Nori MP from the New South Wales government, signed on in these terms. The draft communique from the special meeting of Commonwealth, state and territory ministers and parliamentary secretaries responsible for retail tenancy matters, which I will table, reads:
The Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries endorsed the objective of establishing consistent legislative or regulatory minimum retail tenancy standards across Australian jurisdictions. Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries supported achievement of this objective through State and Territory legislation or regulation. The Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries reaffirmed that proposed or existing State and Territory-based legislation or regulation is best placed to deal most effectively with retail tenancy issues.
You would probably say, `Well, they would say that.' But it is historic and I think Senator Schacht would recognise that to get a ministerial council, or whatever this particular council seek to call themselves, to say absolutely without equivocation that they will sign on to establishing `consistent legislative or regulatory minimum retail tenancy standards across Australian jurisdictions' is quite historic. They have not done that before. The states have been developing their own legislation.
—It has taken them about 15 years to get it done, of course; they dragged their feet. I've been through this on other things too.
—I have had that experience as well on the Corporations Law but the reality is that you can get these things into place.
The Commonwealth has the will there, as do the states. It is a matter of political imperative for the states. It is a hot issue out there for the states as much as it is for any of us. Hardly a week goes by that Ray Martin does not have a show on some tenant being done over by a landlord. The Commonwealth is going to drive this process. The bottom line is that you do not have the constitutional power at the federal level. The Labor Party recognised that up until a few weeks ago. We will be opposing this amendment.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In committee</title>,Bills,31,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-04-02,"—This is one of those issues that is made clear to you in my electorate—in fact in the whole of Western Australia. Close to my electorate there is a food hall and I have had people from the food hall leaping out at me, if you like, knowing that this debate on the Trade Practices Act was coming up. They were very keen that something be done to stop the current abuse of power by land 
 lords—and, in this particular case, by an absentee landlord. You can see there are various parts of Western Australia where there are obviously gaps, and the gaps last for a long time. That is probably because the people involved are not treating their tenants very well. They have lost good tenants because they have asked for too much or they tried to treat them unfairly. So I think it is needed.
I would be supporting the opposition's amendment. I would like to think that if it is not supported by the Senate's majority we will see something happen, and happen soon. The reality is that we know small business is a major employer and we know that companies or corporations are involved. Whether they are overseas absentee landlords or large shopping centres which have tenants within their arcades, surely it would be useful to them to have some sort of uniform code that gave them some sort of `certainty'. Whichever way it goes—as I said I will be supporting this amendment—if this does not get up in the Senate, everybody will be watching to see some resolution at a state level fairly soon.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In committee</title>,Bills,31,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-04-02,"—I have an intense interest in this area and have had for a long time, both in my pre-political life and since. I have actually written a booklet—49 pages worth—on leases, landlords and tenants which deals with this very issue. We know the government's argument about lack of constitutionality. That argument was considered by the Reid fair trading report. There is still some question over it—I accept that—and it needs to be tested. But I am also concerned when all the ministers around the various states get together and agree on a minimum code. That is what we are frightened of. We are frightened that it is legislation that is going to end up as the lowest common denominator. What we are after, on behalf of tenants, is a maximum code because the law, generally speaking, is deficient in every state and does not deliver yet, in any state, the sort of regime that would balance the scales between landlords and tenants.
I would say to you as follows, Senator Schacht. I am not convinced, as you are not, 
 that you have everything in your legislation that you should have or that it is great legislation. It probably needs a lot more work. Having watched what has happened in divisions so far today, I would suggest that if we vote to call a division on this one it is likely to go down again, because even relatively simple propositions have been dealt with in that fashion. If that is the mood of the Senate, I do not want to see what you have suggested die.
What I want to suggest—and I am not sure how it would work—is that, with the motion that the report of the committee be adopted, your amendments be referred to the Economics Legislation Committee for inquiry and report. I am not seeking a repetition of the fair trading report's approach, because you have actually put down details whereas they, at great length, made recommendations, although they were nevertheless generalised. I believe that the government's case that it is not constitutional needs to be tested, and tested well. I believe that the content of your amendments needs to be tested, and tested well, and needs to be compared against the propositions of the state ministers who are putting up something accordingly.
So, with great qualification—I am not going to put myself wholeheartedly behind everything you have put in there because, frankly, I do not do so—I support you out of principle, not in terms of detail. But I would suggest to you that it is likely to go down. I would recommend to you, if you are willing to do so, that we put up a reference of the matter to the Economics Legislation Committee.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In committee</title>,Bills,31,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-04-02,"—I accept the fact that until recently I—when I was minister for small business and went to interminable meetings where there were very upset small business retailers who were complaining about their rents, et cetera, and I remember a famous one in Newcastle which was extremely vigorous—was having to say to people, `This is a state matter; unfortunately, we don't have a remedy for you.' That was the case at that time.
We are now saying that, yes, it is true; we have had advice from Mr Rose that there is 
 a way to use the corporations power to have this mandatory code in place. Someone will say, `Mr Rose has got it wrong'—with two lawyers there will be three opinions; we all know that view that is around. However, he does put forward a substantial case to say in principle it can work. That is why in June last year the shadow ministry took the principled position of endorsing all the Reid recommendations—including this one about the mandatory code, the uniform retail tenancy code—and subsequently did further work taken from Mr Rose's opinion. So I do not think there is anything inconsistent with what I have said previously prior to this work being done.
I also have to say, Senator Murray, that you are right. Unfortunately, the numbers are probably not quite with us on this if you go through our track record in the committee stage so far. I am certainly not opposed at all to the idea that there be a resolution in the report of the committee that my amendment, if it is defeated, be referred to the Economics Legislation Committee for further consideration.
All I can say, as a final point, is that I know the minister is speaking more in hope than in reality about a ministerial council meeting representing the six states and two territories. They have a consistent track record of there usually being, unfortunately, one state or one territory that will not buy complementary legislation. In my own area as minister responsible for standards, we could not get them to agree to introduce legislation over 10 years to tell the time correctly in Australia. You would have thought that was absolutely uncontroversial—but no. In the end, even this new government has had to accept doing legislation under the constitution to take it back from the states so that we could tell the time. Therefore, I am not convinced that a council will actually get us through rapidly enough and, as a result, the complaint from the small business area of retailing will continue and the demand will grow for the principled position that there be a national, uniform retail tenancy code. I commend the amendment to the Senate.
	 Question put:

(1)	 Omit proposed subsection 51AC(7A), substitute:
(7A)	 A reference in this section to acquisition or possible acquisition of goods or services does not include a reference to the acquisition or possible acquisition of goods or services:
			 (a)	 by a person or corporation employing more than 20 people; or
			 (b)	 in the case of a person or corporation engaged in the manufacture of any goods—by a person or corporation employing more than 100 people; or
			 (c)	 at a price in excess of $1,000,000, or such higher amount as is prescribed;
		 whichever represents the highest threshold in relation to the particular case.
This amendment says two things: that the threshold shall be what I shall refer to in shorthand as the ABS definition of small business, or the $1 million government cut-off point, whichever represents the higher threshold in each case. This has been debated at length and we clearly understand the issues. Therefore, I do not intend to comment—unless there are further questions.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>In committee</title>,Bills,31,1

"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-04-02,"—The opposition has an amendment but we will be withdrawing it in favour of the Democrats' amendment. Since we started this debate one thing has been clarified that does ameliorate some of our concerns and that is the threshold figure of $1 million can be changed by disallowable instrument subject to further debate and community consultation. That does give flexibility regarding some of our concerns about not having to introduce legislation. I have no doubt, knowing the 
 small business community, that if they think this threshold of $1 million has kept too many people out of getting remedy under the act, there will be great pressure to rapidly change that figure and that definition.
We are attracted to the further Democrats' amendment in particular in that the $1 million is over a 12-month period and not an endless period. Senator Murray has already explained that. We believe this amendment makes it easier for more small businesses to get remedy under that definition. It is a very reasonable amendment.
The government has already indicated that none of these amendments will be acceptable and, on the track record of the votes so far in the Senate, I suspect the government has probably got the numbers for its view. However, as the parliamentary secretary has generally indicated, there will be a review in 2½ to three years time. I have no doubt this will be one of the major areas, other than retail tenancies, that will demand further change. The opposition will be voting for the Democrats' amendment.

"Reynolds, Sen Margaret",ALP,1998-04-02,"—This is the first opportunity that I have had to speak in this place on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2] . I was on a parliamentary delegation to the United Nations at the end of last year and, although I have spoken on the issues relating to this particular bill, I have not had the opportunity to put a viewpoint in this place. I must say that one would have thought, being as distant as I was in New York, the implications of the debate would not have reached me at the United Nations.
But I have to tell senators that there is concern within the United Nations about some of the perceived changes in attitudes in relation to human rights generally, and in relation to racism and indigenous issues specifically. I want to spell these out before going into the detail of my presentation. Firstly, I think it is known that, over the previous five or six years or so, Australia had taken a high profile in initiating indigenous debate in the international community. There is concern that we seem to be adopting a different position and leaving it to other countries. Secondly, rather than speaking out on racism, we are leaving it to other countries.
I am certainly not accusing the government of adopting a different approach in terms of voting against some of these resolutions, but we are not being up front in taking a leadership role on either racism or indigenous issues. Given our background, given the sensitivity of these issues in this country, given the fact that we do have a certain legacy to live down, given the history of the White Australia Policy and the history of indigenous and non-indigenous relations, I am 
 really pleased to see Senator Herron is in the chamber. I appeal to Senator Herron to have us take a much more proactive role in the international community as soon as possible.
It is complex legislation and I propose to revisit the debate essentially from an historic, moral and practical perspective. Essentially, I would say that the Australian people are entitled to ask why they need to recognise what they perceive to be special land rights for indigenous people. It is a legitimate question for those who have not been part of the debate, who have been given a very warped view of history in their schooling. It is understandable that they do not understand the issue. That question, as well as `How has this need evolved?' and `What will it mean to the average taxpayers?'—those are the three questions that an average Australian is likely to ask.
Firstly, the term `native title' must be demystified. It is a term that has been widely abused, discredited and misunderstood since the High Court first recognised indigenous land rights in the Mabo case. Since that time, too many political and industry leaders have deliberately created a fear of Aboriginal association with the land. Why? Talkback radio hosts and other sections of the media have fuelled this widespread alarm about both the Mabo and the Wik cases. In particular, the High Court itself has been undermined by critics accusing it of `mischief' and `adventurism'—although, presumably, after yesterday's decision, there will be more muted comment about the High Court itself. But, in answering the question, `Why is native title a fact of life in Australia today?' we must emphasise the reality that the High Court did not invent native title. The High Court did not give anything new or extra to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; the court merely accepted the historic evidence and the international legal precedents that have been inherited because Aboriginal property rights pre-exist European settlement of this country.
In considering how this situation has developed in the specific Wik claim, which of course has very largely prompted this legislation, we need to go back to the experience of 
 Aborigines who were first in direct conflict with pastoralists attempting to establish Australia's cattle industry, who then became integral to its success. I would urge anyone who is concerned about pastoralists' rights to read Dawn May's book Aboriginal Labour and the Cattle Industry. It is the first book that I know of to genuinely recognise the major contribution of indigenous people to the success of the cattle industry. In the conclusion to her book, she says:
Given that the cattle industry was not economically viable in the nineteenth century, it was heavily reliant on traditional skills of Aboriginal people to minimise costs. Aboriginal people provided labour in an area where white workers were reluctant to venture. The seasonal nature of the work suited Aboriginal workers as it allowed them to leave the station to pursue traditional activities. The link with the land ensured their return to stations located on tribal ground. Because it was their own country, they had an intricate and detailed understanding of the area.
The cattle industry, the pastoralists, are indebted to Aboriginal people for the work they did from early contact to the late 1950s.
The book continues:
After 1919 the situation changed markedly, moving into a new phase . . . the Queensland government took a more active role in regulating Aboriginal employment in the cattle industry. In a liberal democratic society such as we have in Australia, the rights of the individual are seen as more important than the rights of the state. This did not extend to Aboriginal people. Although the state was theoretically committed to their protection, the interests of the cattle industry were always paramount. Aboriginal wages were set below the award to assure the industry of cheap labour, and removal orders directed labour to areas where it was most needed. Removal orders became a major instrument for breaking Aboriginal people's nexus with their land.
It goes on to say that protectors could use these orders to relocate people who were seen as surplus to the needs of the cattle industry at that time. At this point I want to table a photograph of this time in the cattle industry in North Queensland around Wik country. It is a photograph that I discovered in the Brisbane airport during the term of the Keating government. It was displayed by the FAC as an historic photograph, but I am sure, when honourable senators see it, that they will 
 be shocked by it. It is called `Children pulling plough, Weipa 1930'. I seek leave to table that photograph and to distribute copies of it.
Leave granted.
—I thank the Senate. I make this point not to lay blame at the feet of the pastoralists or the church—it was probably, as far as we can tell, on a church mission—or to try, as some would say, to make anyone feel guilty. I simply table this photograph as a very realistic depiction of the inheritance of the Aboriginal people of that region who claimed their rights in the Wik case. It is worth emphasising that the occurrence of children pulling a plough—in the photograph there are about 29 children pulling a plough in Weipa in 1930—was against all Australia's commitments to protect children, to protect indigenous people; yet it happened. It is symbolic of what we are discussing in this debate. We have to understand the history and experience of indigenous people.
More than 150 years ago, when pastoralists were moving into Queensland to take up land that was not theirs—it still is not theirs; they rent it—administrators naively thought that Aborigines and the cattle industry could coexist. Over all those years, that was the expectation; yet here we are in 1998 still trying to find ways where Aborigines and the pastoralists can coexist. Today, even after the High Court has ruled this way, many people—not just in the pastoral industry, but also other Australians—resist fairness and equity in a negotiated settlement.
I know a little bit about the need for negotiation. In 1993 I wrote to the then Queensland Premier, Premier Goss. I thought senators would be interested to hear that in 1993 I, as the government representative on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, wrote to the Premier and suggested that he host, without prejudice, discussions between Comalco and the Wik people, as I believed this would be a positive step in resolving the uncertainty surrounding future mining leases at Weipa. However, I acknowledged fully the concern of the Premier to facilitate appropriate development which offered economic growth and employment opportunities. I said:
I believe, nevertheless, the Wik People are entitled to:
(a)	 a full apology for forced expulsion from mission land—the action of a National Party Government which failed in its duty of care—a breach of fiduciary duty—despite strenuous efforts of the Presbyterian church management acting on their behalf.
(b)	 discussions about reasonable compensation for that action to reflect a 1993 response to a total breach of State Government standards as being responsible for the welfare of Aboriginal people at that time.
(c)	 negotiations about the future relationship between the State Government, Comalco and the Wik people to ensure recognition of indigenous rights and an appropriate package of training, jobs and infrastructure.
I also pointed out that there had already been, even in 1993, a number of successfully negotiated agreements between Aboriginal communities and sections of the mining industry in other parts of Australia which illustrated that it was possible to reconcile Aboriginal interests with development. I did not have very much success in persuading the then Premier to initiate negotiations. Instead, the legal option was pursued. The legal option was pursued with a vigour and a cost to Queensland's taxpayers.
Soon after that first letter, seven Queensland federal members of parliament wrote again to the Queensland Premier. On that occasion we made the same points and we requested that negotiation be the way to go rather than going through the courts. Negotiation was not seen as the appropriate way to deal with the Wik people's absolutely legitimate claim. We all know what happened. The Queensland Labor government refused to negotiate and went to the court. Guess what? Out came the High Court and said that coexistence and negotiation would be a good idea, as we would all assume.
So back I went in 1997 to a different Premier. On that occasion I was critical, as I had been of the previous Premier. I said that I was concerned by his comments about restructuring the High Court which suggested that he was unwilling to accept the umpire's decision, even when that decision was based on legal precedent that had been established in the United States, Canada and New Zea 
 land for many decades. I reminded him that I had previously written seeking negotiation and acceptance of coexistence. I paid tribute to the Prime Minister, who negotiated in the native title debate in 1993.
On 19 February 1997 I also acknowledged the work that at that time John Howard was doing in initiating those first negotiations. It is just a pity that he has not continued to negotiate with indigenous people. I also acknowledged the work of the Tasmanian Liberal government in initiating a major dialogue between its cabinet and the local indigenous community. I also even acknowledged Premier Kennett—which, as senators would understand, is most unlike me—because he was also working with Aboriginal leaders to develop a state-wide agreement on native title. But still Queensland was lagging behind in refusing to negotiate.
A few months later, in May, I wrote again to the Queensland Premier, and still the Queensland Premier was grandstanding in his criticism of the High Court, in his alarmist statements about backyards being taken over. On 6 May I wrote to express my concern about his government's challenge to the High Court decision in the Wik case and the breakdown of the reconciliation process in Queensland. I was concerned at the proposed changes to the Natural Resources Act which would have allowed some 3,000 leaseholders to convert to freehold status on interest-free terms. I called on him to reveal these details:
1. The names of individuals holding pastoral leases and the extent of their tenure;
2. The names of companies holding pastoral leases and the extent of their tenure;
3. The amount of land held by lease and the amount paid per hectare per year;
4. The number of leases held by individuals not holding Australian citizenship;
5. The number of leases held by foreign-based companies.
I did get a reply to that letter, but I did not get the detail. The Premier said that, if I wished to pay for that work to be done, I could take appropriate action.
I think the experience that I have outlined indicates that, as long as people—be they Queensland premiers, industry leaders or 
 decision makers in this place—continue to reject the concept of basic decency in accepting equally negotiated outcomes with indigenous people, miners and pastoralists having equal say and equal power, we will not resolve the indigenous land rights issue in this country. We may see a piece of legislation go through this parliament, but we will also see challenges. We will continue to have uncertainty.
For all the complexity and all the detail and all the hard work that many people may well have put into this, until there is an acceptance of the legitimacy of indigenous rights we will not have an acceptable outcome. Until we have an acceptable outcome, an outcome that many people around this country are calling for, we will be accused of racism and denying indigenous people justice. That will be extremely damaging to Australia's name.
That brings me back to the point where I started: Australia's reputation in the United Nations has been a very proud one, but we are losing it. People are asking, `What is happening down there?' I have described it as being a little like asking about someone's relative who is very ill—you are concerned but you do not want to be intrusive. I am afraid in this case the sick relative is the Australian government's attitude.

"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-04-02,"—First of all, I would like to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which Parliament House stands: the Ngunnawal people. It is easy for all of us to forget that there are traditional owners of all of Australia, including the cities—and that includes Canberra and Parliament House, where we are now. I would also like to acknowledge the presence—I do not know whether they are in the gallery at the moment but they have been throughout this debate and will continue to be—of the Wik people from Cape York Peninsula.
The last time the Senate debated the Native Title Amendment Bill I was unfortunately unable to speak on the second reading. I had that flu that was going around, and it was very distressing for me to be sitting at home listening to the radio, yelling at various 
 people from my lounge room. Fortunately I am back here now, and I will try not to yell at various people but it is very difficult not to. Although I cannot say I am pleased that the bill is back before us, I am pleased that I can now make some small contribution to the second reading debate in the defence of the rights of indigenous Australians.
This evening I would like to concentrate on some international dimensions of the native title debate. Successive Australian governments have agreed to bind Australia to a number of international human rights standards. The universal acceptance of a set of basic guidelines about human rights behaviour is to be applauded, and of course I do applaud that. But it is a real pity that this bill appears to infringe a number of international human rights instruments to which Australia is a party. In particular, the bill appears to the Australian Democrats to contravene article 27 of one of the most basic human rights instruments—the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights—as well as contravene the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.
To understand how this is so, we need to go back to 1993 and to the events during the drafting of the Native Title Act. At that time, the indigenous negotiators agreed that the act could be deemed to be a `special measure' for the purposes of racial non-discrimination law. A `special measure' is something which advances a disadvantaged racial group's human rights even though it contains elements that can be deemed to be racially discriminatory. The indigenous negotiators agreed to those aspects of the act which discriminated against native title holders as a trade-off against the provisions which improved on the common law rights of native title holders—and I refer there, of course, to the land fund, to the non-extinguishment principle and to the absolute basic right to negotiate.
This bill that we are now debating has had no such agreement from indigenous people, but we have seen the federal government seek to rely on this in its attempts to push that legislation through. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination obliges Australia to outlaw racial 
 discrimination and to provide for equality before the law in the enjoyment of human rights. That includes property rights. That convention also requires us to apply special measures only when they secure the advancement of a racial group towards the equal rights of others. In the Democrats' view, this bill fails that test.
It is really quite astounding that Senator Minchin has described this bill as beneficial to indigenous Australians. It most certainly does not advance their rights—including their property rights—as defined under that convention. Obviously, then, the government cannot possibly be relying on the `special measures' test because it just does not apply to this bill.
In fact, this bill discriminates against indigenous people in a number of ways. The most crucial is that it supports the rights of non-indigenous people over the rights of indigenous people. It takes a great deal away while giving very little back. You need look no further than the amendments to the right to negotiate, to the sunset clause, to the validation of intermediate acts and to the suppression of rights associated with primary production activities, water, fishing and reserves.
In essence, we have private property rights of indigenous people being removed for the benefit of other private leaseholders—be they pastoralists, miners or developers. Removing those rights would be bad enough if they were being removed in the public interest. But they are not being removed in the public interest; they are being removed for private interests. The removal of the right to negotiate over mining on pastoral leases would benefit private interests at the expense of native title holders. The compulsory acquisition provisions in the bill are designed to benefit other leaseholders to the detriment of native titled holders. Allowing diversification of land uses, up to the definition under the Income Tax Assessment Act, is designed solely to benefit those other than native title holders.
The second major area where the bill discriminates is its failure to provide the same protection to native title holders' property rights as is afforded to others. If we were 
 considering what automatic rights should be afforded to pastoralists, to miners or to developers when native title holders wanted to take some action on the land over which they held rights, those rights would no doubt include some form of consent. However, if we consider the provisions of this bill relating to validation of intermediate acts, to private water and fishing rights and confirmation of past extinguishment, those rights do not apply to native title holders. When it comes to indigenous people under this bill, no such consent is required.
The sunset clause under this bill is not only discriminatory but also immoral. It is immoral to impose it on one group's property rights and not on others. In short, this bill treats native title as an inferior property right to all other property rights under Australian law—and that should never be the case.
Discrimination also occurs if there is a failure to provide equality by way of appropriately different treatment of the unique aspects of Aboriginal culture—and we see that in the ICCPR. Let me stress that this is not `special' treatment, as the government seems to think it is; rather it is appropriately different treatment. It is quite appropriate to be different in this case. It is a reality that Aboriginal culture is not white culture. We have to accept that. This bill discriminates because it does not accept that fact.
In the right to negotiate provisions, it fails to recognise the Aboriginal sense of obligation to land, whether it is in relation to its use, to its protection or to its management. The Australian Democrats not only believe the bill is discriminatory and will be seen as such under international standards but also believe many aspects of it are immoral.
It is morally wrong to: remove the property rights of one sector of society on the basis of race; impose a time limit on some people's property rights but not on others; use unfair tests that people have to pass to exercise their own property rights; render people's property rights useless by removing their ability to negotiate about the use of their land; and validate unlawful acts without either permission or compensation to those who have been 
 disadvantaged by those illegal acts. All this is on the basis of race alone.
At the international level, United Nations committees—the Human Rights Committee and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination—apply the relevant standards. They do this partly by considering complaints from individuals or groups who report breaches. While we know the findings of these committees are non-binding, such a finding against Australia, based on this bill becoming law, could only be extremely negative for Australia. Our standing in the international community, as we have just heard from Senator Reynolds—and she is absolutely right—in the field of human rights is already at the lowest point that I can remember. Such a finding from a United Nations committee can only diminish our standing even further.
After the furore and fallout that has arisen in our region over recent times, it is hardly in our national interests to continue either the perception or the reality that Australia is prepared to discriminate against one race over another. We cannot afford as a nation to fail to develop a better understanding between indigenous and non-indigenous Australia. Mick Dodson, the former Social Justice Commissioner, and a great Australian, wrote in the Melbourne Age last year:
Coexistence is about sharing our history and our stories, as well as our land and contributing to a shared vision of our nation.
This bill not only does not achieve that but takes us in the opposite direction. The opportunity we have as a nation to foster an understanding of Aboriginal culture is an opportunity that presents itself to any nation not just once in a decade or even 50 years. Let us not squander it.
The doctrine of terra nullius upon which our law was founded provided us with the excuse to attempt a decimation of a culture. That was many years ago. It must never be attempted again—either implicitly or explicitly. The failure to build our future on respect and on tolerance will contribute to a reality that sees Australia unable to disentangle ourselves from the racism which has disfigured our past. The discriminatory aspects of 
 this bill must not be enacted if we are to disentangle ourselves from that past. I sincerely hope that the Senate accepts that view over the coming days.",SENATE,<title>NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,34,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-04-02,"—It is with some surprise that I rise to speak at this stage in the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2]  debate. It seems that the Democrats, who are listed before me to speak, have not arrived. But I was intending to speak this evening because this is, of course, a very important debate.
I find myself debating native title in this chamber for the third time. I was fortunate to have been recently elected when we first passed the Native Title Act in 1993, and I participated when we first dealt with this bill last year.
—And made a very find contribution.
—Thank you, Senator Woodley. I find it difficult to know what to say this evening because we have debated this bill before. Unfortunately for Australia, we are debating it again. But I think there is also a sense of anticlimax this time, because there was a lot of emotion and a lot of energy when we first debated this bill. Obviously there is not quite the same atmosphere this time as people await to see the outcome of the final, often backroom, negotiations. That is unfortunate because this is still a most important issue dealing with very important principles for this country. It is vital important that the nation focus on this debate because, in my view, how we treat our Aboriginal people and how we respond to the challenges thrown down by the Wik High Court decision are fundamental to the future of the country. It is imperative that this parliament provide leadership and deal with this issue in a constructive way—in a way which builds on the reconciliation process and in a way that finally recognises the legitimate rights of the first indigenous Australians.
I will not be party to any decision in this parliament which seeks to further restrict those Aboriginal people's rights. It is very important that this parliament takes a principled stand. The common law rights recognised by the High Court must be respected by 
 the parliament. In my view, there is no other option open to us. If we do not do this we will only condemn ourselves to division, to further legal challenges and to international ridicule, as has been pointed out by earlier speakers. More importantly, that sort of decision will eat away at the wholeness of the nation, it will eat away at the fabric of the nation, because we cannot have a situation where we fail to recognise the common law rights of Aboriginal people. We will not be able to survive and prosper as a nation unless we come to terms with their rights.
I am very proud of the position that the ALP has continued to take in this debate because I think it is a position of principle; it is a position of persistence in advocating the proper recognition of Aboriginal people's common law rights to native title. I am very proud of our leader, Mr Beazley, of Gareth Evans, of Daryl Melham and of Nick Bolkus, in particular, for the role they have played in ensuring that the Labor Party has adopted and maintained a highly principled position—one which has resisted the political pressures to concede ground in advocating Aboriginal people's native title rights. As I say, this is one of my proudest moments in the Labor Party, and I am pleased to argue and advocate our position.
It is common to claim that this debate has been a divisive one—that is has divided people, particularly in the bush. To a certain extent, that is true. The tensions caused by the debate and the expectations raised, quite falsely I think, by some conservative members of parliament, have been divisive, and have caused people to be concerned and fearful. But there are also a range of very positive things that have come out of this debate as more people have been educated about Aboriginal culture and Aboriginal relationship to country. For the first time, I think many of us recognise the importance to these people of that culture and country, and the importance to Australia of our recognising and paying due heed to that culture and Aboriginal relationship to land. While there have been some negative aspects of the debate, there have also been highly positive aspects. I think it has resulted in the education of a large 
 number of Australians about the value and importance of Aboriginal culture, the pride it generates among Aboriginal people and the value of Aboriginal people to Australia.
While we have been forced to confront some of the more divisive issues, I think we have also been forced to confront the European treatment of Aboriginal people, our failure to respect their culture and our failure to allow them to practise their culture and enjoy their relationship to land. I think that, as a result of large numbers of Australians having to deal with those experiences and with that reality, that in the long run it will be a very positive thing for Australian society. I just wanted to make that point—that there are also many good things coming out of this debate which will be for the good of Australia in the longer term.
I want to make a number of points that I think are worth repeating. When this legislation was last before the Senate I made a speech in the second reading debate which set out my views on this issue. I do not want to repeat all of what I said as I am conscious that, in a sense, the debate has moved on. But there are a number of important issues that I think have to be highlighted, and one of those is the way so many Australians of non-Aboriginal descent have mobilised in support of Aboriginal people. I want to congratulate them; I take pride in their activities and in their commitment to and support of Aboriginal people. I think many good people have developed an awareness and have mobilised in a display of solidarity which is highly laudable. I have drawn great strength from their activities.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-04-02,"—I seek leave to make a statement in response to an order of the Senate on 31 March in relation to the tabling of certain documents. I understand notice has been given to all parties.
—I raise a point of order. We are in a period of the Senate's timetable where there is agreement that no quorums and divisions will take place. I was not aware that the minister intended to do this. I wonder, procedurally, how we will go if anything arises out of his report. I am a bit perplexed by the suggestion that we do it now rather than during the normal sitting time of the Senate.
—I suppose it is slightly complicated by the current arrangements, but the order of the Senate required me to table a document by no later than 2 April, therefore, close of business today. It seemed to me that in those circumstances I had to respond today. I am happy to respond in the morning, to allow the matter to be debated tomorrow morning, or whenever it is convenient. I do not mind. If the Senate wants me to make the statement tomorrow, I will make it tomorrow.
Leave granted.
—I am indebted to the Senate. Senator Bourne's motion seeking the tabling in the Senate of the report provided to the government by Arthur Andersen Corporate Finance on the ABC's digitisation strategy was the subject of an order of the Senate on 31 March. I do not propose to table the document, on the basis that it is subject to public interest immunity. It is a confidential report obtained by the government for the purpose of consideration of issues which are currently being considered in the budget. It forms an attachment to a cabinet submission and has been lodged with the cabinet office. Cabinet's consideration of the budget has not been completed. It is not reasonable or appropriate to expect the government to make public a document forming part of cabinet deliberations. The Commonwealth has consistently opposed release of material relating to cabinet considerations in the parliament and in the courts. These considerations are particularly important where those deliberations relate to matters to be considered in the context of the federal budget.
I note that the Australian Labor Party, when in government, also accepted the need for confidentiality of cabinet documents. Although I am always extremely loath ever to 
 rely on anything that Senator Bolkus says, on this occasion I will, but only on the basis that it forms part of a tabled statement from the then Attorney-General, Mr Lavarch. In response to an order of the Senate in relation to documents relating to payment of legal costs for Carmen Lawrence in her legal challenge to the WA royal commission into the Penny Easton affair on 29 June 1995, the statement read in part:
Some of the documents caught by this motion I have not tabled on the basis that they are subject to legal professional privilege or public interest immunity or both. The documents which are caught by the motion which I have not tabled include:
requests by the Attorney-General for advice from his Department;
the advice provided by his Department;
documents, including this advice, and advice from the Department 	 of Finance, which formed the basis of Cabinet ministerial and consideration of these matters . . . 
					 . . . . . . . . . 
These documents clearly fall within the accepted boundaries of legal professional privilege and public interest immunity. The Senate has traditionally recognised such claims.
Further, on 13 November 1995 in response to an order of the Senate relating to the appointment of the acting director of the National Gallery of Australia, then Senator McMullan said:
One document, a letter from the Minister for Communications and the Arts to the Prime Minister . . . has not been tabled. The government considers that the public interest would not be served by having the document produced to the parliament. It deals with the consideration by cabinet of a relevant matter. It is a well-established convention that deliberations by cabinet are confidential, and no useful purpose would be served in this instance by a departure from that convention.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation</title>,Documents,35,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-04-02,"—by leave—At the time the Senate asked for the document to be tabled I had not heard many of the things that the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) just said. I must say that the document was not half as interesting to me before that statement as it is now. Before that statement we had heard a few comments from Mr Errol Simper and we had read a couple of comments in 
 newspapers and elsewhere probably related to that article. Who knew whether they were true. Now, of course, I am assuming that everything I have read is true. The document is absolutely fascinating. It has a great deal in it that all of us who have the ABC's best interests at heart really want to read, and it is in no way laudatory of the government. Perhaps I am wrong, but the only way to prove that to me now is to come up with the document, to table it and to demonstrate that that is not the case. Until I see the document that is what I am going to assume is in it.
It was interesting that the minister said that the document had been—I was writing the words as he said them and I may not have them quite right—`attached to a submission to cabinet and lodged with the cabinet office'. It is fascinating that you can attach something to a submission to cabinet and lodge it with the cabinet office and therefore you never have to show it to anybody again as long as you live. You could do that with anything, could you not? The mind boggles. It is just wonderful. Think of the things you could hide that way. It is just extraordinary.
As far as I knew, this was an independent study—by an independent and very well-respected organisation—of the ABC's digitisation strategy. What can be secret about that? If it is purely because of a budget strategy, about whether or not the government is going to fund the ABC—which I now doubt, having heard all this—to digitise its entire production and transmission network, it is obvious that when I bring up this motion again, as I will, after the budget, the minister will be more than happy to table it immediately. I tell the minister now that that is what I am going to do. I look forward to seeing it and to being proven wrong. Concerning all my suspicions about this document, I look forward to seeing it and to being proven wrong about what I now think about document.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation</title>,Documents,35,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-04-02,"—Unfortunately, I do not think 
 this is going to be one of my best contributions, given interruptions and the haste with which I was called originally. But I do wish to continue some remarks I started before the dinner break, because it is important to make a few points in this debate, although, as I said earlier, I think we covered much of the ground the first time around—the first time the parliament dealt with this bill.
I did want to make some further observations. First, I want to try to dispel the myth that somehow this bill is going to fix up the problems that people perceive with native title—that there is going to be some quick fix put in place by the parliament by which those people who are concerned about native title are going to be satisfied and the problem as they see it is going to go away. Of course, that is not going to happen, and those who have created that expectation will have a lot to answer for when they go back to those communities. For 200 years Aboriginal people have been striving for recognition of their rights to the land in this country. Having finally received some recognition, they are not going to give up that recognition lightly and they are not going to walk away from asserting those rights.
For the government to pretend that they can introduce a sunset clause in this bill and create the impression that in six years time all of this will be resolved because the people will have filed a claim and had it dealt with and somehow native title will be fixed is, firstly, a legal nonsense. But it also fails to have any appreciation of the way common law rights of Aboriginal people to native title are likely to develop in this country. We have seen the experience of the development of native title law in other countries, which has taken anywhere between 50 and 100 years. Our very brief experience with our own native title leads me to believe that it will be a long time before the issues surrounding native title are resolved in this country.
That is not to say that the parliament should not act; that is not to say that parliament should not put in place procedures and regulations and laws to help create a structure for the resolution of native title claims and the fair and just recognition of the rights to land 
 of Aboriginals and other stakeholders. But for people to somehow think that this is the end of the process, that what happens in the Senate in the next few days is the end of the process, is quite wrong and extremely misleading. We are at but one stage in a developmental process, and it is a very early stage.
I think the government has made a serious error in not inviting the involvement of Aboriginal people at the early stages of the development of their legislation. The Aboriginal people have a right to be consulted, just as the pastoralists and the miners and other people have been consulted. In my view, without the consensus agreement of all those stakeholders and a broader Australian community consensus, we will not get any constructive development on native title. We cannot legislate in favour of part of the Australian population over the interests of another group of the Australian population. That will not resolve native title issues in this country. We must attempt to legislate for all stakeholders and for all Australians. I think the government has missed that opportunity by choosing to legislate on behalf of what they think are their constituent groups.
I suspect that this process will be repeated sometime down the track, that we will have to debate native title issues again at some future stage, because we have not built a national consensus about the resolution of native title issues and we have not included the Aboriginal people in genuine discussion about their legitimate aspirations. We will at some stage have to do that if we are to make real progress in resolving a whole host of issues that relate to the development of native title in this country. I do want to put down that warning. To think, whether the government's legislation is carried or not, that somehow we are resolving native title issues by this process is a complete fallacy.
I also want to mention my own state of Western Australia briefly, because we have had the most serious difficulties in Western Australia in terms of overlapping claims, particularly in the Kalgoorlie region, with its high level of mining and exploration activity and what has turned out to be a whole raft of 
 competing claims by Aboriginal groups and individuals to native title in that area. Because of the history of Aboriginal settlement in the area and the mining activity, we have a very confused and difficult picture. I think it is fair to say that the Kalgoorlie goldfields region represents the most difficult case in terms of trying to resolve issues associated with native title.
I do want to say that I think there have been some serious errors made by the mining industry, usually the smaller miners, by attempting to buy progress in these areas. There has been a lot of concentration on the fact that so many Aboriginal groups and individuals have sought to lodge claims and make financial settlements with mining companies to allow exploration, but I think it is also the case that a whole range of mining companies have sought to buy favour and buy progress with their claims in a way which has made a rod for their own backs. I think the large mining companies will certainly tell you that.
From our point of view, it does not do us any good to be too critical of those Aboriginal groups or individuals who have sought to take advantage of the situation. The way the system has developed, I think there is fault on both sides, and the behaviour of some of the mining companies has been highly cynical. I think they have now realised that they made a rod for their own backs. The behaviour has become so cynical that in Western Australian recently we saw a mining company—headed by the brother of the Premier, as it turns out—which actually paid for the lodgment of a native title claim over a piece of land on which they had mining exploration permits. That is the level of cynical and, some would say, corrupt behaviour that has developed.
We will have to deal with that, but I think it is fair to say that this legislation goes no great way towards resolving those issues; those claims are lodged and those developments have taken place. Without some general agreement on the principles to be applied or without some serious negotiations and face-to-face discussions on the ground this legislation, whatever its form, will not fix those problems. People have to start dealing with that reality 
 because the legislation is not the panacea for those real practical difficulties that exist on the ground.
I wish to make another point: the right to negotiate is one of the most important aspects of this bill because it is about recognising Aboriginal people as having rights and giving them power. The government seeks in this legislation to reduce that power. I find that very interesting because Senator Herron and others have always argued that the future for Aboriginal people lies in them having independence rather than welfare dependency. That is quite right. But that independence must be built on them having rights and power, and one of the very things that give them rights and power, the Native Title Act, this government seeks to water down. It is because Aboriginal people have been asserting their rights and power in their relationship with mining companies and pastoralists that the government has sought to try to reduce that power. The government must deal with the problem. They cannot have it both ways. Empowering Aboriginal people is a good thing. That is what the Native Title Act in part did and their attempt to water it down does them no credit.
I want to make a point on behalf of Senator Cooney. Senator Cooney, unfortunately, will not be with us for this debate. He is on a delegation. As senators would know, he has taken a very keen interest in the issue and he played a big part in the debate the first time. Senator Cooney, who is a very accomplished parliamentarian, wanted to make the point that despite the great dispute about the history of relationships between Aboriginal people and non-Aboriginal people we have accepted since 1993 the preamble to the Native Title Act, and that includes a clause which says:
(b) 	 to ensure that Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders receive their full recognition and status within the Australian nation to which history, their prior rights and interests, and their rich and diverse culture fully entitle them to aspire.
Senator Cooney makes the point that these very laudable objectives contained in the preamble to the Native Title Act have been supported by this parliament and that the government, in seeking to amend this legisla 
 tion, continues to support that preamble by having it remain within the act. Senator Cooney wants me to bring to the attention of the parliament the fact that the government is maintaining that preamble but in his view the government's amendments run contrary to those laudable intentions contained in the preamble. He thinks it would not sit at all well for this parliament, which endorses the preamble, to endorse the government's amendments as well. He sees them as being contradictory and he believes that the amendments passed by the Senate the last time are a much better match for the laudable sentiments that we all profess to share. I do want to put that on the record for Senator Cooney, who is most concerned that he was not able to be part of this debate. I am sure the debate will be poorer for his absence but he remains absolutely committed to the protection of native title and will, I am sure, follow the debate with interest and seek reports on his return.
It is very important that this parliament do all that it can to protect and enhance the rights of Aboriginal people to native title in this country. This is a defining moment in the development of this country and it is essential that this parliament provide the leadership on this issue. Without that leadership Australia will be a much poorer nation.",SENATE,<title>NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-04-02,"—There are two main issues that I want to address this evening in this debate on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2]  and they are, firstly, local government and the role which it can play in bringing communities together and providing leadership and education and, secondly, conservation and the way in which the Native Title Amendment Bill has the potential to remove a very vital level of protection for our natural environment.
I have been enormously encouraged by the work of local government in this country since the Wik decision. A publication entitled Working with native title was put out by the Australian Local Government Association last year and was followed up by a number of seminars and workshops in local governments right across Australia.
After I attended the ALGA's national conference late last year I reported to the Senate the groundbreaking resolutions that were passed at that conference, almost all of them unanimous, which reflected the desire by local government to lead their communities into reconciliation through understanding. In my view, local government much more than other levels of government understands the importance of united communities. They know, because they are in touch with those communities, that issues of the significance of native title must be handled with care and sensitivity and in the local context.
The ALGA was here in Canberra yesterday and it asked for a role in the all-important task of raising awareness and providing a vehicle for education. It is most unfortunate that local government is very rarely brought to the table or asked for its collective view. In this I would urge the federal government to take up the offer of the ALGA to run a national community based public education campaign with opportunities for constructive mediation and negotiated outcomes.
I bet you that if we surveyed a slice of Australian society right now to find out how much people understood about native title and the 10-point plan, you would find that there is a very high level of confusion. I say confusion advisedly because this government has, in my view, done its utmost to mislead people about what native title is actually about.
Sir Rupert Hamer, respected former Liberal premier of Victoria, this week drew attention to this state of confusion in his letter to the Age. He pointed out that Senator Minchin had been saying that his bill respected native title in line with the Wik decision and provided for claims to be made on about 79 per cent of Australia's land area, including over pastoral leases. On the other hand, Dr Patrick Wolfe says, and I think correctly, that the effect of the bill will be to convert pastoral leases into freehold property.
It is clear that the government cannot deny that its legislation allows the compulsory acquisition of native title rights and allows state governments to reissue leases as a different form of tenure. Aboriginal property rights are removed without their permission 
 by removing their right to negotiate. It is, in fact, privatisation of public land. And if there was still any doubt in anyone's mind, we should refer to the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) last year that `primary production', referred to in the legislation:
. . . goes far beyond pastoral activities that are currently sanctioned under pastoral leases.
He said:
. . . those activities will be able to be carried on without any let or hindrance from either native title claimants or indeed any other section of the Australian community.
Senator Minchin confirmed this in a letter that he sent to one of his constituents recently. He said:
It is true that the amendments will permit the Commonwealth, a State or Territory to acquire native title to allow a leaseholder to undertake activities for which a form of exclusive tenure is necessary (for example, to undertake horticulture or other high intensity agriculture). This may include an upgrade of a lease to freehold.
Of course, once horticulture or other high intensity agriculture is permitted, native title can no longer coexist. The rights of the farmer then prevail.
Sir Rupert Hamer concluded his letter by saying that, unless the Senate reaches agreement about the objectives of the bill and the extent to which they are achieved:
. . . any election called on this issue will not relate to the merits of the bill, it will rest upon uncertainty and prejudice.
Primary production has a wide definition and it includes just about any commercial land or water use. We must remember that much pastoral lease country has already been damaged by overgrazing, erosion, species extinctions and land clearing. The rate of mammal extinctions in Australian rangelands is already the highest in the world. Primary production has indeed a very wide definition and will allow uses that have not previously been allowed on pastoral leases.
It is this threat which prompted the National Biodiversity Council to speak out last week and to say that the 10-point plan posed a significant threat to Australia's biodiversity. These 17 eminent scientists, advisers to government, are concerned about the changes 
 to land use in the upgrade of pastoral leases. They said:
Australia's record of land management since European occupation has been appalling, with many extinctions and removal of a large percentage of many different pre-1750 habitat types. Less than 8% of the natural habitat remaining is protected in reserves. In many places, loss of species and simplification of ecosystems has resulted in decreased opportunities for future generations of Australians.
Biodiversity conservation must consist of careful management of unreserved land; that is, land used for grazing, agriculture, mining and human settlement. The Council believes that it is imperative that controls like those imposed on the use of leasehold land remain and, indeed, they should be strengthened in accordance with our improving understanding of how best to manage land sustainably.
The NBC calls on the Government to honour its commitments to the International Convention on the Conservation of Biological Diversity by not pursuing proposed changes which may permit the opening up of new and potentially inappropriate land uses across much of Australia. It is our opinion that opening up leasehold land to full primary production and facilitating land uses which are equivalent to those on freehold land will seriously diminish our ability to protect the biodiversity Australians are so fortunate to have inherited.
Dr Tim Flannery, author of The Future Eaters , joined these scientists and urged the government to carefully consider the implications for Australia's biodiversity.
This upgrading, as we know, also opens the way for irrigation and will greatly limit the ability of governments to manage river courses and water resources. A case in point that I would like to mention here is the Fitzroy Dam and the associated irrigation project in the Kimberleys. A feasibility study, as I understand it, is now under way for the construction of dams on the Fitzroy River—this is the largest river in the Kimberleys—to allow the conversion of pastoral leasehold land to a quarter of a million hectares of irrigated agriculture, mostly presumably cotton. This could use 2,500 gigalitres of water annually.
With this legislation there would be nothing to prevent this scheme going ahead, despite the environmental damage which it would cause, which would include salinity, pesticide 
 pollution, threats to species of fish and birds, and loss of environmental flows. Such a scheme would also wipe out native title and, with it, the culture of Aboriginal communities in the region. The traditional owners would have no say over such a scheme.
Our national parks and state forests are also under threat. Approximately 23 per cent of Australia is reserve. The amendments allow reserve land to be used for non-reserve purposes where it would cause `no greater impact' than a use consistent with reserve purposes, and that will be done again without reference to native title holders. The states can develop management plans or put in, for instance, camping facilities without any requirement to negotiate with native title holders. Negotiation, under those circumstances, is not discussion about money; it is simply an agreement about how these places are managed.
Uluru and Kakadu are two of Australia's best known reserves. I recall the great resistance and the enormous fuss that was created some years ago by the Northern Territory government when Uluru was handed over to Aboriginal people and then managed under negotiated leases by the Territory. Uluru has been conserved for its natural beauty, for its biodiversity and, above all, for its deep spiritual and cultural importance to Aboriginal people. I know that non-indigenous people who go to Uluru often come away with a much greater understanding of the importance of that place and of Aboriginal culture. They recognise the deep spiritual meaning that is attributed to that place.
With the involvement of indigenous people, there ought to be more opportunities for reserves of this kind. Cape York and the Kimberleys are two which come to mind. The 10-point plan, however, even refers to mining in national parks, which is currently illegal in most states, and allows mining to proceed on reserves without negotiation with native title holders. The states are even able to convert vacant crown land to a reserve just to facilitate mining projects.
The government says that its 10-point plan will remove the racial discrimination inherent in indigenous people having the right to 
 negotiate with miners and not pastoralists. I think this really is the essence of what is driving this legislation. The Howard 10-point plan is not about giving pastoralists certainty; it is about giving miners certainty, certainty that they can ride roughshod over native title and over the environment. My colleague Senator Woodley said yesterday that thousands of hectares of Aboriginal land have already been taken by mining companies since the 1950s, and he referred to the lengths to which mining companies have gone to stop native title.
The right to negotiate is fundamentally important to indigenous Australians. It is not the right of veto, as the government well knows, but it is the right to negotiate. Senator Chris Evans pointed out a moment ago the importance of this right to negotiate and the difficulties being encountered in Western Australia but, as he says, this bill will go no way to solving that problem and I do not need to expand on the sort of damage which is done to the environment by mining companies in this country. Overall, I believe that the threat to the environment from mining or from agriculture is not well understood out there in the community. The debate, quite rightly, has centred on what this will do to indigenous Australians and it comes back, I think, to that question of accurate information and awareness.
I want to return to the question of the ALGA, too. The ALGA says that the overwhelming feedback from local communities is that they are seeking accurate and dispassionate information to assist in developing their understanding of native title: what the bill does, what range of options are available for responding to native title claims and how they can respond within a broader reconciliation context. They say that local communities are trying to find non-adversarial ways of handling indigenous issues, including native title.
Local area agreements, of course, have been very successfully handled and have kept the matter well and truly out of the courts. I would have thought that this would be the way forward and something that the government should be encouraging. I must say that 
 it is my experience, too, that communities are very willing and very keen to do what they can to further reconciliation. I am now receiving invitations to join local communities in reconciliation ceremonies, and just this weekend my local council, the City of Port Phillip, has its annual community day and the theme is reconciliation and unity.
If this legislation has done nothing else, it has generated a groundswell of support for indigenous Australians which will not easily be quashed. If the government's 10-point plan gets through pretty much intact, millions of Australians will be deeply hurt and angry that we have taken such a huge step backwards in our very slow progress towards land rights and cultural recognition of and reconciliation with our indigenous people.
The Democrats have argued before that any watering down of native title is also a watering down of environment protection. Conservation of culturally significant places for Aboriginal people is almost always critically important to the environment as well. But just as indigenous people believe they belong to the land—a notion which is at odds with our own concepts of ownership—we must recognise that we will never be reconciled collectively with this country until we embrace the rights of Aboriginal people to relate to the land in the way which is appropriate for them. After 210 years, the best we have been able to come up with is native title. Let us not destroy that small effort, that small sharing of the wealth that this country represents for all Australians.",SENATE,<title>NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-04-02,"—I begin my comments on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2]  by honouring the Ngunnawal people, on whose land this great parliament is built and on whose land this capital city of Australia has been placed. I want to honour also the indigenous people throughout this country, who enrich our lives and to whom we owe so much, particularly in identifying as Australians whether we are in this country or whether we are elsewhere, and to whom we have returned no such great honour, identification or pleasure in life.
At the outset, I wish to foreshadow an amendment that I will move on behalf of Senator Margetts that we:
Omit all words after ""That"", substitute:
""in view of:
(a)	 the insufficient consultation and negotiation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people regarding changes to the Native Title Act 1993  and the entire issue of indigenous land justice; and
(b)	 concern that passage of the Native Title Amendment Bill in any form will further diminish Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander native title rights and will greatly impede the process of reconciliation and healing between indigenous and non-indigenous people; and
(c)	 the fact that there are many unresolved issues with regard to indigenous sovereignty and unfulfilled promises with regard to the implementation of a treaty process with the indigenous people of this continent;
the bill be withdrawn until a comprehensive process of negotiation and agreement with the many indigenous communities of this continent has taken place"".
What is the plight of the indigenous people of this continent, this country of Australia? It is one of dispossession, and it is an ongoing history. Although it was left out of the history books for nearly two centuries, in the late 1990s every mature Australian has to accommodate to the fact of an invasion which was followed by many thousands of killings, great disruption, torture, pain, and destruction of the oldest continuing culture—and the peoples of that culture—that is known on the face of the planet.
In more recent decades, which have encompassed certainly the early part of my lifetime, that dispossession has continued with the saga of the stolen children, for whom the leader of this country has yet to find a place in his heart to apologise, as a starting point for trying to make amends where no true amends can be made. I am afraid that, if we take an historic view of it, the process which is unfolding in this parliament right now is a continuing process of dispossession. It is a process of taking rights, taking land, taking association with the land from the indigenous people of this country. Instead of this process now being stealth in stealing, it is legalised 
 stealing that this legislation is about—the stealing of rights, the taking of rights, where ethics would forbid such action.
One of the problems with the process is the immediacy of the political situation. Time and again we hear in this place and outside that, above all, we must find a resolution here—and I read that as `we must cave in to the iniquitous 10-point plan even further so that we avoid a race based election, so that we avoid a double dissolution at all costs. But how can we be asked to erode more of the rights of the indigenous people of this country, none of whom are allowed a voice in this place, so that we avoid an uncomfortable election, if needs be, but institute a race based country—a country where the indigenous people are second-class citizens by the law that we pass through this place; a country where their rights to the land and their rights to their culture are further eroded by our action?
So do we avoid the public debate, do we avoid an election based on this issue—as is threatened by the government, and as worries Senator Harradine and so many other people so much—by a process of instituting, against the rights and wishes of the indigenous people, the very thing that election is supposed to threaten? Instead of it being through an election process, it becomes a process that disadvantages the indigenous people and embarrasses those of us who believe in a fair go in this country for decades, if not centuries, to come. Avoid the immediate problem: take it off the ledger, and let the indigenous people bear the penalty of that forever more.
I for one do not think that way. I for one as a Green believe that, in everything we do in this place, we have to look future generations in the eye and say, `We thought of you; you were as important as we were. The only difference between you and us is that you can't vote now, whereas we can.' I do not think we will ever mature as a nation, unless we take on board not just some of the culture of the indigenous people but their philosophy as well, and take into account those future generations in everything we do. If we cannot say, `We thought of you and, after deliberation, we were sure we were acting in your 
 interests,' then we should not be going down that path.
Yet this parliament is going down that path of taking away from future generations of indigenous people in this country their rights to the land, their rights to their culture therefore; and taking away from all Australians the right to know that at last we came to terms with our history and, through a process no less than a treaty, gave what we could of what was left rightfully back to the indigenous people of this country.
Senator Harradine said last night that this is an occasion which will not come again—`If we don't get it right, I cannot foresee a future time when we will get it right.' How wrong he is—because we are not getting it right here, and it is going to continue to trouble us, and we are going to have to get it right further down the line. History is going to judge this moment in this parliament very strongly and very negatively indeed.
When you look at the movement towards a world declaration on the rights of indigenous people, which has now been in train through the United Nations for more than a decade, let us see how we measure up—and I will mention just some of the draft articles of this draft declaration on the rights of the 300 million indigenous people around this world. Article No. 7 is on cultural integrity. It says:
Indigenous peoples shall be free from cultural genocide.
Governments shall prevent:
(a) actions which take away their distinct cultures and identities;
(b) the taking of their land and resources;
(c) their removal from their land;
(d) measures of assimilation;
(e) propaganda against them.
This is the world's move towards an accommodation with indigenous people, one which Australia should be leading—but how far short of this are we? Article 26 on ownership states:
Indigenous peoples have the right to own and control the use of their land, waters and other resources.
Indigenous laws and customs shall be recognised.
Item 27 on restitution states:
Indigenous peoples have the right to return of land and resources taken without their consent.
Where this is not possible, they shall receive just compensation in the form of land and resources.
Item 28 on the environment states:
Indigenous peoples shall receive assistance in order to restore and protect the environment of their land and resources.
Army activities shall not take place on the land of indigenous people without their consent.
Hazardous material shall not be stored or disposed of on the land of indigenous people.
Tell that to the indigenous people of South Australia or the Northern Territory. It further states:
Governments shall take measures to assist indigenous peoples whose health has been affected by such material.
Article 30 on resource development states:
Indigenous peoples have the right to determine strategies for the development of their land and resources.
Governments must obtain the consent of indigenous peoples before giving approval to activities affecting their land and resources, particularly the development of mineral, water and other resources.
Just compensation must be paid for such activities.
To put a bush term on it, we do not come within a country mile of the way the rest of the world is thinking. We certainly do not come within a bull's roar of those stipulations on the proper treatment of indigenous people around the world, including those here in Australia.
In February I had the great privilege to visit the Kimberley for the first time. That was at the invitation of the Bunuba people. For a week I took part in a canoe expedition of 15 people, half of whom were the local Bunuba people, down the Fitzroy River for some 300 kilometres. I will not take a great deal of time to describe the magnificence of that country, its gorges, waterfalls, woodlands, eagles, salt water crocodiles, fish, insects, kingfishers and brolgas—the magnificent interrelationship which we were privileged to have between the Bunuba people and their land; the coming to three galleries of indigenous art, some of it thousands of years old along the gorge country of this great river, some of it not described 
 in contemporary descriptions of such storehouses of indigenous treasure in Australia.
Towards the end of that trip it was pointed out where it is proposed to build a dam up to 100 metres high in the final gorge which will flood back many kilometres an area bigger than that of the Ord River scheme. Then I was told how a 300 kilometre canal is proposed from that dam or at least from the so-called Geikie Gorge below that dam to the plains near Broome. Then I was told how up to 250,000 hectares of those plains will be converted for cotton crops, with the whole panoply of environmental threats that that presents.
Sadly, I had to tell the Bunuba people that they will not determine such things under this legislation, though it be leasehold land which affects them in many parts of that scheme, because those rights have already been given away. Their rights to negotiate on dams are not entertained in this debate by either the government or the opposition because they have been given away. Their rights to negotiate on that 300 kilometre canal are not entertained in this debate because they have already been given away by the government, the opposition and Senator Harradine. Their rights to negotiate on cotton crops spreading across leasehold lands are no longer there because they are not being entertained in this debate. They have been given away by the government, the opposition and Senator Harradine.
The same applies to quarries, and the same applies to woodchip operations and farm stay tourism and fences, roads, offshore fisheries, oil derricks and wharves, and on and on it goes. The deceit of this debate is such that in shorthand now when the press refers to the right to negotiate it is not said at the end `on mining' because that is all that is left—holes in the ground. Everything else has been conceded already by the power entities in this parliament. Yet Senator Harradine says that on this occasion the signs are that we might end up with a piece of legislation from this chamber with which all stakeholders can live. What on earth does he mean? How can the indigenous people live with an outcome 
 which deprives them of the right to have a say in their land forevermore?
How can those of us who do not want to see a divided country in the future say that we are close to an agreement, that the signs are there for an agreement? No, they are not. The signs are there for a get together by the major players in this parliament to sell out the Aboriginal interests in this country. It is written on the wall. It is going to be written down in history as another one of the episodes of stealing the rights and interests of the original Australians. But this time it is the parliament that is doing the stealing.
How can we feel anything but shame at being part of that process? How can we say that the important thing is that we get an agreement? Didn't they once say that the important thing was that the children get a white style upbringing? Didn't they once say that the important thing was that farmers be protected or that squatters be protected from raids by indigenous people? Isn't this just another set of excuses for justifying the unjustifiable?
We are so far from coming up with a fair, just, honourable, reasonable and certain outcome, as Senator Harradine put it, that there is no way that such an outcome will come of this process in the next few days in this place—no way at all. Even at this eleventh hour I would appeal to the Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the National Party, Senator Harradine and Senator Colston to examine again the conscience of this nation if it takes again from the indigenous people and, worst of all, if parliament gives the stamp of approval.
We can excuse ourselves by saying, `Well, we avoided this as a topic in the next election,' but we have to live with the fact that it is something that will not go away. There will be turmoil for this country in the future—as we have seen elsewhere in the world—if we do not get this right. We are charged with getting it right, and we Greens will fight to the last to try to get a right outcome, which means also a just outcome. But, as I said, we are a bull's roar from that at the moment.
At the front of the United Nations Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
 Peoples, there is a quote from Mathew Coone Come, Grand Chief of the Grand Council of the Crees, whom I have been very privileged to meet on a couple of occasions in the United States. He has written that:
The Draft Declaration . . . began as a cry from the indigenous peoples for justice, and it is drafted to confirm that the international standards which apply to all peoples of the world apply to indigenous peoples.
I hope that something of that cry from the heart, which the indigenous people of this country must have towards this historic occasion, will turn around some of the hard hearts that have turned their backs on indigenous rights during the passage of this legislation so far in this parliament. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-04-02,"—It is important that the Senate gets this issue right because the Howard government to date has shown both a complete unwillingness and a total incapacity to do so.
The approach of the Prime Minister to native title has been insensitive, narrow minded and mean spirited. He has consistently refused to listen to those who have a different view from him. Right from the start, the government set this bill up to become a double dissolution trigger. The bill was to be the vehicle to deliver a poll-driven and socially divisive race election and with that agenda as the basis of their approach the government has thwarted our attempts to work constructively on this issue and negotiate in good faith. They have not been willing to compromise at all.
On the other hand, I think it is also important to remind the Senate that, far from being obstructionist, the Labor opposition has bent over backwards to work with the government and with all stakeholders to try to come up with a workable solution. We did not block this legislation last year. We passed the bill even though more than 80 per cent of our amendments were defeated. We felt that what we did achieve with our successful amendments was a more acceptable piece of legislation that at least had some chance of survival in the High Court. We validated titles that were potentially invalid. We were successful 
 in making the legislation subject to the Racial Discrimination Act and we were successful in retaining the right to negotiate. We still contend that the bill, as amended and passed by the Senate, is one that should be acceptable to the government. It took into account the needs of all stakeholders.
Even at this late stage, we believe that, if the government starts to show some good faith, it is still possible that a bill can pass with broad support from the Senate, and then the ugly threat of a divisive, race-based double dissolution election can be averted. We do not want to fight an election that promotes division within the community and where the government will try to exploit community fears and prejudice. However, we believe that this legislation, unamended, is unconscionable and should not be passed by the Senate.
There really is no better indication of the government's motives on native title than John Howard's own advertising campaign which was exposed by the Labor Party during recent Senate estimates committee hearings. John Howard's own office was responsible for devising two newspaper advertisements on native title and having them exhaustively focus group tested. One of those was inspired by John Howard's infamous performance on the ABC's 7.30 Report where he held up a map of Australia, 78 per cent of which was stained brown, declaring that the brown represented the area of land that may be subject to native title claim. The other advertisement was based on a photograph of a corrugated iron humpy entitled `The Australian dream'.
The Prime Minister's office asked the Office of Indigenous Affairs to provide the text and directed the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet to book $600,000 worth of newspaper advertising space. These ads were to appear, of all things, over the Australia Day weekend. The only conclusion one can draw is that the Liberals considered that the Australia Day weekend was the most appropriate time to launch such damaging and divisive advertising. I think this exercise provides a very instructive insight into what you could expect during a John Howard 
 orchestrated double dissolution election campaign on native title.
But beyond John Howard's election agenda, beyond the next election, more than anything, unless it is amended this legislation will deliver uncertainty to all stakeholders. There will be ongoing uncertainty of title, uncertainty of rights, uncertainty of laws and uncertainty over business and livelihoods. Yesterday's High Court decision on the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Act is proof of that. All the double dissolutions in the world will not save unconstitutional legislation. Yesterday's High Court decision, properly analysed, must send a warning signal to the government. The risk with the legislation before the parliament today is that, if the government does not accept reasonable amendments to its bill, we will see years of endless litigation and we will see years of social division.
A prudent approach would see the government back down from its brinkmanship. It would see the government work with us now to achieve a workable and acceptable solution to all parties. For the Labor Party, especially after yesterday's High Court decision, it is critical that an amended bill be subject to the Racial Discrimination Act. For the Labor Party, the right to negotiate must be retained. Of course the other risk is that, if John Howard's legislation passes unamended, it will be decimated by the High Court and we will have to start all over again. The bitter irony of such an ordeal will be that the next government, of whatever political persuasion, will inevitably have to revisit and embrace our amendments to make the legislation workable.
This debate does have international significance. It has ramifications for Australia's standing in the international community. We will not stand by and see Australia's reputation at risk of being sullied on race issues. We will not be silent as Australia risks losing its high standing as an advocate for racial tolerance and indigenous rights. We will not be silent if the Howard government's policies see us become an international pariah on these issues.
But this bill not only affects our international standing. Most importantly, it will deter 
 mine the way that Australia treats its indigenous people. This bill may on the face of it be a bill about land management and a new layer of land title which the High Court recognised in the Mabo decision. But at the heart of this bill is a moral issue. Do we turn our backs on our indigenous people? Do we insult them by allowing this bill to go through unamended? Do we wind the clock back prior to 1967 in our treatment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and say, `For a brief few years you had native title. But now we'll give you bucket loads of extinguishment'? I just want to say this: the opposition in the Senate refuses to allow Australia to go down this path without putting up amendments and without supporting other amendments which will take the discrimination out of John Howard's divisive bill.",SENATE,<title>NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-04-02,"—I believe it is important at the start of this speech in particular to acknowledge that this debate on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2]  is taking place on the traditional land of the Ngunnawal people. I also wish to recognise the many other indigenous people who have tried to make their message heard in relation to this issue over what seems like a very long period, including those present now in the gallery and others who have been in this house over the past few weeks, the past few months and indeed the past few years. As my Australian Democrat colleague Senator John Woodley said yesterday, we all need to recognise that the decisions we make on this piece of legislation will directly affect these people—potentially in an extremely significant way.
Senator Brian Harradine indicated in his second reading debate contribution the first time we debated this bill that we as a parliament and as the Senate, as the chamber of review—the house that most accurately reflects the views of the Australian population—have an opportunity to respond to the High Court decisions on native title in a positive way or a negative way, in a constructive way or a purely political way. As he said:
We can see this as an opportunity to contribute to reconciliation and restoration of trust— 

or we can play politics and fail once again, as we have so many times in the past.
It is my not overly uplifting view that we have failed once again. I think no-one on any side of this debate could possibly suggest that this legislation and in particular the debate that has surrounded it have contributed to reconciliation and restoration of trust. This legislation is flawed and, in the Democrats' view, the amended version passed by the Senate at the end of last year was also flawed, if in a slightly less significant way.
The political approach to this issue, in my view, again highlights the defects in the adversarial two-party system of Australian politics. I think the Labor Party, in some respects, seem to have treated native title as a problem rather than a marvellous opportunity. Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, at the Labor Party's recent Hobart conference, spoke about his grand solution to this native title issue. His solution was to get all stakeholders in a room and basically make them all talk it through and not let them out until, to use his words, `this problem is solved'.
In my view and I believe the Democrats' view, that whole aspect of continually looking at native title as a problem, as a bad thing, as some difficult thing, as a risk to investment, as something that is a real pain that we just have to try to get rid of or deal with and forget about is why the parliament has failed to address this issue adequately. It is not a problem. Look at the situations that people in countries in Europe—in Ireland, for example—face. They stem back many centuries and are so difficult to resolve. Often times societies do not get the opportunity to be able to grasp a specific moment to really address those centuries-old problems—the legacy of history that is impossible to escape from unless it is acknowledged and addressed. Here in Australia we have had this marvellous opportunity—due to the High Court rather than any wisdom of us unfortunate politicians—to be able to address and respond to this problem and to some extent deal with it. I feel, unfortunately, we are going to stuff it up again.
At the end of the day I think everybody wants certainty, to use the magic word. They 
 want to know at least in some respect what the future holds in what always seems like an uncertain and unpredictable world. Clearly and undeniably, this bill, either in its current form or even in, in the Democrats' view, the amended form as it was passed last time around—we will see what we end up with at the end of this second go—will not provide certainty. That is the con which is being sold to the Australian people. If I can quote an article by Margo Kingston in today's Sydney Morning Herald dealing with the High Court decision from yesterday:
. . . the government has proclaimed, eyeball to eyeball, that its bill provides constitutional certainty. After yesterday's Hindmarsh decision, all that is certain is that the question is unresolved.
This will not provide certainty, this will not address the issue and this will be yet another missed opportunity to take a positive step forward.
How can Minister Minchin continue to proclaim that his legislation is beneficial to indigenous people, as he insists on doing, when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) says that it swings the pendulum away from Aborigines? `Away from' does not sound too beneficial to me.
As the Democrats continue to point out, a double dissolution election on this issue would be a socially divisive gamble—not to mention the $60 million cost involved. To pass a piece of legislation, the process of which may or may not meet the constitutional provisions for a double dissolution trigger, and the content of which may or may not survive the High Court challenge, does not sound too certain to me.
I find it very sad that we have not been able to address this issue positively, that indigenous people seem to have been put last once again. The stances of the major parties seem to have been driven as much by political advantage as by proper policy considerations. I mentioned in my speech on the original bill—I think in November last year—the shadow of Queensland state politics which has been cast over this legislation and this issue, and the stance of the various parties in relation to it. I think that is even more relevant this time around, with the Queensland 
 election even more closely looming. In the same way that Labor's position on the Hindmarsh Island bill was clearly heavily influenced by state political factors in the lead-up to the South Australian election, the pending Queensland election is also obviously heavily influencing Labor's stance on this bill.
It is clear that the Labor Party in Queensland and Mr Beattie, the state opposition leader, in particular are very nervous about the impact of the native title issue on the their electoral chances. As Senator Woodley mentioned in his speech yesterday, Mr Beattie seems to think that he has a commitment from the federal ALP to allow mining leases to be automatically renewed without going through the processes of the right to negotiate.
The Democrats will be standing a large number of candidates in the upcoming state election in a large number of seats across the board, including many marginal seats. I wish to state clearly to the Labor Party that I personally will be watching very closely to see not only their performance on this bill in this chamber—which, as I stated last year, and I am happy to repeat now, has not been particularly inspiring to date on some issues—but also what concrete commitments the state ALP will make on native title issues prior to the pending state election. There can be no doubt that the preferences of Democrat voters will be pivotal in deciding the outcome of the number of seats in Queensland. I think the ALP cannot simply expect to rely on being slightly less worse than the coalition.
Of course, to be fair, I must acknowledge that the Queensland National Party's performance on this issue has been nothing short of disgraceful—deliberate fear, distortion and misinformation from day one. I know I am still naive—and in some ways I hope to retain a bit of naivety for as long as I can—but I still found the extent of misinformation, of distortion, of deliberate deception that has surrounded this issue very depressing and very distressing. That goes back to my concern and disappointment that I expressed at the start of my contribution this evening that we have missed this opportunity and failed to grasp the perfect chance that the High Court delivered to us to take a real step forward.
It is a tragedy that Queensland and Australia will have to suffer the long-term impacts of such dishonest actions, which extend beyond political parties to many other organisations in the community, which have clearly been conducted solely for a perceived political gain. I can only hope that that gain does not eventuate so that the perpetrators of that deception will not be inclined to do it again.
On a positive note, as we are talking about native title, I spoke in my original speech last year—the first time around on this issue—about a few of the many positive and constructive outcomes which are a direct result of native title. It is not just a feel good thing. It is not just the feeling, `This is an historic opportunity. Let's get together and hold hands and say how united we are.' It delivers concrete opportunities, concrete possibilities. These have already occurred as a direct result of the High Court opening up this issue and making us recognise the reality of native title, which parliament, over so many years, continued to turn a blind eye to.
I listed a number of these in my speech during the first passage of this bill through the Senate. I will not go through all those again. But I would like to mention a couple that relate specifically to Queensland. One that I spoke of in my original speech relates to the agreements that have been reached with the Quandamooka Land Council in south-east Queensland and the Redland Shire Council, which is adjoining to my home city of Brisbane.
Another is the negotiations in the Cape York heads of agreement, which were the result of longstanding and very detailed negotiations between a wide range of people in the local communities in far north Queensland—the various indigenous communities from that very large, very diverse, very rich and very wonderful region of Queensland. The pastoralists, environmentalists and indigenous community are among the people that are involved in the ongoing future of the Cape York region—a perfect example of local people, local communities getting together to work out things for themselves about how they might like to progress forward. That is the sort of thing I would have thought the 
 coalition would have approved of. But, unfortunately, specifically in relation to the Cape York heads of agreement and more broadly in terms of native title, they have seen fit to undermine, destroy and ignore.
In relation to the agreement closer to where I live in the bottom corner of Queensland, with the Quandamooka Land Council and the Redland Shire Council, I think it is important to recount again, in an abbreviated form, what that agreement was about. Each area has its own specific and unique characteristics. This sort of thing is an example of what can be done elsewhere. But the big thing about it, and why native title is so important to this sort of agreement, is that it is not just a symbolic thing, it is an example of how indigenous people, wherever they are from and whatever their history, that have any connection with this area are able to be recognised as having a legitimate place.
Given some of the negative aspects of Australian history, clearly the original inhabitants of this land were not recognised as having any role at all, to put it mildly. There were some very negative, appalling things that were perpetuated in specific examples. But even in the most mellow description of the approach we have taken, one could say that the role of the original inhabitants was not considered to be relevant to how we progressed ourselves as a nation and to how we moved in to the future.
Native title and the recognition of it serve to demonstrate to all sectors of the Australian community that the original inhabitants also had a place. They weren't out there getting rights and special privileges. They were just being given a place; they were just being given recognition. To reduce or remove that recognition in a wide range of circumstances, as this bill seeks to do, is very unfortunate—to be mild again and to try to choose non-inflammatory language.
The Quandamooka Land Council, in their agreement with the Redland Shire Council, which to date, or at least as far as I am aware of, has related specifically to North Stradbroke Island—although, they have traditional connections to a broader part of that region, including Moreton Bay and other islands in 
 that region—has been a really positive example of the opportunity native title presents to bring people together; to explore and to walk forward together in to the future; to accept each other's rights, which relates to the wonderful High Court's phrase of `coexistence'; to accept each other's interests; custodial obligations over the area; traditional and current local government obligations; and to ensure that the special environment of this region—in this case, North Stradbroke Island and the surrounding area of Moreton Bay—is preserved for present and future generations. It is not just being locked up for the local Aboriginal people to say, `This is ours. Bugger off. You can't have it. We're going to jump all over it and poke our tongues out at you.' It is a collective, cooperative and inclusive agreement that seeks to work together to move forward.
Native title is central to that sort of agreement in that area and in so many other parts of the country because it recognises coexistence—it recognises the role, the history and the future of indigenous people. We have to acknowledge our history—that does not mean wallowing in guilt; it just means acknowledging it. Remember that in the same way we are now looking back at the actions and the mistakes, as well as the achievements, of the past, so too will Australians of the future look back on what we have done, what we are doing today and what we will do over the next few days in this chamber. I fear that, when they look back at our actions and the opportunities we had and the opportunity I believe we are about to squander in addressing this issue, the judgment of the Australians of the future will not be very kind or positive.
I will be symbolic for a moment. I think I made a similar analogy to the following in my last speech, but I will do it again—what the hell. There are a lot of empty seats around us tonight. The seats are not so empty behind me—which is nice to see. The people are bearing witness to us this evening as to what we are saying about this and will look upon us as we deal with what we are about here and now. We can think of the empty seats all around us as representing the many people who will come after us and who will bear 
 witness not just to what is happening then but to what has happened before. Think of how they will look upon what we have done and, I suspect, reflect on how we could have done it rather better. Perhaps that might give us at least a little bit of pause to think about a long-term approach rather than the immediate perceived political advantages—imagined or otherwise—that each of us may be able to extract out of this in the little political maelstrom that we exist in from day to day; to try to take a longer-term view from the past and to the future and perhaps keep a broader perspective.
This afternoon I was involved in a student youth leadership program that is organised each year. I do not wish to bring that into this debate to politicise it. I think one of the good things about it is that it is multi-partisan and non-political. One of the big things about it is that it talks about leadership and the role of people looking beyond short-term advantage to the broader community issues that need to be involved. I simply ask all senators to at least consider all the inspiration and ideals that are present there as well as the immediate political context that we are so often focused on.
That concludes my contribution. Before I finish, I inform the Senate that because of the extended sittings tomorrow and this evening, Senator Lees, the Democrats leader, has had to go to Brisbane for engagements tonight and tomorrow. As well as making my contribution, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the speech that she would have given during the second reading debate but for the change in sitting arrangements.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
I rise to speak on the Native Title Amendment Bill and I open my remarks by acknowledging the, Ngunnawal people, the traditional owners of the land upon which parliament sits.
I would also like to acknowledge the Kaurna people of the Adelaide region on whose land I live. And on behalf of my Democrat colleagues, I thank the five clans of the Wik people who danced so powerfully on Tuesday in the forecourt of Parliament House. 

Madam President (deputy?) I am proud to stand in this place as the Leader of the Australian Democrats, a party, which has never wavered on Wik.
From the passage of the first land rights legislation and the-first judicial recognition of native title under Mabo, through to the defining judgements in the Wik case, the Democrats have always supported the rights to land of indigenous people.
We will continue to do so and we will not be swayed!
Much has been made of the need to compromise on this legislation.
But some of us seem to have forgotten that the High Court has already compromised.
After the acknowledgment that Aboriginal people were here when the first white settlers came,
•	 it was determined that Aboriginal people have NO CLAIM  over freehold title. That is, no claim over any of that land regardless of any previous wrongdoing or ownership rights. The Aboriginal people accepted this as long as they had the right to negotiate. . . 
•	 Land over which there is no title—unalienated Crown land—may be claimed if an ongoing association or attachment can be shown.
•	 Land under lease, must be shared—with the pastoral lease prevailing.
These determinations Can be seen as nothing other than a compromise for the original inhabitants of this continent.
This compromise—along with further compromises—was enshrined in law with the Mabo Legislation.
Now we are back here being threatened by a Government saying that if it doesn't get its way as far as the removal of even more rights from the original inhabitants of Australia, then it will call an election. The Government threatens that it will go to a double dissolution in the hope that it will be able to pass the entire 10 point plan at a joint sitting.
Well, I think we have compromised enough. This government got 8/10 last time we saw this bill. 80%. Is that enough? What more do they want.
This is a defining moment in Australian history.
At this point in our history we have the chance to right some wrongs, to demonstrate to ourselves and to the rest of the world that we, the Australian people, still adhere to the notions of justice, equality and a fair go. That we will not ask our Aboriginal people to give up even more rights.
The decisions which we will take in this place over the next few days will mark out the kind of society we take with us into the 21st century. 

My earnest hope, and that of my colleagues, is that as the elected representatives of the Australian people we shall emerge from this debate with a decision which truly reflects the fundamental decency  of the Australian people.
Backyards, 79% of Australia ""under threat"", jobs, exports, balance of trade,—the dire invocations have gone on and on. . . ..
They say the land will be locked up, it will be rendered useless, it will be wasted.
Yet the proponents of these arguments know them to be false.
They know these things are not true and it is to their eternal shame that they continue to peddle these lies. And lies are what they are. Backyards are not going to be taken, the economy hasn't ground to a halt and the sky hasn't fallen in—nor will it.
I am delighted to be able to say that hundreds of thousands of Australians, from all walks of life, and from all points on the political compass, have taken the trouble to inform themselves about the issues surrounding Native Title.
This knowledge and understanding has been sought—not out of fear and loathing—but out of a genuine desire to get to the truth, and a desire to see that justice is done to all parties.
I am delighted to observe that the indefensible scare-mongering that has gone on, has fallen, very significantly, on deaf ears.
This issue, and the rights of Australia's indigenous people, addresses and flows from the three pillars upon which Australian society is built the pillars of legality, morality and spirituality.
Let's take the pillar of law.
The High Court has ruled in favour of indigenous native title rights- not once but twice. The Law Reform Commission has come out against the Government's Native Title Amendments. Countless eminent legal figures (including the former Liberal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs) have spoken out against the Native Title Amendment bill.
The law is, fundamentally, about rights and obligations.
Wik is about rights. It is about the right to have ceremonies, the right to gather food, the right to a continuity of relationship with the land and the right to negotiate  with others as to the management of that land.
Wik is about obligation. It is about the obligation we all have, as Australians, to ensure that the smaller, least powerful and most disadvantaged groups in our society are treated equally, and according to the principles as laid down in our law. And it is about the obligation to acknowledge the 
 special rights Indigenous people have as the first Australians.
And in this context it is important to stress again, Wik is not  about taking land from pastoralists. It doesn't seem to matter how often this is pointed out to this Government and others by successive court decisions and by eminent legal counsel. Wik clearly says that pastoral rights prevail over native title rights. I shall say it again. The Wik judgement says that pastoral rights are to prevail over native title rights.
All of my Democrat colleagues in this place have visited indigenous communities and have met with indigenous people.
We have rigorously examined the consequences of the Wik judgement. And we have found nothing to be afraid of Nothing. We accept the obligation we have convey this to the Australian people and we shall continue to do so.
We know that millions of Australians are listening and that they understand.
Let me now discuss this issue in the context of morality.
I am confident that there is not Senator in this place who would—or could—accuse Australia's churches and church leaders of self-interest or duplicity in this issue.
Many of our church leaders and churches have come out in strong support of Australia's indigenous people. Why? Because it is, fundamentally, an issue of morality—of what has been done and what ought to be done.
Of right and wrong. Of justice and equality. Of fair play. Of decency.
You will have noted that I have resisted what is an almost overwhelming temptation to attack the government on its quite disgraceful behaviour over this issue.
I believe that there is far too much at stake here to waste time reiterating- what more and more Australians already know—and that is that this Government's behaviour has been and continues to be shameful.
Enough of that.
I now draw the attention of Senators to the role of spirituality in Australian society. We move towards the religious feast of Easter. There would be no one in this place who would, at least publicly, dare to cast aspersions on those Australians who take Easter to be an important spiritual event on the calendar.
But somehow, for some people, it is considered fair enough to sneer and cast aspersions on indigenous people when they try to explain to the rest of us that their interaction with their country is a spiritual event.  

An indigenous person from Western Australia said,
""If you were in a darkened room and there were people talking about the land, you Would be able to pick the indigenous person straight away, because that person would talk about the subject, the land as if it were a relative.
I guess the single most important relationship we have with the land, and the way we understood it, is the interconnectedness of everything. Animals, plants, us, spirituality, everything is all interconnected and our management of it boils down to this. one cannot survive without the land. People who destroy the country, destroy themselves.
Let us remember that law, custom and culture are tied to country.
If the Government extinguishes native title, it will entrench the problems that have evolved following the displacement of Indigenous people from their land. Health, housing, education, all these things will come after appropriately acknowledging that fundamental connection to country that is so intrinsically important to Indigenous people.
What sort of society would legislate against someone else's spirituality that very element of existence which distinguishes humanity from the rest of the life forms we share this planet with?
I hope and pray—not the Australian society that we want to take into the 21St century
How will history view us?
If we don't know where we've come from, we can't know where we are going.
I've looked at where we're going- and the stark choice we as a nation face at this moment in history.
Let's look at where we've come from. And let us not flinch when we do.
Historian Rosalind Kidd discovered this quote in a Brisbane newspaper published in 1880.
""This, in plain language, is how we deal with Aborigines: on occupying new territory the Aboriginal inhabitants are treated exactly the same way as the wild beasts and birds the settlers may find there. . . Murder and counter-murder, outrage repaid by violence, theft by robbery, so the dreary tale continues, till at last the blacks, starved, cowed and broken hearted, their numbers thinned, their courage overcome, submit to their fate and disease and liquor finish the work which we pay our native police to begin.""
Of course we must also acknowledge the tens of thousands of Indigenous Australians who were stolen from their families, their culture and their communities and the irreparable damage that has done.
At this moment in Australia's history we must learn from history, not deny it—certainly not dismiss 
 distasteful and unpalatable historical episodes as just `the black armband view of history"".
As a nation, we now have the opportunity to remedy many wrongs in our country's past. If we refuse to acknowledge the reality of history, if we refuse to apologise and refuse to work actively together towards reconciliation, we do no more than wind back the clock.
This Senate has an historic opportunity to ensure Native Title rights reman
I am aware, as are we all, that the ALP is currently the target of concerted lobbying activities by big business. I urge the ALP to stay strong in the face of this pressure.
Equally, I urge Senator Harradine NOT to compromise away the essential rights we have left. To stand again with the Australian Democrats—and the majority of the Australian people who are aware of what is at stake here over the next few days.
We must oppose the worst of the Native Title Amendments. The worst of the 10 points.
The Australian Democrats have said time and time again that certain parts of the Native Title Amendment Bill are wrong. They were wrong when they were introduced the first time
The Democrats still say these amendments are wrong and for a second time we will support Australia's indigenous people in their fight for fair access to their land.
Should the government push this issue to the point of a race-based election, I state here and now that the Democrats are prepared to fight an election on this issue.
It is a matter of principle.
Why?
Because we know that the Australian people are fundamentally decent and fair-minded and we are confident that the Australian people do not want any Government to discriminate against Australia's indigenous people.
On behalf of the Australian Democrats—from all of our state and territory divisions and members I assure Aboriginal people that we will not abandon you.
We will not stand idly by while your property rights are watered down watered down and washed away.
We know you were the first Australians, that your land and your communities were stolen from you and voting against the more pernicious parts of this legislation is the very least we can do.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-04-02,"—I rise this evening to talk about an issue that has occupied a significant proportion of my time throughout my period here in the Senate. It is one that relates to information technology. Certainly this government's total disregard on this issue is something that has become an actual symbol of their lack of leadership for the Australian people. I note with interest the contributions of Senator Tierney over the last couple of adjournment debates in trying to put on the public record some credentials that this government has in respect of IT policy.
This evening I would like to put the perspective that Labor holds in respect of this government's credentials on IT policy. It is quite a shameful one. The government has, in fact, squandered the opportunities that have presented themselves to this country. Over the last two years, we have seen this government continually on the back foot when it comes to seeking out and taking hold of the opportunities that are presented to us.
There is so much ground to traverse in this contribution that it may in fact take me beyond the time I have to speak in this adjournment debate, but I would like to start the story with what I see is a significant plank in this government's deficient approach to IT policy. It relates to the identification of Australia's advantages in this area. What are our strengths? What can we hang our advancement on?
One thing that has become very clear over the last two years is the role of government procurement in relation to information technology policy. We know that the largest IT contracts in this country belong to the Commonwealth government. As of the budget statements of last year, we know that this government handed these contracts as a gift to private corporations. The significance of this should not be underestimated. The policies, the procedures and the practices which this government put in place to implement 
 this procedure have not only deprived Australian industry of the opportunity to participate in these contracts but in fact reshaped the opportunities that present themselves.
I refer back to Labor's period in office when the Office of Government Information Technology was established. The basis upon which this office was established was quite sound. It was about trying to harness the efficiencies across a whole of government regime with respect to information technologies and it was about looking at a coordinated approach. We have heard many times in this chamber references by government members to a particular report called Clients first saying that somehow the government's outsourcing agenda was driven by the Labor initiated report Clients first. I am here this evening to draw the distinction between what Labor's vision was for government IT and what this government has done to completely thwart the principles and processes that were put in place.
Clients first identified the potential for efficiencies to be gained. It identified outsourcing as a mechanism for doing that, but it did so on the basis that a benchmark had to be established and the actual precise merits of establishing what efficiencies were needed to be put in place. It was quite a dry formula and I think one that could have been improved. But in handing over the power to this government and the change of political party in control of this country we have seen a complete shift in the approach to the IT outsourcing of government. No longer is it an issue of trying to achieve efficiencies. It is now an issue of complete restructuring of our Australian IT industry.
Through the IT outsourcing process, this government is attempting to harness leverage that will completely disarm and disenfranchise the Australian IT sector. The mechanism for doing this is using vertically integrated and laterally connected cluster contracts, the first of which is cluster 3 which is now being let to a multinational corporation called CSC. It is interesting to note that the savings advocated as the initial justification for this project for this financial year are completely unrealised given the contract has only just been let 
 and we are now only a short month or two away from the budget.
The processes initiated by this have changed the future for our Australian information technology industry. No longer can Australian companies hold up the badge of honour that comes with holding a government contract as a credential to improve their export markets. Under cluster 3, they are perpetually relegated to the subservient position of subcontractor. This denies the sector the opportunity to do business in the way that they set themselves up to do it. The complete domination of the Australian IT sector by these large players is not something that only the Labor Party is concerned about: we know the sector is angry. Their words, their pleas and their messages to the government are being completely ignored.
In this regard it is an interesting process to start analysing what this government's motivation is for what seems on the surface to be a completely unreasonable policy. Why would a government compromise part of our private sector which has the potential for the fastest growth, the most new job opportunities of any sector in the country? We know this because of global trends. We know the information technology sector is one that is growing and has the most potential to grow. So what could possibly motivate this government to deny this sector that opportunity in Australia? I look to a couple of indicators, but the most outstanding is one of laziness. When you have a government that has no creativity, no scope to look beyond what the simple, lazy policy solutions are, you find a government that has the most clout, the most power and can provide the simplest solution.
We see this government wooing multinational corporations. We see them inviting them to cabinet. We see CEO after CEO of major multinational corporations spending time with the Prime Minister and telling him what he can do for them. The Prime Minister is not telling these corporations what they need to do if they want to get a bite of the Commonwealth government's IT outsourcing cherry. We see these corporations dictating to this government what they demand if this country wants the privilege of their presence 
 here. This is what distinguishes Australia from the rest of the world. What we have is a situation where there are lucrative opportunities in the area of IT outsourcing, but these lucrative opportunities should be there to help foster and grow our own uniquely innovative sector.
One of the important issues is definition. I for one know that there is a complex blend of multinational corporations that employ local people and that distinction becomes quite clouded. But, in the first instance, the Prime Minister must be looking towards the strength of this country and providing our own businesses with opportunities; not excluding them.
