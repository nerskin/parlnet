"Mr ABBOTT,MP",LP,2004-05-11,"—Mr Speaker, I seek the indulgence of the chair to add to an answer.
—The minister may proceed.
—In further response to the member for Braddon and, through him, to his constituents, let me inform the House that the Australian Hearing office in Burnie is not closing. I am advised that Australian Hearing will change the operation of its Burnie hearing centre with effect from 17 May. This change is necessary because of the shortage of resident audiologists in Burnie. I am advised that clinical services will be provided for an equivalent of two weeks in every month by two qualified audiologists who are based in Melbourne and Launceston. Technical services for the repair of hearing aids will be provided one day per week by a visiting technician.
I understand that Australian Hearing has advised its 2,000 clients of the details of the new service. It has also advised members of parliament, local hospitals and doctors. Australian Hearing is confident that this new service will continue to meet the government's obligation to children under 21 years of age and to people with complex hearing needs.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Health: Australian Hearing</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1
"SPEAKER, The",N/A,2004-05-11,"—On 1 April 2004, the member for Cowan asked me about security passes for Comcar drivers. There has been no general withdrawal of photographic passes for Comcar drivers. One Comcar driver had his photographic pass cancelled in October 2003, following a request from Comcar management.
Several of the 11 photographic passes issued to permanent Comcar drivers have expired in recent months and have been reviewed by the parliamentary Pass Office in accordance with their routine audit process. It has now been agreed between the Parliament House Pass Office and Comcar management representatives that photographic passes will be issued to all 11 permanent Comcar drivers, subject to their maintaining regular and frequent access to the restricted areas of Parliament House. Comcar management has agreed with the Pass Office that, if a driver does not maintain regular and frequent access, that driver's Parliament House photographic pass should be withdrawn.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER</title>,<title>Comcar Drivers: Security Passes</title>,Questions to the Speaker,8,1

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2004-05-11,"—One could be forgiven for wondering just who is going to run the country next year if the Liberal government is re-elected. We have a Prime Minister who refuses to commit to serving for the life of the next parliament and a Treasurer who wonders out loud whether he has any more budgets left in him. I was astonished to hear the member for Adelaide on radio this morning saying how demanding it had been for the Treasurer to put together nine budgets and how hard it had been on the Treasurer's family and that, yes, it might be appropriate for him to soon move on to be Prime Minister, as if the Treasurer is going to become Prime Minister so that he can have a rest! The bad news for the Treasurer is that Australia in the 21st century is not like Australia in the fifties, when Bob Menzies could go to Lords to watch the cricket while the country took care of itself. Being PM is a bit more onerous than that.
—Are you reading this? He's reading his speech!
—The Minister for Science does not have the call.
—However, it turns out that the country is being run by John Howard—that is, John Howard of Howard Partners Pty Ltd, a firm of consultants who did an evaluation last year of Australia's Cooperative Research Centre Program. Howard Partners recommended that cooperative research centres, known around the traps as CRCs, be industry driven and that pure public-good related research not be part of the program in future. That the Howard government accepted this recommendation is utterly regrettable. It has sounded the death knell for environmental CRCs such as Rainforest CRC and CRC Reef. It has also sounded the death knell for the CRC for the coastline and guaranteed that there will be no funding for the proposed CRC on solar energy. 
I am very disappointed that successive Howard government environment ministers, both Senator Hill and Minister Kemp, have been disengaged from the CRC process and have allowed this debacle to happen. Why weren't they advocating in the Cabinet the importance of research into protecting our environment? They will say, and the government will say, that whether CRCs get funded or not is the subject of an independent assessment and not their decision, but they were party to a government decision to put an end to pure public-good research and to say that the CRCs must all be industry driven.
We have a situation now where the success or failure of your CRC project is all about the size of the industry contributions. So we will have CRCs into coal and cotton but no research into what is needed to protect the Great Barrier Reef or into what is needed to protect our World Heritage listed wet tropics rainforests. What is it that the Bible says? `To those who have much, more will be given; but to those who do not have, what little they have will be taken away.' That is typical of Liberal Party performance. The longer they stay in office the more their true colours shine through.
By abandoning research from the CRCs into the reef, the rainforests and the coast, the government ensures that we will hear less about the environmental problems which these magnificent areas are facing. I suspect that is exactly how this government wants it. This is a government for whom no environmental news is good environmental news. As long as we do not hear too much about the problem, all will be well.
We will hear plenty of talk tonight—budget night—about deficits, but this government has been running a massive environmental deficit. Whether it is land clearing, the extraction of water from our rivers, greenhouse gas emissions or salinity, we are creating an environmental debt for our children and leaving behind an unsustainable legacy of which they will have to bear the consequences.
One of the CRCs being defunded, Rainforest CRC, did a report in January this year which examined the impact of climate change on the wet tropics rainforests. Many rainforest species can only survive in a very limited, mountainous and high-rainfall habitat. Climate change will reduce the area in which many of these species can live, typically pushing them up the mountain. Rainforest CRC found that for endangered species, such as the golden bowerbird, an increase in temperature of just one degree Celsius will shrink the area of habitat in which they can survive by 50 per cent. It might not suit the government to hear this news because it underscores just how short-sighted their policy is to refuse to ratify the Kyoto protocol on climate change, but it is the kind of information we need in order to develop good public policy to protect the wet tropics.
I visited North Queensland last week and spoke with Professor Nigel Stork, the head of Rainforest  CRC in the wet tropics, about his CRC's work. I was very impressed with innovations up there such as the canopy crane, which enables researchers to look at the treetops and examine them without the need to endlessly climb up and down the trees. I was also impressed by the way in which Rainforest CRC brings together a range of research bodies, such as James Cook University. I met some of the researchers from Rainforest CRC and it was clear that their morale had taken a battering, not unlike the effect of one of those North Queensland cyclones. I think it is inevitable that this decision will lead to a brain drain south from North Queensland of researchers who wanted to pursue a career in relation to the reef or the wet tropics but who no longer will be able to do that. Make no mistake, this decision is a disaster for James Cook University and for North Queensland. 
I also met with groups who were distressed about the defunding of CRC Reef. Not only environment groups but also the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators and organisations like the Australian Institute of Marine Science in Townsville were talking about the kind of work and the significance of the work which CRC Reef does. As the tourism operators know better than most, there is a $4.3 billion tourism industry in the Great Barrier Reef catchment and it employs more than 47,000 people. That industry depends absolutely on the continued health of the Great Barrier Reef. You have to protect the asset and everyone up there knows it. Our reef must continue to be better than other reefs around the world. We must face up to threats to the reef from coral bleaching caused by climate change, from land based run-off and from overfishing. To get sound public policy decisions we need sound research. Without research or evidence, no action will be taken and the reef and the rainforests will just slowly deteriorate. Just what part of $4.3 billion is it that the science minister does not understand?
The Liberal member for Herbert, just like former Liberal Party President Tony Staley, knows this decision is wrong. The member for Herbert said, `This has been a disaster and it just can't be allowed to happen.' Unfortunately, he has no influence in this place, and it is happening. The Liberal member for Leichhardt has more influence in this place, but he supports the government line. It is time the member for Leichhardt became North Queensland's advocate in Canberra, rather than the Liberal Party's advocate in North Queensland.
I want to turn now to the decision to defund the Coastal CRC. Labor understands that the decision to defund the Coastal CRC—
—Whose decision?
—Order! The member for Wills will resume his seat and we will stop the clock. I am not here to disadvantage him. The Minister for Science would be among the first to express indignation if he were being interrupted by someone on the other side. He will lead by example.
—Thank you, Mr Speaker. The rapid population shift to the sea change coastal zone can cause the loss or degradation of, or irreversible change to, coastal habitats. River and tidal flows are being altered, beaches eroded, and vegetation is being cleared along waterways. Water quality is deteriorating from excess nutrients, urban stormwater run-off and domestic sewage. Pollution and sediment are impacting on our creeks, rivers and bays. Competition for coastal resources such as potable water supplies or new land for urban growth is putting many local councils under severe pressure to come up with suitable options that maintain services and preserve the amenity of our landscape.
There is a need to increase protection for our beaches, coastal zone and waterways. That is something that Labor understand, with a coastal protection policy that we released just a couple of short weeks ago. The Coastal Cooperative Research Centre has been addressing these challenges since 2000 with a range of social, economic and environmental research and development projects. It was advised that it was unsuccessful in its rebid for future federal government funding for seven years, based on a two-page summary that all rebidding CRCs were obliged to complete. 
If that CRC does not continue, you will have not only the loss of the full-time jobs there but the loss of our only independent national coastal research and development organisation, the loss of coastal research and development coordination and data sharing between the states and one of the territories, and the loss of Australia's professional research and management networks, such as the National Estuaries Network. You will have the loss of the potential to export coastal management expertise to developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region, the loss of a key organisation to facilitate the implementation plan for the government's framework for a national cooperative approach to integrated coastal zone management and the loss of coastal science capacity for regional NAP and NHT groups.
I also mention that some of the Coastal CRC's best achievements have benefited Brisbane and Rockhampton residents. The ecosystem health of Moreton Bay has been assessed. This CRC developed and implemented an ecosystem health monitoring program to monitor water quality in Moreton Bay and its estuaries. That program provides data for an annual report card rating system. It is being used by local councils. It has led to better management practices such as sediment controls and sewage treatment plant upgrades. The annual report card receives considerable publicity.
The Coastal CRC has also developed remote-sensing technology which is being used around Australia's tropical estuaries and coasts. Key water quality parameters, such as chlorophyll and suspended sediments, can now be assessed cost effectively using new imaging technology. That is being used by Queensland's EPA to monitor changes in marine biodiversity in Moreton Bay and along the Capricorn Coast.
I also want to make some reference to the decision not to fund a Solar CRC. The Solar CRC application comprised the Australian National University, Murdoch University, the University of Sydney, Central Queensland University, the University of South Australia and Origin Energy and involved the Australian Greenhouse Office, CSIRO and the governments of the ACT, South Australia and Western Australia. It was to focus on solar photovoltaics and solar thermal energy.
The failure of that application means that there continues to be zero strategic federal support for renewable energy research, development, demonstration and commercialisation. It follows the closure in recent years of the Energy Research and Development Corporation, the Australian CRC for Renewable Energy and the Australian Greenhouse Office Renewable Energy Commercialisation Program. Professor Andrew Blakers, Director of the Centre for Sustainable Energy Systems at the ANU in Canberra, said last week:
I wish I knew why there is more than $100 million available for fossil fuel strategic research and development, and why the corresponding sum of money available for renewable energy strategic research and development is zero dollars and zero cents.
He also said:
The Government has behaved quite irresponsibly over the last five or six years in closing down, one by one, every single one of the renewable energy strategic funding agencies while transferring large, large sums of money into the fossil fuel industry.
And if rumour is correct, there'll be another $100 million or so going into the fossil fuel industry in the next Budget—
that is, the budget tonight—
and that will make the score $200 million to nil.
The problem is that there is a huge gap to take basic research and development and turn it into a commercial product. That is the sort of gap that a cooperative research centre would fund, but the government have been closing down those various bodies which could have closed that gap. Now there is nothing at all for solar energy. The government say: `We don't make those decisions; they are made by an independent committee.' The chair of the CRC committee which chooses the centres which are funded just happens to be the government Chief Scientist, Robin Batterham, who is also employed by the mining corporation Rio Tinto. 
—He is not.
—The Minister for Science has acknowledged that Dr Batterham participated in the recent CRC funding decisions, but he denies that there is any conflict of interest. We are concerned that, while Dr Batterham has been Chief Scientist, research money for fossil fuel technologies has flourished and research money for renewable energy has evaporated. It has dried up. This government's response to the conflict of interest issue is completely unsatisfactory. When the conflict of interest issue is raised, the government says: `Dr Batterham makes these funding decisions as the Chief Scientist. He's making decisions in the public interest and his position at Rio Tinto doesn't come into it.' But when Labor seeks to question Dr Batterham before a Senate committee, the government says: `You can't do that. Dr Batterham is not a public servant; he's a private sector man.' This nonsense must stop. Either Dr Batterham is acting on behalf of taxpayers or he is acting on behalf of Rio Tinto. He should appear before a Senate committee so that his status, the conflict of interest allegations and the reasons why renewable energy research gets so little funding under this government can be sorted out once and for all.
This government has lost sight of what cooperative research centres should be all about. When a previous Labor government established the CRC program back in 1990, we did so in response to clear market failure in certain research areas. The private sector simply was not carrying out research in areas where research was in the public interest. A Labor government would overturn this government's decision to defund these CRCs, and we would also overturn the Howard government's change to CRC guidelines, which has caused their demise. The Howard government does not believe in public good research because it does not believe in the public good. If there is not an immediate dollar in it, it just does not get it. But Labor believe that both North Queensland and our environment deserve better than that, and we will act to look after them the way they should be looked after. Not only will we support the kind of research which has been carried out in these areas but, under the coastal policy which we have developed, we will act to ensure that our precious coastline is protected and that we do not, as we are in danger of doing, end up loving those areas of coastline to death. We have been prepared in outlining our coastline policy to indicate the importance we place on it. This government, in defunding the CRC for coastline areas, indicates that it places no importance on that area of research and is no longer interested in that issue.

"McGauran, Peter, MP",NATS,2004-05-11,"—The Labor Party has a credibility problem in coming into the chamber to debate this matter of public importance on environment cooperative research centres—and so does the shadow minister—in that there was not a single question asked today, in either the House of Representatives or the Senate, on this subject. The Labor Party had some 18 questions available to it today in which it could have asked about this matter of great public importance, and it failed to do so. That is unheard of. Every member of this House knows that the MPI, a daily debate, signifies the most pressing, urgent issue which faces the opposition and consumes public attention. Yet there was not a single question on this issue. This is a charade. This is completely concocted anger and a completely constructed argument against a normal, sensible and entirely creditable government decision. 
The Manager of Opposition Business, Ms Gillard, remains in the House. Perhaps she can enlighten us as to why the tactics committee of the opposition did not allow one of the nine questions the opposition asked today to tackle this issue. I was ready. I think there are matters of great public policy at stake here, but I would have liked the opposition to have treated it seriously and pursued it instead of putting this great issue of the most pressing kind in the graveyard shift. This is the matter of public importance before the budget. The eyes of the nation are hardly on this matter of public importance. Put it up tomorrow, put it up Wednesday, put it up Thursday, put it up next week—
—We're not sitting next week.
—Next sitting week. Put it up again. Ask me some questions. But instead you slink in here and think: `Well, we need a time filler. This might as well be it.' The most important aspect of this is that we finally have a concrete policy announcement by the opposition. I happen to disagree with it, as I will now establish, but I respect that we finally have an announcement as to science policy. It is a bit curious that the shadow minister for the environment is announcing it. I trust you have the consent and agreement of your counterpart, the shadow minister for science, and even the shadow cabinet. You have said two things: first, you will change the criteria under which the cooperative research centres program is based. Fair enough. I do not agree with you; you have done no consultation on this except in the last few days, but that is your entitlement should you come to office.
 (Mr Jenkins)—Order! The minister will address his remarks through the chair.
—The second major announcement today by the shadow minister for the environment is that the decisions of the cooperative research centres selection committee will be overturned. That is fundamental to this debate, because there are 52 applications before the CRC selection committee. Nineteen of those 52 have not made it through to stage 2. The first 19 have not progressed. Of the 52 there would be, I guess, between 10 to 15 funded. How can the opposition selectively, almost at random, choose some of those—disappointed, understandably—38 or 40 applicants and support others? It is an absurdity. We have probity lawyers all the way through this process to ensure that no-one gets an unfair advantage, that all are treated equally, and that the politics are kept out of it. I am completely at arm's length. I am glad that the shadow minister for the environment did not, in his descent into filthy politics with his attack on the Chief Scientist—a very distinguished Australian—go that far and say that I had somehow interfered. He conceded that there is no question about the probity and fairness of this entire process. So you are going to turn it on its head.
An independent scientific panel has selected 33 applicants out of 52 to go to the next stage, and even then a large number of them will not be funded. Yet you are going to ride to the rescue, and it just happens that the politics surround the largest complainants of those who are unsuccessful. What about the other 19? Of the 19 that were unsuccessful, you have announced today that three will be funded. What about the other 16? Aren't they in marginal seats? Aren't they friends of the Labor Party? Haven't they made enough noise? You are going to choose three out of 19— 
—The minister will address his remarks through the chair!
—The shadow minister for the environment will choose three out of 19 and possibly three out of 40 unsuccessful applicants. That is improper. That is politics at its worst. No wonder the scientific community cannot take the Labor Party seriously. You are going to ride in on a white horse and, for base political reasons, assist three fortunate, privileged CRCs. That is a nonsense, and the Labor Party will have the Auditor-General down around its head. It is as simple as that. Under the guidelines established for the CRC program, we have an independent CRC committee, and I have got every confidence in its judgment and the decisions that it has made. My role as Minister for Science is to make decisions at the very end of the process—the final recommendations of the CRC selection committee.
Bear in mind that we fund this program very generously—$200 million a year—but you cannot fund every applicant for research funding. You would need $2 billion a year if you were to fund, through the CRC program, all of the applicants. Of course it is on a competitive basis. Every aspect of research funding, with a few notable exceptions, is competitively based. Would the Labor Party have us believe that every applicant to the Australian Research Council or the National Health and Medical Research Council should be funded? Of course not. Are you going to intervene in those bodies too—for those unsuccessful applicants that catch your eye or that you want to assist for your political strategies? It is a nonsense. You have got no credibility, you are distorting good governance and good government, and it is a very risky path that you are proceeding down.
In any event, let us look at those three CRCs that you now wish to re-fund, despite an expert panel saying they cannot have continued funding when their funding expires in two years. Bear in mind that they have still got two years funding. They have got a lot of other options. The CRC for reef have been in existence since 1993 and have had some $31 million of Commonwealth funding over that period. They have had $31 million, and they have still got two years to run to make alternative arrangements if possible. The tropical rainforests CRC have also been going since 1993, and they have received approximately the same amount. They have received $29½ million. The CRC for coastal zone has been in existence since 1999 and it has received $17.8 million from the Commonwealth. This is a mature research program. It has been going since 1990. Of course the government were entitled, after 14 years, to review the guidelines, and we decided to redraft the guidelines—as was known to all of the applicants when they made their submissions in December of last year—to more reflect Australia's industrial and economic needs. I hasten to add—
—We don't agree with you.
—You do not agree with us? Fair enough, but I want to see that in writing. I want to see the shadow minister for science put in writing now what the shadow minister for the environment has announced. There is nothing in writing from the opposition on this. They take advantage of the limited but politically advantageous use of radio grabs and perhaps quick TV grabs and local media in North Queensland, but they will do nothing here. There is nothing in the parliament apart from this paltry debate and there is nothing in writing. I challenge the shadow minister for the environment and his Labor colleagues: have the courage of your convictions and put in writing that you are changing the criteria. And you had better explain also why these three environmental CRCs will be re-funded and whom you are going to take the money off. Given that every program is limited and has a ceiling, which among the successful CRCs are you going to take the money off? 
Bear in mind, of the eight CRC environment applicants in this round, four have proceeded to stage 2. What are you saying—that the four that have proceeded to stage 2 are not as worthy as the three that were unsuccessful at stage 1? You are tying yourselves up in knots. There is no doubt in my mind that the Labor Party will not have the courage to put in writing what its selection criteria will be for the CRC program, nor will it have the courage of its convictions and tell us which successful CRCs will be defunded to fund its chosen ones. That is what happens in science policy when you do not support the independent arm's-length process. I stand to be corrected, but I believe the shadow minister for the environment is bluffing. I do not believe he has the authority from the shadow minister for science or from the shadow cabinet to make these commitments here today, which I remind the House are, firstly, to overturn the criteria that is currently in place for the CRC program and, secondly, to re-fund these three CRCs.
By the way, the CRC for reef management put in an application for $88 million. So you are going to fund the CRC for reef for $88 million? What about the others? You are talking a great deal of money here but, more than that, you are talking equity, because those who have been deemed successful in the application stage to date by an independent scientific community have a right to proceed. There are other options for these CRCs that have been unsuccessful in the first stage. May I make a footnote here: there were 19 unsuccessful applicants in stage 1; five of them were existing CRCs seeking renewed funding, while the other 16 were new applicants—new consortiums, new proponents—whereas the reporting on this has been that all 19 were existing CRCs and their funding was being chopped. So bear in mind that we are talking about five existing CRCs here.
With regard to the reef CRC, there are alternatives: the Australian Research Council and the Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage. The Great Barrier Reef is rightly and justifiably the most studied reef in the world. Commonwealth expenditure in this financial year—about to end on 30 June—is estimated at $37.7 million. This is how much is invested in the study of the Great Barrier Reef. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the Australian Institute of Marine Science, ARC, the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation and all these other institutions are studying the reef: James Cook University, the University of Sydney, the University of Queensland, Central Queensland University, the University of Wollongong, Southern Cross University, the Australian Museum, CSIRO Marine Research—a great deal of money there—the Lizard Island Research Station, the Orpheus Island Research Station and Heron Island Research Station. The CRC for reef has other avenues to pursue.
With regard to the other example—the solar application; not an existing CRC—which was denied, who has been the chief spokesman for the whingeing crowd but Professor Andrew Blakers? Who since 1999 has received $5 million from the Australian Research Council? He and his unit at the ANU. Professor Blakers has been well supported in his research, and his connections with Greens senator Bob Brown are not lost on me, at least.
There is a great deal of other solar research being conducted and I will detail it. For instance, within my own portfolio of education, science and training, the Australian Research Council funded renewable energy with $26.3 million between 2002 and 2004 and there was CSIRO renewable energy research of $14 million between 1998 and 2003. In addition, the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources under the R&D Start program had funding commitments to renewable energy projects over the past two years of about $9 million. The research and development tax concession claims relevant to renewable energy totalled about $23 million in 2002-03. On top of that you have the Australian Greenhouse Office spending more than $300 million on providing support for the development and use of renewable energy. 
It saddens me as Minister for Science to have to say that not everyone can be funded. But we have independent panels. Of course, no government whatever its political complexion has been able to meet every applicant, whatever funding body. The CRCs that are not progressed into stage 2 have alternatives, they have two years to run and the areas that they cover are generously supported in any event by this government. I look forward to a debate on another day about what are the best criteria for the CRC program. I strongly maintain, after a great deal of consultation through John Howard and Partners consultancy—which was referred to by the shadow minister—that we have it right: there must be a greater bent. This is just one program. These applicants have come to the wrong program. There are many other programs for them to pursue.
I am deeply upset also at the attack on our Chief Scientist, Robin Batterham. He is not chairman of the CRC selection committee, and I would like the record to be corrected and an apology from the shadow minister for the environment on that. He is one of 13 people on that committee. He adheres to the conflict of interest rules assiduously, and this is just part of the continual campaign of denigration against him. It will not work. The Labor Party's reputation in the science community is in tatters because they personalise their attacks and do not have the courage of their convictions. Let's see if you put all this on paper.

"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,2004-05-11,"—It saddens me to hear a minister in this House, who has been a minister and a member of this parliament for quite some time now, who thinks that matters of public importance count for so little. He thinks that having a debate on a matter of public importance is not something that the parliament takes note of, that it is not something that is of importance to debate. That saddens me that we have a government—and they show it time and time again—that have total disregard for the processes of this parliament. I rise today to find myself in agreement for the first time ever, and probably the last, with Warren Entsch. While falling well short of calling for a ministerial review of the decision to defund the environment cooperative research centres for the Great Barrier Reef and the tropical rainforest ecology, the member for Leichhardt has conceded that he was `very, very angry' when he heard of the decision. He is not alone in his anger. Contrary to what the minister has just gone on about, members of his own side of the House are angry and upset at these decisions. It is just a pity that Mr Entsch, member for Leichhardt, does not have the fortitude to fight this dumb decision.
Again, contrary to the minister's claims, we have absolute credibility on this side of the House in respect of CRCs. We created them. We are the ones who established them. We are the ones who set out the guidelines way back when they were first established. What we are arguing here today is that the changes to the guidelines are wrong. We are saying we should reverse those guidelines and go back to the guidelines that were established and that have been working so well until now. Research should not be about commercialisation only; it should be for the sake of research, because from that comes the common good. The CRC for reef asked for too much money, the minister says. If they asked for too much he could have given them less. He could have said, `Maybe not $88 million but something a little less.' But why did they ask for $88 million? It was because they had $88 million in matched funding. That is a pretty good effort, to roll up $88 million of your own in matched funding. Again, the minister went on about how we personalise debate. I am sure that Dr Andrew Blakers will probably read Hansard with interest and see how he has been personalised. The minister said that this was independent funding. It is interesting how he has noted how personally he sees Andrew Blakers' involvement in these CRC grants and his association with the Greens. I am finding that there is a bit of conflict here. 
How short-sighted of the government to wipe out research organisations which are crucial to protecting three of Australia's most important natural assets—the reef, rainforest and coastline—to say that research into the future health of the reef, a World Heritage area, is unimportant. In the words of the chief executive officer of the rainforest CRC, Professor Nigel Stork, the defunding will be a `cause of international embarrassment'. Mind you, this government does not shirk away from international embarrassment. These CRCs have undertaken important research—research for the public good of our country. The reef CRC is currently undertaking work into an alternative antivenom for the deadly irukandji jellyfish. It counts among its other worthy achievements the development of a pilot plant to sterilise ships' ballasts contaminated with foreign marine pests. This CRC has also sold modelling on wave formation to Woodside for use on its offshore gas platforms and has completed groundbreaking modelling on the risk of storm surges in Townsville.
The rainforest CRC has published internationally recognised research into how climate change is affecting tropical rainforests. Maybe that is the problem. This government does not like being faced with the reality of climate change and its own inaction on stemming the tide. So why would it support a research centre which demonstrates the impact of climate change? The government's failure to sign the Kyoto protocol speaks for itself. We have a situation where the government has shirked its international responsibility in respect of climate change and at the same time denied Australian business access to global trading mechanisms. Maybe that is why the government wants nothing to do with CRCs which are looking into renewable energy or rainforests, because they may provide advice to the government that we must act on greenhouse gases. Mind you, if the government—or more particularly, the Prime Minister—does not want to know about something it just does not ask. We have seen that time and time again: shut down the area, do not find out, do not know, then you cannot act.
Professor Stork said last week that the withdrawal of government funding would probably signal the end of rainforest canopy research in Australia. Down will come a massive crane, installed in Far North Queensland at a cost of $1.6 million, which had provided scientists with a unique opportunity to study how a tropical rainforest regenerates after disturbances, because, by chance, Cyclone Rona had passed through a few months after it was set up in 1999—all because, in its wisdom, the government is choosing to support scientific research that will produce a quick buck; who cares whether the greater public good is being served? Because of the government's changes to the program's guidelines, applicants to the CRC program must now demonstrate that their research would contribute substantially to Australia's industrial, commercial and economic growth. While many CRCs may produce research which leads to profits, surely this should not be their raison d'etre. Indeed, Labor introduced the highly successful CRC program back in 1990 specifically to fund research which the market was not taking up. 
I know about the public good that is served at these centres because my electorate is, in fact, home to more CRCs than any other electorate in Australia. It is probably because in my electorate I have Monash University, Monash Medical Centre, CSIRO's Clayton site, Deakin University, and, within Monash University, the National Stem Cell Centre. Right next door to my electorate they are building the synchrotron. Sadly, the Australian synchrotron CRC is one of the ones that is actually being defunded as we speak, and this will become a focal point for research and development. R&D is alive and well in my electorate and I know full well, having visited most of my CRCs, the important work that they are doing—work that might not produce commercial outcomes now but will in the future if you let them exist, if you let them do their research. This slash and burn approach to CRCs shows a breathtakingly narrow view of commercialisation by the Howard government. Public interest research, much of it critical to Australia's social and economic prosperity, is being shut down. The government must immediately come clean and issue a full list of the 19 existing and prospective CRCs that have not been funded. It must review these destructive decisions. It must rewrite the guidelines which have created these farcical results.
To date, Labor has got a tally of CRCs to go. They include: Australian Photonics CRC at the University of Sydney; CRC for Satellite Systems at the University of South Australia; the aquifer ground water resource management CRC in South Australia; the solar CRC at the ANU, Canberra; the biodiscovery CRC at the University of Queensland; CRC for hydro energy at the University of New South Wales; the synchrotron in Victoria; the learning CRC in Queensland; CRC for the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area in Queensland; CRC for Tropical Rainforest Ecology and Management in Queensland; and CRC for Coastal Zone, Estuary and Waterway Management in Queensland. Do you notice any trend through there? They are all to do with the environment and other forms of energy. It is not just the ones we have been talking about; there are 11 that are going, or have not got funding, and they are all to do with environmental issues.
What signal do you think this sends to our young scientists, engineers and researchers? Many will be lost to Australia. The head of the University of New South Wales Centre for Photovoltaic Engineering, Dr Richard Corkish, has said that the government's failure to fund a solar energy CRC in Canberra would potentially force many unique engineering graduates offshore. Dr Corkish said that while local graduates in a world-first engineering degree in solar cells were `players in a world market ... we would like the position to be as rosy as possible in our home country.' He said that the government's decision to leave solar energy research out in the cold was:
... an indication that the government is not very excited by this approach to dealing with greenhouse.
But, then again, this is a government which has placed a huge order for an American anti-flu drug in preference to an Australian version that would have paid royalties to CSIRO and an Australian company. What is the government's problem with backing Australian research and Australian researchers? What is its problem with backing CSIRO? 
The ANU Centre for Sustainable Energy Systems had the cards stacked against it in its battle to get funding for a solar energy CRC. As has been explained by the centre's director, the much maligned Professor Andrew Blakers:
The problem is that there's a huge gap to take basic R&D and turn it into a commercial product and that's the sort of gap that a cooperative research centre would fund. 
However, over the last several years the federal government has closed the Energy R&D Corporation which funded this gap, closed down the Australian CRC for Renewable Energy which provided funding in this gap.
It closed down the renewable energy commercialisation program with the Australian Greenhouse Office which used to fund in this gap. Now there's nothing at all for solar energy.
In government, Labor will support a CRC program which serves the public good. We will support the protection of the Great Barrier Reef, our rainforests and our coastline. Just a fortnight ago we announced a $30.8 million beaches and coast policy to fund initiatives to protect the fragile environment surrounding our coast. Even the Liberals realise that the loss of the Great Barrier Reef CRC is a disaster. On the 7.30 Report just the other night, Peter Lindsay, the Liberal member for Herbert—who it seems is very brave as he is about to follow me—said:
This has just been a disaster and it just can't be allowed to happen, and I'm doing all I can to make sure that probably one of the best CRCs in the country is, in fact, refunded.
I hold him to that promise. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Environment: Cooperative Research Centres</title>,Matters of Public Importance,12,1
"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,2004-05-11,"—It has been instructive this afternoon to hear the announcements from the Australian Labor Party in respect of the issue we are discussing. In this particular round, 52 CRCs applied for available funding. One of the CRCs we are discussing this afternoon wanted a third of the entire funding available and the remaining two-thirds to go to the other 51 CRCs. Yet this afternoon the Labor Party has announced a policy to fund that CRC, no matter what. I do not think that is particularly responsible. But why does it not surprise me that the Labor Party would make such an irresponsible announcement this afternoon? I thank the member for Chisholm for her challenge and, indeed, I take up the member for Wills's challenge in relation to this particular issue—and more on that in a moment. 
Today the Labor Party questions the government's decision to defund the CRCs for reef and rainforest. The problem with its proposition is that no such decision has been made. The CRCs seeking re-funding have been in discussion with an independent committee whose role is to recommend which CRC bids should proceed to round 2. This debate gives me the opportunity to assure the opposition, the science community in Townsville, James Cook University and the CRCs themselves that I am going to do all I can and more to ensure that the important work done and the contributions made by the CRCs will continue—indeed, they must continue. In relation to the reef CRC, I will not stand by and see one of the best working models of a user-driven, user-pays CRC dismantled at a time when it is ramping up levels of user support over a broad area and fulfilling the government's R&D agenda in tropical Australia. 
Let me make clear what I have just said. I invite the member for Wills, when the particular CRCs being considered in fact do continue with their good work, to come back into this parliament and withdraw the imputation that he has made against me in saying that backbenchers in the government have no influence. When he finds that these CRCs do continue in the work they are doing, I ask him to come back into the parliament and acknowledge that he was wrong. The member for Chisholm will also understand and respect the comments that I made on the 7.30 Report, which this afternoon she so correctly attributed to me. 
The external review of the reef CRC commented favourably that that CRC is achieving a dramatic culture change in the postgraduate students and the staff of research institutions working with it. Its external earnings have doubled each year since it initiated a commercialisation strategy in 2001. I am well aware, as are others in the parliament this afternoon, that CRC Reef is strongly supported by the marine tourism industry. With 47,000 people on the Queensland east coast working in reef based tourism, CRC Reef is seen by the public and me as the knowledge provider for GBRMPA, which protects the reef. CRC Reef has been successful in getting industry involved in research and it has industry support.
CRC Reef currently supports 17 per cent of all graduate students at JCU. It is the largest single contract for JCU in its research earnings list, about $2.5 million a year. Any threat to the ongoing work of the reef CRC would bring a major loss of external earnings for JCU and the Australian Institute of Marine Science. Each year the CRC spends more with JCU than the whole of the AIMS@JCU budget. Finally, a major reduction in spending on research on Great Barrier Reef issues, including reduced support for the Prime Minister's reef protection plan and a large reduction in research support for GBRMPA at a time when its needs are increasing, cannot be seriously contemplated. I think there is universal agreement in the parliament in relation to that.
The background of the issue is this: this year CRC Reef bid for refunding. The bid proposed a new centre that was considerably larger than the previous one, owing to significant new investment by participants. Resources from parties had grown from $30 million in the current CRC to about $70 million in the new one. 
The marine science engineering skills base coming out of the Townsville group is being sought by buyers in Darwin and the Torres Strait, in my colleague the member for Leichhardt's electorate, in addition to the Barrier Reef. The new CRC would remain based in Townsville but have nodes in the Torres Strait and Darwin. The CRC would produce much greater cooperation between AIMS, the university, CSIRO and industry across most of tropical Australia. It fits very neatly into the national priorities. There was a perception—or misperception, indeed—that the new guidelines were recommending matching funding. The guidelines in fact do this several times. This pushed up CRC Reef's grant request to a level that could be seen by some as too high for the size of the program.
Performance reviews of CRC Reef have suggested it is outstanding. The new CRC proposed to implement the national priorities and is very industry oriented compared with five or 10 years ago. It is actively commercialising the results of the research while still meeting GBRMPA's needs, and it will support the government's AIMS@JCU partnership. CRC Reef is a unique combination of researchers, government and industry groups that coordinates research helping the sustainable use and conservation of the Great Barrier Reef and Torres Strait, a huge and valuable part of Australia's exclusive economic zone. CRC Reef supports both industry and the government's public interest. There is no other coordination mechanism available to government or industry in the region for marine research. With the loss of coastal and rainforest CRCs, there are no research coordination groups in the entire GBR catchment region. The ARC funded centres at JCU, UQ and Griffith focus on discovery or curiosity research but, while of high quality, they are not end user driven or able to provide the coordination role. 
Without CRC Reef, the significant research effort by Commonwealth and Queensland agencies would be fragmented, inefficient and much less focused on the end users' priorities, as it was prior to the formation of CRC Reef in 1993. The high level of coordination achieved by CRC Reef is such that it is explicitly named in the PM's Reef Water Quality Protection Plan, and it is the major coordinator of the bulk of GBRMPA's R&D. CRC Reef was instrumental in supporting the recent reef rezoning and was the major provider of scientific support to the Great Barrier Reef fisheries management plans. A recent review was highly favourable to the centre for both its focus on its customers—the end users of research—and its entrepreneurialism. It has a strong education program supporting 78 graduate students, all of whom are user focused and very productive researchers. CRC Reef is creating a new generation of researchers who are accountable and respond to end user priorities.
CRC Reef is currently operating two nodes—one in the Great Barrier Reef and one in the Torres Strait. The failed bid proposal included an expansion to include all tropical seas of Australia so that the skills developed in the GBR region could benefit the rest of the region, which I guess was why it grew so large. CRC Reef is a partnership with a budget this year of about $10 million. It includes CRC Torres Strait, which was a spin-off from the CRC for the Great Barrier Reef. About $3.5 million of its annual revenue is a CRC grant. The rest is partners' and contractors' funds, including $1.2 million from the environmental management charge collected through the tourism industry and managed through GBRMPA, fishing industry funds via a Fisheries R&D Corp investment, $600,000 from GBRMPA, $150,000 from the GBR Research Foundation and contract funds from port authorities. The marine researchers—primarily JCU, AIMS and Queensland DPI—contribute a small amount of cash.
In the short amount of time left to me, I want to assure the parliament and the good men and women who work in these particular CRCs that the member for Leichhardt and I are doing everything we can and more to make sure that the good work of these CRCs is able to continue. It may be in a different form. There are a large number of options available before us. We have had many meetings in relation to ensuring this—
—We have been working closely with them.
—We have been working closely with them. We have been working together and we will continue to do that. I am confident that we are going to see a great outcome. I am going to enjoy it when the member for Chisholm and the member for Wills come back into the parliament and acknowledge the work that has been done.

"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2004-05-11,"—As the sole Greens member in this place, I welcome the opportunity to speak in support of the member for Wills's MPI, which is rightly critical of the Howard government's lack of vision and foresight, as evidenced by the recent decision to defund various CRCs which have an obvious environmental focus. For a government which claims to be the greenest in the history of this nation, as the minister likes to inform us, this latest action is beyond spin. It is undeniably a bad decision for the environment and a clear indication of where the government really stands in regard to environmental protection. The latest decision to axe three CRCs—namely the CRC for the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area, the CRC for Tropical Rainforest Ecology and Management and the CRC for Coastal Zone, Estuary and Waterways Management—will have far-reaching consequences, as will the failure to support a solar CRC. 
The reason for the axing of the aforementioned programs was because they had supposedly failed to attract private funding or sell their ideas. Sadly, this government likes to throw important environmental research out into the marketplace, although we all know that this research is clearly in the public interest. There is a place for the commercialisation of local research, and the University of Wollongong is at the forefront in that area. But that should not be the sole and overriding criterion when we come to consider the type of research carried out in this country into areas such as the Great Barrier Reef, rainforests, the coastal zone and renewable energy. These are an investment in our future.
Environmental research for our future needs obviously needs far more support than this government will provide or is willing to commit. Given that it is an election year, this is a rather odd decision, especially in light of the fact that we know the future of the environment is high on the agenda for many Australians—and rightly so. The fact that I now stand before you is evidence of this. The community out there is very concerned about environmental issues and environmental protection. Our future quality of life and the future of the planet depends on our governments acting responsibly and thoughtfully, with a bit of vision and strategic thinking. But from this government we are increasingly coming not to expect that.
The impacts of cutting funding to the three environmental CRCs being discussed today will be far reaching. Nigel Stork, chief executive of the Tropical Rainforest Ecology and Management CRC, recently said:
This will probably be the end of rainforest canopy research in Australia.
The rainforest CRC had published internationally recognised research into how climate change was affecting tropical forest. Likewise, the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area CRC had developed a pilot plant to sterilise shipping ballast contaminated with foreign marine pests. Additionally, the rainforest and the Great Barrier Reef CRCs had combined forces to study how run-off affected the Great Barrier Reef. None of this important work will now be able to continue as a result of the defunding of these two CRCs. The member for Herbert recently said of the reef CRC:
This is a centre of marine science excellence in the world ... to knock out the CRC Reef out of that equation is just unthinkable. It's a disaster.  
The member for Herbert has not just repeated those words, he has also given us assurances that he is going to work very hard to keep the CRC in operation or find other ways of seeing that its work continues, but I think it is going to be very hard in light of the refusal to re-fund it at this stage. The science minister's response to the centre's concerns at losing their funding was:
I am deeply disappointed by the whining and whingeing of some of the unsuccessful applicants.
During the debate, the minister made reference again to people whingeing about what has been happening lately. This is not a very mature or considered response from our minister. Aside from the environmental CRCs, the federal government's support for research on fossil fuels at the expense of renewable energy could cost it its lead in solar technology. This warning comes after the federal government decided not to fund a proposed cooperative research centre into solar energy to help commercialise Australia's technology. Professor Andrew Blakers, the Director of the Centre for Sustainable Energy Systems at the Australian National University said: 
... for the first time in 30 years there is no fund for strategic R&D in renewable energy. It's very short-sighted. We can't maintain a lead with no funding.
I also note with some concern the minister's statement that Professor Blaker's apparent friendship with Greens Senator Bob Brown is `not lost on me'.
The decision to cut these important CRCs is an indefensible decision, and the government's priorities in regard to this issue go to the heart of their priorities in government. The environment and some of Australia's most precious environmental assets are obviously not high on this government's priority list. The failure of the government to use the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Act to proactively intervene and protect our environment is further evidence of this. So there is plenty of evidence that this government's environmental credentials are not very good at all.
I note the member for Wills's discussion at length on the axing of the Coastal Zone, Estuary and Waterway Management CRC. This is especially of relevance to my own electorate of Cunningham, which has some of the most beautiful and environmentally sensitive coastline in this nation. With extreme pressure from the sea-change phenomena, the axing of the coastal zone CRC, in tandem with the failure of the New South Wales state Labor government to implement a comprehensive coastal protection policy, and the inability of local governments in the region to prepare and implement coastal protection management strategies, all bode ill for our precious coastline.
I welcome the opposition's recent ann-ouncement of a coastal policy which will sup-posedly save our coastline, but where is the government's coastal policy? Where is the commitment to our coastline and our coastal waterways? Whatever happened to that comprehensive Resource Assessment Com-mission Coastal Zone Inquiry of 1991 and 1993, where people and organisations throughout Australia came together to come up with a detailed response to the coastal issues facing this country? Basically, those issues have not been addressed. A lot of people were looking towards the coastal CRCs to help push forward that quest for real protection of the coastal zone.
We have heard lots of talk but precious little action by government on coastal protection and management issues over the last decade. The Howard coalition government, since coming to power in 1996, has likewise done precious little, especially to strategically protect our coastline. At the end of the day, it will best serve the national interest for environmental CRCs to be supported and, more importantly, for the government to commit to renewable energy and environmental protection outside of the CRC mechanism. I therefore commend the member for Wills for raising this matter today.
 (Mr Jenkins)—Order! The discussion is now concluded.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Environment: Cooperative Research Centres</title>,Matters of Public Importance,12,1
"Charles, Bob, MP",LP,2004-05-11,"—I ask leave of the House to make a statement on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit concerning the draft budget estimates for the Australian National Audit Office for 2004-05, and also leave to present a copy of my statement.
Leave granted.
—In accordance with provisions of the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951, the committee is required to make recommendations to both houses of parliament and to the Prime Minister on the draft budget estimates of the Australian National Audit Office. The committee has considered the draft budget estimates for 2004-05 submitted by the Auditor-General. I am pleased to advise parliament that the JCPAA is now satisfied that the estimates are sufficient to enable the Auditor-General to properly exercise his functions and powers under the Auditor-General Act 1997.
At a meeting in March this year, the ANAO had advised the committee that its budget allocation of $56.316 million would enable the ANAO to meet its statutory responsibilities and undertake a comprehensive audit program for 2004-05 at broadly existing levels. However, the committee was also advised that the ANAO would need an extra $2.71 million to meet two additional measures that could not be accommodated within its base funding.
The first additional measure was to meet additional costs to the ANAO arising from bringing forward the deadlines for completing the audit of agency financial statements. The ANAO would have continued to meet its statutory financial auditing obligations, but this would have been at the expense of other activities—potentially including the breadth and depth of its performance auditing. The second additional measure was to enable the ANAO to respond to the Senate resolution request of May 2003 that the ANAO conduct an annual report on progress of major defence projects. This would be a major exercise, again outside the ANAO's base resource capacity.
The Auditor-General has been able to advise the committee in the last two weeks that it will receive additional funding to cover the consequences of compressing the financial statement auditing time frame. This will amount to $2.035 million in 2004-05 and $1.626 million in out years. The committee is persuaded that this will adequately compensate for the additional demand on audit resources.
The Auditor-General also advised the committee that the ANAO would not receive additional funds in 2004-05 to allow it to undertake the audit work requested by the Senate in relation to the major defence projects. The question of whether to provide funding to allow the audits will be deferred by the government until the 2005-06 budget to give the new Defence Materiel Organisation time to establish its procedures. In light of the government's decision, the committee has been advised that the ANAO proposes to defer consideration of the Senate's request until its audit program for 2005-06. Thus, the committee considers that the ANAO's immediate budgetary concerns are resolved for the 2004-05 year. 
The ANAO has foreshadowed to the committee increasing cost pressures that it faces in the longer term in both the financial statement and performance audit areas. The continuing attention to sound corporate governance in both the public and private sectors, including the increasing recognition of the importance of effective financial management and the implications of CLERP 9 legislation, are all contributing to an environment which may significantly increase the cost of the ANAO's financial statement audit program.
The proposed adoption of international accounting standards and the harmonisation of government financial statements and generally accepted accounting principles will also place additional burdens on the financial statement audit program. Furthermore, the increasing complexity of the public sector environment continues to increase the level of resources required to meet the ANAO's performance audit responsibilities. In particular, the growing importance of information technology for communication, record keeping and service delivery means that the ANAO needs, for example, an ever-increasing IT audit capacity.
These additional cost pressures on financial statement and performance audits are expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Consequently, the cost of meeting the Audit Office's statutory obligations is expected to increase in 2005-06 and the three forward years. Nevertheless, prudent financial management has resulted in the Audit Office's overall financial position remaining adequate at this stage. The Audit Office also has sufficient cash reserves to meet ongoing liabilities, including employee entitlements, and to fund future capital acquisitions.
As I indicated at the beginning of my statement, the committee is now reassured that the Auditor-General has a sufficient budget allocation to allow him to meet his statutory responsibilities for 2004-05. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, in line with its statutory responsibilities as the audit committee of the parliament, will also continue to monitor closely the demands placed on the Auditor-General's resources by way of ad hoc audit requests. This will ensure that the Audit Office's wider scheduled program of performance audits is not compromised.

"Edwards, Graham, MP",ALP,2004-05-11,"—The Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004 is a very significant piece of legislation for the veteran community, first, because it delivers a small number of very important benefits to veterans, and, second, because it represents perhaps one of the greatest frauds ever perpetrated on the veteran community. This bill is a valuable bill, but it contains nothing which could not have been delivered years ago.
The Clarke review of veterans' entitlements, which was commissioned by the government to honour an election promise late in 2001, reported in February 2003. As we know, the veteran community responded wholeheartedly to this review. They saw it as an opportunity to put their case for change to a whole range of policy issues which affected them. Over 3,000 veterans, widows and others made submissions. Many were granted the opportunity of addressing the review panel at many centres throughout Australia. To that extent, the review was a good example of the democratic process at work. Accordingly, Justice Clarke and his fellow members honoured that image and were generous with their time. To his credit, Justice Clarke also reflected that evidence in his report by direct reference on most issues. 
It can be fairly said that, consistent with his charter, Justice Clarke was independent in his considerations—so much so, in fact, that the government did not like some of his conclusions, rejecting them outright. This final analysis shows the real futility of the review, and the cynicism behind it. A large number of the review's recommendations endorse the status quo—that is, contrary to many of the submissions, there should be no change on many of the matters considered. The government rejected most of these recommendations for change. Importantly—and this point is not lost on the veteran community—of the recommendations accepted in whole or in part by the government, none was original or innovative. In every case, the government's response might well have been drafted five years ago, or even earlier. Nothing in this bill is new. Everything in this bill could have been legislated many years ago.
The conclusions of the veteran community are therefore understandable. They feel that they have been duped. They know that the whole exercise was a stalling device behind which the government chose to hide, do nothing and simply procrastinate. The 16-month delay since the completion of the report has been carefully calculated to provide benefits to the veteran community on the eve of an election. The government and the minister may think that is cunning, but the veteran community has not been fooled. Indeed, they know full well that the government has attempted to sting them.
Typical of the Howard government's tactics, the veteran community has been lulled into a sense of assurance and the hope of great change. How wrong they were. The publicity machine worked overtime until the penny dropped. This bill is therefore another monument to the Howard government's duplicity. As veterans also know, the only reason the bill is here today is that it was rescued by a backbench revolt, which told the Prime Minister to think again.
Veterans are sick and tired of being used as stage props for the Prime Minister's self-glorification. They are sick of being taken for granted. History now clearly records that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Prime Minister have been rolled by the veteran community. The proposed announcement of 17 February was cancelled and, instead, a dramatically revised version was issued on 1 March.
Let us look at the provisions in turn. The first—and the one of most merit—is the provision of rent assistance to war widows. This was originally intended to have an effective date of mid-2005 but, due to loud protest, has been brought forward to 1 January. This entails an extra cost of $5 million. It is worth spending a moment on this, because the policy on war widows pensions is very complex. To many, it was very unfair—indeed, in many respects, it still is. Justice Clarke's analysis is very instructive for those interested in the detail, but it is not necessarily fair in its conclusions. There are two big bugbears in this area. The first issue is that, to be eligible, a widow must be able to show that her partner died of war-caused injury or illness. In old age, this is often a difficult thing to do, as the probability declines rapidly with age. Hence, many widows fail to be granted a war widows pension, even though their perception and knowledge is that their partner died of war-caused injury or illness. 
The second issue is the effect that remarriage has on their eligibility, which is dismissed by Clarke. It is a fact that there are still a number of widows who have never applied for a war widows pension simply because, at the time, eligibility was lost upon remarriage, so there was no point in applying. These women are still ineligible. If they had applied for and been granted the pension, and then lost it, it would by now have been restored.
The circumstances of rent assistance, however, are different. In 1987, a major change was made, whereby it was decided that war widows of age pension age should not receive both the age pension and the war widows pension. While the war widows pension continued—along with the domestic allowance—the age pension was frozen at $120.10. This included rent assistance. It was therefore only a matter of time before the frozen rate was reconsidered in the context of what an appropriate differential with the age pension might be. The unfreezing of the rate in the last budget was therefore appropriate, and since then we have seen the income support supplement, as it is now known, grow by pro rata indexation.
The inclusion of rent assistance, however, was not considered, and it is pleasing to see at least this recommendation by Clarke being acceded to. It was not without a fight, though, as it was this issue that was added to the failed statement of 17 February to make it more respectable. Henceforth, war widows renting privately will enjoy the same benefits as age pensioners who have to battle for accommodation in the private rental market. This is indeed a worthy outcome. Again, though, we did not need an inquiry costing $1.7 million to tell us so.
The second element of this bill provides a $25,000 grant to ex prisoners of war of the Korean War or to their widows. This flows from the earlier decision to make such a grant to POWs of Japan and to their widows. The judgment made by Clarke was that the conditions endured by those captured by the North Koreans were the equivalent of the conditions endured by those who suffered under the Japanese. We agree with that—although, considering that only 29 people will benefit from that, it is questionable why the distinction was ever drawn.
The great anomaly remains the claim of those imprisoned in Europe. Our best estimate of the number of surviving ex-POWs from Europe during World War II is 1,442, that being the number of gold cards on issue. Estimating the number of widows could be more difficult. With the POW Japan grants, widows outnumbered veterans by almost two to one. The death rate for veterans imprisoned by the Japanese, however, is much higher. On this basis, the cost of extending the grant to this group could be somewhere between $29 million and $75 million.
Putting the cost aside, the point is that this grant was a Howard government initiative. But in its generosity the government has also been quite discriminatory. The government has basically said that being a POW of the Germans was nowhere near as bad as being a POW of the Japanese. In broad terms that may be true, but we have plenty of letters from POWs and their widows from Europe whereby it is impossible to make that distinction. The government's attitude is indeed very selective. It must address this anomaly which it alone has created.
The third element of the bill is the so-called exemption of disability pension from the means test at Centrelink. This is an issue on which the Australian Labor Party has been pressuring the government for five years at least. It is therefore pleasing to see the government come on board at last by accepting Justice Clarke's recommendation to the same effect. The curious thing, however, is that this is not to be an exemption under the Social Security Act. The Department of Family and Community Services and their minister have clearly been successful in denying veterans this very simple solution. Instead, veterans and ex service people—as well as their partners—will be paid an allowance in lieu by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This is an unnecessary and complicated administrative arrangement which will require Centrelink to provide accurate data to DVA fortnightly and a separate payment system in DVA—all because of a bureaucratic impasse which not even the Prime Minister has been able to resolve. 
If the Department of Family and Community Services are worried about flow-on costs to other payments of non-economic compensation, it is worth considering their evidence to Clarke. To quote the department at page 6, they said: `Although it is arguable that DVA disability pensions could be classed as compensation for social security purposes, successive governments have chosen not to distinguish DVA disability pensions whether they contain elements of economic or non-economic loss.' Clearly it is a policy choice of government. This government has so chosen but is paying by a different means. All it means in effect is that the Social Security Act is not affected by this concession to ex-service people. How it avoids a flow-on is difficult to see.
Nevertheless, ex service people will benefit, especially 950 TPIs—totally and permanently incapacitated people—who will receive a reimbursement of over $260 per fortnight. Almost 25,000 age pensioners will also benefit, as well as 2,000 on disability support pensions and several hundred on Newstart and carer pensions. For these people this measure is a very valuable benefit. Despite the messy means by which it will be implemented, we support it. It is true to say, however, that the ALP position has been vindicated.
There is another policy irony here, however, and that concerns the treatment of the TPI special rate. As the government has decided for the purposes of indexation, the special rate has been split into its economic and non-economic components. The government's view is that the 100 per cent disability pension portion is non-economic. The above general rate is economic. Yet, despite the fact that economic compensation is treated as income by Centrelink at a dollar-for-dollar deduction from benefits, in this case it is not. This is a major policy contradiction and so it is little wonder that the veteran and ex-service community do not understand what is going on. We would like clarification, too. Perhaps it is this which Family and Community Services objected to—understandably.
The increase of the funeral benefit from $572 to $1,000 as provided for in this bill is also supported. It is still a token, though, as everyone knows that a funeral costs well over $7,000 these days. The minister says it is a `contribution'. She is right. The addition is useful, but still a token. The government still relies on the fact that bereavement payments on death, which are paid as a lump sum, can also be used for these purposes. But this is mealy-mouthed, because that is simply not the rationale for bereavement payments. It should be pointed out that the funeral benefit under the new Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Scheme is $4,738 tax free—and bereavement payments are made under that scheme as well. So veterans should see this tokenism as just that.
The extension of qualifying service to a small number of post World War II operations is also supported. However, we do wonder how much longer this process can continue. We have had under this government two inquiries at great cost designed to look at the reclassification of past deployments against the danger test of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The more concessions and redefinitions are made, the more claims of anomalies are made. There is probably not an area of veteran law which is more inconsistent and erratic than this one. Even the Repatriation Commission has admitted it has been in error for many years with respect to coastal travel in World War II. In both inquiries the government rejected proposals to redefine the test. One can only say, `What a mess!' 
No comment is made on the merits of the service now to be redefined, except that there remain thousands of serving and ex-service personnel who believe that many aspects of their duty were dangerous and can see no difference. There are others with overseas service who are equally aggrieved, and I mention BCOF, the British Commonwealth Occupational Force, as a case in point. There is simply no area of greater mismanagement of veterans' affairs than this one.
The next item I wish to address in this bill is the indexation of the above general rate portion of the TPI special rate by CPI or MTAWE, whichever is the greater. This change is to have effect from 20 March 2004, though payment will not be made until this bill is passed and the computer systems are changed. Mention has already been made of the contradiction of the government with respect to the TPI special rate—that is, it has not been split into two parts for the purposes of the exemption from the means test at Centrelink but it has been here. There is no explanation for this.
The suggestion that the special rate be split is of course not a new one. Justice Toose referred to it, as did Clarke. If it were not for the contradiction referred to a moment ago, there would be a message here for the TPI community: the government is only prepared to make future reform in this area in line with this new model—that is, disability compensation will remain fixed for everybody, without a change to indexation by CPI alone. The above general rate which is available only to TPIs and those on the intermediate rate at a lower level will be treated as income—hence the change in indexation to match the indexation model of the service pension, the widows pension, the age pension and the income support supplement.
This new model is directly at odds with the campaign conducted by the TPI Federation which has concentrated only on the special rate. The government are clearly saying that, with respect to the claim for benchmarking, they will only consider those elements which are income support—that is, the above general rate and the service pension. By the same logic, a disability pension is not regarded as income. However, there are no proposals from government on the table. As for the Labor Party, we support this amendment simply because it does accept in part the complaint that the special rate has been eroded by the standard of living for many years. As to what future reforms might be considered in this new context, that is something to be discussed with the TPI community.
That in summary covers the key provisions of this bill, with some commentary on the more controversial aspects. It is, however, not the end of the Clarke report. Many veterans and war widows feel very aggrieved by this process. Two groups most annoyed are those who served with BCOF in Japan and those who served during the atomic tests in the 1950s. The latter have been given a nod and a wink that they will be looked after once the cancer and mortality study has been completed later this year. BCOF veterans are still out in the cold, with Clarke's recommendation—that they be given qualifying service—ignored. In light of other decisions by this government in recent years to extend qualifying service, the case against BCOF seems very thin. It is also mean and tricky, as the gold card is the only benefit at stake and the majority already have it from other service, whether in World War II or in Korea. The ALP have serious reservations about some matters contained in this bill; however, we do not want to deny veterans and widows the benefits it does contain, so we agree to its passage.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2004-05-11,"—I take this opportunity to thank all my colleagues for coming into the chamber to enable me to speak on this most important bill, the Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004. The Gold Coast community is host to the fourth largest veteran population in the country. We have on the Gold Coast a very large veterans population—a population that certainly plays a very significant role in the cultural fabric of the Gold Coast. In particular, the veterans community on the Gold Coast is vibrant, it is active and it is a community that thrives on its historical success.
The reality is that the veterans community on the Gold Coast is a hallmark of what I believe is an active and engaged veterans community. I am delighted to have had such a very good relationship with my veterans ever since I was elected in November 2001. My veterans community is a wonderful sounding board for me as to what this government's policy should be with respect to veterans' entitlements as well as what the community's expectations are of future government policy.
I recently took the opportunity to convene a kitchen cabinet, so to speak, of veterans who come and meet with me. I wrote to several ex-service organisations in my electorate, asking them to nominate a representative from their organisations who could come and sit down and speak with me about veterans matters. I was delighted with the very strong and favourable response that I obtained as a consequence of writing to my ex-service organisations. In fact, seven of my ex-service organisations responded in the affirmative and sent along a representative to come and sit and meet with me. There were representatives from the various RSLs in my electorate as well as representatives from the TPI association, Legacy, the War Widows Association, the ISA association, the VVFA and the VVAA.
I now have at my disposal a certain resource: the collective knowledge, experience and future beliefs of seven representatives of what is certainly the widest part of the veterans community. It is a delight for me to offer myself at their service and to hold myself out as being willing to sit down and listen and talk with them about important veterans issues. As a consequence of that veterans kitchen cabinet that I had, I am very pleased to come into this chamber to report that, by and large, the veterans community on the Gold Coast is pleased with this government's generous and comprehensive response to the recent Clarke review. I am certain, after speaking with my local veterans community, whilst acknowledging that not each and every one of their concerns has been addressed, that they certainly have responded very appropriately and positively to the good measures that this government have undertaken and adopted with regard to the Clarke review.
In summary, the Howard government—I notice the Minister for Veterans' Affairs in the chamber this afternoon—have taken a very generous approach to veterans' entitlements: an additional $267 million over five years for veterans and for war widows and widowers. It builds on the fact that we have a strong track record with regard to veterans and it brings veterans expenditure in the current budget to $10 billion, an additional $4 billion since the Howard government was elected in 1996. Certainly, I would welcome bipartisan support, and I know that the minister would welcome bipartisan support, for the additional entitlements that the Howard government have introduced for veterans. Unfortunately, however, I am not sure that such support will be forthcoming from the opposition benches. That is a great shame, because the veterans community are not stupid. The veterans community recognise that the opposition sit there as an alternative government. The opposition certainly have an onus to demonstrate in a clear and palpable way that they have a veterans policy. But the opposition have been silent in this regard.  
I put it on the record that veterans on the Gold Coast certainly recognise that it may be very well and good for the opposition to sit and cast stones about areas in which they believe the Howard government have not been generous enough, but fundamentally the opposition must rise and deliver with regard to veterans policy—something that the opposition have been unable to do for quite some time. Despite the hollow rhetoric and despite the fact that the opposition claim to stand up for the veterans community, they still fundamentally have failed to demonstrate the way in which they will provide for the veterans community into the future.
The Clarke report is a comprehensive report that delivers on a promise of the Howard government. There are 109 recommendations in the report, around half of which suggest that there should be no change to current practice. In the Clarke report a number of issues are canvassed and discussed—and testimony was taken in the Clarke review. Those issues include service eligibility, disability pension arrangements and the gold card entitlement, among a host of other veteran related issues. It is very clear that the main aspects of the Howard government's response address the principal concerns of the veterans community. I repeat: I do not profess that each and every concern that has been raised by the veterans community has been addressed. But certainly this response—the additional $267 million flowing into the veterans community—most certainly addresses in a very generous way a large number of the concerns of the veterans community. 
In addition, it is worth noting that the veterans community does not always have a unified voice on veterans' entitlements. One thing I very quickly learned from speaking on a regular basis with my local veterans community is that different segments of that community have different desires. There are some, for example, who would like the gold card to be confined to people who saw active service. There are others who have raised with me the fact that they would like an extension of benefits to those who perhaps offered themselves for active service but, at the end of the day, did not see active service. Those are examples of the divergence of opinion within the veterans community about what is the appropriate source of entitlement and the appropriate parameters on entitlements that should apply to the veterans community.
I turn now to the main thrust of the bill that is before the House today. One of the primary ways in which the Howard government has delivered for veterans is the exemption of the DVA disability pension from the means test at Centrelink. This comes at a cost of $99.5 million to Australian taxpayers but it will directly benefit 19,000 veterans and their partners. It ensures equity amongst veterans regardless of whether they receive income support from the Department of Veterans' Affairs or from Centrelink. For a single totally and permanently impaired recipient—that is, a TPI—in receipt of income support that can mean up to an additional $257 per fortnight. Another key element of the Howard government's response to the Clarke review has been the decision to index the above general rate of TPI payments in the same way as the service pension—that is, through a combination of CPI and MTAWE being the index measure used, whichever is the higher of the two. This amounts to $66 million and it is of direct benefit to some 45,000 veterans. It ensures that the most disabled and those who cannot work or who work only part time receive the maximum level of support through appropriate indexation.  
Another part of this government's response has been the granting of rent assistance to war widows, in addition to the income support supplement. This, at a cost of $73 million to taxpayers, will benefit 11,000 war widows by up to $94.40 per fortnight. It certainly goes to the very core of addressing the needs of the poorest of our war widows and widowers. Another key component outlined in this bill is the increase in the funeral benefit. This is one particular limb that has been very well regarded in the veterans community. At a cost of $27 million to taxpayers, it benefits 14,500 veterans by increasing the funeral benefit from $572 to nearly double that amount at $1,000. It is a very significant contribution towards the costs of a funeral. It is, of course, never intended to fully cover the costs of a funeral, but at $1,000 it is a very significant contribution.
Another key component of this bill, and a way in which the Howard government has very genuinely and sincerely responded to the needs of the veterans community, is the granting of approximately $500,000 in total to 29 ex-POWS or their widows who were involved as prisoners of war in Korea. It sees an ex gratia payment of $25,000 for these ex-POWS. In addition, there are eligibility changes that will benefit a limited number of people, at a cost of $500,000, to address a number of inconsistencies that arose. In particular, there are a range of changes to eligibility for those involved in the Berlin airlift No. 2 squadron and in minesweeping undertaken immediately after World War II.
In addition, I was personally very pleased to see the government is making a comprehensive commitment to responding positively to the needs of those affected by the British atomic testing program when the outcomes are available from the cancer incidence and mortality study on Australian participants in the British nuclear testing program. The reality is that this is a crucial recognition that is deserved by those who were involved in these tests, which modern-day Australians would recoil from in horror but which at the time, I am sure, were not nearly as controversial as they are these days. I think it is very appropriate that the Howard government responds in an informed way once we receive the results of that study. I have no doubt—and I certainly say this to all of my veterans—that the response to that will be as generous as this package has been.
There can be no doubt that there are a number of other areas about which veterans are concerned. I recently had the opportunity to speak at a VVF conference—in fact, it was called Veterans Congress 2004—at Tugun on the Gold Coast. The veterans invited me to come and speak to them because they wanted (1) to know ways in which the government was interested in helping them and (2) to have the opportunity to put their points of view forward. Of course, there was a mixed bag of feelings in that room when I went along to speak to them. But I am not concerned about that, because I have said from the outset that I am there to listen to the needs of my community. With regard to veterans, a whole host of different issues were raised. A large number of them are encapsulated in the bill before the chamber today, but some additional issues were raised which I will put on the record now because I believe they hold merit. I will certainly continue to push for these additions in the future. 
There is one particular limb I would like to focus on, which is what the veteran community calls `reasonable expectation'. I have had a number of veterans approach me who have raised with me what they consider to be an anomaly—that is, the fact that there are veterans who are compensated on the basis of the salary they were receiving when they were discharged from service. They may, especially if they were discharged at a relatively young age, have been expected over the passage of time to have continued to earn more income and to have increased in the pay scale as they continued working. Unfortunately, at this point, as a principle of the compensation available to those individuals, there is not any actual increase in the compensation outside of the CPI and MTAWE. I believe as a matter of principle that, where there is a reasonable expectation, there should be additional compensation flowing to those individuals who were discharged, especially those individuals who were discharged at a relatively early age. The reality is that this is an extraordinarily complex and difficult entitlement to administer. How do you ever ascertain an appropriate threshold and appropriate parameters for determining the way in which an individual's likely future salary may have increased whilst they were in service? It is exceptionally difficult. Nonetheless, I believe that as a matter of principle it is something worth looking at.
In addition to that, there are veterans who, when they have been discharged, have gone into the private sector and begun working. Whilst in the private sector these individuals have earned significant amounts of money. But, as a consequence of their war service, they have no longer been able to continue working. For these individuals the situation arises, from time to time, where the compensation they receive is significantly below what they were earning when they were working in the private sector. Again, as a matter of principle—and I speak from a personal point of view—I believe that individuals who, once they are discharged, go on to work in the private sector and earn a higher level of income should, if it is at all appropriate—and, of course, if it is financially feasible—be entitled to compensation at a level consistent with the income they were receiving in the private sector. If as a result of their war injuries those individuals are unable to continue working and earning that income then I believe compensation should flow on that basis.
I commend this bill to the House. The reality is that the Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004 is a good bill. There will always be those critics who say it does not go far enough, and in certain respects I agree. But that in absolutely no way erodes the very good message contained in this bill. There is a record amount of funding now flowing to the veteran community and a record, wide regard for the veteran community. I would like to highlight one anecdote to the chamber. When I met with my veteran community, they said to me: `You know, Steve, over the years we have noticed something. We have noticed it has been the Howard government and conservative governments that have provided— (Time expired)",REPS,<title>VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS (CLARKE REVIEW) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2004-05-11,"—If the previous speaker, the member for Moncrieff, had been present when the member for Cowan made his contribution to this debate on the Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004, he would know that the opposition supports the passage of this bill. We do have some concerns, and they were outlined by the member for Cowan, but we support this bill. If the member for Moncrieff had paid attention to the debate and had arrived in the chamber at the appropriate time, he would be aware of that. Whilst the opposition supports this bill, I have some serious concerns about the government's handling of this process. It has taken an inordinate amount of time for this legislation to be presented to the parliament. The process has been both lengthy and costly. This legislation that we have before us not only took an inordinate amount of time to be presented to the House; it also took an inordinate amount of time to be developed by the government.  
The Clarke review was commissioned on 8 February 2002 and was presented to the minister on 6 January 2003—about a year later. It was released by the minister a month later, on 13 February 2003. The government's first response to the report though was on 17 February this year. So the report was commissioned in February 2002 but there was no response from the government until 17 February this year—more than a year after the report was presented to the minister. The government then reviewed its response on 1 March this year, and the minister finally introduced the legislation into this parliament on 1 April this year. That was hardly a timely response. 
A number of veterans and veteran organisations have contacted my office expressing their concern that they went to a lot of trouble to prepare submissions and in some cases back up those written submissions with a verbal presentation and there had not been a response from the government. They felt cheated and that the government was just fobbing them off. They felt that this process had not been handled appropriately. 
It is very important for the government to understand how this process has affected veterans. These veterans were looking for the government to deliver many of the good things that are in this piece of legislation and some other things as well. Admittedly, the government's response was delayed a little by the much publicised backbench revolt. We on this side of the House were rather pleased about that revolt because it delivered benefits to the veteran community, and we are all about making sure that our veterans are looked after. We appreciate what they have done for Australia and this is one way to recognise their contribution. 
It is interesting that it was those backbenchers on the other side who are in marginal seats who were really aware of the implication of the first response by the government. They knew that the government's mean spirited response was not good enough. They recognised that veterans deserve more and that the government had just put this process in place to delay improving the entitlements and benefits of veterans. We do not think that is good enough. We do not think that is the way you treat your veterans. 
The process was protracted. As I said before, the veterans and veterans groups who made submissions to the inquiry felt betrayed. At the end of it all, they said, `What was the review all about?' There were 3,000 submissions to the Clarke review but the truth is that the review was just a delaying tactic by the government: the minister's response to looking after our veterans and making sure their entitlements are taken care of was to call a review instead of acting. We on this side of the House believe that veterans want action and recognition. You cannot just hand out some medals and certificates and do nothing—and that is just what the veterans in the community I represent perceive the minister and the Howard government have been doing for them: handing out medals and certificates, saying nice words, being there when a memorial is opened but never delivering things in a timely way. Veterans also recognise that there is an election around the corner, but I will deal with that later.  
Whenever I talk about veterans, I cannot help but mention an issue that is very important in my area and, if the minister were truly interested in looking at veterans' entitlements and making sure they were looked after, she would have ensured that the Howard government had dealt with this issue. The issue I am referring to is that specialists and some GPs in areas throughout Australia are not honouring the gold card. In the Central Coast, the Hunter, Newcastle and Lake Macquarie, specialists are refusing to bulk-bill our veterans who have gold cards. I find that most disturbing and I find the government's inaction on this matter most disturbing. I do not know what to say to a constituent who rings me and says, `I served my country and I was promised that my health needs would be taken care of. When I go to the urologist that I've been going to for five years, I'm told that my gold card is no good and that they're not going to bulk-bill me. As a consequence, I can't afford to attend that urologist any longer.' I think the minister needs to address that issue and deliver that entitlement not only to the veterans of Lake Macquarie and the Central Coast but to all veterans in Australia, because this is happening throughout the whole country.
Minister, I am afraid I am not impressed with your performance in the portfolio; neither are the veterans within the community and the electorate that I represent. Further afield on the Central Coast, they have said to me that they are very disappointed with the delaying tactics, very disappointed with the inaction and very disappointed with the nice words used to placate them. They would rather see action. On behalf of the communities that I represent in this House, I put on the record that they want action, not words and reviews.
The legislation before the House today, as I mentioned earlier, results from the Clarke review of veterans' entitlements. There were 109 recommendations made by Justice Clarke. As I said earlier, I have been critical of the whole review process—the fact that there was a review and the way in which it took place. Of the 109 recommendations, 40 dealt with the gold card; 30 looked at a total restructure of the TPI, which the government rejected; and, of those remaining, 10 to 12 were picked up in this legislation and 15, about qualifying service, were not taken into account. That is an issue that veterans constantly raise with me and it is one that I do not think will go away. I think a lot of the government's response has just been political speak. I will touch on the prisoners of war issue a little later.
The legislation, as I have mentioned, does not take up all the recommendations in the Clarke review; but it does have a provision for rent assistance for war widows renting privately, which is effective from January 2005. I believe it was originally going to be effective from March 2005, but it was brought forward because there was great consternation about how long it was going to take to bring it in. In my electorate office, I have been approached on a number of occasions by war widows who will benefit enormously from this provision. The government is to be congratulated on including it, but I honestly do not think we needed to have a review to know that it should have happened. It was obvious that this was one area that needed action. If the government had been timely in its response to this issue and had actually governed and put in place what was needed, this could have been up and operating by now. Once again, I have to condemn the government for its tardiness in introducing this legislation.
The extension of the prisoner of war grants needs 100 per cent support. There are only a few prisoners of war who will benefit from this—those who were in the Korean War. But what about World War II veterans and the prisoners of war who were held in Europe? About 1,150 of those veterans are still alive. I cannot see how their conditions were appreciably better than those of the prisoners of war who have already been granted the $25,000 payment. In some cases, I am sure they were worse. Those veterans came back damaged men, as those other prisoners of war did. I have had prisoners of war in my office telling me about the consequences of their internment. But we are ignoring them. The government really needs to turn its mind to that issue. 
There is also the matter of the exemption of the disability pension from the means test with Centrelink. The government has done this in a rather messy way. The exemption of the disability pension from the means test does not operate quite the way you would think. The government could not get the Department of Family and Community Services to agree to implement this change. They objected to the policy. So the Social Security Act will not be amended. Instead, the Department of Veterans' Affairs will be paying an allowance equivalent to the deductions resulting from the operation of the means test. You would have to say that this is a very expensive and messy compromise, brought about by a stand-off between two portfolios. Surely the minister can facilitate the departments sitting down together to work out this problem. It is not good enough, Minister.
The increase in funeral benefits from $572 to $1,000 is most welcome. The extension of qualifying service for the small number of post World War II operations also is welcome. As I said earlier, a number of the recommendations that were not taken up related to other conflicts and they possibly need to be revisited. The indexation of the above general rate portion of the TPI special rate by the CPI or MTAWE—whatever is greater—will be effective from 20 March, and that is already in place.
I turn to the issue of the atomic test programs of the fifties. The government agreed that something would be done for those affected by those tests once the current cancer and mortality study had been completed. I have raised in this parliament on a number of occasions the plight of a constituent in my electorate, Mr Albert Martin, who, as records can verify, was at Maralinga at the time of those atomic tests. He has acute myeloid leukaemia. A number of the people that he served with have already died from a similar type of leukaemia; yet, because his testing records that showed the level of contamination at the time have disappeared—as did all of theirs—he has not received any compensation. He has been pushed into a nasty situation whereby he is about to accept compensation at a very much lower level than he deserves. His life has been changed forever and his life expectancy has decreased substantially, yet it has taken this long for this matter to be addressed. I am not too pleased about that. I am sure he will not be too pleased that there is going to be a further wait for further studies to be completed, which will simply ensure that he will not get any benefit from the process.
The veterans of Australia welcome the changes that have been incorporated in this legislation, but they do not appreciate the delays and frustrations associated with the process that has brought this legislation into the House. They do not appreciate the government throwing scraps from the table five minutes before an election. It is interesting that there has been a two-year process and now, when we have an election just around the corner, the legislation comes before the House. It has been a process of delaying changes that were needed and obvious. And why? To save money. It is all about saving money—not about caring for the veterans, not about ensuring that they have the entitlements that they need and deserve. The Howard government is a mean-spirited government that takes with one hand and gives with the other. It is a government that cannot be trusted. Here we are on the eve of an election, and it is giving. History shows that after the election it will be take, take, take. 
The Minister for Veterans' Affairs stated in her second reading speech on 1 April this year that she was proud that the government's response would deliver even more for veterans and war widows across Australia. I would argue that she should be ashamed at the tardiness of the government's response; ashamed that the government even undertook the review, as the changes encapsulated in this legislation were obvious and overdue; and ashamed that she made veterans jump through hoops in the belief that her government would introduce radical changes. The minister has treated our brave veterans, who have been true to Australia, with contempt.
This legislation provides well deserved benefits and relief to our veterans and war widows—benefits that were obvious when the Clarke review was commissioned; benefits that could have and should have been introduced in February 2002, not on the eve of an election. This government stands condemned for its delaying tactics, but I support this legislation and the benefits it delivers to veterans in Australia.",REPS,<title>VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS (CLARKE REVIEW) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2004-05-11,"—It is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise to support the Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004. I arrived early in the chamber this afternoon, which sometimes can be a blessing, but on this occasion was a nightmare, because the member for Shortland in her ramblings highlighted the great problems of Labor. The member for Shortland represents the dim, dark past of the Labor Party. She does not represent any of the new, bright Labor ramblings that we would see the member for Werriwa try to bring before this parliament. Her ramblings were an example of somebody who is way out of their depth, who is not representative of their community and who is not in touch with the veterans within their own community. They were the ramblings of somebody who was unable to demonstrate any understanding of this very important debate. If the member for Shortland had been serious about putting forward the views of veterans of Australia and supporting them, she would have come into the House and explained why the Labor Party has let down veterans for generations. In its response to the Clarke review it has demonstrated yet again that it does not represent the veterans of this community in any positive way.
Nothing was said in the previous contribution—or in some of the contributions that I heard today from those on the other side—about the alternatives they would put up, how they would fund the remainder of the Clarke recommendations or what they would put forward by way of a positive contribution to this debate. It is a demonstration, as I said before, of why the Labor Party are unable to gain any traction with the Australian people not only on this issue but on broader issues that are under public debate today. It demonstrates well why the Australian people will reject the Labor Party at the ballot box in the upcoming election. The Australian Labor Party on the issue of veterans, on the issues of the economy and on the issues of national security provide no alternative government to the Australian people. They deserve to be exposed for the shortcomings that have been demonstrated in this chamber today.
I am here to speak about the positive contribution that we have made and that we continue to make towards the veteran community of this country. It is quite apt that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs is in the chamber today. I want to congratulate her for the positive contribution that she has made as part of this debate and as part of the government's response to the Clarke review. The Veterans' Affairs portfolio has never been an easy one. By their own admission, some of the veteran groups will never be satisfied. Some of the veterans that I deal with in my community are very satisfied and complimentary of the position that the government has adopted in response to the Clarke review. There are others within the veteran community who are not satisfied. I understand their concerns and the problems that they have due to some of the expectations that they had of what might have been delivered in the government's response to the Clarke review. But, as I say, responsible government is about providing funded and responsible responses to issues like veterans' affairs and, in this case, the Clarke review. 
The government has made an additional $267 million available over the next five years for veterans and, importantly, for war widows and war widowers. It certainly builds on our strong track record in relation to veterans. It brings the veterans budget to an incredible $10 billion this year, or an additional $4 billion overall since 1996. There has been a great deal of speculation in the media recently about the track record of the Howard government in some of the areas that we have provided considerable support to.
The Australian Labor Party hold themselves out to be the supporters of the worker and the battler and of demographics and groups within our community such as the veterans, but I really think they have been exposed over the last eight years of our government. The Labor Party had 13 years in government, right up until 1996, to demonstrate that they supported those groups within our community that they and some Australians believe the Labor Party have traditionally stood for. What we have shown over last eight years is that they did quite the opposite. But this government has been about supporting families and workers in this country. Indeed, today, as we can demonstrate, it has been and continues to be about supporting the veterans in our community. We do welcome the bipartisan support that has been begrudgingly offered in a negative sense by the Labor Party, who have been silent on veterans' issues. This has been noticed by the veteran community and certainly by many veterans I have spoken to.
The Clarke report provided 109 recommendations, around half of which suggested no change to current practice. Essentially, that is an endorsement of the way in which the government operates its affairs in the veterans' affairs portfolio. A very strong message, and one that needs to be highlighted today, is that, in half of those recommendations, Professor Clarke recommended that there be no change. As I said, that may in fact upset some of the veterans and it may please some of the others, but what it does say is that this government is committed to supporting our veterans.
The Clarke report obviously raised a number of issues in relation to service eligibility, disability pension arrangements and gold card eligibility, amongst other things. I want to touch briefly on some of the main aspects of the government's response and then talk more comprehensively about some of those things later in my speech. The first significant aspect of our response was the exemption of the DVA disability pension from the means test at Centrelink. That is at a cost to Australian taxpayers of just under $100 million. It will benefit 19,000 veterans and partners. It ensures equity amongst veterans, regardless of whether they receive their income support from the DVA or Centrelink. For a single TPI in receipt of income support, this can mean up to an extra $257 per fortnight. 
One of the other main aspects was in relation to the indexation of the above general rate in the same way as the service pension—that is, through the CPI-MTAWE combination. This was agreed to by the government at a cost to taxpayers of $66 million. It will benefit 45,000 veterans. It ensures that the most disabled—those who cannot work or can only work part time—receive the maximum level of support through appropriate indexation.
Thirdly, the government's response provides for rental assistance to be granted to war widowers and war widows in addition to the income support supplement, at an additional cost of $73 million to the Australian taxpayers and benefiting 11,000 war widows by up to $94.40 per fortnight. It addresses the needs of the poorest of our war widowers. 
Fourthly, we have increased the funeral benefit. I think this is most important. It is at a cost of $27 million to Australian taxpayers and it benefits 14,500 people per year. It almost doubles the funeral benefit, from $572 to $1,000. Of course, that sum has always been designed as a contribution toward the cost. Never was it intended to meet the full cost and never could the Australian taxpayer, regrettably, afford to meet the full cost. But it is a significant contribution when we are talking about an increase from $572 to $1,000. Importantly, in relation to the government's response, we have talked about and responded to those who were prisoners of war in Korea. At a cost of half a million dollars to the Australian taxpayer, around 29 ex-POWs or their widows will benefit from an ex gratia payment of $25,000.
In relation to eligibility changes, the government has announced that $500,000 of Australian taxpayers' money will be contributed to a range of changes to eligibility for those involved in the Berlin airlift, No. 2 Squadron and minesweeping immediately after World War II. It will benefit around 10 people. In relation to the atomic test participants, the government is making a sound commitment to respond positively to the needs of those affected by the British atomic test program when the outcomes are available from the Australian participants in the British nuclear test program cancer incidence and mortality study.
As part of this debate it is important to recognise that these measures are in addition to those already signalled and flagged for the veterans within our community. It is interesting to look at a few facts in relation to DVA disability pensions as part of this debate. The DVA disability pension is tax-free, means test exempt and paid for life. It is in addition to income support that a person may be eligible for otherwise. The government spends $1.3 billion per year of taxpayers' money on DVA disability pensions to 156,000 disability pensioners. On top of that $1.3 billion, the above general rate disability pensioners are also eligible for other allowances and, of course, the gold card. Over half of the government response to the Clarke report—$166 million out of the $267 million—is to address areas of need for our DVA disability pensioners.
As I moved around my electorate during celebrations and commemoration surrounding Anzac Day, I spoke to many veterans. I attended the dawn service at the Kallangur RSL, organised by the Pine Rivers sub-branch. I attended a service later that morning at the Gaythorne RSL and I attended a subsequent function back at the Kallangur RSL later on Anzac morning. At all of those occasions there were not only record numbers of veterans, many of whom I spoke to, but also record numbers of schoolchildren and other members of our community who proudly came out to support the veteran community and acknowledge the memory of many of those Australians who gave their lives in the service of this country. 
That is part of the reason I was so vigorous in my support of the government's response to the Clarke review, and why I put forward the views of many veteran constituents within my own electorate and why I believe that, as a government, we need to continue in our strong support of the veteran community in this country. When I spoke to many of the veterans at those ceremonies right around the electorate on Anzac Day and at the celebrations leading up to the day I received feedback that many of those veterans were in fact impressed with the response of the government. As I acknowledged in my opening remarks, many of those people wanted to see the government response go further than it did, but the majority of those people recognised that the extra $267 million that we had committed in our response to the Clarke review was adequate and fair and signalled the continued strength in the policy that we have adopted over many years towards the veteran community.
I want to talk about the indexation of the above general rate of the DVA disability pension. This was important to many of the constituents of my electorate and indeed to many veterans right around this country. The government decided to reject Clarke's proposal in relation to the restructure of the DVA disability pension which we believe would have introduced a much more complex and difficult arrangement. Instead, the government responded to and are addressing key areas of concern for disability pensioners—namely, effectively exempting the DVA disability pension from Centrelink's means test. In addition to that, we have indexed the above general rate of the DVA disability pension in the same way as the service pension—that is, it is to be indexed by CPI and benchmarked against MTAWE. In my view, that is a very important element of the response, and that was reflected in the views given to me by many of the veterans as I moved around my electorate.
It is also important to talk about the Defence Force income support allowance and how it works, because it is an important element in the government's response to Clarke. The DFISA will be paid to those veterans who receive a reduced income support payment from Centrelink because their DVA disability pension is included as income in the assessment of their Centrelink payment. It will be a taxable income support allowance, paid under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986—the VEA—from 20 September this year. It is important, because up to 19,000 veterans and their partners may receive an increase in their total Australian government income support payments as a result of this initiative. No veteran or their partner will receive less as a result of this initiative. The DFISA will be automatically paid to eligible veterans and their partners who are currently receiving a social security payment.
One of the most important commitments that we have as a government is to support war widows and war widowers. Under this proposal, this government has provided for 11,000 eligible war widows and war widowers to receive rental assistance in addition to the maximum rate of the income support supplement. It is estimated that around 4,600 recipients will receive an increase equal to the maximum rate of rent assistance, which is currently just under $95 per fortnight for a single person. If you say that quickly, Mr Deputy Speaker—$94.40 per fortnight for a single person—you might gloss over it and think that it is an insignificant amount. But I say to you and the House today that that is most welcomed by those in most need. It is a significant amount of assistance to those war widows and war widowers who had their partners make the ultimate contribution and sacrifice for this country. I am very proud of that measure that the Howard government has committed to. A further estimated 6,900 people will receive an increase in the order of half of the maximum rate, being the rent assistance entitlement as determined by the amount of rent they pay. This measure is the fourth significant enhancement to war widows' benefits in the past eight years. 
I spoke about funeral benefits before and about how they would increase to $1,000. Eligible veterans include those receiving a disability pension for severe or extreme disablement, those who were prisoners of war, those whose death was accepted as being due to service, those who were in severe financial need or those who died in a hospital or at home after being discharged with a terminal illness where treatment was under a repatriation entitlement, and dependants of veterans who died in severe financial need. That is a significant contribution to those people who are most in need.
I want to close my speech today on the support that this government is providing as part of our response to the Clarke review by saying that we obviously face a budget tonight which will continue this government's support to not just the veteran community but to Australian families far and wide. This government has been about been providing support for the cross-section of the Australian community. This bill is a demonstration of the way in which we continue to support the veteran community.
It is by no means an example or a message to the veteran community that there is not more that needs to be done. We acknowledge as part of the debate today that more does need to be done. We will continue to do more. But it is important for our critics to realise—particularly those on the other side who have come into this chamber misinformed about this debate—that we make a commitment in the order of $10 billion per annum to the veteran community. It is a significant contribution and it is one that will be reinforced, I believe, in the budget tonight. But, as I said, the budget tonight will go much further to supporting indirectly those in the veteran community and those in the broader community.
Over the last eight years, the Howard government has been about providing for a stable economic environment in which we can return dividends to the Australian people. It does need to be said as part of this debate today that, if this government had not been as economically responsible as we have been over the last eight years in delivering surpluses to the Australian people through the budget process, then we would not be able to afford the measures that are contained in this bill today, and we would not be able to afford the announcements that will be made by the Treasurer tonight.
All Australians can be proud of the way in which the Howard government has conducted its economic affairs over the last eight years because it speaks not only to what we are able to provide—through the significant measures as announced and discussed today—but also to those measures which will be announced for many years to come in this country. The question the Australian people need to ask themselves is: could the Labor Party deliver what we have delivered to the veteran community and to the broader Australian community for years to come? The resounding answer is: definitely not.",REPS,<title>VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS (CLARKE REVIEW) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2004-05-11,"—I welcome the opportunity to rise this evening to speak to the Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004. In response to the member for Dickson's assertion that people on this side of the House come to this debate not informed, I would like to point out that we come not misinformed but concerned.  
According to the minister, this bill is the culmination of the government's commitment to review anomalies in veterans' entitlements and concerns about the level of benefits and support provided to disabled veterans. The minister's explanatory memorandum goes further. It says that the measures include creation of a new allowance, new indexation arrangements for certain disability pensions and a once-only payment to former prisoners of war of the North Koreans or their surviving spouses. The measures in the bill do go some way to addressing longstanding inequities, particularly the new indexation measures for totally and permanently incapacitated veterans—TPIs—and I welcome these measures. But the veteran community says that they do not go far enough. That is right: the experts, those who know most about these issues—the veterans themselves—say that these measures do not go far enough.
I have received a lot of correspondence on this matter over the past few years, and I am sure other members of this chamber have as well. The recent passing of Anzac Day and the various parades and services I attended in my electorate of Cunningham brought home to me many of the outstanding issues facing the veteran community. Various veterans have spoken to me about these outstanding issues. I would like to quote what one veteran has written to me, and I want to raise some of the issues that are relevant to this debate. The correspondent says:
Totally and Permanently Incapacitated (T&PI) war veterans receive $762:80 per fortnight for the loss of ability to work.
Some will argue that we also receive the Service Pension, true, but that is welfare and we are not welfare cases.
Until 1984 TPIs were not entitled to the Service Pension as the compensation payment was sufficient to give the appearance of a normal lifestyle similar to that of the average Australian.
The stealthy removal of that compensation payment has had a serious impact on the pride and dignity of veterans.
Presenting a Pensioner Concession Card and begging for a concession not only goes against the original intent of the original Repatriation Act, but reduces once proud men and women to mere beggars.
A suitable income allows us the dignity we were promised and fought and died for.
It's about what Prime Minister Billy Hughes told this Parliament on 21 March 1929.
The correspondent included a quote from Prime Minister Hughes because he obviously felt that it encapsulated the feeling out there amongst the veteran community and that it was of relevance today. Prime Minister Hughes, in reference to World War I veterans, said:
Some, indeed, came out of this inferno of war apparently unscathed; the bounding vitality of youth for the time triumphed over the fearful shocks and strain of war.
As the honourable member for Reid and others have said, when the war was over, they made haste to throw off their soldier's tunic and put on the jacket of a civilian, thanking God they had been spared, and resolved to put all thoughts of the horrors they had endured behind them.
For three, five, or perhaps ten years they pursued their various civilian vocations, apparently hale and strong, and then with startling abruptness comes the end.
Their strength oozes from them, their youth passes, they are broken men. 
The expectation of life at the age of 24 years, which we may assume was the average age of men of the Australian Imperial Force, is 43½.
The average death rate at 35—that is 11 years after the Armistice—is 45 per thousand; but the men of the AIF are dying at the rate of 75 per thousand.
The war is doing its deadly work, but then again how many of them are below par? 
They are still far from old but they are getting toward middle-age.
Disease takes a thousand shapes; some of the men develop Locomotor Ataxia; some tubercular trouble but these maladies are due to one thing—a lowering of vitality.
The nervous force has been reduced until the men no longer have the power to resist disease. Their war service has prematurely aged them.
If a civilian, subjected to a similar strain in the course of his employment, sued his employer, no doctor in Australia would say other than that the ills from which the man was suffering were due to that cause.
The onus of proof is placed on the unfortunate ex-soldier, although it takes the best of us, in the days of vigorous health, to prove anything before a Court of Law or other Tribunal.
These poor men, suffering the effects of the great strain of war service, goes before a Tribunal and, because he cannot prove what no doctor on earth can prove, or disprove, redress is denied him.
Prime Minister Hughes summed it all up when he said:
The onus of proof is placed on the unfortunate ex-soldier, although it takes the best of us, in the days of vigorous health, to prove anything before a Court of Law or other Tribunal.
They put their case well, don't they, Mr. Deputy Speaker? But there is more. My correspondent goes on to say:
Well, we are still in that position and many are dying long before we are able to prove their case.
Prime Minister Hughes talks about the health of veterans of the great war of 1914 to 1918 but a similar pattern exists with other wars, the mortality study and validation study on Vietnam veterans reads similarly to the words of Billy Hughes.
Anyone who thinks disabled veterans are not worthy of some dignity can only be described as heartless and lacking compassion.
Many were called up for national service in the sixties and seventies and were led to believe they would serve for two years, and many are still serving, but on a reducing income granted at the whim of men and women that have never seen the ravages of war. 
`Is this a fair go? Would you accept it?' my correspondent asks. He goes on:
The TPI community is probably the only group in Australia that does not have a benchmark on which to base their compensation payments, and this had been a concern for many years.
The TPI Federation in its submission has not asked for full restitution of their compensation, the claim is for it to be indexed at 75% of MTAWE—
the male total average weekly earnings—
which still leaves them at a loss compared to those that preceded them.
When we departed for war in the sixties and seventies we were well briefed on our entitlements and were confident that they would be looked after if they suffered injury or illness. 
We were made a promise and we won't go away until it is honoured.
A suitable wage for TPIs also contributes to the national economy and allows disabled soldiers to continue to assist each other thus further reducing the burden to society. 
What will be the real cost to government when we are finally so financially embarrassed that we stay at home and allow their depression to scream to new levels?
We are not asking for anything other than a fair go; is that so much to ask?
Is it too much to ask? I do not think so. Australia's veteran community are obviously angry, and they feel betrayed by the government. Consider this from another veteran, a namesake of the Prime Minister, as it happens. He is especially critical of the government and the minister:
When the Minister of Veteran Affairs [or the Minister of Movements, Monuments and Morning Teas] can inform the general population of Australia that we [TPI's] receive 109% of the MTAWE—
the male total average weekly earnings—
it makes you wonder about HONESTY.  
When the very same Minister uses a figure of $10 billion as proof that we are well looked after, it certainly makes you wonder about TRUSTING any one especially those in power on that hill in Canberra. 
The Minister does not inform the public that the $10 Billion would cover things like, infrastructure, wages, superannuation, rental of buildings, taxes of those employed, utilities, insurances, solicitors, monuments, travel to open said monuments, appeals against the claims of service personnel who fight their way through courts [i.e. the HMAS Voyage case] etc, etc, etc. 
Most of the money allocated in the above would be spent on the bureaucracy within the public service, so much for Duty of Care of the Veteran Population! 
Now we have introduced by the SPIN DOCTORS, economic and non economic loss. 
Is this another move to slow the process of correcting the TPI rates of compensation as sought by the President [Mr J. “Blue” Ryan] and the 27,000 [approx] members of the National TPI Association of Australia?
You can see that some of our veterans have now reached the point where they do not believe the government. And that is not surprising. On 1 May 2004, the Sydney Morning Herald carried an article by Nick O'Malley, which dealt with veterans' access to medical treatment via the gold card. I will quickly quote from that:
Some medical specialists are closing their doors to war veterans because government payments to the doctors have not kept pace with the increasing costs of treatment.
It is not known how many specialists are refusing to accept veterans' Gold Cards—which are meant to pay for full and free health care—but last November the Department of Veterans Affairs told Parliament that 323, or about 4 per cent, had done so.
Anecdotal evidence gathered by the RSL and the Combined Superannuants Association suggests the problem is worsening, especially in rural and regional areas.
A Bathurst urologist, Mark Morrissey, wrote to his veteran patients last month informing them that “with deep regret” he would not be accepting Gold Cards as payment from May 1 because the schedule fee paid by the Department of Veterans Affairs no longer covered costs.
“It appears that the department does not value veterans in the same way as the Medicare patients in our area,” he wrote.
Dr Morrissey's practice manager said the department was willing to ferry patients to Sydney in taxis but would not increase his fee.
In January orthopedic services were suspended for Gold Card holders at Nowra Hospital and orthopedic surgery will be withdrawn from June.
There patients were issued a memo saying they would charged, “like other seniors”, $80 for an initial consultation and $40 for a follow-up.
“If you are unhappy with this situation, please write to your federal MP, your RSL and the Prime Minister and make your dissatisfaction known,” it said.
The RSL president, Bill Crews, wrote to the Minister for Veterans Affairs, Danna Vale, last month highlighting the problem and pointing out that other government bodies responsible for paying doctors, including Victoria's Transport Accident Commission and WorkCover, had managed to increase schedule fees to doctors.
Major-General Crews said most specialists were keen to help veterans, but some could not afford it.
“Those who have a heavy caseload of veterans have a very hard time of it,” he said.
Major-General Crews said the problem was pronounced in regional areas where there were fewer specialists.
He said he was told by a member of the Department of Veterans Affairs that problems with veterans' health could not be tackled until endemic problems with Medicare were addressed.
“That is not a satisfactory answer when you consider the contribution these people have made to the national security of this country, especially when other agencies already [treat those in their care] better,” he said.
“There is a sense of being let down. Some might call it a sense of betrayal. I would be cautious to use that word, but some might.” 
Last week a spokeswoman for Ms Vale said the Government could not guarantee veterans access to their choice of doctor, but could guarantee that they would be treated, even if that meant transporting them from country towns into regional centres or cities.
Margaret Mauro, of the Bathurst branch of the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association, rejected this, saying: “John Howard is willing to send men off to war but not to look after them when they get back.”
You can see that Australia's veterans and the veteran community expect just one thing from their government. They expect it to stay brave and true. It is a matter for regret that the Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill does not do that. I will support the legislation solely because it does provide some enhanced benefits, but I say again that what it delivers is a long way short of what the veteran community wants, what the veteran community needs and what the veteran community deserves.",REPS,<title>VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS (CLARKE REVIEW) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Somlyay, Alex, MP",LP,2004-05-11,"—Let me say at the outset of this debate that it is indisputable that Australia has the most comprehensive, generous and wide-ranging repatriation system in the world. No country looks after its veterans better than we do, and that applies whether the coalition is in government or the Labor Party is in government. The Australian veterans' entitlements system is acknowledged worldwide. From time to time the government finds the need to review our repatriation system. This is because, as veterans age or new conflicts arise or peacekeeping needs are met, problems encountered by our veterans change and the existing system does not cater for them as well as originally intended.
We must remember that veterans' entitlements are not welfare. Veterans' entitlements are compensation paid to those Australians who serve their country and put their lives on the line for their fellow Australians. The Clarke review was commissioned to examine and modernise veterans' entitlements. The purpose of the Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004 is to give effect to the government's response to that review. It contains measures that include the creation of a new allowance, new indexation arrangements for certain disability pensions and a once-only payment to former prisoners of war of the North Koreans.
Our communities, of course, are composed of many different but interrelated groups. Our veterans are integral not just to the strength and values of those communities but also to our sense of national pride and identity. Our veterans have learnt strength and wisdom not from reading in an armchair but through practical and challenging experiences. They not only stand for many of our core values but have actually put their lives on the line for those values.
The fact that our community is appreciative of veterans is demonstrated by the increasing number of people attending Anzac Day ceremonies every year. Every year I see it at each of the five or six Anzac Day ceremonies I attend. At this year's dawn service at Coolum Beach a young primary school girl—her name was Chloe, I found out later—quietly went around to all the veterans, anybody wearing a ribbon or who marched or was wearing medals, and gave them a very small card. I have one of the cards in my pocket. I kept one that one of the veterans gave to me. She sat at home the previous day and made those cards to give to the veterans. She gave her Saturday to that purpose. I have a card here. It had a flower attached to the back of it. She had hand drawn an Australian flag on the card. Inside it said, `Thanks for making our country what it is today.' That came from a child of six or seven years of age, and it shows you what the community thinks of the contribution of our veterans to our community. I know that the Anzac spirit is well and truly alive when I see young children who are motivated to do that. 
When we came to office in 1996, spending on veterans' health was $1.7 billion. The member for Cunningham spoke about the need for more spending on veterans' health. This year that spending is $4.1 billion. In 1996 total spending on veterans' affairs was $6.4 billion. In last year's budget it was $10 billion. Let me repeat that: in the 2003-04 budget the government allocated $10 billion to the care of our veterans. Of course there is always a need for more. There is always more that can be done or should be done. There are always things that can be done differently. The government are aware of this and are constantly reviewing such matters. That is why we had the Clarke review. Much of the increased spending on veterans' affairs is due to the government's recognition of the growing and changing needs of Australian veterans, war widows and widowers as they become older.
In its review of veterans' entitlements the Clarke committee consulted widely with the veteran community, held public and private meetings and accepted over 3,000 written responses. The committee attempted to address as many as possible of the issues submitted, and in doing so it made 109 recommendations—more than half of which called for no change to current arrangements. The government has accepted some of the recommendations and rejected others. To implement those it has accepted, the government will be providing an additional $267 million over five years. This bill gives effect to the government's acceptance of those recommendations.
There are basically six areas of benefit for veterans in this bill. It provides for an ex gratia payment of $25,000 to surviving prisoners of war held captive by North Korean forces, or to their widows who were alive on 1 July 2003. It means that above general rate disability pensions will be indexed in response to both the CPI and male total average weekly earnings. It introduces a Defence Force income support allowance. It ensures that rent assistance is provided in addition to the ceiling rate of service pension or income support supplement which may be payable to a war widow or widower pensioner. It increases the maximum amount of funeral benefit from $572 to $1,000. It extends operational service under the act to include persons who have been awarded or who are eligible to be awarded certain minesweeping or bomb clearance awards. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2004-05-11,"—I move:
That this bill be now read a second time.
It is with great pleasure that I introduce Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2004-2005, which, together with Appropriation Bill (No.1) 2004-2005, is one of the principal pieces of legislation underpinning the third budget of the third term of the Howard government.
Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2004-2005 provides funding for agencies to meet:
	expenses in relation to grants to the states under section 96 of the Constitution and for payments to the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory;
	administered expenses for new outcomes;
	requirements for departmental equity injections, loans and previous years' outputs; and
	requirements to create or acquire administered assets and to discharge administered responsibility.
Appropriations totalling $5,187.5 million are sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2004-2005.
Details of the proposed appropriations are set out in schedule 2 to the bill, the main features of which were outlined in the budget speech delivered by my colleague the honourable the Treasurer just a moment ago—and what an excellent budget it was. 
I commend the bill to the House.
—Before I request that the debate be adjourned, I encourage those who are conferring on the floor of the House to make their way out of the chamber. A good deal of tolerance has been exercised by the chair, but it is outside the standing orders.
