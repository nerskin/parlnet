"Taylor, Bill, MP",LP,1998-06-01,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's interim report on its inquiry into the Multilateral 
 Agreement on Investment, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—This interim report on the Multilateral Agreement on Investment responds to the reference of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) to the committee on 5 March this year. We have also been asked by the Senate to conduct an inquiry into the MAI and to report by 25 May. Clearly it was impossible to provide a final report by then if we were to do justice to this inquiry because of the high level of public interest and the complex nature of the issues before us. We have decided, therefore, to roll both terms of reference into the one inquiry. A more detailed report will be presented to parliament once we have taken all the evidence we need.
To date we have held one preliminary public hearing in Canberra, but we intend to resume our inquiry in the winter recess. The MAI has proved to be a controversial agreement in Australia and in a number of other countries, with the negotiating parties finding it impossible to reach consensus on a number of key issues: cultural protection, labour issues and the environment in particular. Last month in Paris negotiations in the OECD were put on hold for six months to see whether some agreement could be worked out and to allow for broader community consultation in OECD countries. To date we have received just over 800 submissions as well as around 400 form letters opposing the agreement.
The concerns range from outright rejection of the concept of international treaties to those with specific criticisms or reservations about aspects of the MAI, particularly perceptions of adverse effects on sovereignty. Other main concerns relate to the impact of the MAI on the environment, labour standards, human rights, cultural issues and the perception that the MAI in its current form ascribes rights to multinational investors equivalent to sovereign states.
We intend to consider further whether the OECD is the best forum in which an international investment treaty should be negotiated or whether some other body, such as the 
 World Trade Organisation, would be more appropriate. There is a lot of misinformation circulating about the MAI which is creating concern in the community. We hope to dispel this by the end of the inquiry. It needs to be remembered that the MAI should be read in two parts: in terms of the draft text of the agreement itself and in terms of the preliminary exceptions individual countries have indicated they intend to take out. We also need to see the final shape of the MAI as well as look at the proposed exceptions of other countries. The changing nature of the MAI poses a particular problem.
In the meantime, Australia has foreshadowed wide ranging exceptions to protect our foreign investment regime and the national interest. These are likely to expand once state and territory concerns are taken into account. Many submissions criticise the Treasury for inadequate or narrow consultation. We note that certain select groups have been in the consultation loop since 1995, yet it was only on 31 March this year that the Australian parliament and the general public were given access to the draft MAI after it was tabled and later put on the Internet by the Treasury. While the MAI will impact potentially on the states and territories, a framework for proper consultation with the states and territories is yet to be established, and more information needs to be provided, including the implications for local government. A whole of government approach at the Commonwealth level needs to be developed.
The committee is critical of the general nature of the Treasury's submission, which does not allow us to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the draft MAI in any meaningful sense. Likewise, the reluctance of the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism to provide a submission to the inquiry is very disappointing in view of the impact of the MAI on that portfolio and DIST responsibility for investment promotion. Unless Commonwealth departments provide adequate evidence and written submissions to this important inquiry, public perceptions of secrecy and the way this agreement has been negotiated by Australian officials cannot be allayed. 
At this early stage of the inquiry, we remain to be convinced that the MAI is in Australia's national interest. We have recommended, therefore, that Australia should not sign the final MAI text—if and when one is produced—unless and until a thorough assessment has been made that it is in our national interest to do so, as the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) has indicated on many occasions.
The level of interest in the committee's inquiry and objective review of the MAI involving ordinary Australians vindicate the government's reforms to the treaty making process and the establishment of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties in 1996. These initiatives reflect the government's commitment to good governance and public administration—something missing from the Hawke-Keating approach to treaty making and something for which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) should take full credit. As a result, Australians are now able to have public input into a significant international agreement under negotiation and before any ratifying signature. The committee looks forward to weeding out the MAI facts from the fiction. I commend this important interim report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Treaties Committee</title>,Committees,1,1,speech
"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,1998-06-01,"—The lack of consultation was of real concern to the committee and, indeed, is reflected in the report. Aside from the select group of entities to which the Chairman, the member for Groom (Mr Taylor), has referred, who have been part of the consultation loop since 1995, the general Australian public and we as their representatives really did not become aware of the significance of the negotiations until very late last year, and it was not until March this year that an actual text was made available on the Internet. That was something of real concern.
Treasury's assertions that they have had meaningful consultations with a number of groups regrettably was not supported by documentation. When they were asked to substantiate the fact of those negotiations and consultations, they simply were not in a 
 position to verify or outline the nature of the concerns which were communicated to them.
I think it is fair to say that one of the reasons that the public has so much disdain and disregard for politicians generally and for the political process is the fact that they perceive—and indeed to a large extent have—so little involvement in the decision making process. The committee process is one means whereby there can be an element of participatory democracy introduced into the decision making process. But for that to work really necessitates the bureaucracy which stands behind the decision making process to have regard to consultation in a genuine and not a lip-service sense. The consultation has to be meaningful, otherwise the process can be used to justify railroading decisions. The Treaties Committee, in this case, has been quite objective in its criticism of Treasury and also the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism for their lack of appropriate input in the process.
The MAI itself is a treaty proposed to facilitate international investment. We have received, quite frankly, a lot of ratbag submissions, but also a lot of genuine submissions concerned about how the treaty would operate in terms of its effect on labour standards, environmental standards, local government planning standards, the interaction between the federal government, state government and local government, and many aspects of culture—whether it is indigenous culture or even the arts. There are a number of very legitimate concerns which have been well articulated to us in over 800 submissions. That means that this is something that this parliament has to have regard to and, certainly, the Treaties Committee has had regard to.
There is a lot of misconception about treaties, and that has been reflected in some of what I have called the `ratbag' submissions. International treaties are not legislation from the United Nations or from some supreme body that is designed to take over Australian sovereignty. The mere fact that a nation enters into a treaty is its declaration of its own sovereignty and its decision to participate in that international agreement. But, having said that, Australia should—and we on 
 the Treaties Committee are all alive to this fact—only sensibly enter into a treaty if we are satisfied that entering into that treaty is going to be in the national interest.
As the Chairman has indicated, the bureaucracy or those who are advocating a treaty really have the onus on them to satisfy the legislature and those participating in it that it is in Australia's national interest. The Chairman has articulated that with the lack of effort of those involved we just cannot be so satisfied. There is a general and well-founded view that those organisations in the world that do not need protection are multilateral corporations. In many instances they are much more significant than many nation states.
We see that the primary role of government is to protect its citizens and to ensure that there is an appropriate reciprocal obligation between corporations and citizens. Again, the concerns that the MAI might override that interaction and the responsibility of government, on the evidence that has been presented to us, certainly seem well founded. Those who are advocating that treaty have a long way to go to satisfy us. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Treaties Committee</title>,Committees,1,1,speech
"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,1998-06-01,"—Like, I am sure, all members in this place, I have received a lot of correspondence from constituents who are expressing concerns about the proposed Multilateral Agreement on Investment. As the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, the member for Groom (Mr Taylor), and the Deputy Chairman, the member for Barton (Mr McClelland), have both explained, there is a role for the Treaties Committee in this parliament to sort out the fact from the fiction.
But, having said all that, the committee, I think, looked at this wholly on the basis of what is in it for Australia—which is the general operating parameter, operating reasoning, of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. I have to say that, on the surface, I could not see anything. The MAI struck me as more than a little bit of an international diplomatic joke that was attempted to be played out on the people of Australia. Quite frankly, the ongoing role of the Treaties Committee will flush out whether or not my suspicions are true or false.
As the member for Barton said, there is a role for the bureaucracy who have been at the heart of the negotiations of this treaty to prove the case, and to date they have not. They have failed miserably, and I think with a great deal of arrogance and dismissiveness in the way that they conducted themselves. That the Department of the Treasury should front the Treaties Committee with a written submission moments before a hearing takes place I think is an outrage.
We have seen this before because, while the Treaties Committee has been in existence only a little over two years, the bureaucracy has been in existence for 100 or more years in this country, and the fact that there is this other level of inquiry, accountability and relating back to the people of Australia is something I think a lot in the bureaucracy are still coming to grips with. But, department by department, the Treaties Committee is quite willing, I believe, to sort this out and ensure the people of Australia have an active role in participating in public discussion as well as formal discussion on matters such as international treaties.
The role of the Treaties Committee in this particular one is vital because there may well be some good aspects to sorting out some kind of multilateral arrangements to ensure investments between countries are able to proceed without certain interruptions. But by the same token we cannot allow, particularly in this nation with its fairly unique constitution, its federation style of government, our basic right to determine what is in our best interests—what sort of investments should take place here from other countries—to be eroded.
We cannot allow it to occur. We cannot allow our bureaucracy to acquire frequent flier points flipping around the world every six weeks, off to Paris to negotiate a particular treaty. This has been a fact of life, and is one of matters we have uncovered in our discussions and deliberations as a committee. I find it astonishing but it was not until the end of March this year after the foreign minister and, indeed, the Senate referred the matter to the Treaties Committee for inquiry, for public discussion, that we started to find out a few 
 of these things which had been happening behind the scenes. I do not think Treasury for a moment were intending to be covert, but I think what is really good about it is that, as a result of the Howard government's decision to bring in this kind of scrutiny on treaties, we now are able to lift the lid on these sorts of events.
I think it is a disgrace also that the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism, as stated in section 1.57 of the report, have failed to put forward a submission. They see no need to do it; they see no need to account to the parliament for their deliberations and their views on these sorts of matters. I know that the Department of the Treasury offered a briefing session to senators and members and their staff—and that was very good—but the briefing session in itself was really a one-way street. So I think for too many reasons the opportunities for those who like to create the theories of great conspiracies—the member for Barton alluded to them—are there. I say to those conspiracy theorists in our midst that what they need to know is there are now open and accountable procedures through this parliament, through the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, to sort the fact out from the fiction. It is a process that we are going on with. I am pleased that the committee has made one clear recommendation: we should not sign a thing until we determine whether it is, indeed, in the best interests of Australia to sign away on this particular treaty. I commend the report to the House.

"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,1998-06-01,"—The parliament has heard a lot and the public have heard a lot of discussion about the issue of security recently. I am presenting the House of Representatives and the parliament with a chance to do something positive about security, something positive about security for Australian households and security of the most precious asset most Australian households ever possess—their job and particularly the job of the prime breadwinner in that household.
The bill explicitly addresses the circumstances of the corporate scam Patrick engaged in when sacking its work force. The employees of the Patrick labour hire companies were left basically without their two most important rights. They were left without any claim to accrued entitlements, like annual leave and sick pay, redundancy pay and long service leave. These could only be made against their direct employer which turned out, to their amazement and horror, to be a virtual two-dollar Patrick employing company which was then in receivership. They also had lost their right to be protected against unlawful termination. This right was effectively rendered meaningless. Workers could only be reinstated to their direct employer, the Patrick employing companies. But those companies were in receivership and a reinstatement order could therefore be of no practical effect, even though it is clear these workers were sacked illegally.
The government has tried to say that the circumstances of a Patrick corporate scam were unique. That is just plain wrong. Any corporate group could organise their structure so that employees were employed by an internal labour hire company. Any employee who is employed in this sort of structure is effectively without any job security. They have a legal entitlement to redundancy pay, et cetera, but there will be no assets to provide these entitlements on termination. They have a legal right not to be sacked illegally but any reinstatement order is unenforceable.
That is why our bill is so important. The Patrick scam could happen to anyone. This bill would ensure that it could not happen again. It would give employees a measure of 
 job security. It would do so by making amendments to both the Workplace Relations Act and the Corporations Act.
The Workplace Relations Act would be amended as follows. Firstly, new section 170JI would allow the court or commission, when it found that an employee had been unlawfully or unfairly dismissed and should be reinstated, to make the reinstatement order against companies that were related to the direct employer. In the Patrick situation, this provision would have permitted the court to make an order reinstating the sacked employees to other companies in the Patrick group. This provision would therefore ensure that companies could not use the Patrick corporate scam to leave their workers without any effective remedy against unfair and unlawful termination.
Secondly, new section 178A would allow employees to claim accrued legal entitlements against a related company of their direct employer in certain circumstances, as the New South Wales Industrial Relations Act 1996 does. This provision would have made the Patrick group of companies liable for the accrued legal entitlements of the employees of the Patrick employing companies and render the proposed levy unnecessary.
The Corporations Act would be amended through new division 6A, which would provide that, where a company was in receivership, the court could make an order requiring a related company to pay the debts of the other company, including accrued entitlements to employees. Through section 1317HD of the Corporations Law, it would give creditors the right to bring proceedings for the recovery of debts against directors of companies acting in contravention of the Corporations Law. In Patrick's case, this would mean that the employees of the Patrick companies, not just the receivers, would have the right to sue Chris Corrigan and the other Patrick directors for debts arising from breaches by them of the Corporations Law.
This is a chance to make the rhetoric of security effective. Together with the wage guarantee fund legislation of the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), it constitutes a package to advance security for Australian families 
 in the face of challenges of a modern economy. Any government genuinely concerned with security would take these bills up.
The Senate has already taken initiatives with regard to the corporations legislation in ways similar to those proposed in this bill. I hope when that comes back before the parliament the House of Representatives and the government will support that proposal, as I would wish that the government could see its way clear to taking an action of this sort. It probably could not accept passing my bill; it would be too embarrassing. Let them come back with something to achieve the same purpose, done differently. I seek leave to present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.
Leave granted.

"Kelly, Jackie, MP",LP,1998-06-01,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	 recognises that the former Labor Government created a child-care system which was based on inequitable funding practices such as operational subsidies;
(2)	 agrees that the Government's reform of the child-care system provides for an equitable distribution of money between low and middle income families and the creation of an extra 83,000 places over the next four years;
(3)	 notes and supports the Government's allocation of $4.9 billion to the child-care system over the next four years;
(4)	 calls on the Opposition to stop its campaign of misinformation to parents which threatens to do long-term damage to the child-care sector as a whole;
(5)	 notes that due to this Government's reforms low and middle income families are now better off than under the previous Government; and
(6)	 condemns the former Labor Government for its management of the child- care sector, creating a massive oversupply of centres in some areas and undersupply in others. 

I have brought on this debate today because the Labor Party's scare campaign in relation to child care is doing damage to private care providers in my electorate of Lindsay. In the last year of Labor, $1 billion was allocated to child care from federal revenues. That was in the 1995-96 budget, which resulted in a $10 billion deficit. In order to increase that expenditure, Labor would have had to increase taxes or go further into debt. In our first three budgets we have managed to spend $4.9 billion on child care, which is nearly $1 billion more than would have been spent under Labor. By proper budgeting, every reasonable need in the community is being met and government spending does not exceed income as a result of chasing votes with extravagant expenditure. Let me assure all parents in Lindsay that the Commonwealth government will still spend up to $115 per child per week subsidising child care. That is $5,520 per year for a family with one child or $11,040 a year for a family with two children. That is almost the cost of a small car per year on child care.
The purpose of child care is to enable women or single parents on low incomes who want to work to be able to do so. It is not for families with high incomes in the $70,000 range. In order to increase demand for child care so that centres find it profitable to operate, the Commonwealth also funds child care for non-work-related purposes up to 20 hours per week. This gives stay-at-home-mums the opportunity to have time out for themselves, to duck out for some shopping or socialising or to just do a tidy up without the kids underfoot. For low income families it only costs around $35 for 30 hours of child care, with the remaining costs being borne by the Commonwealth—in the vicinity of $64 for one child.
In Lindsay there are 27 private child-care centres providing 1,000 places and 17 centres run by Penrith City Council providing 700 places as well as 500 family day care places, 1,000 places in out of school hours care and 100 other places in assorted care options such as occasional care, community not for profit centres. According to the 1996 ABS census data, there are 11,500 children under five in 
 Lindsay. There were 11,500 children in Lindsay in 1991 according to the same source. In 1991 there were 16 council centres and only five private centres providing centre based care. Historically there was every reason for government to provide child care. No-one else would. However, until the federal government changed in 1996, eight new centres were opening every week. There were no guidelines as to where they would be located and a number of areas were lacking in child-care facilities and options. With four council centres in St Clair no private operator is going to open in St Clair without a level playing field.
Taking the operational subsidies off council centres made the playing field more level for the 136,600 children using private centres compared with the 46,300 using council centres. However, there are only 28,000 families receiving the maximum child-care assistance at council centres while there are 96,000 low income families using private centres; 62,000 families in private centres receive part of the child-care assistance and only 24,000 in council centres; and 20,000 high income families use council centres and 40,000 use private centres. Those figures alone show the inequitable funding practices. The money for operational subsidies is now pooled into child-care assistance and low and middle income families are better off by 90c a day, whether or not their children are in council centres.
Furthermore, it costs Penrith City Council $2½ million per annum in reduced return on assets and $670,000 per annum on the costs of support services for their centres. This is when in the six months to December 1997 the utilisation rates for Penrith City Council centres was 550 for the 700 places. The private centres have used strong marketing campaigns to maintain full utilisation, despite swipes at them by Penrith City Council stating that their quality of care was less and despite the massive scare campaign conducted by Labor saying that child care was no longer affordable. Parents shop around centres before placing their children and more than 1,000 families in Lindsay are happy to use the private centres, which provide excellent 
 quality care. Penrith City Council has had two years notice to reform its services. (Time expired)

"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,1998-06-01,"—If there are two regions in Sydney suffering the most from the Howard government's child-care cuts it is the Greater Fairfield area covered by my electorate and the Greater Penrith area covered by the electorate of the Member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly), who has just moved this motion. She knows it and I know it. The working parents in our electorates certainly know it. Both Penrith and Fairfield City Councils know it. Child-care providers in the area—both private and public—know it. The local and metropolitan press know it. And the Senate Community Affairs References Committee on child-care funding—especially after having one of their hearings in the member for Lindsay's own electorate—also knows it. And yet the member for Lindsay's motion ignores the crisis affecting child care in her electorate. Instead she has concocted some fantasy about how the working parents of her electorate never had it so good.
The member for Lindsay has a responsibility; she has a duty to represent her constituents without fear or favour. She has a duty to reveal the true crisis in child care in her electorate. Instead she comes in here and attempts to hide the facts with half truths and outright misinformation. It is an indictment of the member for Lindsay's commitment to her constituents that the member for Chifley (Mr Price) and I have to do her job for her. Anyone reading this motion who was familiar with the reality facing community based child care in western Sydney would be filled with disgust and anger that a representative of that region could so betray her constituency as she is doing now.
The member for Lindsay says the working parents of Penrith and its surrounds have got a better deal out of child care thanks to the Howard government. If that is the case, perhaps the member for Lindsay can explain 
 why there have been 767 reductions in the use—or withdrawals—from Penrith City Council's long day care centres since the Howard government's cuts to operational subsidies. Perhaps the member for Lindsay can explain why, since July 1997, 181 working families have totally withdrawn from using Penrith City Council's long day care centres; why more than double the level of withdrawals were from lower income families—parents earning less than $27,000 per annum; why child-care fees at the Penrith City Council's long day care centres have gone up from an average of around $150 per child per week to between $170 and $180; why 47 per cent of those withdrawing from, or reducing their child's hours in, care changed from centre based care to care at home; why 64 of those families in the Penrith area will be using unregulated care by families or friends or taking children to their place of work; why 47 women, whom she is supposed to represent in Lindsay, have reduced their number of working days so that their need for child care and associated costs could be reduced; and why 27 extra women have now ceased work altogether in the member for Lindsay's electorate.
The member for Lindsay has, in this House, knowing full well the parlous state of child care in her electorate, brought this motion forward. In not defending these people, and by putting up this spurious motion which not only attempts to hide the truth but misrepresents what is actually happening, she has seriously betrayed her duty and her constituents.
Here was I thinking that forcing low income parents to pay an extra $25 per child per week to keep their kids in care was a bad thing when actually, according to the member for Lindsay, it is something they should be glad about. How silly of me! Here was I thinking that cutting services at community based centres, such as hot food, nappies, toys, et cetera, was a bad thing when, according to the member for Lindsay, it is an all-round better deal. Of course! According to the member for Lindsay, it is good news that the children of low and middle income families can now only be attended to by casual staff 
 because of the funding cutbacks resulting in inconsistency of care and the disruption of the children's routines leading to unsettled behaviour. What was I thinking? That this was not really good for the children?
The real story of child care in the member for Lindsay's electorate is contained in a quote from the Penrith City Council's submission on child care to the Senate committee inquiry. It reads in part:
Quality of care is being threatened in our area as cuts to service provision are made in an attempt to ensure the continued viability of centres. The viability of centres is being jeopardised through the loss of operational funding and the resulting loss of utilisation caused by the increase in fees.
Council is concerned about the issue of affordability, since the withdrawal of operational funding has caused a substantial increase in fees and is preventing equity of access to long day care centres for families from all income brackets. Investigations—
by Penrith City Council—
are indicating that in particular many lower and middle-income families can no longer afford to use centre based long day care.
That is the real story of what is happening in the member for Lindsay's electorate, not the fantasy that this motion and she purports to present.
The member for Lindsay in putting this motion forward is, I believe, naive, dumb or just plain indifferent to the child-care problems in her electorate. Either way she has sold out working parents living in her community. I for one will make damn sure that they hear about it. Just for the honourable member for Lindsay's information, I wonder why she does not go to speak to a mother in South Penrith who has said, `I have changed now to part-time work from full-time work because of the funding cuts; I can't afford child care.' Consider the hardship of that mother in the Blue Mountains—(Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Child Care</title>,Private Members' Business,3,1,speech
"Cobb, Michael, MP",NP,1998-06-01,"—I regret hearing in this chamber the previous vitriolic outburst. I congratulate the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) for bringing this motion before the House. She has been an extremely diligent member in advocating in the joint party room the needs of families for 
 child care, and I pay tribute to her contribution in that regard.
It is very regrettable that the Labor Party constantly puts around stories that we are slashing child care. It is totally wrong. If there is anyone in the chamber who doubts that, they have only to look at the budgetary expenditure for 1995-96, which was the last year of the Labor government. It spent $990.5 million, which was a slash of $88 million on the forward estimates it had in from the year before. The following year, in our first budget, that was lifted to $1,064.7 million—a considerable increase. In the 1998-99 budget it has been lifted again to $1,076.4 million. So it is up nine per cent on the last Labor budget. Even more importantly, it is going to increase by another $250 million over the next three years. That is a quarter of a billion dollars. In the year 2000-01, we will be spending 30 per cent more than Labor spent in its last year of office.
As I say, today we are spending $86 million more than the Labor government did. Probably most importantly, we are doing that against a background of the record Commonwealth debt that we were saddled with and a budget deficit of $10.3 billion. So that is a pretty wonderful effort. Results like that have come about only because of the advocacy of the member for Lindsay, who spoke so eloquently in moving the motion.
We will be funding another 70,000 to 80,000 places, which will mean that another 140,000 children can access child care as a result of the initiatives we are taking. But, perhaps more importantly, it is not so much a case of the actual increase in expenditure; we have reorganised the child-care budget over the last couple of years.
Under the previous government expansion ran amok: it had a gross oversupply in some areas and a serious undersupply in other areas. The relatively well off were being funded and it seemed that the underprivileged were being poorly funded or neglected altogether. We have now got better planning in place to ensure that services will be placed in areas of greatest need rather than having the haphazard growth that existed before. On top of that, we have also got better equity.
The withdrawal of the operational subsidy, which went only to community centres, was because only 70,000 families were receiving about a $20 a week benefit. Another 200,000-plus families that were sending their children to private centres were totally missing out. So there has been an equitable redistribution of scarce taxpayers' dollars in that area.
The outside school hours care has been totally revamped. It had totally inadequate funding under the previous government. Only in the last week or so, the minister has been able to announce that another 51,000 working mothers who were previously receiving no assistance can now have access and are being funded for the first time. On top of that, 19,000 families will be receiving extra funding. This has come about because we have lifted the income test cut-off of $27,125 a year to $65,743 per year for the first child, and it goes up for the second and subsequent children.
I am also pleased to see that funding has been made available over the last couple of years for rural and remote areas. Many towns in my electorate, such as Condobolin, have received the benefit of that, but I would like to see an even further extension to truly remote areas where parents who live so far from a child-care centre can never have access because otherwise they would have to drive several hundred kilometres. Perhaps some small payment could be made to the parents who now teach their children by correspondence.

"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,1998-06-01,"—There is an important difference between the government and the opposition in the discussion of this motion. Firstly, the opposition are in favour of both privately provided child care and council and community based child care. The member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) is passionately in favour of private child care but is quite happy to viciously attack council and community based child care. She is saying that child care is better off as a result of this government, yet she has not talked about the $820 million that has been ripped out of child care in the last two budgets. This is not a neutral position as far as parents and child-care centres are concerned.
Penrith City Council—predominantly represented by the member for Lindsay—has 17 long day care centres, 704 long day care places, 234 preschool places, 29 occasional child-care places, 405 before and after school care places and 300 vacation care places—a total of 1,672 places. The member for Lindsay is saying that all the parents are better off because of the government's changes. Why is it that 183 families have reduced the number of days they use Penrith City Council long day care centres? Are they financial dummies? Can they not work out their daily or weekly family budgets? How is it that the member for Lindsay knows that they are better off but these families feel they are worse off and are reducing their hours? In the Penrith Council area, 181 families have totally withdrawn from long day care. Are they dummies who do not understand their daily or weekly family budgets? The honourable member for Lindsay says that they must be better off. Why are they such economic illiterates and reducing the hours of child care or totally withdrawing it? Seventy per cent of those who are withdrawing from child care are two-income families—the classic Lindsay battlers trying to pay off a mortgage. Are these two-income families economic illiterates, as the member for Lindsay suggests?
There is an issue of affordability with the fee increases so joyously triumphed by the member for Lindsay as outstanding government policy. One of the problems we are having in relation to the fee increases is that 47 per cent of families have not changed from council run or community based child care to the private sector but opted out of formal child care completely. The children are either latchkey children or the families are depending on relatives or family. This is a triumph of government policy, according to the member for Lindsay.
In the Penrith City Council child-care centres—these are Penrith City Council's words, not mine, and if the member for Lindsay thinks they are scaremongering or lying she has the opportunity to challenge them—10 per cent of all child-care workers have been sacked. Are we saying that these child-care centres were so grossly overpro 
 vided that there will not be a loss of quality in child care? Of course not. It is the children in Lindsay who are suffering. I want to give you a couple of quotes. A father from St Clair said:
Not only has our centre been forced to increase fees, although they have tried to keep these to a minimum, but the child care rebate scheme dropped from 30% rebate to 20% rebate in April 1998 causing further hardship and financial strain on the ""two parent workers"".
A lady from Jamisontown in the Lindsay electorate said:
I am a single working mother of two school children and I can't afford to stay at home. And it is so hard to work now!
A child-care worker and mother from Claremont Meadows said:
The effect on child care as a parent and workers is unfair. It has made it just better off working. Trying to pay the house and bills after child care is now a problem. But at least our centre is trying to stay afloat without cutting quality or raising fees too much. But our children will suffer if the government does not wake up to themselves.

"Southcott, Andrew, MP",LP,1998-06-01,"—There is one response to the speeches we have heard from the Labor Party this afternoon, and that is `low interest rates'. The impact of low interest rates on families is—
—Every speech you make you talk about interest rates.
—You have to think back to when the Labor Party was last in government. Small business rates were at 20 per cent and mortgage rates were at 17 per cent. You have to look at what that added to the average family mortgage and took out of the take home income. The member for Chifley (Mr Price) has repeated some of the untruths spread by Labor, such as the notion that women are opting out of the work force due to the changes in child care. That is untrue.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I am not in the habit of stating untruths to the House, and I ask the honourable member to withdraw that comment.
—No, I will not require him to withdraw.
—The member for Chifley was incorrect in what he said. In fact, work participation rates for women are higher in 1998 than they were in 1996 when the Labor Party left office. Looking at one of the specific changes in child care—the operating subsidy for the community based long day centres—this subsidy was introduced in 1971. It was introduced because it was recognised that the community based centres were looking after more infants, under-2s and children with special needs. In fact, a recent survey showed that, when you looked at the private centres and the community based centres, there was no difference in those three groups. And yet, across Australia, the community based centres—which were getting a $20 a day subsidy—were, on average, only $4 cheaper than the private centres. Private centres make up 70 per cent of the child-care centres in Australia, and they were not receiving this operating subsidy.
The Labor Party on this issue are a bit like the successive British governments that kept someone watching the English Channel right up until 1948—a post that had originally been created for Napoleon. They are like the government that continues to spend money when the rationale for it is no longer around. It is wrong to say that there is any difference in quality between the community based centres and the private centres. They are all subject to quality care and accreditation. It is wrong to suggest that we have in any way cut child-care funding. Child-care funding has been increased by 18 per cent since the Labor government's last years in office. In the area of out of school hours care, child-care assistance is now available to 50,000 low and middle income families across Australia.

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,1998-06-01,"—I would like to congratulate the Blacktown Council on its conduct of the city's festival week and parade. The theme for this event, Celebrating Cultures, was appropriate, falling at the end of National Aboriginal Reconciliation Week and being in a city that is home to over 150 different multicultural groups. Blacktown city has one of the largest Aboriginal populations in the metropolitan area and has a significant link to Aboriginal history. One of the first homes for Aboriginal children taken from their families was set up in Blacktown in 1823. Blacktown is now home to over 235,000 people. Many of these people come from foreign lands, with some 20 per cent of the local population from non-English speaking backgrounds.
The street parade and stalls featured many of the city's cultural, community and welfare issues, such as the promotion of the city's local community station by Mr David Cunningham from a special broadcast spot at the festival. This was a real highlight for many observers. David is a very active but disabled member of our community. Other stalls included one on the Blacktown Council's role in providing child-care facilities for its young families. Another stall showed the community's opposition to building an airport at Badgerys Creek, where many thousands also signed protest petitions. There was also the promotion of the city's educational facilities, with students from one of our local colleges, St Andrews, marching in the parade. There was also a promotion of groups providing character development for the city's young citizens, like the Blacktown Air League Squadron and local scout and guide groups.

I have advised the Tax Office to do everything they can to find it.

—The point of relevance is this: it was $800 million specifically related to evasion by high wealth individuals and eight of the nine propositions related to the use of discretionary trusts. That is what the question was about and the Treasurer has done nothing about answering it.
—The Leader of the Opposition has raised his point of order. The Treasurer is entirely within standing orders.
—The question was about what the government has done to secure tax from high wealth individuals.
—Like Senator Parer.
—The member for Hotham will remain silent!
—You are the king of evasion for high wealth individuals, aren't you, Hotham? We know all about the R&D syndicates in the back seat of the Roller—and it is still Labor policy to bring back the R&D syndicate. You are worried, are you, that high taxpayers are paying too much tax? Mr Speaker, they fought us hardest on the R&D syndicate because it was one of the mechanisms that the member for Hotham's wealthy friends used.
—A point of order!
—The Treasurer will resume his seat. I request the Treasurer to direct his reply through me.

—The Leader of the Opposition knows that the Treasurer is responding within standing orders but I suggest that he responds through the Speaker and not directly across the chamber.
—The other thing I want to remind the House of is that when I became Treasurer we became aware of the largest haemorrhage of the Australian taxation system which was worth billions of dollars.

 allow reasonable flexibility in the answering of questions. The Treasurer at the moment is certainly a little wide of the specifics but he is within the ambit of the question.
—I am talking about the measures which the government has taken to collect taxes from high wealth individuals. I can disclose to the House that the scheme which the government was alerted to, which cost the revenue more than any other single measure, of the order of billions of dollars, which made it optional to pay taxation if you earned over $500,000, was the use of negatively geared infrastructure borrowings which this government closed and the Labor Party opened. The Labor Party opened, back in the early 1990s, infrastructure borrowings which caused the biggest haemorrhage on the Australian taxation system for high wealth individuals which this government had to close.
—You have nothing to base this on! What are you on about?
—The member for Hotham will remain silent!
—I regret the fact that it had been opened and I regret the fact that billions of dollars were lost before this government actually closed it down. I am also interested to hear the member for Holt talk about discretionary trusts—that is your latest target, is it?
—The Treasurer will answer his question through the chair.
—Listen to the press release issued by the then Treasurer, Ralph Willis, on high wealth individuals—taxation of trusts—
—Which you walked back from.
—The Leader of the Opposition will remain silent.
—No, listen to the words. He said:
Trusts provide an appropriate structure to meet a legitimate range of needs such as for charities, educational, non-profit organisations, deceased estates, a variety of family purposes—
Listen to this—
and for solicitors and other professionals. 

Honourable members interjecting—
—Wait. Listen to this—
The government will not interfere with these arrangements.
That was the press release of 11 February 1996 on high wealth individuals in relation to discretionary trusts. The Australian Labor Party says, `Oh, we're against discretionary trusts.' Leave aside the fact that you had 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 years—
—Mr Speaker, my point of order is on relevance. He was asked whether he received the same advice as we did on discretionary trusts, whether he followed it and, if not, why not.
—The Treasurer is answering it entirely in accordance with standing orders.
—I am referring directly to the advice in the situation as it was—leave aside the fact that there was no move on discretionary trusts for Labor's first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth year.
On 11 February 1996—which was what? Four or five weeks before the March 1996 election—when they suddenly discovered an interest in trusts—this is what they said. They said in relation to this that they served a legitimate number of purposes, they provided an appropriate structure to meet a range of legitimate needs—charities, educational, non-profit, decreased estates, family purposes, solicitors and other professionals—and that `The government will not interfere with these arrangements.'
The Australian Labor Party's interest in trusts is totally phoney, totally cooked up.
—What level of income.
—There is no reason to believe that they would take any different attitude than they did in 13 years of government. When they looked at the thing they decided that they would not. There it is, it is in black and white—11 February 1996.

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,1998-06-01,"—by leave—I move:
That this House censures the Prime Minister for having misled it when he denied the government members task force had been instructed to bring forth no recommendations.
The Prime Minister (Mr Howard), when he was Leader of the Opposition, said on 7 May 1992:
The Australian people will judge this Prime Minister—
he was speaking about his predecessor—
on the standard of probity that he is prepared to defend. The supreme test of the courage and probity of the Prime Minister is whether he insists on Ministers observing the basic requirement of a Minister, that is, that they tell the Parliament the truth.
The was the position adopted by the Prime Minister when he was the Leader of the Opposition, and I cannot disagree with him. It is the supreme test of the Prime Minister whether he insists on ministers observing the basic requirement of a minister, that is, that they tell the parliament the truth. It is a critical part of the accountability process of this chamber, and it is a particularly critical part in question time.
As we in this House know, there are many opportunities for those being asked questions—if they do not want to confront this requirement—to skirt around the question by being evasive, by not answering it directly or simply, as the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) did a few days ago, by simply saying, `I will not answer it.'
You enter into a totally different realm when you decide that you will answer a question and you will be emphatic about it. What the Prime Minister did last week was to directly answer a question related to the role of the government task force on taxation, a task force which is providing the government with ammunition in what is a critical argu 
 ment in the Australian community about what the nature of tax reform will be, in which credibility will be on the line—particularly credibility of the government: credibility of their guarantees, credibility of whether or not they upheld past promises—credibility absolutely essential in the Prime Minister.
What did the Prime Minister do when asked that question? He did not say, `I will have a think about it' or `I will consult my books; I am not sure what the honourable member is talking about.' He gave an unequivocal, one-word answer: `No'. I will return to that question and the character of it in a moment. First, I want to go to the press release of the Hon. Peter Costello, MP, Treasurer, when the government's task force was established. We can see several interesting things from this press release, which I will not read out in full. The first interesting thing we see is that seated on that particular committee was one Paul Zammit, who happens to be the member for Lowe. In case it is thought that Mr Zammit, in the question that he asked today, got his information second-hand from discussing the matter with another member of parliament, we can set our minds at rest on that matter. Mr Zammit was a member of that committee, tasked to receive a set of community responses. He was invited to reflect on that and the instructions that the Treasurer provided him at that point.
In another very interesting part of the press release, it talks about the task of the task force—whether it is a task force to produce recommendations or to siphon forward community opinion and have nothing to say on the matter. A well-known attribute of the Liberal Party is to appear consultative but to go bull-headed with whatever it is you want. You can see that in the behaviour of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) when it comes to sticking balaclavaed would-be troopers onto the waterfront with their dogs, and you can see it in his preparedness to prevaricate in this parliament about what his role was in that. This government is totally slipshod when it comes to its standards of honesty and integrity in dealing with the Australian people.
This press release said exactly what that task was in a party used to treating its backbenchers as a bunch of mushrooms to be fed the appropriate and proverbial but not to be seen until the occasion comes for them to be plucked. This is what the Treasurer had to say:
The Committee, under the chairmanship of Brian Gibson, will be receiving submissions from Australians from all walks of life, it's a broad based Committee with geographic and different occupational interests and expertise in relation to different industries. And it will be a very big part of the Government's consultation with the community and feeding into the decision making process.
In other words, the job of the committee is to pass on the information that comes through from the community in general.
The Prime Minister was asked a very specific question by me. Because the Prime Minister got up and said, in his answer to the second question, to me: `I didn't mislead you last week because I issued no instructions,' he was not asked that question. He was asked:
Is it true that your own government members' task force on taxation, which you have touted as a great community consultative vehicle on your tax changes, was told not to make recommendations to the government?
Not that it was told by the Prime Minister; simply that it was told by an authoritative member of the government. The authoritative member of the government, as was revealed by Mr Zammit in the House today—but that ought to produce no surprises—happened to be the Treasurer. The Treasurer, as the authoritative member of the government, told them not to make recommendations. The Prime Minister's answer to my direct question in that regard, which did not go to his own personal role in the affair, was: `None'. It was one of those smart alec answers that Prime Ministers give from time to time when they try to prove that they are on top of the issue.
We had the three questions which arose from the comments by the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith), and those went to the role of the consultative process that this government had established. To show that he was on top of this terrible fellow who, like the member for Lowe, had demeaned him by going out and revealing to the public exactly 
 what sort of Prime Minister they have, what sort of Prime Minister they are dealing with, the Prime Minister was prepared to be dismissive of him and ignore any problems of the endless range and number of defections constantly coming across to this side of the House one after another, each one of them with a bit of free character analysis for the Prime Minister as they come across.
What he did to belittle the member for Dickson at that point of time was just to dismiss my question. My question ran straight off the member for Dickson's press release and dealt with every single point that he had of complaint about the government. There was not in the explanation any kind word or whatever for his departing comrade—no, no, no; out the back door: `I am a Prime Minister of toughness, I am a Prime Minister who answers things decisively, I am a Prime Minister who knows exactly what I am during at all points of time. I am a Prime Minister who knows, above all, of the internal procedures of my government. I am on top of those internal procedures. Not a sparrow falls to the ground but that I do not notice it,' according to the Prime Minister.
What the Prime Minister simply did to this House—and this is part of the censure motion—is lie to it. The Prime Minister was in a position to know the truth of that matter and chose not to reveal that truth. He chose to let abroad in the community an impression that when people went forward to those government members they were actually engaged in a meaningful process of consultation and that somebody on that committee, the people to whom they were talking, would pass judgment on their views and recommendations would be made. It is a reasonable supposition, whatever the sleight of hand words from the Treasurer. The sleight of hand words of the Treasurer actually pointed to the real situation. It is a reasonable thing for them to conclude that, that when they talk to this government, this government is actually talking to them listening to them about tax reform. It is a reasonable thing to conclude, but an absolutely erroneous thing for the people to conclude, that this government is actually seriously giving consideration to 
 anything that they have to say to it as far as tax reform is considered.
Then what happened is that the Prime Minister came into this place and, in denying that, he had to handle that question again today. I thought the member for Lowe, who is not in the chamber, when he got up to take a point of order on the Prime Minister was going to ask the question: what colour is red? When he got that direct question from the witness, when the witness actually found himself for a brief moment as the prosecutor and was able to get up and put a direct question of something within his knowledge, the Prime Minister prevaricated, slipped and slid and hoped that we would not notice what it was that he had said. What it was that he had said, of course, was a direct denial of Mr Zammit's question. It is worth regaling the House again with that question from Mr Zammit. He said:
My question is to the Prime Minister, and it follows a question to him in this House last week when he was asked if it was true that the government members' tax consultative task force on taxation were told to not make recommendations to the government, to which you replied, and I quote, `No, no, no.' Prime Minister, are you aware that this task force was directed by the Treasurer at its inaugural meeting to make no recommendations to the government? Prime Minister, as I was an inaugural member of the task force until my resignation from the Liberal Party, will you give me and my electorate of Lowe an assurance that members of parliament who serve on the task force will not be blamed by you for any shortcomings in the tax package you intend to present to the Australian people?
Not a bad question; not a bad question in its way. What the member wanted to do was not find his own political reputation tarnished with the sort of chicanery which has underpinned this particular so-called tax reform process.
Day after day in this chamber we on this side of the House have to put up with this moral unction from the Prime Minister in which he stands up in this place and clothes himself in the cloth of reform. We know exactly where this tax reform proposal came from. It came from a moment of weakness after the last budget that was brought down in the name of the Prime Minister in which the 
 Prime Minister, to defend himself and the reputation of his government—nothing to do with tax reform; to defend himself and the reputation of his government—came out and said, `I place tax reform on the agenda.' It was two days into an awful press baking for what was very much a non-event budget produced by his Treasurer, causing the Prime Minister to put back on the table a proposition which the Treasurer had described only months before as snake oil. What was he calling it snake oil for? It is snake oil when it said it encouraged exporters, snake oil when it said it encouraged small business, snake oil when it suggested it encouraged savings. Snake oil, said the Treasurer, to all those propositions. But the Treasurer was not regarded as a person sufficient to be able to defend his budget. The Prime Minister went out there and said, `I want to put tax reform on the table.'
Then, because he liked the theme, he liked the coverage, he went out and said, `I invite you all on a great tax adventure. I invite the Australian people on a tax adventure.' That was the last time the Prime Minister invited the people to a tax adventure, because from that point on everything has been sleight of hand and clandestine. A proposal which was supposed to be out last December and give all of the Australian people an opportunity to debate it is not yet before us. It was a proposition in which he was supposed to provide the community with an opportunity to have a real say—that is, after all, what a tax adventure usually is.
The fig leaf that he put over the adventure was his taxation task force. But the taxation task force was a snow job, and every member of the taxation task force knows that it was a snow job. Every member of the taxation task force knows that it was there to field the flak from the community that would come with the goods and services tax. It had no serious role. Why did it have no serious role? Because the Treasurer, wanting to get back an agenda that had got absolutely out of control, set it up on the basis that it would put nothing to government. It would merely be a post box and a clearing house. That is all that that committee would be: the cannon fodder of the 
 Liberal Party's tax debate. That is what the members were supposed to be. Their committee was the post box and they were the cannon fodder.
The Prime Minister asks the Australian people to accept his credibility. He starts with a major disadvantage in this entire debate. He is the bloke who went out and said, `Never ever.' He is the fellow who said that he would never ever put this issue back on the table again as far as his government would be concerned.	Not, `This applies for next term, and then we will think about it after that', which is what he said, to give him his due, in regard to the privatisation of Telstra—that he would put it back on the agenda again afterwards. Not that sort of qualified position but a `never ever', which on any definition, not least the Oxford Dictionary definition, means `never ever', a commonsense interpretation. Most people out there know what `never ever' means. It is only the Prime Minister's sleight of hand that would cause any degree of confusion about what `never ever' meant.
So they voted for him with a degree of comfort. All those small businesses who had been invited to be tax agents back in 1993 could vote for him with comfort. All those service companies driving the jobs growth in this community could vote for the government in comfort. All those pensioners out there, and in particular those self-funded retirees, all those folk who had saved for their retirement, could guarantee that their savings would not be devalued by 10 per cent, 15 per cent or whatever. They could all vote for the Prime Minister in comfort. They could join the Prime Minister's other magical mystery tour, his `relaxed and comfortable' magical mystery tour, which they, unfortunately for them, decided they would depart upon.
The government, of course, would never dare run with the `relaxed and comfortable' slogan again. I am surprised it had the dead set cheek to run with the security proposition. Apart from the plagiarism involved in that exercise, given that we have been talking about it for the last year or two, what about the comparison with what the `relaxed and comfortable' was supposed to produce?
We have a Prime Minister on whose tattered credibility is going to depend community consideration of a whole range of other matters. This Prime Minister, who has lied to the House in this instance, now has to be believed by the Australian people when he says, `The GST rate will never ever rise.' The second thing that he has to be believed on is that `the compensation package will stay in place and be meaningful'. There has to be credibility as far as that is concerned. The third thing that there will need to be credibility on is that `those goods excluded from the goods and services tax will stay out permanently'. Those are three very big issues of credibility for this government. On that level of credibility, the credibility that might attach to them, rests the government's entire position in this debate.
So will the deliverer of these statements be a person whom you can trust? Will it be the person who, when he was Leader of the Opposition, had to say that ministers must never mislead the House and also gave us a definition of `truth'. He has given us a new definition of `never ever', but this was recently. This was his definition of truth:
We want to assert the very simple principle that truth is absolute, truth is supreme, truth is never disposable in national political life.
Most of us in this parliament, particularly those who have been here for a lengthy period of time, including you, Mr Speaker, are cautious with our words. Most of us know that we are sinners awaiting judgment. Most of us know that we have from time to time done things in our lives that we are not proud of. Most of us have a smidgin of humility in that regard. Not the Prime Minister.
This is the man who is never wrong. This is the man who will call black white in denial to anybody who comes at him with an accusation that something he has said in the past he has offended against. This is a man who says that in his own personal life he stands for the absolute presentation of consistency throughout it. And this is the bloke who lied to the parliament last week. This is the fellow who was asked a direct question—and there was absolutely no equivocation on it—who stood up to me in today's question time and, when 
 I said, `Didn't you mislead the House?' said, `No, I didn't because I didn't instruct him.' That wasn't the question that he was asked. This is a classic case of separating the inseparable, a classic case of standing aside, a classic case of not saying that `truth is absolute, truth is supreme and truth is never disposable in national political life'.
Prime Minister, you are worthy of the censure of this chamber, I am afraid to say. You deserve it. You deserve it because you have done the classic thing that a minister must never do. It is not that a minister cannot get out of a question. It is not that a minister can fail to answer a question. Ministers have been doing that since time immemorial. But ministers must not tell an untruth. You have said that yourself, and you stand condemned out of your own mouth. (Time expired)

"Howard, John, MP",LP,1998-06-01,"—The censure of anybody is the most serious parliamentary sanction that is available. In accordance with the practice of the House, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) was afforded a latitude with language that I accept without any demur because of the character of the motion. The allegation made against me by the Leader of the Opposition is that I lied. That was the allegation, pure and simple, no qualification, and that is the issue that is at stake here—whether or not I lied.
—You look embarrassed about it.
—No. I intend to treat it seriously because, like the Leader of the Opposition, I do have some considerable regard for this place and I do have some considerable regard for probity in public life. A lie, Mr Speaker, in my understanding, is when you tell a deliberate untruth. It involves telling a deliberate untruth. In other words, knowing that what you are saying is wrong, you nonetheless go ahead and say it.
Mr O'Keefe interjecting—
—I warn the honourable member for Burke.
—Let me assert to the House that I gave no such instruction as asked of me by the Leader of the Opposition, nor was I aware that anybody else in the government had given it. In those circumstances to suggest that I have lied to the parliament is a lie itself, and I totally reject it.
—Why didn't you correct the record?
—I warn the member for Denison.
—That is really about all that I could possibly be expected to say on this issue.
—So it is Costello's fault?
—The member for Denison will remain silent.
—Let me say it again, and say it very slowly: I was asked a question. I was, in fact, asked three questions by the Leader of the Opposition. The first question asked:
. . . is it a fact, as claimed by your latest departing member of your backbench, the member for Dickson, your GST will be presented to your party room as yet another fait accompli?
I answered no to that question. The second question asked:
Is it true that your own government members' task force on taxation, which you have touted as a great community consultative vehicle on your tax changes, was told not to make recommendations to the government?
When I was asked that question, knowing that I had given no such instruction, and not being aware of any such instruction having been given by anybody else, I said no. That remains the situation. Finally, the third question asked:
Is this not misleading behaviour of a piece with your refusal to answer questions in this House on whether your GST will apply to health . . .
And I answered no to that. I would remind the parliament that, when the press release was put out by me establishing this committee, the consultative role of this committee was emphasised in that press release. I believe that committee has carried out a very significant job for the government. As I said in answer to the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) 
 when he asked me the question, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and I will have the opportunity of dealing with this issue this afternoon when we meet the members of the committee.
While I am on my feet, and given that the substance of the allegation made against me by the Leader of the Opposition can be so completely dismissed in less than five minutes, let me take the opportunity in some of the remaining minutes that are available to me in this censure motion debate to traverse some of the confected morality which the Leader of the Opposition has taken upon himself over the last few moments. This is the man who purported a few moments ago to excoriate me for allegedly taking an absolute standard in relation to matters of behaviour. I would have to say to the Leader of the Opposition that no person with an element of commonsense in life would ever take an absolute standard in relation to his or her own personal behaviour. I have never done that, nor has anybody in my party and nor should any sensible person in the opposition.
Seeing that credibility and comparative truth have been put on the table, seeing that the word and the pledge of one man against another man has been put on the table, it is only right and proper that I have the opportunity to deal with the track record of the Leader of the Opposition. It is only right and proper that I have the opportunity of reminding the Australian people, as I have done on many occasions, that this was the man who told the Australian people, knowing it to be wrong—and that is the difference, because that was a lie because he knew it was wrong—that the budget was in surplus before the last election.
He did not seek to qualify those words. He did not seek to clothe them with some kind of excuse or some kind of exculpation. What the Leader of the Opposition did, knowing it to be wrong—in other words, according to his own definition, even worse than a lie, because what he is trying to fit me with is the allegation of a lie in relation to something that I did not, when I uttered those words, know for a moment to be untrue and therefore was not a lie—was to say to the Australian people, to solemnly look down the barrel of the camera, 
 knowing that the budget was in severe deficit, to put his hand on his heart and say, `No, the budget is in surplus.' That is what the Leader of the Opposition did, and that is what the Prime Minister whom he so loyally served at the time also did.
The dishonesty of the Leader of the Opposition, the willingness of the Leader of the Opposition to tell lies, was not limited to his behaviour in the lead-up to the 1996 election. It was also evident in the lead-up to the 1993 election. He knew that the propositions being taken to the 1993 election by the Australian Labor Party were economically unsustainable. He knew that the propositions being taken to the election by the Australian Labor Party could not be afforded if the promises of the Australian Labor Party were to be kept.
On that occasion he cooperated with his colleagues. He joined his colleagues in a dishonest attack on a goods and services tax that he himself had once supported in the middle of the 1980s. Not only did he join in that dishonest attack; after the election, without so much as a snippet of embarrassment, he joined in the repudiation of election commitments that had been made. Yet he now has the political indecency to come into this parliament and to pretend to the Australian people that he can lecture me on honesty, that he can lecture me on probity and that he can lecture me on proper parliamentary behaviour.
The Australian public will have an opportunity in the months ahead to make a judgment about the respective policies of the two sides of politics in Australia at the present time. I believe that as that campaign continues the Australian people will see not only the Leader of the Opposition's empty policy positions but also his confected morality, particularly in relation to the issue of the preferences of the One Nation Party, where he says that it is indecent not to put the One Nation Party last but it is perfectly decent to beg them to give you preferences. Apparently it is immoral not to put them last but it is perfectly moral to crawl into office with their preference votes. That is the morality that is being adopted by the Leader of the Opposition at the present time.
The allegation that was made against me was that I told a lie. I refute that; I reject that. I repeat again: I was asked a question. The basis of my answer was that I had not given any such instruction. I was not aware that anybody else had given any such instruction. It was therefore entirely honourable, entirely proper, entirely consistent with parliamentary practice for me to give the answer that I gave. I think it was the right answer to have given. I reject the censure motion that has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition.",REPS,<title>PRIME MINISTER</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Miscellaneous,8,1,speech
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,1998-06-01,"—What a pathetic defence of a Prime Minister (Mr Howard) who said, `Truth is paramount,' a Prime Minister who said he was going to lift the standards, a Prime Minister whose score of credibility is so diminished that every time he speaks, every time he opens his mouth, no-one can believe him. The Prime Minister leaves this chamber, scurrying out, having been given 15 minutes to defend himself and not able to go beyond 10 minutes. He is a person who, when he makes a commitment, no longer can be believed. He is a person who had the temerity to accuse the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) of covering up the last budget deficit. But Mr Howard was the Treasurer back in 1983 who actually had a document from the Treasury which he sat upon. He will not make that linkage, a linkage where he had a document that he sat upon and refused to divulge that he had put the government, and us coming to government, in deficit to the tune of $23 billion in today's dollars—and he wants to make comparisons about the so-called deficit on this occasion.
This is a Prime Minister who, every time he has got his hand on his heart these days, has got the shoulder twitching and the eyes flickering. Did anyone recall seeing him on the John Laws program when he was trying to get out of the `never, ever' escapade? When John Laws said to him, `But you've never said you were going to break that promise,' he said, `Well, I've just said it now, John.' This was the first revelation of it. He thought he could keep going, like he has tried to do in this parliament today, continuing to deny that he either said it or that someone said it on his behalf. He is the slipperiest of 
 all characters we have ever come across in this chamber, make no mistake of it.
We now have a `Howard dictionary'—a dictionary that effectively has to be rewritten because of the Prime Minister's statements. We have the dictionary of `never, ever'. `Never, ever' no longer means `forever' and `not ever'; it means `until the next election'. That is what the Prime Minister says `never, ever' means. Remember when he made the commitment to visit Newcastle `soon' when they had closed the Newcastle steel works? `Soon' means `Not before I go to Lords to see the cricket test.' And he still has not been to Newcastle. He has also redefined the word `immediate'. Of the car tariff plan, on the last occasion, 12 months ago, he said, `We will be looking for the parliament to give it immediate passage.' The government still has not introduced the legislation into this place. When announcing the great adventure on tax reform, he is a person who said that the details would be announced `soon'; 12 months later, again, we are still no further enlightened by it.
This is a Prime Minister who cannot be believed when he makes these commitments because he is a person who does not follow through. When he is caught out, what is his defence? His defence is, `I did not know; it was not me.'
Let us just go to the circumstances that have led to this censure today. He was asked today by the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) whether it was true that the government members consultative task force on taxation reform were told to not make recommendations to the government—not whether the Prime Minister told them but whether the committee was told. That was the question the Prime Minister was asked on 26 May, last week. On that occasion, when that question was asked of him, he said, `No.' On 26 May, the question was asked:
Is it true that your own government members' task force on taxation, which you have touted as a great community consultative vehicle on your tax changes, was told not to make changes to the government?
The Prime Minister said, `No'—no qualification, not `I haven't said it.' No qualification; 
 an emphatic no. He was asked, `Was the government's task force told by someone in authority in the government not to make recommendations?' and he said emphatically, `No.'
We have to go back to 26 May because that was the day when another member of the John Howard government left because they could not agree on policies. The member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) left on that day. He held a press conference before question time in parliament; he held it before 2 o'clock. I am sure that every member sitting opposite, including the Prime Minister and/or his minders, would have been glued to the set watching what was being said, because they knew that anything that came from it was fertile ground for us in question time. On that day, at the press conference, when asked on the question of tax, `Who do you blame for being clandestine about tax, Costello or Howard?' this is what Mr Tony Smith said:
I'm not blaming anybody. I'm just saying that having become aware that the committee that was set up on tax reform, on the task force, has not even been allowed to make recommendations—I mean, what do you say about that sort of process? Doesn't it illustrate the point I'm making?
He was there before question time, saying that the committee was not allowed to make recommendations. It is something the Prime Minister should have been aware of, it is a question he should have anticipated coming. If he did, all the worse his charge, because he deliberately got up in this House and lied. He got up in this chamber and said, `No, it is not true that they were told they could not make recommendations,' when not only is it the member for Dickson saying that, but if we go back a week to the Four Corners  program, Senator Brian Gibson, the chair of this committee—and you would think whether the member for Dickson or the member for Lowe had some ear to the Prime Minister might have been doubtful, but Senator Gibson, who is one of the Prime Minister's closer confidantes, would—said on the Four Corners  program on 18 May, `Our task is not to make recommendations.' That is the chairman of the committee speaking. He would not have been making that statement out front unless he was under instructions to make it, unless 
 he had been told by the people who set this operation up that he was not supposed to do it.
What we have is the Prime Minister knowingly allowing the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to go along to this committee and mug them, telling them that they cannot make recommendations, and then the Prime Minister maintains his purity, hand on heart in this chamber, and when he is asked the question, `Have you told that committee it can't make recommendations?' he says no. He was given the opportunity today on three occasions. He was first of all asked the question by the member for Lowe. He was asked the question, not in terms of whether he told them, but whether the committee was told. He avoided the question, if you look at the Hansard extract. He tried to laugh it off, as if this was some sort of inconsequential issue, as if it did not matter. Lying to the parliament does not matter to the Prime Minister any more because he has already lied to the public on a number of occasions and is now lying to the parliament; but he chooses to laugh it off. Having failed to answer the member for Lowe, he was then asked a second question. He was asked it by the Leader of the Opposition in a similar form:
Prime Minister . . . you denied that the government had instructed the government's backbench tax committee to produce no recommendations. Having failed to answer the question from the member for Lowe, will you now explain how you have not misled the House?
The Prime Minister said:
I will have a look at what I said last week.
He was then given the opportunity, because we sought to table the extract from Hansard , but no, the government would not take that. We then asked a number of other questions so that the Prime Minister could check the facts. What did he come back with in relation to the third question that was asked of him on the same point? He said:
Mr Speaker, I have now had an opportunity to check the question that was asked. The situation is that I had given no such direction. That was the basis of my answer.
It was not the basis of his answer. Not only has he shafted his Treasurer, knowing full well what the Treasurer has told them, no 
 doubt in consultation with his Prime Minister, but he has tried to change what the question was on 26 May last and on three occasions in this parliament.
You may say that this is a novel way out. It is no novel way out, this is the Prime Minister saying, `No, it wasn't me; not me, I know nothing.' Have you heard that before—`I know nothing'? He said it in relation to Sharp, he said it in relation to McGauran, he said it in relation to the dismissal of Grahame Morris and he said it in relation to Max Moore-Wilton, when he was supposed to be checking all the other conflicts of interest. He said it in relation to DDB Needham, he said it in relation to Prosser and he said it in relation to Parer.
He is a serial offender, this guy. This is a person who makes promises that he never intends to keep. When he is caught out he pretends he never made the promise, but when he is told what the promise was and shown the words he says, `I didn't mean that,' or, `I personally didn't say it.' This is the redefinitionist Prime Minister, the Prime Minister who said he would never ever introduce a tax that now he is saying he never ever will increase. How can anyone believe him? Today is just another example of what this Prime Minister will do to deceive the Australian public and to cover his hide, and that is why we have got the censure today.
This is not one isolated incident. This is a serial offender we have in the Prime Minister. This is a person who will lie at every opportunity. This is a person who will deceive the Australian public. This is a person who will mislead this House if he thinks he can get away with it. As far as we are concerned as an opposition, we will not let him get away with it. He is required to be accountable to this chamber and to the people who elected him. He is not accountable if what he is doing is lying to them in the worst possible ways. Let me say this: as far as the Prime Minister is concerned, there is no more important issue on his agenda than tax. He is the one who has asked the electorate to come on this great adventure with him. He set up the backbench committee to receive recommendations from 
 his fellow adventurers. He knew precisely what he was seeking to control and manage.
I am pleased to see the Prime Minister back in the chamber because, Prime Minister, we have been alleging against you that you have consistently deceived and lied to the Australian public, that you have misled the Australian parliament and that, whenever you get into trouble, you try to minimise the circumstances around you. Your intention is to shaft everyone else. Previously, you have axed seven ministers from your front bench because they became embarrassments and indefensible. We will still wait and see how long you have to hang on to your good flatmate, Senator Parer. We will still see how long you are prepared to hang on to him.
But always through those exercises you have said, `It had nothing to do with me, it was their fault, they must go.' Today you have shafted the Treasurer because he went and told that committee not to make any recommendations. He went, we assert, with your knowledge. You knew about it because you were involved in this exercise to hoodwink the Australian public, but you think you can come into this chamber and tell us that they were not directed to come up with no recommendations when you knew full well they were.

"Costello, Peter, MP",LP,1998-06-01,"—One has to be amused by the performance of the person who just stood opposite at the dispatch box, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). Never before would we have seen a censure or purported censure so lacking in all conviction. There was no conviction in that speech whatsoever. There was no support from the backbench. Never before would we have seen a censure so lacking in substance. No substantive issue whatsoever was raised by the member for Hotham. Never before would we have seen a censure with no moment. Was there any moment in the House that this was somehow significant, that this was a serious charge being mounted against the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)? Never before would we have seen a censure with no significance and on no substantive policy issue whatsoever.
The member for Hotham is so devoid of policy that he trafficked material which had been downloaded from the DAS computer to try to look into travel allowances and travel claims. Don't tell me he can't take it! He got on the Channel 9 program and, when he was asked whether or not he had downloaded from the DAS computer, he made out that he had not. He was trafficking around. I call him the Arthur Daley of the federal parliament.
Then he set up a little unit in his office to go out and look through Senator Parer's tax affairs. Do you think this man is interested in policy? Is he interested in budgets? Is he interested in tax? Is he interested in policy? Is he interested in debt? Is he interested in inflation? No. He has got a little unit in his office that runs around after the tax affairs of Senator Parer—again, a matter of great moment!
Then, of course, there was the Menzies Research Centre. Remember the Menzies Research Centre? He fed it out to the Bulletin. Another attempt to blackguard the reputation of the Prime Minister. Why? Why does the Labor Party invest so much time in trying to blackguard the reputation of the Prime Minister? It is not only because they have no policy but also because they know that the integrity and the honesty of the Prime Minister stand absolutely unchallenged. That is why they invest so much time in trying to blackguard the Prime Minister. They know that compared with them he stands unchallenged in the credibility and honesty stakes.
Mr Melham interjecting—
—Even by way of interjection from the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs. `You are supposed to be different,' he said—and so we are. The absolute outrage from the Labor Party when it appears that the government is different and does take a higher position!
So we have this concerted attempt by the little dirty tricks department that runs around in the ex-ACTU officer's office. It runs after Parer, runs after the Menzies Research Centre and gets up on these lacking-conviction censures—over what? Over a great policy issue? Does a great policy issue turn on any of this? No. Does any great policy issue that 
 the public will be engaged in turn on this? No. This is allegedly a matter of great moment as the Howard government consultative task force interplays—
—Look at the press tomorrow.
—That was a very interesting interjection. He said, `Look at the papers tomorrow.' Is that what you said?
—No, I said, `Look at the press tomorrow.'
—`Look at the press tomorrow,' he said. I hope the journalists heard that interjection: `Look at the press tomorrow.' It is an age-old tactic, Mr Speaker: move a censure, get up and throw around the words `lie' and `deceit' under public interest immunity and try to get them into the press tomorrow. That is as far as you think. `Look at the press tomorrow,' he said. When he said, `Look at the press tomorrow,' he was saying that this is all a media stunt to get the headline into the press tomorrow. Do you know what the press ought to report tomorrow? `Another stunt—Crean. Another blackguard—Crean. More dealing in deceit and lies from Crean.'
The Prime Minister got up here in answer to a question on Tuesday last week. The question was:
Is it true that your own government members' task force on taxation, which you have touted as a great community consultative vehicle on your tax changes, was told not to make recommendations to the government?
When he answered that question he answered it in utmost truthfulness—to the best of his knowledge and in utmost truthfulness, as he has said. There was no attempt whatsoever to mislead this House—in fact, the misleading of the House came in the cleverly phrased question. It was basically an attempt to say that the Prime Minister was not interested in his consultative task force recommendations. I can tell you that not only is the Prime Minister interested in their recommendation but he has a meeting with them at 5 o'clock this afternoon to receive their report.
—And he knew of the instructions. 
—The member for Hotham has made his contribution.
—What do you think is going to be in their report? A big blank page? It is going to be a report which is full of advice for the government as a result—
—Recommendations?
—What is a recommendation?
—Did you tell them not to make any?
—The member for Hotham will remain silent.
—What if the task force says—
—The Treasurer will speak through the chair.
—`Your tax reform package should include the following issues,' or, `We have heard from the following people'?
Mr Crean interjecting—
—The member for Hotham will remain silent.
—Do you call that a recommendation? Do you? Do you call that a recommendation?
—The Treasurer will respond through the chair.
—What a goose! What a pathetic argument. We are now having this semantic argument about the difference between a report and a recommendation, are we? We have got this huge report from the taxation task force consultative committee which is coming to the Prime Minister full of advice—99 per cent of it is, I am sure, correct, but there will no doubt be some items that the government does not agree with—and we are down here in the parliament having a semantic debate about what constitutes a recommendation.
It has always been absolutely clear what the purpose of the tax consultative task force is. The Prime Minister announced the formation of the government's tax policies on 13 August 1997, and the government's plan to reform and modernise the Australian taxation system. 
 He said it would be a two-stage process. He said:
Progress in this area will be undertaken by the Taxation TaskForce, headed by the Treasurer, with representatives of my department, the Australian Taxation Office, the Treasurer's office and the Cabinet Policy Unit.
He then went down and he laid out five principles as to what the government would be guided by in relation to tax reform:
a. There should be no increase in the overall tax burden;
b. Any new taxation system should involve major reductions in personal income tax with special regard for the taxation treatment of families;
c. Consideration should be given to a broad based,indirect tax to replace some or all of the existing taxes;
d. There should be appropriate compensation for those deserving of special consideration; and
e. Reform of Commonwealth/State financial relations must be addressed.
He then set up a second group, which he said would enable a heightened process of consultation with interest groups. He said:
The government will be assisted in this respect by a special task force of government members.
That was what was announced on 13 August 1997. On 4 September, the Prime Minister then announced the government members task force on taxation. He announced all of those that were due to be part of it. He said this:
The task force—
completely consistent with that—
has been established to assist in the process of public consultation. The task force will take public submissions . . . public submissions should bear in the mind the government's view.
—Did you tell them not to make recommendations?
—The member for Hotham has made his contribution and will remain silent.
—The task force will take public submissions and report to the government, as was said on 4 September 1997. Unless there was any doubt on this, I then issued a press release on 23 October 1997. And what did I say?
—`Don't make recommendations'. 
—Did I? Did I say that?
—Do you deny it?
—Did I say, `Don't make recommendations'? Did I?
—I warn the member for Hotham
—Another false claim! Another false claim.
—Deny it!
—The member for Hotham will leave the House for one hour under standing order 304A.
The honourable member for Hotham thereupon withdrew from the chamber.
—We are not much impressed by the bullyboy tactics of ex-ACTU presidents in this parliament. When I released a press release on 23 October 1997, again it was entirely clear what the tax consultative task force was to do. The government's tax consultative task force has commenced liaison with the community; the task force has been established to assist in the process of consultation; the task force will be taking submissions; the task force will take submissions on ways to achieve a fair and better modern taxation system; those making submissions should bear in mind the government's view that—and five principles were set out. So here we have a policy group, as announced by the Prime Minister, which is working on tax reform options; we have a consultative group which is consulting with the public, and the consultative group is reporting back to the government at 5 o'clock this afternoon on what the public has submitted it wants in a taxation package.
What does the opposition say? `Oh,' the opposition says, `big point here.' When this task force reports—with a report which is about as thick as the two fingers of the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey)—the question is whether that advice, whether that consultation, whether that report can be also characterised as recommendations. Of course there is going to be advice in that report. I have not been privileged enough to see it as yet, but it was always entirely clear, as the Prime Minister said, that this group was going 
 to have a free hand to consult, that this group was going to have a free hand to report—that was the whole essence of this group—and that it was going to work in tandem with the task force group.
The opposition gets up here in this confected appearance to try to make something out of the internal processes of the coalition and how it works. What turns on it? In what way will this affect the life of any Australian? In what way will this see that Australians who are paying mortgages on their homes will have a situation which is changing? In what way will it change the way in which the taxation system operates? In what way will it determine the outcome of tax reform in this country? This is one of the most arcane, inconsequential, semantic disputes that you could possibly muscle up, and it has been muscled up because this is an opposition which is failing to engage in any policy discussion whatsoever.
The Prime Minister's integrity in this matter stands absolutely unchallenged. And we will repudiate any attempt by the blackguarding of the Australian Labor Party to go around and try to put aspersions on him. If you want to see the kinds of aspersions that actually affect people, let us think about what people are told before elections on the state of the Commonwealth budget. This is something that can really affect people. What were people given to understand in February 1996 when the then Minister for Finance went out and said that the budget was in balance? That had the capacity to affect people. It had the capacity to affect people in terms of the government's fiscal position. It had the capacity to affect people in terms of their vote. It had the capacity to affect them in relation to their mortgage interest rates. What do you say about a finance minister who, on the eve of federal election, goes out and says that the budget is in balance?
—He's a cheat! He's a liar!
—What do you really say about person like that?
Mrs Crosio interjecting—
—The member for Prospect will remain silent.
Mrs Crosio interjecting—
—I warn the member for Prospect!
—What motivation could you have on the eve of an election to make that statement when the budget was then $10,000 million in the red? Let us go to motive here. And let us ask: who had the motives?
—And the forged letters.
—And the forged letters—quite right—on the eve of the 1996 election which were put out by the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis). I have had the decency not to refer to that in this parliament until you raised it. What were the motivations on the eve of the 1996 election?
Let me ask you about other motivations in relation to policies on the eve of an election. What motivation would you have before an election to legislate income tax cuts and take them away afterwards? What motivation would you have?
—To deceive.
—To deceive. Did anything turn on that? Yes. What turned on that was millions of Australians' pay packets. He actually put into legislation an income tax cut and then, after the election, took it away. Was that an arcane dispute about what constitutes a recommendation or a report in a backbench consultation process before an election? No, that wasn't. That was an assurance which was put to millions of Australians—that, on the re-election of a Labor government in 1993, they would get a reduction in their personal income tax. Did they ever get it? No. That was not l-a-w, that was a l-i-e. Do you know what happened? It worked. It got the Labor Party back in the 1993 election. In the 1993 election, Labor stole an election on deceit. Labor tried to do it again in 1996, and Labor was caught.
  So don't give me any of this smokescreen about the Prime Minister's integrity. Don't give me any of this smokescreen about Labor being holier than thou. Don't give us any of 
 this smokescreen about how the Labor Party is interested in standards. The Labor Party is not interested in standards. The Labor Party can't hold a wick to the honesty of the Prime Minister. The Labor Party can't put a torch to it. This censure should be utterly defeated and repudiated. And we do it!
	 Question put:
	 That the motion (Mr Beazley's ) be agreed to.",REPS,<title>PRIME MINISTER</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Miscellaneous,8,1,speech
"McLeay, Leo, MP",ALP,1998-06-01,"—I move:
That this House calls on the Government to make closed captioning compulsory on all prime time programs and all news programs.
From my earliest days in this House I have been a consistent advocate for the captioning of television programs. In fact I recall asking the then Minister for Communications in 1980 about the feasibility of introducing subtitles to television programs, especially news programs, to assist people with hearing difficulties. The then Minister for Communications, the Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair, responded early in 1981 with advice about several developments such as the then recent introduction of SBS, which showed subtitled programs and also used sign language to accompany some of its early news bulletins. At that time SBS was working towards complete subtitling of its main news program and the ABC was giving consideration to the introduction of a closed captioning system for some of its programs. It was also stated:
Every effort will be made to ensure that programs for the hearing impaired are included in these new services should they be established.
Those were the words of the then Minister for Communications in 1981. What has happened since then? Not enough. Although there has been some extension of the provision of closed captioning, a very slow rate of progress has been achieved.
Captioning started in Australia in 1982 when the Barchester Chronicles was shown on the ABC with captions. At present only 15 per cent of all programs are captioned. No caption programming is available on pay television, I am told. I do not have pay television myself, but I understand from people who watch it that there is no captioning on programming there. There is no legislation in Australia covering the captioning of television. The nearest thing to a regulation is contained in the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations' code of practice, which states that television stations will	endeavour to increase captioning. To ask private companies to endeavour to spend 
 more money on something that some of them say has no commercial advantage is something that beggars belief.
Overseas it is a different story. In the USA, for example, the Telecommunications Act 1996 ensures 100 per cent captioning must be achieved by 2008 for all programs, regardless of how they are delivered. Currently, almost all free-to-air television in the US is captioned. The American regulators regard two per cent of turnover as being a reasonable indication of how much should be spent by a broadcaster on captioning.
In the United Kingdom, the Broadcasting Act 1992 stipulates that 50 per cent of all programs must be captioned by July this year. This covers the commercial networks. The BBC has agreed to maintain captioning levels at a comparable, or higher, level than the commercial networks. We, in Australia, lag a long way behind in this area. We have not even achieved the goal of captioning all prime-time and news and current affairs programs, let alone all programs.
A lot of people might be interested to learn who actually uses captions. They are used mainly by the deaf and the hard of hearing, who are unable to hear the soundtracks of many programs. Interestingly, they are also used by people learning English and can be used by school students as an aid to improving literacy.
Some people wonder whether this is just something to help a small number of people in the community. How many deaf or hard of hearing people are there in Australia? The 1995 ABS national health survey found that over 1.7 million Australians identified themselves as having total or partial hearing loss. Indeed, deafness or partial deafness is the most widespread disability in this country. With our increasingly ageing population, the proportion of deaf and hard of hearing people will increase dramatically as time goes on.
I have to admit some self-interest here, Mr Deputy Speaker, because, as you and some of my colleagues are keenly aware, I have a little deafness in one ear and a lot of deafness in the other ear.
—And you have it in both ears when I talk to you.
—Indeed, when the Minister for Family Services was the Manager of Opposition Business, I used to find it was pleasant to be deaf all the time, mainly because he had nothing interesting to say at the time.
Deafness is something that affects millions of people in this country. There are the 1.7 million who are hard of hearing and the families of those people. When you look at that, you see we are talking about three or four million people who are affected in various ways through either themself or a member of their family being hard of hearing.
Those of you like the minister, who says he has normal hearing, should try to imagine what it is like not to be able to hear properly or even at all. How many of us wake up to the sound of a clock radio and absorb the day's news as we are getting ready to go to work or while we are driving to work? How many of us even have the television switched on in the background with an ear attuned for items of interest? A deaf person is unable to take advantage of that and a hard of hearing person usually cannot either. There are many opportunities available to others to tune into things that go on around them and to what is being broadcast. These people, be they deaf or hard of hearing, are considerably disadvantaged by their inability to hear.
Consider the situation of the families of those who are hearing impaired. At night-time, watching television at home can often turn out to be very difficult. The television volume is turned up, often to an uncomfortably high level, which can cause discomfort to those with normal hearing. It is hardly conducive to a calm, relaxing time with the family when you have noise dominating the domestic scene. The person with the hearing disability feels frustrated because they cannot hear properly, while others feel as if they are being blasted by sound. Members of this chamber might recall, from recent experiences of the Speaker's changing the sound reinforcement levels in this chamber, the difficulties that can happen according to the 
 varying amounts of individuals' hearing acuity.
While captioning has been in Australia for over 15 years, as I said earlier, currently only 15 per cent of television programs are captioned. At that rate of progress it will be the year 2080 before total captioning is achieved, compared with the US where it will be 2008. The cost to the networks of captioning should not be huge and certainly not prohibitive. It should represent only a small percentage of their annual turnover and should be well within world benchmarks for the cost of captioning. Furthermore, the technology and expertise readily exist in this country to caption all forms of programs, which brings me to my next point.
The parliament will soon be debating the  Television Broadcasting Services (Digital Conversion) Bill 1998 , which includes a requirement for the provision by free to air operators of a closed captioning service for all prime time programming as well as for news and current affairs broadcast in prime time. This is a positive step and a start in the right direction.
Because the digital terrestrial television broadcasting signal enables compression of the digital data stream, the available spectrum can be used more effectively. The capacity to replace a single analog channel with a number of digital programs means that transmission will create spare capacity. This spare capacity could be used to provide more captioning.
The government is prepared to lend the commercial and national free to air television broadcasters seven megahertz of spectrum free of up-front charge. In return they will be required to simulcast their existing services in analog and digital formats for eight years, after which they will have to return the equivalent of their loaned spectrum to the Commonwealth. I would like to suggest that, in return for this loan of spectrum, the free to air broadcasters should be required to caption all programs. They are going to get a loan of a free public good and they should be willing to put something back in.
As I have said before, while deaf and hard of hearing people want to be able to keep up with the news and current affairs just as much 
 as anyone else, they should also be able to enjoy other programs and not be deprived of the entertainment available to those who do not have a hearing problem. It is very easy to become excluded from society if you are not allowed to access the forces that shape it. I think captioning should be provided not just for news, current affairs and prime time broadcasting but for all programs so that both the deaf and the hard of hearing can participate in the things that shape the life of our country.
The digital compression legislation should include the provision that all programs should be captioned. We should get ourselves into a position to do this and keep up with the rest of the world. For once it would be nice to see us ahead rather than trailing terribly behind. (Time expired)

"Neville, Paul, MP",NP,1998-06-01,"—The matter of hearing loss and deafness in Australia is not a pretty one. It is variously estimated that between one million and three million people suffer from some form of hearing impairment. In 1995 a government survey put that figure at 1.7 million people. As the aged population sector moves over 60 years of age, the rate of impairment is as high as 50 per cent.
Two in every thousand babies born are deaf. Rubella, congenital defects, middle ear infection and birth weight under 1,500 grams all play a part in putting hearing at risk. In the indigenous population, the Menzies School of Health estimates that 60 per cent suffer hearing problems while 80 per cent of indigenous children are at risk through ear infections and ear drum injury.
It is not surprising then that a large proportion of the population suffers from deafness or severe impairment. The Australian Caption Centre puts this figure at 3.7 per cent of the population and the ABS puts it at 3.9. So we know that about four per cent of Australians cannot enjoy the facility of hearing like most of us can.
We live in an enlightened society which is better informed than any previous generation. Access to books and print is at an all-time high, while the electronic media—radio and television—dominates great portions of our lives. It is not uncommon for homes to have two or more television sets and three or four radios—many of them playing at the same time. We are shameless information and entertainment junkies. We demand access, sometimes at great expense, to telephony, the Internet, radio and television. In many instances we label it in legislation as a community or a universal service obligation.
Against this background, spare a thought for the 1.7 million Australians who do not enjoy these various mediums of communication or entertainment or can enjoy them only in a very limited way. They too have rights which are taken for granted by the wider community and they stand at one side of this debate.
The other side is more complex, especially as it applies to television and whose responsibility it is to deliver television services to the deaf and the hearing impaired. As the motion of the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) confirms, the main vehicle for delivering better standards of television information and entertainment lies in closed captioning. Closed captioning is a text delivered on part of the television screen. The signal generating it is carried with the video signal and is generated onto the screen by a decoder. Unlike open captioning—an example being subtitles—this form of captioning can be brought on the screen by the viewer at will by switching on his or her decoder. This system plays a vital part in the lifestyles of hearing impaired people and, well and generously handled, can richly enhance the quality of their lives. To date, Australia's record has been quite reasonable, given the diversity of our television choices and the large areas of metropolitan and regional Australia that need to be covered.
While it is true that more can be done in this field, the facility is not without its difficulties, costs and technical problems. You might ask: what is the current Australian position? As the member for Watson said, currently about 15 per cent of all programs 
 and 50 per cent of all prime time commercial television, excluding summer sport, is captioned. This includes all Australian drama, most US drama, sitcoms and some movies. The Federation of Commercial Television Stations believes that all commercial stations will cover most prime time programming in the next few years without legislative strictures. This may be a little slower than the US and the UK, but it is not a bad effort from a small population. The UK requires 50 per cent of all broadcasting to be captioned by July this year, while the US requires all programming to be captioned by the year 2008.
The Seven Network has a commendable level of commitment to captioning. In Perth, Seven's news was the first in Australia to be closed captioned. It is the only network with an in-house off-line facility for pre-recorded programs and an on-line facility for live broadcasts. The other channels conduct their affairs through the ACC. The Seven Network first used this facility for the series Witness. It also live captioned Princess Diana's funeral, and last year it live captioned the AFL Grand Final.
The Nine Network—which won the Caption Centre's Award for two years running and captions 40 per cent of its prime time programming—has captioned Friends, Suddenly Susan, Water Rats, ER, Sale of the Century and Burke's Backyard, and it has obtained Toyota's sponsorship for captioning 60 Minutes. The Ten Network, through the ACC, captions Neighbours and a number of movies and has New Zealand captioning for Hercules and Xena. It has recaptioned, through the ACC, Beverley Hills 90210, Just Shoot Me, Mad About You, The Nanny, NYPD Blue, Roseanne, Seinfeld and X-Files.
The ABC, which has been captioning for 16 years, has progressively increased its captioning budget, which currently runs at $550,000. It recently captioned the popular series Sea Change and it captions seven state based 7 p.m. news bulletins and one late night bulletin. Not having sponsorship or commercial income, the ABC's position is quite different. It will cost the ABC $3 million to achieve captioning in prime time. The fact that the 
 government has allocated $7 million over four years for captioning on ABC and SBS is an indication of the importance it attached to it.
As many in the community ask: why not more? When it comes to overseas shows, especially American programs and movies, the transfer of captioning to the Australian circumstance is not automatic. Not only does the base program have to be reformatted from NTSC but the captioning, which is often owned by a separate company, needs to be bought, decoded, reformatted and restriped to the reformatted video and sound of the particular movie or program. Furthermore, movies are frequently edited to suit, with different markets having different requirements. Crocodile Dundee had a totally different type of editing in the United States from what we had in Australia. An American program which has been formatted with captioning cannot be put onto a television screen in Australia and played in the normal way. In addition to the technical problems, there are censorship considerations and sometimes the script has to be partially rewritten for the local idiom.
Another problem to be considered is the change to digital technology, which will require a totally new technical approach to captioning. There is also the obvious problem of captioning two formats—the analog and the digital—during the eight-year co-transmission period, especially where live to air programs are concerned. This will require two captioning stenographers working at the same time in two separate booths for the co-transmission activity. Then there is the matter of live sport, which is very difficult to caption bearing in mind that the best captioning stenographer can only work at an intensive level for about 45 minutes. In fact, across the whole captioning regime, the matter of the competence and cost of captioning stenographers is a major point of concern, especially in the regionals.
A similar problem exists with the Today show, Hey, Hey, It's Saturday, the Midday Show, et cetera, where there is often fast and furious live dialogue to be transcribed and where people speak over the top of one another. One also has to ask whether it is 
 reasonable at this stage to ask that overseas news services which are used as overnight fillers, such as NBC News, the America Today show, et cetera, should have to be captioned. For example, if we force the hand of the commercial stations with such innovative programs as Sunrise and Daybreak, which would be very expensive to caption, will they continue?
I sound a word of warning. An unreasonable demand in time or cost on the resources of regional television could have an unintended consequence and may lead to the diminution of regional news programs and their being subsumed by capital city programs. This could lead to an unacceptable centralising of news and the dropping of regionally based news programs. I vehemently oppose the centralising of media control and output, in the name of both ordinary Australians and hearing impaired Australians.
Nine broadcasts 18 separate half-hour regional news bulletins. In Queensland alone, it runs five separate bulletins, while Seven runs three. You can imagine the cost of caption stenography in that circumstance.

"Sawford, Rod, MP",ALP,1998-06-01,"—This motion by the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) is very significant, particularly for the 1.7 million people who identify themselves as having a total or a partial hearing loss. That is the known figure, and it represents just less than 10 per cent of the population. However, as the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) pointed out, the more likely figure is somewhere in the vicinity of up to 3.4 million people, 20 per cent of the population. I would like to congratulate the member for Watson for some time ago convincing the then Minister for Communications, Michael Lee, to have captioned the evening news service on both the ABC and SBS. The former minister tells me quite emphatically that the member for Watson was absolutely merciless in his lobbying for the captioning of these news services.
Making compulsory closed captioning on all prime time programs and all news programs is an area that Australia has taken a back seat in, and Australia now lags behind the rest of 
 the Western world. In August 1997 Robert Scott, chief executive of the Australian Caption Centre, was quoted as saying that only 13 per cent of all Australian broadcasts carry closed captions. This was compared to the United States at 90 per cent and the United Kingdom at 45 per cent. I understand that almost all free to air television in the United States is captioned, and their Telecommunications Act 1996 ensures 100 per cent captioning by the year 2008, regardless of how programs are delivered. In the United Kingdom, the Broadcasting Act ensures 50 per cent of all programs are captioned by this year, and by recent standards they are well on track to achieve this.
We pride ourselves in this country on having the highest consumption of new technologies as soon as they become available. Take, for example, our mass consumption of mobile phones and VCRs. With digital television being introduced in 2001, our appetite for this new innovative technology will be just as great, if not more. So why is Australia different to the United States and the United Kingdom when it comes to captioning? The member for Watson alluded earlier in his 	speech to his approaching the then Minister for 	Communications in early 1981, I think he said, to inquire about the	 developments in this area. But, compared to the United Kingdom and the United States, not a great deal has been achieved in this country.
The necessary technology has existed for a decade and a half but, in addition to that time, generational advances in computer technology and in the communications industry have made it even easier now than it ever has been before. In the United States, regulators regard two per cent of turnover as being the responsible indicator of how much should be spent on captioning. Whilst SBS and the ABC—and congratulations to both of them—are well in front of their commercial counterparts when it comes to program captioning, we are still well behind other leading countries in this area. It is obvious that, unless we put in place some formal obligations by the broadcasters to provide this service within a reasonable 
 timetable, it will not be significantly advanced. In fact, it just will not happen.
Voluntary industry codes and goodwill, often favoured by many in the current government, simply will not work in this industry, which is driven by high profit motive. Unless government provides leadership in this area, Australia will maintain a level of commitment to those 1.7 million to 3.4 million people who have a hearing impairment well short of our international reputation for justice and fairness for all.
With any modern society, it is important we should take and use the appropriate technology to ensure everyone in our nation is able to fully participate and enjoy what others take for granted every day. The Television Broadcasting Services (Digital Conversion) Bill 1998, currently before the House, requires closed captioning of all prime time programming, in addition to all prime time news and current affairs. That is certainly good news. Inclusivity and fairness are admirable aims, and Australian aims, if I may say so. Therefore, anything which encourages an increase in the level of social debate in Australia, as well as allowing more people access to general entertainment and current affairs on television, is a good thing.
However, we should not be content to leave the issue there.

"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,1998-06-01,"—I am delighted to hear particularly the Deputy Manager of Opposition Business, the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), offer support for the digital television bill, because I have a grave concern that in fact in the other place opposition senators may choose, in their usual style, to delay the process of that bill. I think that in itself, if it were to occur, would bring about the exact opposite outcome to what the member for Watson is aiming for in his fine motion before the House today. So I would urge the member for Watson to use what I understand to be his considerable power within the opposition to 
 ensure that there is smooth, steady and timely passage of that legislation when it reaches the other place. One thing is for certain: there needs to be a level of certainty so that all those operators of television, both the ABC and SBS, along with their commercial counterparts, can get on with the job of actually ordering the equipment and can get on with the business of providing digital television here in Australia.
With that, as has been outlined by the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), there is a requirement to upgrade the amount of captioning that is contained in Australian television programs, and that is a good thing. That only 15 per cent of programs across the networks are currently captioned is a great shame and a great disgrace. Less than half of prime time programming is captioned. It has taken the initiative of one of the commercial networks, if I could highlight the Seven Network and its efforts since 1977, to show the lead to the others. Seven, in the year 1996-97 increased its captioning from 38 to 53 per cent, while unfortunately the Ten Network's captioning commitment reduced to below 30 per cent. That probably had as much to do with the viability of that network at the time as anything else.
It is important to highlight in this debate today the efforts of Channel Seven and, in particular, the efforts of Channel Seven Brisbane. John McFerran, who is the national manager of the Austext organisation within Seven, has had 40 years experience in the television industry. McFerran has worked very closely with everybody from the Queensland Deaf School right the way through to, in more recent years, the Australian Captioning Centre with a view to expanding the amount of caption material available to those who are hearing impaired or profoundly deaf.
—Without compulsion.
—There has been no compulsion, as the member for Hinkler has quite rightly highlighted. Whilst those opposite will often suggest that the almighty dollar is the prime motivation of commercial operations in Australia—and high profits, I think the member for Port Adelaide said—it is more than admirable that the Seven Network, for 
 one, has turned its profits back into its Austext operation. I was going to say `experiment' because I think it was when it started in 1977. Here we are in 1998 and over half of the Seven Network's programs in prime time are captioned as a result of Austext. It has been an incremental increase over a long period of time. That Austext service, providing people have access to or own a television with a teletext facility, is accessible to about 96 per cent of the Australian population through the Seven and affiliated networks. So that signal is there.
I must submit, as secretary of the government's backbench policy committee—the member for Hinkler is our magnificent chairman—that the matter of closed captioning has not escaped members of the government. We have some concern that in the digital TV regime Seven is allowed to continue—and is, in fact, encouraged to continue—its great work in the area of closed captioning, so that those in our community who are deaf or hard of hearing are able to access information not just as a result of closed captioning but also through the Austext service.
So there is probably a need for government to play a role in providing some legislative parameter. I think that is a reasonable and fair thing. A lot of that is addressed in the bill that is before the House. It is fair to set some targets. It is a matter that the government has not lost sight of.

"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,1998-06-01,"—by leave—On behalf of the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund I present the advisory report of the committee, incorporating a dissenting report entitled Twelfth Report: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill 1998 , together with evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund inquired into the Heritage Protection Act 1984 and reported to parliament on 2 April 1998. Later that day the government presented the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill 1998 . The main objective of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill 1998  is to establish procedures for the preservation and protection of indigenous areas and objects of significance. The bill provides for a heritage accreditation regime for the states and territories. Heritage protection issues then could be resolved at the most appropriate level and, where possible, through mediated outcomes for the benefit of all Australians. The process aims to avoid the problems, costs and litigation associated with heritage protection such as were encountered with the proposed Hindmarsh Island Bridge.
The Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund has been pleased to conduct an inquiry into the heritage protection bill. The matter was referred to the committee by the House of Representatives on 2 April 1998, following the second reading of the bill. The committee received 28 submissions and held two days of public hearings in Melbourne and Canberra. All evidence has been carefully considered. In particular, the committee sought to be sensitive to any evidence that might reject the views that it formed for the report on the 
 1984 act. Significantly, the committee did not receive evidence that would encourage it to amend the recommendations contained in its 11th report. This is necessary because the government presented the  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill 1998  on 2 April 1998, following tabling of the committee's 11th report. Consequently, the committee's recommendations could not be adopted in the bill as presented.
If the recommendations of the committee's 12th report are incorporated into the bill, they will ensure significant improvements to the protection of indigenous heritage. The report recommends that the bill provide blanket or presumptive protection of indigenous heritage. Further, the committee recommends a more detailed and comprehensive Commonwealth standard by which the state and territory heritage protection regimes may be accredited. The Commonwealth standard should provide for state and territory committees, including an appropriate gender balance and indigenous representation. The committee's report further suggests that appropriate qualifications for the position of Director of Indigenous Heritage Protection be specified.
The committee was also concerned that the definition of `national interest' should include the protection of indigenous heritage. Under this criterion, appeal would be made to the Commonwealth, even where heritage protection regimes were accredited in the states and territories. Were the government to accept this recommendation, the proposed legislation would resemble more a statute of last resort, such as the 1984 act that it is intended to replace. Notably, legislation of last resort was endorsed by the committee's 11th report, tabled on 2 April.
In conclusion I would like to thank the committee and, in particular, my coalition colleagues for their diligence and commitment to the inquiry and for producing a report which will benefit all Australians. I would also like to thank the member for Franklin, Mr Harry Quick, for his contribution to the committee, particularly in relation to the bill inquiry. It remains in the interest of indigenous and non-indigenous Australians alike that we work together to provide the highest 
 possible level of protection for this country's precious indigenous heritage. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund Committee </title>,Committees,17,1,speech
"Melham, Daryl, MP",ALP,1998-06-01,"—by leave—The tabling of the 12th report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund is an occasion of profound regret for those with an interest in the integrity and effectiveness of the parliamentary committee system, those with a belief in the responsibilities of the legislature as a check on the burgeoning powers of the executive, and those committed to the protection of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage.
The 11th report of this committee resulted from its inquiry into the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984, whilst the 12th report deals with the government's legislation to repeal and replace the 1984 act. Both reports had the benefit of being formulated after the 1996 report by the Hon. Elizabeth Evatt AC of her review of the 1984 act. It is to be regretted that, despite a number of sound recommendations, neither of the committee's reports matched the insight, rigour or constructive criticisms evident in the Evatt report.
The 11th report had all members of the committee accepting Justice Evatt's recommendation that any new act should continue to provide Commonwealth legislation of last resort together with a thorough accreditation regime for state and territory heritage protection regimes. All members accepted the decision to endorse that view in the 12th report. Unfortunately, the majority in the 12th report remained silent on the fact that the 1998 bill fails to deliver either legislation of last resort or comprehensive and acceptable accreditation criteria for state and territory regimes.
The  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill 1998  marks the withdrawal of the Commonwealth from Aboriginal heritage protection in all but a few narrowly defined instances of a so-called `national interest'. In seeking to do so the government is walking away from its constitutional and international responsibilities. In its silent 
 acquiescence to this move in defiance of its explicit recommendation, the coalition members of the joint committee have ill-served the parliament, ill-served the committee process and ill-served indigenous heritage. I would remind the committee chairman of his own words in tabling the committee's 11th report:
There continues to be a need for Commonwealth legislation concerning indigenous heritage protection and such legislation should be provided as a statute of last resort.
These words supported the recommendation of the majority in the committee when they said:
The Committee accepts the need both for legislation of last resort, and an accreditation regime.
The coalition members of the committee have remained silent in the face of this glaring contradiction between their stated principles on the one hand and their support of the government's legislation on the other.
I turn now to our international obligations. Australia is a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. That covenant obliges our national government to protect and preserve the collective rights of our indigenous peoples to enjoy their own culture. It further requires that all signatories enact laws to preserve and protect sites associated with that culture. Another of its provisions that places the 1998 bill at odds with the covenant is the requirement to actively involve indigenous people in the development of those laws. The government has ignored the Evatt report and the report of the minority of the parliamentary joint committee in failing to establish an Aboriginal cultural heritage advisory council including indigenous members or an independent Aboriginal heritage protection agency.
This bill leaves us without an integrated and consistent approach to the protection of indigenous heritage. There are, in fact, at least three pieces of existing legislation that bear on the Commonwealth's responsibilities in this area, each with its own perspective: the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1993, dealing with world heritage values; the Australian Heritage Protection Act 1976, dealing with national heritage values; and the legislation immediately under discussion, the 
 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984, dealing specifically with indigenous heritage values.
There is a need at the national level for a comprehensive and integrated Aboriginal cultural heritage regime. We missed the boat in this bill if we were to deliver what Elizabeth Evatt has called `a systematic assessment of what is needed to ensure that Aboriginal people are able to maintain, protect, develop, and fully enjoy their culture and heritage'. It is not my intention to debate here the merits or otherwise of the government's bill—that will be done later this week—but rather to reflect on the failure of the committee system in general, and this committee in particular, to bring telling influence to bear in having the government deliver appropriate and effective legislation.
The government's rationale for walking away from Aboriginal heritage protection is that it will put in place accredited state and territory regimes to perform the tasks. The fact is that the 1984 act was intended to be legislation of last resort with underlying state and territory regimes. The fact is that 14 years later such legislation is non-existent in some places and inadequate in others. For many people, the Commonwealth legislation is legislation of only resort.
If we needed a political reality test on the difficulties of developing Commonwealth-state regimes to address a problem, we need look no further than the issue of uniform national gun laws. Rarely has there been such a clear popular consensus on the need for national action. Rarely has there been such swift national action or such multi-partisan support for a uniform national approach. And look how quickly even this initiative has faltered when put to the test of uniform implementation. Already we see state governments appearing to buckle before sectional pressures. What possible hope is there for a state based approach in a much more contentious area?
This is an area where the committee could have given more specific guidance. It will not be sufficient to have national substantive or legislative criteria for state regimes. To have any hope of success it is essential that the 
 criteria go to processes and procedures in addition to statutes. Many problems of the past, and today, stem as much from a failure to implement or apply existing law in a fair, efficient and equitable way as they do from the absence of laws or inadequacies in their drafting.
The issue is one of political will to act. It is an issue of procedural equity. History has given people little faith that the states will deliver Aboriginal heritage protection without comprehensive oversight. This report, and the bill it refers to, comes to this place in the context of a wider and contentious national debate. We cannot ignore the debate on native title in turning our attention to this legislation. In the face of the erosion of native title and of the right to negotiate attached to its incidence, heritage protection legislation will be all that indigenous people will have to turn to. The debate on this bill must be seen in that context. It is also in that context that we must reflect on the inadequate consultation and investigation that preceded its presentation in this place.
We need, and indigenous Australians deserve, better legislation than this.

"O'Keefe, Neil, MP",ALP,1998-06-01,"—This is the second tranche of legislation which seeks to complete putting in place the new arrangements for the marketing of wheat internationally and domestically into the future. To put this into context, I make the point that it was resolved some 10 years ago when John Kerin was the federal primary industries minister that we would start to change the statutory marketing arrangements for a number of commodities including wheat and that we would move towards a structure which resulted in grower ownership of whatever model developed. We also decided back in 1989 that whatever corporate structure 
 became the body that ran what we know as the single desk and managed the collective selling of the wheat pool would need a capital base. So from 1989 growers began to contribute to a levy to provide a capital base for the company or structure to take over this role about now.
Over time that capital base has grown not only through contributions from growers but also through its own earnings on the investment. There has been a capital growth and that is in itself the subject of some debate between the industry and the government, which I will come to further down the track in this contribution. That capital base became known as the Wheat Industry Fund. I mention it now in setting the background and also in explaining the reasons why I am proposing the amendment that will be circulated in my name and moved at the end of this contribution.
When the first tranche of this legislation was introduced into the House, we found that the government had chosen to go in a particular direction to try to take account of a grower corporate model—some kind of corporate structure that growers would own and control—and also some way of integrating that capital base into the grower corporate model. The structure chosen by the government was an A- and B-class share structure which gave specific rights in the corporate model to growers as growers of wheat—in other words, if you were a grower, you got a share and you were in the game. The government tried to blend into it as well capital rights for the holders of contributions in the Wheat Industry Fund. It tried to give those voting shares in proportion to the amount of capital that had been invested.
It became evident to us in October last year, when this legislation first arrived, that the structure the government had adopted was a complex one, that it was legalistic and had a number of problems. There were other ways of doing this but this was the model which had been chosen.
I made the comment in the last debate, when we virtually had a mirror image of where we are now, that the government should not take the  Wheat Marketing Legisla 
 tion Amendment Bill 1998 through the House—pending at that time an examination by the Senate standing committee which had given itself a reference to have a look at this—because there was substantial concern among growers about the way it had been unfolding. At the time the minister had assured me that he had industry support for the plans. But we suddenly found that on the Senate committee the majority members—that is, the government's own members on the committee—were deeply troubled by this structure. Arising out of their inquiry, they finally came to an accommodation with the first tranche of legislation but that was subject to a number of things taking place in the second tranche.
Now the second tranche has arrived and the problems have not been resolved, certainly not to my satisfaction and not to the satisfaction of a substantial number of growers who have been in contact with us during the last fortnight. Therefore, I am proposing as an amendment tonight that we defer the implementation of this legislation for 12 months and that we extend the existing arrangements—the underwriting of the Wheat Board—for a further 12 months while the growers come to consider more fully the model which they are now coming to, the model which, interestingly, my instincts took me to when I took over this portfolio area from Bob Collins on behalf of the opposition and I had my first look at it.
Before I met with industry representatives, I looked at it and thought: how would I do this? Now I find that so did a lot of other people, and they have all reached the same conclusions. What has now come to the fore is that there was no need to go for a convoluted corporate structure that tried to somehow build ownership and representation of the money bank, the WIF, into the grower corporate model, which will be doing the management of the arrangements, running the single desk and representing the farmers. There were other ways of doing it. It was always my view that a far better way to do it would have been to set it up as a corporate cooperative in the same structure as a number of modern corporate cooperatives in the dairy industry, 
 both in Australia and in Europe, have been formed in line with cooperative principles but under a corporate structure and to separate the money base, the WIF, quite independently. That is now emerging as what should have happened.
Let me explain why this is so. Western Australian growers in particular were aware of this from day one. I now discover that growers in New South Wales—in their original discussions with the New South Wales Farmers Federation, which were representing their views at peak council—had the same concerns but gave way because growers in Queensland, Victoria and South Australia—although not a majority in quantity producers but a majority in numbers—decided that the minister's model was the better way to go.
We now find that the Western Australian and New South Wales growers were looking at a different model altogether. Their instincts were right because—even with the provision, which I will turn to in a minute, that is incorporated in this legislation to give direction to the way the company is run and the undertakings in the memorandum of understanding which underpin the corporate directions—what cannot be overcome is a core flaw in the structure. What everybody has been trying to accommodate is what you do for the wheat grower who has contributed money to the Wheat Industry Fund to give a capital base to the new company. When we get to the point where the company has been set up—it is a private sector grower company and its capital belongs to the wheat growers—what happens if the wheat grower wants to have his or her money back?
They have contributed compulsorily up to this point as part of the industry arrangements. But, from the point of handover to a private sector grower corporate model, it is their money to do with as they want. Everybody accepted that there has to be a way of enabling a grower who wants his or her money back to be able to do that. The model the government set up was to issue tradeable shares in the B-class structure, which enables growers to cash in their money by selling their shares to someone else. That is fine if they sell the shares to another wheat grower, 
 because you still have a corporate model owned and run by growers, which was always the objective, but what if the shares are sold to someone who is not a grower? What if the shares are sold, for instance, to an AMP or a National Mutual that thinks it is a good idea to have an investment in the wheat industry, as will certainly happen?
That leads you to the point where you have emerging a conflict of interest, because if you are a shareholder as a grower what you are seeking to do out of this whole exercise is to maximise your return as a grower; you want the highest wheat price you can get. If you are an investor of money into the corporate structure, you want the best return you can get on the finance you are providing to the structure. The only way that the structure can pay a better dividend to the people who provide the finance is by paying the grower a lesser price for the wheat. It is an essential conflict of interest that cannot be walked away from, no matter how you try to set it up, even with the conflict of interest paragraph in the bill, which states:
Company B will be required to pay for wheat and it is obliged to be managed with the objective of maximising the net return to growers who sell wheat into the pools.
In other words, to overcome this potential conflict of interest, the bill sets up in the memorandum of understanding a direction so that everybody who invests money in shares knows that the objective is to provide the growers with the maximum return. The government well understands that the more growers there are who take their money out the more institutions are going to hold shares that are in direct conflict with the growers' return versus the institutional investors' return.
What is emerging from the Western Australian growers and, as I have now had confirmed, the New South Wales growers is that they want time to rethink an alternative model which sets up the grower ownership and control separate from the money, and the wheat industry fund money becomes a financial resource. There are other ways of dealing with this. I make it very clear that I am very happy with that part of the arrangement where 
 the company administers the single desk. I am not all that enthusiastic about the review of those arrangements under competition policy in the year 2000 which is prescribed. I am an unabashed supporter of the wheat single desk, and I will not be doing anything to pull that apart. This is not a `no ifs and no buts promise but forget about it' like sugar tariffs and things like that. Let us not get too sexy about some of these things. I am saying very clearly that I am an unabashed supporter of cooperative operations and cooperative national marketing structures. So the single desk is no problem, and having a grower corporate model managing the single desk is no problem.
What has changed between 1989 when the WIF was established and now is that there is now a huge pool of capital available in Australia in the form of the superannuation funds and other equity investments. Whereas before the wheat industry had to borrow offshore to find capital—because Australia had such a deficiency of capital, there was a high interest rate regime when all this was established—it was a wise decision at the time to say that the growers would need to protect their debt to equity ratio when they formed their own company by having a capital base established. That is what we did and that is what they have contributed to.
However, the situation has changed in the last nine years. There is now a substantial capital pool in Australia and there are people like Mortimer and Greiner wanting to put together the capital pool to underwrite the whole structure. The growers could all have their money back tomorrow because it is no longer necessary. This makes it quite possible to have an alternative structure which manages the single desk, manages the pools and gives all growers equal representation but does not have to find a convoluted way of tying the money into the corporate model.
That is the essential difference I am putting forward, and I hope the government members will listen to the wheat constituency which, as late as last week, has taken some very considered professional advice from people who have been involved in setting up modern corporate cooperatives. In fact, one of the 
 advisers to the Western Australian growers, when talking this through with me, was quite surprised to find that I understood this exactly as he did. The reason for that is that a considerable part of my background before coming into parliament was in the cooperative movement, and I understand what you can do with these things. I see the success that the dairy industry has had with a couple of its models, and this particular consultant has actually helped the dairy industry do exactly what the wheat industry now has the chance to do.
What I am saying to the government is that the minister has always been wrong to tell us, as he constantly has, that he had the support of the industry. What he has had is the industry squabbling with each other. We have had the New South Wales growers giving it away because they thought everybody else wanted to go in another direction. One lot has been played off against the other. The Western Australian growers have stuck to their guns. They now have a situation where they are all rethinking this, for the reasons that I have now put forward. There is nothing very spectacular about accepting my proposal. To defer the implementation of this for 12 months to allow the growers to consider this model is no big deal. If I can draw a parallel, only a month or so ago the minister announced that, because of the change to the market situation in Asia and therefore further perceived difficulties for the wool stockpile, the government had decided that the handover date of the wool stockpile was being extended. My response to that was that it was a good policy decision. The circumstances have changed and it made sense to extend the government underwriting of the wool stockpile, because we are going to have to manage the industry through changed circumstances.
Here I would say that for different reasons the circumstances have changed. The WIF is not the necessary capital underwriting of the wheat industry that we perceived it would be in 1989. The situation has changed and the wheat industry could raise the capital anywhere, because it is a sensible and sound investment, as people like Mortimer and Greiner well understand. I have got to say— 
and I do not say this to in any way say, `Aren't I smart?'—that when Mortimer and Greiner came to the government and the wool industry six months ago and said, `What about letting us, on behalf of the private sector, provide the capital and move in and buy the stockpile and remove from everybody the onus of having to manage the stockpile in wool?', the collective answer was, `Oh no, we can't do that.' Of course, now we have actually had to defer the arrangements because the situation has deteriorated. Had people with a bit of understanding and vision about this stuff actually embraced what was a very sound recommendation, the fact that the circumstances have changed would not be the problem of the government, it would be the problem of the private sector.
There is significant discontent in the wheat industry, as was shown when the first tranche came through. The government majority on the Senate committee went back to the minister and said, `Look, we don't think you have got this right. We will go along with it under sufferance, but we don't think you have got it right and we've got a lot of concerns about it.' Now, that momentum has built—for exactly the reasons I have outlined. I think the government should consider giving support to my proposal to defer those arrangements. As I say, given that only a month or so ago the government deferred the arrangements for the wool industry and the underwriting of its stockpile, it is no big deal to do that.
I go to a couple of other issues. On the conflict of interest paragraph within the bill, if it is decided to defeat my proposal, if in the Senate the government is able to secure support for the passage of the legislation, all I am saying is that in five years time we are all going to have to come along and fix this up again because there will be a significant number of wheat growers who will take the opportunity to withdraw their capital. They will be replaced by the Mortimers and Greiners of this world who want to be in there underwriting the wheat fund. By definition, no matter what you have in the memorandum or articles, there will be that conflict of interest and it will have to be resolved, or our next complaint will be that the growers 
 have lost control of their own operation. My view of this is that, if we are going to have to fix it in five years time, let us get it right now.
I am not sure where the government is on the question of capital gains in the wheat industry fund. Just to explain briefly, the situation there is that the grower contributions are, as I recall it, in the order of $350 million or $400 million. The fund has actually made a capital gain over time and sits in the order of $550 million now. I apologise to the House if those figures are not spotlessly correct, but it is something of that order. I know that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has told the industry that he regards the capital gain that has been made on those contributions as taxable under the capital gains tax when it is realised in the hands of the industry. I know that the industry was requesting that the government clarify its position about this. I am not sure if there has been an answer to that yet. I have not heard of there being an answer to it, so I suppose the industry is still waiting. But I have to say that I find it a bit rough, because these growers were made by the government of the day to contribute to this WIF and they could at any time have invested that money elsewhere.
—Not by us.
—Of course it was the former Labor government that required them to invest in the WIF. I do not have any problems with that. But we are not the ones who have suddenly decided that it is capital gains taxable. You have come into office, and you guys from the National Party are supposed to be the farmers' friends. That is why these people find themselves in such a dilemma with you. No-one ever talked about them paying capital gains tax on the gain in the WIF, and then all of a sudden your Treasurer has let them know that they are up for $60 million or $70 million worth of capital gain when they realise that profit.
It was a compulsory contribution to a fund. Had they made those contributions elsewhere and raised the funds in some other way, they would have been able to make all sorts of structural arrangements, the way everybody does, to minimise their capital gains contribution. But they have no choice with this very 
 late announcement by the government. The government has to deal with this. It is not reasonable to just tell these people, `This is the structure you are going to have and, by the way, you are going to have to pay capital gains tax on the gains it has made.' The growers' support for the structure at the time was conditional on a satisfactory answer from the government on this question. It has not been received, as far as I know.
Members of the government will find, as they go to check the veracity of what I have said in the House today, that as late as last week significant bodies were rethinking their position now that they have come to understand two things: they have seen a deferment in the wool industry, so they know it is possible to have a deferment; and they have come to better understand the inevitable conflict of interest and, as it is no longer necessary to have their own capital base to underwrite the grower corporate model, why can we not consider the model that has been hugely successful in the dairy industry? Those matters are coming to the fore now. Everybody involved should give the industry a chance to rethink its position. The following amendment gives effect to deferring for one year the implementation of the arrangements under this bill to allow the industry representatives to look at alternative arrangements and be fully satisfied about those arrangements before they are finally enacted. I move:
That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
""the House calls for the enactment of the proposals to be deferred for one year and the existing arrangements extended for this period so that further consideration can be given by industry representatives to the best arrangements for the industry and so that all parties can be fully satisfied about those arrangements before they are finally enacted"":
—Is the amendment seconded?
—I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.
Sitting suspended from 6.26 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.",REPS,<title>WHEAT MARKETING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,1998-06-01,"—As the member for O'Connor, I represent some 
 4,800 wheat grower locations, the largest by nearly 1,000 of any electorate in Australia. These locations produce 40 per cent of Australia's wheat and approximately 60 per cent of Australia's wheat export. It is wheat exports which are covered by this legislation under the Commonwealth's export power. The domestic wheat market is deregulated and represents an excellent alternative to wheat producers in the high population states, where domestic consumption represents a high, if not the total, percentage of local wheat production. The WA domestic market, by comparison, is approximately three per cent of WA wheat production. My constituents are therefore totally vulnerable to any flaws that might exist in the performance of this legislation in terms of the protection they deserve.
This legislation is unique in that, for the first time in my recollection, a government has chosen to give an independent commercial entity an unconditional monopoly to sell and export an entire commodity produced within Australia. It is not unique in the terms of there being an export monopoly for wheat, as this has existed for decades through a fully government controlled statutory authority called the Australian Wheat Board. However, that authority was subject fully to government legislation and ministerial control. Clearly, the commercial entities that have been created in this legislation and some earlier legislation associated with this bill are not subject to such government control. Normally in the commercial sector the discipline that guarantees performance is the marketplace. As an agent selling commodities your client base simply walks away to competitors if the returns you achieve for them are below those provided by other competitors.
Wheat growers who, by an accident of geography, are locked into export have no such choice under this legislation. They must sell their wheat through the privatised Australian Wheat Board. Wheat growers in my electorate continue to support the concept of an export monopoly. They are, however, deeply concerned that the structures that this and previous legislation provide afford them inadequate protection both in terms of the returns on their pooling of export wheat, in 
 terms of administrative charges and in terms of their long-term control of this company, which I now choose to call AWB Inc.
The suggestion is that, because wheat growers are the sole shareholders under what is to be termed an A-class shareholding, and as they are the sole shareholders who will be able to elect the board of directors of AWB Inc, their control is ultimate. It is equally logical to argue that the shareholders of BHP had total control over that company's board when it decided to purchase Magma Copper in the United States. The shareholders of BHP can sell—and have sold—their shares to demonstrate their dissatisfaction with the performance of the board, resulting in the resignation of senior officials and board members on some occasions.
Nevertheless, in the case of AWB Inc there is yet to be published AWB Inc's memorandum of articles of association. However, I am reliably informed that they will prescribe the board membership in terms of the qualifications that its members should have. Many of those board members will not be farmers and will not be shareholders of AWB Inc. The period of their appointment is unknown but could be three to five years, and wheat growers will have no day-to-day influence during that period. Unlike politics, it is also of little interest to many professional directors as to whether they are popular with the shareholders or not. The memorandum of articles of association will also provide for a form of preselection of directors and require an independent nominee to obtain 100 signatures from A-class shareholders before they are eligible to stand for election. This is a very substantial burden obviously designed to deter such attempts to join the board. The whole process, consequently, will provide almost dictatorial influence to the chief executive of AWB Inc.
As I read the arrangements, the chief executive will be involved in preselecting his or her own board of directors. This is called an election slate, and it is all there hidden away in the documents that are quite frequently hard to get your hands on. If you are going to be the chief executive and you want to put up your own salary and you have already 
 preselected your board, the chances are that your salary will go up. It is also intended to convert the compulsory farmer levy called the wheat industry fund into B-class shares, the holders of which will also have a right to elect some directors at a later date. These shares are also expected to pay a dividend and, at a later date, be traded upon the Australian Stock Exchange.
The compulsory wheat industry fund, at two per cent of farm gate value for wheat, has represented a significant financial burden for many wheat growers, actually exceeding their net profit in some cases. Many farmers in my electorate are borrowing money to plant crops and/or are unable to upgrade essential farm machinery whilst having wheat industry fund reserves in excess of $100,000. The only way they can recover their funds is to sell their B-class shares on the Australian Stock Exchange after the projected listing.
There will be many other reasons, including the misfortune of family breakdown or drought, that will require the sale of these shares in the future. This raises two issues. Firstly, and unlike the current situation where the Australian Wheat Board operates as a statutory authority and passes on the full benefit of any discounts that it can obtain on interest and those sorts of things, such farmers will actually be charged financial service fees to generate dividends for the B-class shareholders.
`B' gets a lot of mention in this particular legislation. The proposal is that there will be a company A, a company B and a company C. Company A is to be the provider of financial services and, as such, will pay dividends to B-class shareholders. Company B is to be the company charged with selling export wheat and company A will be entitled to deal on the domestic market.
The interesting thing is that the only way that company A can earn money is to lend it to company B. The money it will lend in the first instance is wheat industry fund money. In other words, farmers will be paying interest on their own money. That, in itself, is all right if they join in and receive dividends on their wheat industry fund or B-class shares, but if for reasons beyond their control they 
 are forced to sell those shares they will be taxed on their performance not only at the interest charges that are incurred by company A but with an additional premium to ensure that a dividend can be paid and, of course, the operating expenses of the new AWB Inc. bureaucracy can be met. Obviously, they will no longer receive any offsetting dividend if they sell their shares.
The second problem relates to the purchasers of their shares. These could be competitors to AWB Inc, other major grain traders, family style investors or large financial institutions, who of course are purchasing these shares for the financial return that will be paid. Family investors will, along with these other investors, automatically assume a proprietary interest in the dominant asset of AWB Inc.—that is, the government granted monopoly.
Notwithstanding the assurances that might be given in this place, the reality is that people will know that this investment will only make money while it retains a monopoly over export of grain throughout Australia. This legislation guarantees this monopoly to AWB Inc. for five years; it does not, however, terminate that right at that point in time. It will require new legislation to discontinue that monopoly. At this stage of the game, there could be good reason why that should not continue.
I draw the attention of the House to the circumstances that could arise if wheat growers do not wish that monopoly right to continue in the hands of AWB Inc. I make the point that, over history, the AWB has been perceived as the source of the guaranteed minimum price, the single desk in all these things, but in fact it was just the body that delivered those gifts from government. The reality is that it is now going to be a private company and it is only one of probably a dozen Australian private companies that could manage an export monopoly. In your state, Madam Deputy Speaker Kelly, a similar situation arises where the company CSR delivers services to the Queensland Sugar Corporation, but that does not have the arrangements that are being proposed here.
Quite clearly, those outside the wheat industry who have purchased shares and received dividends arising from the operations of the monopoly would object strenuously to any action by the parliament to remove this monopoly in the future. The fact that only four members—and only one, me, from the government—have decided to speak on this legislation is evidence of the number of members who might support the wheat growers' request in the future. The rest, however, would be quick to respond to the demands of their investor constituents, who could be spread all over Australia, in demanding the retention of the AWB Inc. monopoly which generates their dividends but which was disadvantageous to wheat growers. The potential for this situation to arise is of great concern to me.
The solution to all the issues I have identified is to ensure that this legislation in its own right ensures that the people it captivates do have adequate protection to receive adequate returns for the products they produce. The vehicle available for this purpose in the legislation is called the Wheat Export Authority, WEA.
I welcome the amendments which increase wheat grower participation on the board of this body, particularly the positions which will be allocated to those states who contribute the most to export wheat. However, in requesting this increased representation, both Senator Crane from Western Australia and I did so in the context that the powers of the WEA should be better defined so that its board could be effective in protecting the interests of those wheat growers who are obliged to sell their grain through AWB Inc. In this regard, I believe that the WEA should be the agent for the government in issuing all export licences, including this five-year monopoly, and as such be able to do so by adding conditions—for instance, as to the level of net return based on international evidence that AWB Inc. would return each year to wheat growers.
I find it ludicrous that the government agency empowered to, as the legislation says, `control the export of wheat' must also knuckle its forehead to AWB Inc. If, for 
 reasons of wheat grower benefit, it wished to license the export of a quantity of wheat larger than one container, it actually has to get their written permission. The body that the legislation says is controlling the export of wheat has to go to the person who has the export monopoly and say, `Can I please send more than one container of wheat out of the country or let somebody else do it because there is a benefit to the wheat industry in so doing?' That is in clause 11 of the amending bill, dealing with subsection 57(3) of the original legislation.
Fortunately, this requirement does cease on or after 1 July 2004. At that point the WEA will have more powers as to whom it licenses. Similarly, the WEA appears to have no power to include or exempt certain wheat varieties such as durum from the monopoly. The issue of the rights of wheat growers who produce certain varieties that the AWB refuses to export is unresolved. I trust the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) will tell the parliament how such growers might service available niche export markets for bulk exports, not just single container loads or bags. Clearly, in this situation the WEA should be able to issue an export consent without the written approval of AWB Inc. Put simply, it has happened in the past: the Wheat Board says it does not want to handle certain varieties of wheat, and if you go out and get your own market for it you just simply cannot get it out of the country.
My other area of concern relates to the method of electing board members to the Grains Council of Australia, the GCA. At present, only nominees who have established farmer organisations can be members, which disenfranchises all non-members of those organisations, including many who simply cannot afford the cost of membership of those farmer organisations, which frequently runs to thousands of dollars. The Wool Council has addressed this issue recently by creating three positions to be elected by plebiscite of all wool growers, irrespective of their connections with farmer organisations; and considering the importance of the GCA and the operation of this bill, soon to become an act, 
 I consider they should undertake a similar process at the GCA.
Due to my continued representations the government has, at the 11th hour, included clause (1)(b) under the heading of powers and functions of the WEA, as a further amendment. That does add somewhat to the responsibilities and the powers of the Wheat Export Authority. The original bill said:
The Authority has the following functions:
(a) to control the export of wheat from Australia;
(b) to monitor nominated company B's performance—
that is the exporting company's performance, and this is the new bit—
in relation to the export of wheat and to examine and report on the benefits to growers that result from that performance.
That at least makes it clear to the WEA that they have a responsibility to report to the parliament. That is the limit of their power. This amendment, whilst clearly charging the WEA to conduct an appropriate supervisory role, still restricts its powers to one of persuasion by reporting its concerns to the government. Based on my long experience in this place and the opportunity for reverse lobbying by the executive of AWB Inc. and its non-wheat growing shareholders of the future, I am not confident of an appropriate government response to any report arising from the WEA. I have already pointed out that there are nine wheat growing electorates in Australia where the wheat growing locations exceed 1,000. That is about the extent of their influence in this place.
If AWB Inc. is constantly underperforming in the international marketplace, then wheat growers will be the only losers, as they will continue to pay all the administrative and financial charges that the B-class shareholders and the AWE Inc. bureaucracy demands. I hope my concerns are never realised. However, just as I have promoted them in party forums, I would be wrong not to put them on the record today.
I apologise to my constituents for my failure to achieve more, and personally believe their future would be more stable if they elected to undertake their own statewide 
 marketing arrangements in WA through a WA grain pool-Cooperative Bulk Handling consortium. However, I doubt this initiative will be taken and, once this bill passes both houses, it would be very difficult as, were the federal government to approve this arrangement in the future, it clearly would be sued for damages by AWB Inc. for removing its five-year monopoly rights. That is another aspect of this legislation.
The reality is that, notwithstanding how poorly AWB Inc. performs, they would argue that they were not and, just as we have discovered with mobile phones, this parliament is locked into a five-year agreement by its own legislation, not by some contract which has conditions put upon it. I am not happy with it, but I have promised my party room not to oppose this legislation, more particularly because the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) did at least assist me with that additional amendment. I tend to agree that there is also no rush. Quite clearly, the AWB as a statutory authority, with or without a loan guarantee, could conduct the business it conducts today. But we will just have to wait and see how all this goes. I repeat: I am not opposing the legislation but I am not at all happy with it.",REPS,<title>WHEAT MARKETING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,1998-06-01,"—The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) has put down his comments on the bill—and in a fair way he has some serious problems with its make-up and has listed those for the parliament to hear—but he says he is going to follow the party line. I think there are a lot of wheat growers in Australia who have serious problems with this Wheat Marketing Legislation Amendment Bill 1998 .
This bill has quite a long history and it is linked to the ongoing development of the Australian Wheat Board, which came about to provide some sort of security during difficult times for wheat growers many years ago. But in making sure that there was a single desk, or one voice, to speak for the growers in export negotiations, it has taken on the role of a monopoly. It seems that agricultural marketing boards were initially established in the early 1900s. Before their advent there is little doubt that private traders and users underpaid 
 growers for their commodities. In an article recently in the Australian Financial Review, Stephen Wyatt revealed that collusive buying practices, particularly by flour millers, triggered the move towards boards. He went on to say that the Marketing of Primary Products Act 1927 set up marketing controls to assist farmers who were perceived to be in a weak bargaining position compared with the buyers of their crops. Farmers were isolated. They did not know what price their produce was trading at in the world market or indeed in the domestic market centre. There was no general legislation to prevent collusive market practice.
The Australian Wheat Board was established in 1948 and has existed continuously since then. Its principal function is to control the export and overseas marketing of Australian wheat. Its other functions include domestic trading in wheat and export—but not control—and trade in other grains. Times have changed since its inception, of course. The Trade Practices Act was introduced in 1974, and was extended and then strengthened by the Competition Policy and Reform Act in 1995. Farmers are better informed and have access to modern communications—telephones, faxes, computers and now the Internet—even to the extent of having chat lines to debate the issue of the current changes to the Wheat Board. In fact, their chat is recorded on the home page of the Wheat Board and makes interesting reading for those of us who are interested in getting that up.
One at least gets a feeling about the thoughts and aspirations of some of our farm comrades out there. As might be expected, a lot of the discussion is about whether or not it is raining in different parts of Australia. There are also lots of information workshops, and there is excellent potential for passing on information on these sorts of issues. But the discussion also gives a clue about how farmers are thinking on the Wheat Board changes. There does seem to be some concern amongst growers about the structure of the Wheat Board as to whether or not it will satisfy their needs with regard to long-term grower control. The member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), our shadow minister for primary 
 industries, spoke about this earlier today in this debate. In fact, there is a conflict of interest in the dual class share structure which the honourable member for O'Connor mentioned earlier.
Some growers see that the existing `grower corporate model' structure contains a conflict between the interests of growers, A-class shareholders, and the interests of investors, B-class shareholders. The growers' interests will be subordinate to those of the investors. As the investors will seek to get the highest return and the highest dividends, it would be in their interests to ensure that the farm gate price is as low as possible. So that is a possibility in the future. The growers' shares will be subsidised by those of the investors. Therefore, if there is some suggestion that the board be privatised, those interests could well be taken	offshore and then there would be no control over the price of wheat at all.
I found Mr Wyatt's explanation quite interesting in this regard: there are two sides to any monopoly. It can be a buying or a selling monopoly.	Marketing boards in Australia generally have both sides of the game sown up. Growers have to sell to the board—termed `vesting' for the buying side of the monopoly—and the board is the only seller of the commodity, both domestically and internationally.
In 1989, changes began to occur when the Wheat Board deregulated the Australian domestic wheat market. This set a blueprint for the other boards to give up domestic buying monopolies but retain the international ones; the idea being to trade off control over the domestic market in order to keep control of the export market. It is said that the review assumes that export monopolies actually confer a net benefit on Australia and that an export monopoly does not impact on the domestic market. But that is not, in fact, true. It is the export monopolist that sets up the domestic market. The criticism is that it is a half-hearted attempt to free up the domestic market, but it does not work. More and more people are reaching that conclusion. The reason given for this is that if the monopoly exporter controls the sale of the vast majority of that commodity in the export market, then 
 it must also control the price of that commodity in the market from which the commodity originates. The major seller must be the major buyer. Other buyers will just price against the major. This is what the Australian Wheat Board do: they set the tone for the market.
There needs to be some way of making sure that there is grower control in the day-to-day decision making process. It seems that the interests of growers and investors are impossible to reconcile and that ultimately the decision making processes will develop a bias in favour of the principal providers of the capital—namely, the B-class shareholders or investors.
No amount of refining or redrafting of the memorandum of the articles of association will provide an adequate solution to this conflict of interest as, at the end of the day, it is not possible to serve two masters. The opposition would prefer to see a different organisation. We would rather see a well structured corporation adopting modern cooperative principles which not only would have a better chance of surviving the single desk review process—which I would certainly support—but also would have better prospects of commercial success and of satisfying grower requirements in a deregulated market. In a deregulated market a cooperative wheat exporting enterprise could be sustained by reason of the strong grower loyalty that could evolve out of grower ownership and control. The member for Burke emphasised the opposition's position on this.
I think the amendment to stand aside this legislation for one year so that we can look at this and so that the growers can chat more through the Internet, in meetings and by coming together to workshop this issue is a fine amendment. Everything aside, I think it should be taken on board. The government should take on board what the honourable member for O'Connor said. I think he was very sincere in what he said. He represents a considerable number of wheat growers. Twelve months deferral of this bill would not really be of concern. That is what is really needed at this time. I support the bill being deferred and will certainly do that when it 
 comes to the vote. I ask the government to extend the existing WIF credit guarantees for a further 12 months, as has been suggested in my colleague's amendment. I am sure the many people on the other side of the House who have considered this would like to support the amendment when it comes to the vote.",REPS,<title>WHEAT MARKETING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Anderson, John, MP",NP,1998-06-01,"—Today is an important occasion for Australia's wheat industry. It is important because the passage of this legislation, the Wheat Marketing Legislation Amendment Bill 1998 , will allow Australia's wheat growers to take control of their own destiny. The development of the new commercial arrangements has been a long and complex process and has involved the grains industry in a very extensive and comprehensive way right throughout. There have been some very considerable challenges and hundreds of difficult issues to address, but industry consensus was reached earlier this year with the unanimous support of the Grains Council of Australia for the grower corporate model.
I would like to pay credit to the many grains industry leaders at all levels who have contributed to the achievement of a final model. In particular, I wish to mention the work of the past two presidents of the Grains Council of Australia, Jeff Arney and Brendan Stewart. Jeff Arney guided the industry through a difficult and challenging period, and his good nature and diplomacy shone throughout. Brendan Stewart, who is a young Queenslander, has and is displaying great strength, maturity and leadership to the industry. I have no doubt that he will have a great role in the future of rural Australia.
I also wish to pay credit to the staff of the Grains Council for their tireless efforts, to the Australian Wheat Board, to its legal and commercial advisers, and to the hardworking people from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy who, along with other members of the Grains Council, have made an enormous contribution to the ongoing development of a model for the future of this great industry. 
I would like to comment on the remarks made by one participant in this debate, the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), both in the media and in this place. He rightly supported the commercialisation of the Australian Wheat Board, particularly when he addressed this matter in this chamber the first time around, but he has since presented information that is quite simply factually incorrect. Likewise, he has put forward arguments in his criticism of the grower corporate model which are not tenable.
He has raised concerns, for example, over an apparent conflict between wheat grower and shareholder interests. I can assure the honourable member that the wheat industry would not have unanimously supported the agreed arrangements if this conflict existed. Throughout the memorandum and articles of association of the new Australian Wheat Board there are many requirements for the interests of wheat growers to be held foremost. The primary object of the Australian Wheat Board effectively will be to undertake grain trading to maximise net returns to growers.
I should also address the member for Burke's assertion that the industry would prefer a cooperative or composite arrangement. The Grains Council of Australia released a media statement on 20 May which categorically rejected any support for a composite alternative. There were very good reasons for the Grain Council's rejection of a composite alternative, and I am very surprised indeed that the member for Burke has nailed his colours to the mast of a proposal which is not supported by the majority of the industry and which would in fact on any objective analysis fall far short of optimal outcomes.
The model being proposed, and apparently being supported by the member for Burke, would cost wheat growers many millions of dollars of their hard earned investments.
—Rubbish!
—With great respect, since you interject, I simply say to you that I see no evidence that you have examined this matter in any detail at all and I cannot see that you really have a valuable contribution to make to this debate.
Under this grower corporate model, the B-class shares of a company will be listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, thereby allowing growers to access their equity at its maximum value, if they so choose. Some growers personally will have $100,000 or $200,000, and possibly even more, in equity, but under the composite type proposal alluded to by the member for Burke wheat growers' equity value would be much less than under the grower corporate model approach. I strongly contend that, given that this is growers' money—they have been contributing to it ever since 1989—they ought to be able to make the choice to access their money if and when they wish without restriction and without devaluation, which is the effective outcome of a composite model or the cooperative model.
There are a number of examples which I could put forward to reinforce why growers should be able to make their own financial choices. Firstly, and not an uncommon situation, a grower might have, for example, $100,000 tied up in the wheat industry fund in equity, yet at the same time find himself in a situation where he has to borrow $100,000 to put his crop in. Seasons are often irregular in the bush. People do need access to that sort of equity from time to time. It would be an absurdity if it were not able to be freely accessed.
The grower ought to be able to make the choice of what to do with his or her own money. The grower corporate model will allow the wheat grower to sell some or all of his or her shares to gain premium value for those shares and to reinvest in his or her farm business or family or elsewhere. If growers do this under the model that the government and the working party and the grains industry have negotiated, they will not lose control of the AWB.
Another example is the case of a wheat grower having a considerable investment in AWB shares and wanting to purchase the property next door when it comes up for sale. It might be the only chance the farmer has to expand his or her wheat growing operation so as to achieve, for example, a greater economy of scale. He or she might need the money in 
 a hurry. Alternatively, a grower may have three teenage children who are about to enter boarding school or university and may, as a result, find short-term financial demands on the family can best be met by accessing their investment in WIF.
The ability of the farmer to access part or all of his or her wheat industry fund equity at its maximum value may very well be a determining factor in whether he or she is able to secure the best advantages for the family, the children or whatever it happens to be. Alternatively, the farmer may wish to reinvest the money off-farm to diversify the family security to allow the farm business to better withstand commodity price fluctuation—something we would support. But the proposal from the member for Burke, it must be clearly understood, would diminish those opportunities.
The coalition government supports the right of wheat growers to make the decisions which affect their own industry and their own finances, and I believe very strongly that, since we live in a free country, that is therefore the only appropriate way to go. Discounting the worth of grower equity from its maximum value does not make commercial sense. It can be arranged in a way that does not cost growers control over their own industry. I repeat the point I made earlier: the growers and the working party would not have agreed to a model which compromised them in this regard.
In my view, there is a real question here not only of commercial commonsense but also of equity to wheat growers and their families. I believe that the very-late-in-the-piece opposition that has emerged from one or two opposite demonstrates not only a lack of understanding of this model and what is being proposed but also a lack of concern for rural people.
The opposition spokesman has stated that he believes the government should extend the underwriting of first advance payments for an extra year, and I wonder whether in fact that would be his policy going into the next election. I certainly wonder whether it would be the Labor Party's policy because it has not been up until today.
Back in 1989 the then Labor government introduced the levy for the wheat industry fund to `generate a capital base for financing the AWB's marketing activities'. When the government guarantee expires next year, the fund will have over $600 million in it. It has been agreed by the AWB, independent financial consultants and the grains industry that that is more than enough for underwriting purposes, which begs the question: why on earth would the member for Burke want to extend the government guarantee when the industry has more than sufficient to do the job? Why on earth—in terms of other questions that might be asked—would he want the AWB to go into next year's national competition policy review as a far from fully commercial operation which is under the financial and paternal wing of government and unable to demonstrate a separation of the regulatory and commercial aspects of the export monopoly?
Surely he knows—at least I hope he knows—that under these circumstances the recommendation from the national competition policy review is likely to be less favourable to the single desk arrangements of the AWB. Growers have made it absolutely plain throughout this whole process that their prime objective is to secure the future of the single desk. They ought to remember that the last Labor minister for primary industries was plainly less than committed to that single desk and, indeed, was caught quite red-handed a couple of times committing himself to the single desk to growers but telling other people in the industry that it would shortly go. Those who think that playing politics with this might somehow advance their interest might just remember that. It needs to be very clearly put on the table that, if Labor are going to play cheap politics with this, they will put me in a position where I will be telling Australia's 50,000 or so wheat growers that they are playing lightly with their No. 1 objective, which is the retention of the single desk.
I want to return to something I alluded to a moment ago, and that is to point out that the proposal discussed by the member for Burke is also commercially inferior to the grower corporate model. The composite type 
 model delivers a lower capital liquidity, and this would be reflected in the value of the company as a whole. When the company went to borrow its annual funding requirement of between $3 billion and $4 billion—$3,000 million to $4,000 million—financial institutions lending the money would not look positively at those cooperative arrangements that are now being thrown around by the member for Burke. Because the B-class shares are redeemable, they would not be treated as permanent capital by lenders, and this would be reflected in the repayment conditions and risk margins attached to any deal—that is to say, the cost would be reflected in the pool price of wheat.
A great deal of what has been discussed and negotiated and worked through time and time again between the working party and the consultants is how to maximise the pool price of wheat. It must be understood that that is one of the primary objectives—a very understandable primary objective—of the industry in this whole debate, and yet again that appears to be simply not understood by those opposite.
To put that in very simple words: were we to go along with the composite model that a minority are still pursuing, the value of the wheat growers' company would be reduced. The value of the capital base of AWB would be lower—that is to say, the value of each wheat grower's personal equity would be reduced. The ability of the company to maintain adequate first payments could well be compromised and would certainly not be maximised. The ability of the company to deliver the most optimal wheat prices to growers would almost certainly be compromised and most certainly would not be maximised. Furthermore, the composite model is structured in such a way that it would be more difficult to pass the national competition policy review.
I again emphasise that the member for Burke has demonstrated today and over the last few days that he does not have an understanding of the wheat industry restructure. He does not have a compassionate view towards the real needs and desires of farmers. He apparently does not respect the right of 
 farmers to unfettered access to their personal investment, which is rightfully theirs and which the coalition, and I in particular, have been very keen to emphasise in recent years.
—They put money into the fund.
—That is right—two per cent every year creamed off since Kerin was minister.
—Read my speech and you will understand it. I understand it better than you do. Tell them about the capital gains tax and the $60 million.
—You go back and have a look at the transcript of what the Chairman of the Grains Council of Australia said today. You do not understand the wheat industry. It is perfectly obvious that you do not understand this industry.
—Talk about diminishing their returns.
—You have just demonstrated again that you do not understand it. They only pay capital gains tax. They do not pay capital gains tax unless they sell their shares.
—They hear you talking about maintaining the value of their shares. If they sell their shares you are going to capital gains tax them. What a terrible thing to do to them.
—It is a perfectly fair and legitimate outcome.
Mr O'Keefe interjecting—
—You have just demonstrated it again. Go and read your words carefully tomorrow. You do not understand what you are talking about.
—I know exactly what you have done.
—You do not. You obviously do not; your words condemn you. I am sorry to have to say to you that you have just demonstrated that you do not understand how this works. Until you do I suggest—
—Tell me again. Of course I understand. 
—You do not; it is as simple as that.
—Tell me how they avoid capital gains tax.
—By not selling their shares.
—So you are talking about giving a grower back his money and now you are saying that if he doesn't sell his shares and doesn't take his money then he will not have to pay CGT. If he takes his money he is up for CGT.
—If he sells his shares. See, you do not understand. There is no tax on conversion. Are you still with me?
—Once he sells his shares.
—If he chooses not to sell his shares then he will pay no capital gains tax. If he chooses to sell his shares, he has a very fair and equitable set of arrangements in place.
—What a terrible rip-off—compulsory contributions.
—That is not a rip-off. I challenge you to commit yourself to a more generous arrangement as an alternative government.
—You've creamed them, mate. I understand you.
—No, that is wrong. The people I have met and everyone that my leader, Mr Fischer, has met have had this explained to them and they have said, as wheat growers, they accept that it is entirely fair.
—That is not what they say to us.
—I will be very interested to see whether you can extract a more generous arrangement and then I will hold you to it, if you are ever to be in government, because what they are having put to them is a very fair and generous arrangement.
Mr O'Keefe interjecting—
—Oh, no, we have heard it all. You have heard what the Grains Council had to say about you today. The Grains Council made it quite obvious what they 
 believe. You do not understand what you are talking about.
—You have demonstrated you don't understand what I'm talking about.
—No, I do not understand what you are talking about because it is gobbledegook. You are putting the industry's future at risk.
—No I'm not.
—Yes you are. You go and argue it with the Grains Council of Australia. The Grains Council understands full well that you are not in a situation to be able to contribute usefully to this debate because you have not followed it and you have not understood it.
The fact is that, after two years of comprehensive research, consultation and debate, the Grains Council of Australia, which is made up of senior representatives of each wheat growing state, including Western Australia, unanimously endorsed these arrangements only a matter of months ago. The unfortunate thing is that we are not getting an intelligent contribution to this debate from the member opposite. It really ought to be of great embarrassment to the Labor Party to have a spokesman who publicly makes statements like this—and this is quoted from a radio interview he did on ABC Radio last week:
A better way to do it is to separate the money from the corporate structure and simply have a corporate structure. Give the growers back their funds and allow them to form it into a coupon on a debt that is owed by the company.
When the managing director of the AWB goes to a financial institution to borrow $3-4 billion to purchase its wheat they'll ask him, `What are you borrowing this money against? What capital does your company have?' And the Wheat Board's answer will be—can you cop this—`I've got a cardboard box full of debt coupons.'
Good grief! But don't worry, Mr Bank Manager. They will say, `The member for Burke says it is okay because we need to separate the money from the corporate structure and we have done exactly what he told us to do.'
This issue is far too important for the opposition to play petty politics with. The member for Burke has demonstrated an extraordinarily confused misunderstanding of commerce and finance matters. On the ABC's Country Hour today it was reported that the member for Burke's views were met with `anger and disbelief' by the grains industry. Mr Brendan Stewart, the President of the Grains Council of Australia, said:
Mr O'Keefe shouldn't be playing politics with people's livelihoods.
I urge the House to support this legislation in full and the Senate to pass the bill without amendment, without delay. As a matter of urgency the industry needs to put in place the new arrangements so that it is in a position to maximise the interests of growers with a proven track record before the financial sector when it is due to take over control of its own affairs. That is precisely the outcome that the previous government was essentially working towards. For them now to jeopardise that would be the ultimate in hypocrisy and stupidity. It would be an injustice against a major Australian export industry.
	 Question put:
	 That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr O'Keefe's  amendment) stand part of the question.",REPS,<title>WHEAT MARKETING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Brereton, Laurie, MP",ALP,1998-06-01,"—The Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Bill 1998  will give effect to Australia's obligations under the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, the CTBT, and will provide a legislative basis for national implementation. I wish to make a few remarks tonight about this legislation before I turn my attention to the crisis arising from India's and Pakistan's nuclear tests.
This bill enjoys strong bipartisan support. The objective of the CTBT has been pursued by Australian governments for a very long time—that is, a total global ban on nuclear weapons tests and all other nuclear explosions in all environments and for all time. Australia was, of course, the site of 12 British nuclear tests at the Monte Bello Islands, Emu Field and Maralinga in the 1950s. These nuclear explosions and the many so-called `minor trials' have left enduring scars on our land and lingering health concerns for the thousands of Australian and British veterans who participated.
In 1963, Australia was one of the first non-nuclear weapon states to sign and ratify the partial test ban treaty banning nuclear tests in the atmosphere, in outer space and in the oceans. In the early 1970s Australia went on 
 to lead regional condemnation of France's nuclear tests in the South Pacific. Negotiation of the CTBT was a major diplomatic priority for Labor in government as part of our activist approach to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation issues. This approach was underpinned by both the goal of achieving a nuclear weapon free world and a hard-headed assessment of Australia's security interests. As DFAT's National interest statement on the CTBT rightly states:
An effective treaty is important to Australia's national security interests and for global security. In particular, Australia has a strong security interest in ensuring that nuclear weapons are not acquired by countries which could use them against Australia. The CTBT will act as a solid barrier to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and imposes severe constraints on the qualitative improvement of existing nuclear weapon designs. By furthering the twin goals of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, the CTBT strengthens the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which remains the cornerstone of international nuclear security arrangements, and hence Australia's security in this field.
In the 1980s and the early 1990s, Australia pushed long and hard to open negotiations for a CTBT in the conference on disarmament in Geneva. These negotiations eventually began in January 1994 and they continued until August 1996.
Australia was a central player in this process. Australia's technical experts helped develop the stringent CTBT verification regime. Our diplomats made key contributions to the text of the draft treaty, especially article 1 setting out the basic obligations of state parties never to carry out nuclear test explosions or any other nuclear explosion in any environment. Each party state further undertakes to refrain from causing, encouraging or in any way participating in the carrying out of any nuclear weapon test explosion. This is an Australian text, and it is at the very heart of the agreement.
In March 1996, on the eve of the last federal election, Australia played a vital role in pushing the conference on disarmament into the endgame of the negotiations by tabling a complete model treaty text as an aid to identifying the key remaining points of difference and ways for their resolution. Later, 
 when India withheld the consensus necessary for the conference on disarmament to transmit the draft treaty text to the UN General Assembly for endorsement, Australia took the treaty direct to the United Nations in New York, and an Australian-drafted resolution was adopted by an overwhelming majority of the General Assembly on 10 September 1996. Australia signed two weeks later, and passage of this CTBT bill is now required before ratification and national implementation can proceed. Australia is, after all, one of 44 countries designated in the treaty whose ratification is required for the CTBT to enter into force.
Clause 8 of the bill makes a person `who causes a nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion' guilty of an offence with a penalty of imprisonment for life. This clause implements the basic prohibition of the treaty. Clause 9 provides for the extraterritorial application of this offence. The CTBT does not explicitly define what constitutes a nuclear explosion; nor does the bill. This was a very difficult aspect of the CTBT negotiations, with much argument over the precise scope of the treaty; that is to say, whether or not the CTBT would ban so-called subcritical nuclear experiments. I do not see any advantage in reopening this issue in tonight's debate. In any case, the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty Act 1986 contains a definition of what constitutes a nuclear explosive device, which would be relevant to any argument about the precise activity prohibited by the new legislation.
The language contained in clause 8 of the CTBT bill is very similar to that used in the United Kingdom's Nuclear Explosions (Prohibition and Inspections) Act 1998. The opposition has been advised by DFAT that the legal definition of `causes a nuclear weapon test explosion' would extend to actions which facilitated or in any way assisted the carrying out of a nuclear test, even if the person in question did not actually push the button.
Consequently, the basic offence established by the legislation before us extends to cover any participation by an Australian citizen in a nuclear test conducted by another country. To take a hypothetical example, an Australian 
 citizen who participated in or otherwise assisted with the carrying out of a nuclear test by India or Pakistan would be guilty of an offence under this legislation. In any case, such a possibility—hopefully, a very remote possibility—is already covered by section 13 of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty Act 1986, which makes it an offence to do:
any act or thing to facilitate . . . testing by any person (including a foreign country) of a nuclear explosive device (whether inside or outside Australia).
That legislation provides for a penalty of up to 20 years imprisonment.
This bill empowers the Commonwealth to facilitate verification of compliance with the CTBT's provisions, including the establishment and operation of 21 Australian monitoring stations as part of the international network of more than 300 seismic and other monitoring facilities around the world. Australia's facilities will assist in the detection and identification of any nuclear explosion prohibited by the treaty. By virtue of Australia's geography, we will have the third largest number of monitoring facilities, after the United States and Russia. I repeat: we will be third only after the United States and Russia.
Australia is also under an obligation to allow the CTBT Organisation inspectors, pursuant to article IV of the treaty, to inspect any place in Australia or our external territories to resolve any questions concerning compliance with article I of the treaty. The bill provides comprehensive powers for compliance arrangements, including the right for inspectors to collect and remove samples and the right to undertake drilling. Access to facilities by inspectors for on-site inspections is by consent of the occupier or by warrant issued by a magistrate.
These provisions are modelled on those contained in other non-proliferation related legislation: the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty Act 1986, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 and the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994. Tonight's bill will continue Australia's practice of adhering to the highest standards of 
 compliance with international non-proliferation obligations.
As I mentioned earlier, the entry into force provisions of the CTBT, article XIV, provide that ratification by all 44 designated states is required before the treaty comes into operation. This list includes the five declared nuclear weapon states—the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia and China—and the three so-called threshold states: India, Pakistan and Israel. Of the 44 states listed in the entry into force provisions, India, Pakistan and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have not yet signed the CTBT. And as everyone knows, India and Pakistan have between them just conducted no fewer than 11 nuclear tests in the space of little more than two weeks—the most intense burst of nuclear testing since the lead-up to entry into force of the partial test ban treaty, all of 35 years ago. This is the worst break-out for 35 years.
Carried out in total defiance of the overwhelming international consensus against further nuclear testing, the actions of India and Pakistan have attracted strong condemnation, including from both sides of the political mainstream in this country. India's open declaration of a thermonuclear weapon capability and the declared intention of both India and Pakistan to proceed with weaponisation of their nuclear capabilities has sent the most appalling signal to other states interested in acquiring nuclear weapons.
It is a matter of record that I referred to India's nuclear tests as an outrageous act of nuclear bastardry. The same can be said of Pakistan's latest test, which appears to have been carried out for no better reason than that of levelling the nuclear test score with India.	All sides of politics in this country have called on India and Pakistan to join the global consensus against nuclear testing and to sign the CTBT without delay.
I earnestly hope that both India and Pakistan will soon see the absolute folly of their actions; though, for the moment at least, rabid and extreme nationalism appears to be the dominant theme of public expression in both New Delhi and Islamabad. India and Pakistan are no longer so-called nuclear threshold 
 states; they are now self-declared nuclear weapon states. But they should be accorded no respect and they should be accorded no status whatsoever. They should be treated for what they are—nuclear pariahs.
Tonight, I would like to draw attention to an important aspect of the situation in South Asia that has been largely submerged in the press coverage of the nuclear tests—that is, the acquisition by both India and Pakistan of ballistic missiles which, together with development of the nuclear warheads they will carry, introduce a new and highly destabilising element into the strategic equation in South Asia. Ballistic missiles are, of course, not new. It is more than half a century since the first long-range ballistic missile, the German V2, brought death and destruction to the city of London. Such weapons hold great attraction to countries eager to acquire symbols of military power and prestige and reliable delivery vehicles for weapons of mass destruction.
India's ballistic missiles are well known: the Prithvi, a relatively short-range missile but more than adequate to reach Islamabad; and the intermediate range Agni, long thought to be directed toward China. India now appears determined to arm both missiles with nuclear weapons to match Pakistan's new intermediate range missile, the Ghauri, which was tested last April. Indeed, although the nuclear intentions of the new Indian government were never much in doubt, Pakistan's missile tests last April may well have precipitated the timing of India's nuclear tests. Pakistan too has declared its intention to equip its new 1,100-kilometre range missile, probably developed with Chinese or North Korean assistance, with its own nuclear warhead.
We now face a situation where India and Pakistan will face each other with nuclear missile forces on high alert, ready at a moment's notice to respond to an attack or even a perceived threat of attack. With flight times to their likely targets of only a few minutes, there will be no time for second thoughts, no time for diplomacy and not even time for a telephone call to avert disaster. This is the new strategic balance in South Asia—a balance of two deadly adversaries, 
 both infected with the virus of extreme nationalism, locked in a longstanding territorial dispute and armed to the teeth with nuclear ballistic missiles, each only a brief flight from the other's capital. Unless the international community can take concerted action, not only to force India and Pakistan to desist from further nuclear tests but to stop the development of their ballistic missile forces, South Asia will move ever closer to the brink of absolute disaster.
Alongside the CTBT and the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, there is clearly an urgent need to strengthen multilateral constraints on the supply of ballistic missile technology. We need to significantly upgrade the missile technology control regime, the MTCR, the informal missile non-proliferation forum of which Australia has been a member for some years. The international community also needs to look very seriously at negotiating multilateral constraints on the testing and development of ballistic missiles. The United States and Russia have, of course, already concluded a number of bilateral agreements which in various ways limit their missile forces, including a ban on all intermediate range missiles and an agreement to give bilateral notification of ballistic missile test launches.
In 1995 Australia canvassed the possibility of a multilateral ban on ballistic missile tests with our partners in the MTCR and, failing that, negotiation of a ballistic missile launch notification regime as a confidence building measure. Some MTCR countries were enthusiastic; others less so. Let me say to the House tonight that, in the context of the nuclear crisis in South Asia, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade could very usefully resurrect these proposals and explore the possibilities for their further progress.
In question time today, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) referred to the longstanding Australian objective of negotiating a multilateral convention to cut off the production of fissile material as the next step to building the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. This is an important objective that Labor supports, and supports absolutely. Clearly, however, the situation in South Asia, and in the Middle East as well, 
 confirms that stopping the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction requires work across a wide range of fronts. We need to make progress on the cut-off convention, but we also need to significantly strengthen international constraints on ballistic missile proliferation. For our part, Australia has a strong interest in ensuring that our immediate region remains free not only of weapons of mass destruction but also of long-range ballistic missiles as a technology which can very significantly change our strategic circumstances.
Efforts to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are an area of foreign and strategic policy characterised by strong bipartisan support. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, Labor supports this bill. We look forward to the negotiation of further measures which will both enhance our national security and move the international community toward the objective that we all share: a world free of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles; a world free of the shadow of the mushroom cloud.",REPS,<title>COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR TEST-BAN TREATY BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Taylor, Bill, MP",LP,1998-06-01,"—On occasions I have been known to disagree with the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), but I have to say I agree with almost every word of that speech, and the government agrees with a strong bipartisan approach in terms of this piece of legislation, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Bill 1998 , and indeed the broader CTBT. I refer members back to what the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) said during question time today. The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith has referred to the special session within the conference for disarmament in Geneva commencing tomorrow, and in particular to the foreign minister's reference to the proposed fissile material cut-off treaty.
If we go back to early February, when the Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed the conference on disarmament in Geneva, he made the point that the two priorities at that stage for Australia were, firstly, the banning of anti-personnel land mines—we will not get into that issue this evening other than to say once again that it is an international tragedy 
 which has to be corrected—and, secondly, that we would be pushing towards a treaty for the fissile material cut-off. That has been reiterated by the tragedy of South Asia in the last couple of weeks.
I agree with the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith that this whole situation is not about security worries in South Asia; it is all about rampant nationalism. India stands condemned. One could argue quite cogently that, with the political instability that has existed in India for many months, the tests were designed to appease the domestic requirements of many millions in that country. As a result, it has created some problems with Pakistan. Understandably for some—although I do not agree with it myself—that has pushed Pakistan into the situation of the last few days.
The comprehensive test ban treaty marks an historic milestone in the efforts to reduce the nuclear threat and to build a safer world. By banning all nuclear explosions the CTBT aims, firstly, to constrain the development and qualitative improvement of nuclear weapons; secondly, to end the development of advanced new types of nuclear weapons; thirdly, to contribute to the prevention of nuclear proliferation and the process of nuclear disarmament and finally; and, finally and most importantly, to strengthen international peace and security.
The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith referred to a section from the national interest analysis which has been produced and which, in terms of the ratification process, is part of the treaty. The national interest analysis is being referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which I chair. I want to quote a section from the national interest analysis which the honourable member read out because I think it is absolutely critical to an understanding of this whole problem:
An effective CTBT is important to Australia's national security interests and for global security. In particular, Australia has a strong security interest in ensuring that nuclear weapons are not acquired by countries which could use them against Australia. The CTBT will act as a solid barrier to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and imposes severe constraints on the qualitative improvement of existing nuclear weapons designs. By furthering 
 the twin goals of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, the CTBT strengthens the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), which remains the cornerstone of international security arrangements, and hence Australia's security in this field.
This is an absolutely critical excerpt from that national interest analysis, and I commend the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith for drawing it to the attention of the House.
I also want to make some comments about the role that has been played by both sides in terms of the CTBT. As the member indicated, the previous government played a leading role in the lead-up to the March 1994 negotiations and onwards until the early days of 1996. I am sure that the present Minister for Foreign Affairs would not mind if I gave due credit to the then Senator Evans for the role that he played in the development of that CTBT text. Since that time the present Minister for Foreign Affairs has been a key player in the whole process. In September of 1996 it was his personal intervention in the General Assembly which enabled the CTBT text to be developed to the extent that it has been. He attracted the congratulations of US President Clinton for the role that he played in developing that final text.
This legislation does four things: it creates an offence to cause a nuclear test or explosion, it extends the offence to Australian citizens operating outside of Australia, it implements the verification procedures, including on-site inspections, and it establishes the Australian Comprehensive Test-Ban Office. That office will have strong links with the CTBTO in Vienna, which is the central focus of CTBT operations through the mechanisms of the United Nations. I am sure the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith would want to join with me before he leaves the House in wishing our diplomats the best of luck, whether it be Penny Wensley in New York in terms of what may be proceeding there, John Campbell in Geneva in terms of the conference on disarmament or Lance Joseph in Vienna in terms of the CTBT office.
Without getting into the detail, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties looks forward to further consideration of the CTBT prior to ratification. In fact, as a result of 
 what has happened in Pakistan and India, I have reconvened the public hearing of that committee tomorrow morning. We will be looking once again at the CTBT in the light of Pakistan's moves. It is rather fortuitous that, in the same list of treaties that was referred to my committee, there is an investment protection agreement which, once again, we will look at in the light of what has happened in Pakistan in the last few days.
With those brief comments, I want to commend this legislation to the House. We are very appreciative of the strong bipartisan support from the opposition in correcting what, if we do not watch it, will be a problem for not only South Asia but also for all mankind throughout the world. I am sure none of us want that to happen. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR TEST-BAN TREATY BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Kerr, Duncan, MP",ALP,1998-06-01,"—I welcome the tone in which this debate has been conducted. It is an opportunity for both sides of the parliament to respect the achievements that each have contributed in their way to the making of this legislation. The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) set out the record of the former Labor government and its substantial achievements. In giving credit in relation to this matter, I am sure the work of Gareth Evans would be respected by all sides of the House.
There is no doubt in my mind that the world is now a substantially more dangerous place as a result of the testing of nuclear weapons by both India and Pakistan. That might be thought to be a truism and might be thought simply to be a piece of self-evident rhetoric, but it does have domestic consequences. It has domestic consequences because much that we still do in Australia gives mixed messages about where we stand regarding the nuclear cycle. That is particularly the case with regard to the stance of the present government with respect to the nuclear industry.
The Australian Labor Party while in office operated a three mines policy—that is, it recognised that existing uranium producers would be allowed to continue—but it was responsive to concerns in the Australian community not only about the threats to 
 human health and the local environment that mining and milling of uranium posed but also about the generation of raw materials which are useable for nuclear weapons manufacture and which demand the enforcement of effective controls against diversion and which also challenge the global community in ways which only now are becoming so obvious.
There are some who appear to be far too sanguine about these threats, and I instance the editorial of today's Financial Review which I regard as a singularly ill-judged comment in respect of this issue. In respect of those two tests the Financial Review said:
. . . the nuclear rivalry between Pakistan and India may not necessarily be such a dangerous and destabilising development for South Asia.
It further stated:
If anything, nuclear weapons have contributed significantly to world peace.
It continued in this vein, arguing:
Though there is no established causal relationship between nuclear deterrence and peace, there is certainly a strong correlation between the two.
If that piece of fatuous logic were to be carried to its logical consequence, then the world would be much safer by giving Saddam Hussein the facilities to manufacture weapons of mass destruction. The world would be much happier, were that the case, if we released those controls—the existing safeguards—on the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The argument that stability in a global context is enhanced by the wider access to nations having the capacity to develop and to utilise nuclear weapons is such an appalling misjudgment that it demands comment in this House.
There are some issues where one might expect there to be a little sympathy for countries such as India and Pakistan—not sympathy regarding their actions but sympathy in relation to what they would perceive from their point of view are the double standards that others impose upon them. They would see that some, such as the Financial Review and other commentators, have regarded possession of nuclear weapons in the hands of the `big five' as contributing to global stability while arguing that the possession of nuclear weapons in the hands of other nations 
 diminishes the likelihood of stability and international peace. That, at best, I think can be described as an unfortunately Eurocentric or first World view of where the balance of peace ought lie.
There is no case to be made for the fact that the world is a safer place because a number of nations possess nuclear weapons. The history of the world over the last 50 years has been one of continual sporadic outbreaks of significant war. The possession of nuclear weapons by the big five has not prevented major conflicts which have had significant regional and international consequences. One only needs to look at the disintegration of countries within Africa, the civil wars that have existed in Europe, the conflicts that occurred in Vietnam, to give the lie to the simplistic idea that the possession of nuclear weapons by a group of nations who in some sense can act as the international policemen gives a guarantee of peace.
This analysis underpins the stance of the former Labor government when, whilst building on the treaty to prohibit the testing of nuclear weapons, also introduced into the international dialogue discussion of the total abolition of nuclear weapons through the Canberra Commission on Disarmament that was sponsored by the previous Labor government. It also underlies the work of the international community which is seeking to eliminate stockpiles of chemical and other weapons of mass destruction which have no place in warfare. I note the presence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), who carried through the work of the former government in relation to landmine issues and secured a comprehensive agreement to ban the use of landmines.
All these are important initiatives which go to eliminating from arsenals of the global community weapons which give rise to the possibility of such destructive behaviour that we as a civilised community rebel against. It cannot be the case that the possession of nuclear weapons is plausibly seen as a guarantor of peace. The instances of testing by India and Pakistan show clearly how simple it is for countries which at present may wish to adhere to nominal agreements that they 
 will not develop nuclear weapons to move beyond that.
What is the size of the nuclear club now? We know that two nations have emerged from the covert possession of that capacity: India and Pakistan. What other nations possess that covert capacity? Some, I think, would argue that Israel is certainly amongst that group of nations; others have suggested that South Africa may be. I do not wish to speculate, but it is certain that for some time there have been more than five nations with that capacity.
With a growing acceptance in the reality of international politics that those weapons do exist, so too the international community must develop a growing response not merely to limit the testing of nuclear weapons but to move to their ultimate abolition as weapons of war. As long as those other nations can look to the big five—and now potentially the big seven—developing and refining their nuclear capacities and enhancing their stature as nations having possession of that capacity, that power and that authority that flows from it, so too will others seek some form of equivalence.
It is not too strong to say that there is also now a potential trade in fugitive nuclear materials from the former Soviet Union. When the former Soviet Union broke into its now constituent nations, that nuclear arsenal was intended to be possessed by the larger Russian state. But those weapons still remain—now in sovereign territories—outside Russia, and there is no little evidence emerging that some of those materials are beginning to be the subject of diversion. So we are now seeing a world which is increasingly unsafe; a world in which those who are concerned to prevent catastrophic events in the international scene have greater reason for concern.
Even if it were the case—and I do not accept it—that possession of nuclear weapons by a handful of states has prevented the wholesale hostilities between large empire nations and that the consequence of sporadic civil and regional wars were increased as a consequence of that, one really needs to undertake some kind of serious risk analysis. 
 The risk analysis I would put to this House is as follows: assuming that you do have a greater capacity for sporadic, cross-border, minor wars—what do you lay against that, against the possibility of a nuclear contagion being set loose by a country that develops and uses nuclear weapons and plunges its region, and potentially the globe, into a nuclear winter?
It certainly is a tragedy whenever conflict emerges, whenever violence is sought as a recourse to human activity and conflict. But it is more than a tragedy if that conflict is manifested by the use of those kinds of weapons of mass destruction. They can set at risk not merely the survival of the government but the survival of whole regions, continents and, potentially, the stability of the global environment. An article that was written, surprisingly, by the Sunday Mail was much more sensible in its reflection on the Indian-Pakistan circumstance, saying:
We now face the chilling scenario of the sabre-rattling between these two arch antagonists developing into a nuclear war which would be almost impossible to confine to the region.
An article in the Canberra Times  stated:
The horror of a nuclear exchange would not be confined to the sub-continent. The Chernobyl disaster showed just how extensive nuclear fallout can be, even from a site where remedial action is undertaken almost immediately. A nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan would bring a different order of fallout as well as terribly destructive changes to weather patterns, particularly in the northern hemisphere.
The combatants themselves would, of course, be devastated, with large areas virtually inhabitable.
The article concluded:
Just when it seemed the nuclear terror was behind us forever, those who returned it to centre stage will not easily be forgiven.
But I do not share the views of the editorialist of the Financial Review . I think they are irresponsible and serve their readership very poorly by their platitudinous, relaxed and comfortable attitude to the expansion of the nuclear club by two new members who are nations with histories of enmity and whose peoples have responded to the explosions with outbursts of unconstrained nationalism and 
 passions of a kind which foreshadow very poorly the possibilities that may emerge.
On this issue the Australian Labor Party takes on a position which is strong, consistent and definitive. We have argued consistently that we should seek to restrain reliance upon nuclear weapons, firstly, by banning their proliferation and setting a framework in place which would be the basis for their ultimate removal as weapons of war.
Second, we have put in place in our platform a commitment that no new uranium mines will be opened after our return to government. That conflicts with this administration which, since its election, has sought the helter skelter development of nuclear industries. This government has been urging the expansion of this industry to the sacrifice of all other considerations, including that of the environment.
Before the last federal election, when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was asked on a national television program about his views regarding the possibility of mining uranium at Jabiluka, which is a site excised from but inside the Kakadu world heritage area, the Prime Minister said, `I would have thought that environmental concerns alone would rule it out.' Acting no doubt upon that assurance, the Australian people would have been relaxed about the prospect of this government coming to office and not proceeding with that particular proposal.
But within days of coming to office the tone was changing and within months the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Parer, had given the green light to this government's approval of uranium mining at Jabiluka, notwithstanding that there had yet to be put in place any environmental assessment process; notwithstanding that the Aboriginal people, who are the traditional owners of that site, remain implacably opposed to it; and notwithstanding, as we now know only too well, the risks that must always emerge with the expansion of the nuclear industry of possible diversion.
The Labor Party, on this issue, has had a consistent, strong and honourable role throughout the debate. Whilst tonight we welcome the government's bringing forward 
 of this legislation, we say to this government that there are yet further measures that you must pursue and undertake to reassure the Australian public that your words are not simply the reactions of a government that says one thing at one particular time to satisfy demands from the community and then does another at a later stage.
It is, above all, an issue which our children are concerned about. Whenever you travel throughout this country and address concerns of young Australians, one of the issues they put before you is their concerns about the global arms race. I guess those of my age—and most of us in this parliament are my age or older—have come to accept the apparent reality of these tensions and the possession of nuclear weapons in the hands of a number of states. We have learnt to live within that framework.
But we have become far too complacent. The Australian community expects more of us than that we will now introduce sanctions and other measures against India and Pakistan. They expect us to move down the road of facilitating the work of the Canberra Commission. They expect us to give international leadership of the kind that the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) spoke about when he detailed the work over more than a decade of Labor in government as it built international momentum towards disarmament.
It expects that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will not resile from those difficult tasks—they are difficult and they do involve our dealing with powerful and influential friends who will not welcome those interventions—but they are tasks which Australians, particularly young Australians, demand of us. It particularly behoves us as we address what may emerge in the next election to look at the commitments of both parties with respect to the uranium industry. Thus far, no new mines have been approved by the present government. Let us hope that that is the state we are at at the next election because, unless compelled by all steps having been taken such that we must regard mining of uranium as being an existing process, a future Labor government will not allow any new uranium 
 mines to open. That sends an unambiguous message to the world on where we stand on these issues that are so significant to us and future Australian generations.",REPS,<title>COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR TEST-BAN TREATY BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Jull, David, MP",LP,1998-06-01,"—It is not my intention to delay the House for very long tonight but I would like to join in this bipartisan debate and to express my satisfaction, indeed my congratulations, to the government and in particular to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), who is at the table, for the tremendous work that has been undertaken by Australia over many years in the United Nations to bring about what we are debating here tonight, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Bill 1998 . I think the debate has been significant and I will not go over the territory that was covered by the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton).
One of the great privileges I have had during my 23 years or so in this place has been to serve in New York as a parliamentary adviser with the United Nations General Assembly. That happened in 1995. It was at that time that Australia was sponsoring and promoting a resolution condemning French nuclear tests in the Pacific. I suppose, in a very small way, I had an exposure to what this operation was all about. The then Ambassador to the United Nations, Richard Butler, who has gone on to bigger things at the United Nations, was very keen that the two parliamentary advisers become involved with the operations of the UN. In this respect I would like to pay tribute to the now retired Senator Dominic Foreman from South Australia who was my colleague during that period in the United Nations.
It was partly our job to go around to gather information, to gather intelligence, to try to coerce some of the delegates and advisers to the various delegations to the United Nations to come on board the Australian bandwagon and to promote the condemnation of the French nuclear tests. That in itself was a fascinating exercise. For those of us who have been involved in lobbying exercises in this House, may I suggest that when you get on that international stage and you have to deal with some of the international characters and some of the international characteristics of the 
 representatives and the nations of the United Nations it is an entirely different game. As it was, Australia was successful in getting that resolution through. I think that it was a very great tribute not only to the then staff of the Australian United Nations delegation but indeed to the team in Geneva as well.
But during that whole period the one thing that really came through to me was the respect that Australia had built up over many years. In that forum of the United Nations, one of the things of which I was most proud was simply the fact that Australia was regarded as an honest broker. We were not seen as a massive power, we were not seen as one that would have huge public influence, but we were seen as this honest broker which could go around and tell it like was and which could negotiate and argue. Indeed, I think the work that had been done during the previous decade was probably a tribute to this.
I think that that Australian quest now has reached the point where we are looking at the test ban treaty and that Australia very early in the piece had done all the right things. I think too that the Minister for Foreign Affairs should be commended for what he did. In fact, at the first available opportunity he was in there initialling the agreement. Australia had to do that. We were looked to as the country to make those leads. While tonight mention has been made on a number of occasions of the situation with India and Pakistan, I agree with the last speaker that the role of Australia as a world leader in this regard has in many respects just begun. I think it is a tribute to this government that we have looked to the area of landmines and those other areas where we can have some confidence in convincing so many nations to come on board to try to get these wretched weapons of destruction out of the system altogether.
The foreign minister should be congratulated on his very quick call for the meeting that is going to be held tomorrow. I think that it is going to be up to Australia once again tomorrow to show that lead in providing the condemnation of what has happened between India and Pakistan. I hope Australia will once more show that leadership in bringing other 
 nations on board so that India and Pakistan well and truly get the message that this particular situation that they find themselves in is not to be congratulated, is not to be supported.
With those few words, in light of the restrictions on this debate, I extend my congratulations to all who have been involved in getting us to this point in the House tonight where we are actually going to put through this bill. I pay tribute to all those who over many years—in particular, a number of our foreign ministers—have been so dedicated in their task and so dedicated in making sure that Australia is a leader in the field of nuclear disarmament.",REPS,<title>COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR TEST-BAN TREATY BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,1998-06-01,"—I rise to speak in this debate on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Bill 1998  because, like you, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, I have a long history of involvement in the campaign against nuclear weapons. In that context, I am pleased to say that there is largely a bipartisan approach to this important and complex issue this evening. I also want to refer to the fact that I believe that the television pictures, the newspaper headlines and the radio stories which blared out at us all last night and this morning reflect the urgency of this debate on a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty.
After the collapse of the former Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War many people hoped and thought that a new era of peace would settle on the world. We all watched the hype when some nuclear facilities in the USA and the former Soviet Union were decommissioned. We again hoped that these were further signs of a new era of peace settling on the world. I also understand the important role that Australia has in the UN. I myself used to experience that in the ILO, which is part of the UN. Australia is not a large country from a population point of view, but it is always regarded as an honest broker; a nation that has the capacity to work out a reasonable solution and to draw other parties to that solution.
It is for this reason, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I, like you and many others in the House, have spent many active years in the peace 
 movement. The developments of previous years were good signs in respect of this particular movement. After all, many a time I proudly marched behind my union's banner, calling for nuclear test bans as part of the huge annual Sydney Palm Sunday marches. I want to place on record this evening my appreciation of former Senator Bruce Childs, who was active in the development of and involved in those mass rallies, those Palm Sunday marches, not just in Sydney but in many towns and centres around Australia.
We in the union movement in Australia have always, I am pleased to say, strongly voiced our opposition to the mounting stockpile of nuclear warheads. It is also interesting to note that, historically, we have in many instances been attacked for that view. We called on the Australian people and we called on our government to take strong and decisive steps in opposition to the madness of nuclear stockpiles. We hoped and thought that, with the end of the Cold War, we would also see an end to these stockpiles. It is a long held desire of many Australian families.
The Australian people made their voices heard at that time. The Palm Sunday marches were an institution which grew and grew as the threat seemed to increase and slowly dissipated as the nuclear threat seemed to recede. I now think that the Australian people must once more march peacefully in the streets and make their voices heard again. The claim must be: we do not want nuclear war.
That is what the Australian people want to make loud and clear not just to this parliament but also internationally. We have to take to the streets. As a nation that has contributed to development of the changes that have occurred on the nuclear front, we are not going to tolerate and we do not want nuclear war. I hope that unions and other groups—churches and community organisations—join with all other sections of Australian society to make their voices heard. We must tell the governments of India and Pakistan that the peoples of this region are opposed to the mounting nuclear menace that they represent, in the same way that we sent our voice to France in recent times.
The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) must take every effort to get these two countries to sign up to the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. Diverting the scarce resources of India and Pakistan into a muscle flexing nuclear competition is not good for the millions of poor people in those two countries. But getting India and Pakistan to back off and to talk treaty will mean more positive action on nuclear disarmament by the Western world. It is about leadership. You have got to lead by example. On that note, the charges of hypocrisy aimed at France, the United States and others is a very real charge. We have to face up to that in the debate about the bill before the House this evening.
Non-aligned nations have correctly been lobbying for the real elimination of nuclear weapons. The comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, in its preamble, makes repeated mention of the need for nuclear disarmament, but there is no commitment to eliminate nuclear weapons. That is a debate that must occur not just within Australia but also internationally. The Western nuclear powers have flatly rejected the position of the non-aligned nations who have consistently argued for a time-bound framework for nuclear disarmament.
I think that the West must take steps now which will lift the charge of hypocrisy and so bring India and Pakistan into the negotiations for the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. India, as we all know, has by far been the most important and vocal opponent of the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. They, for example, back the claims of the non-aligned who argue that the treaty does not do enough to advance total nuclear disarmament and is thus merely a non-proliferation measure. They argue that the treaty, as it exists, allows the existing nuclear weapons states to maintain a discriminatory status quo. India's representative in the United Nations, Ambassador Prakash Shah, said:
Clearly the nuclear weapon states have no intention of giving up their dependence on nuclear weapons, nor do they have any intention of letting the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty become an impediment to their pursuit of the qualitative improvement of nuclear weapons. In such circumstances it was not surprising that the negotiations 
 were skewed and the text which emerged, far from being the intended historic step towards a nuclear free world, will only succeed in perpetuating a discriminatory status quo.
Since those statements were made, unfortunately, I consider that a right-wing Hindu-centric government has come to power in India which is prepared to use the rhetoric of the disarmers to cover its own aggressive drive to become part of the nuclear club, and we should not lose sight of that issue.
The people in charge of India are influenced by a narrow-minded ideology which is perceived as being hostile to both its own Muslim citizens as well as its Muslim neighbours. Pakistan correctly feels threatened and has retaliated, unfortunately, with its own nuclear tests. The clandestine nuclear program which Pakistan had been involved in, with the alleged secretive help of China, is now well and truly in the open. Pakistan's worry about India has always been related to its view that its huge neighbour would get some type of advantage in the nuclear race.
Now that Pakistan has so dramatically tested its nuclear capacity, it has unfortunately been lauded by some Islamic nations for being the first to hold the so-called Islamic nuclear bomb. Our worry as a nation, and of those who are concerned about the importance of the state of the international community, must now be how the third threshold nuclear state, namely, Israel, reacts to the headlines in the Islamic media which have rejoiced at Pakistan's new nuclear status. We should use whatever influence we have with Israel to ensure that they do not get involved in this escalating nuclear madness. It must come to a stop. India and Pakistan are to be condemned. Israel must show leadership and in doing so win brownie points by not responding and joining the move.
Across the political parties, Australia has played a laudable role in the Conference on Disarmament. Both the current Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and the previous Minister for Foreign Affairs, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), are to be congratulated on the manner in which they have set about contributing to this debate. I also have a view that Australia's delegation 
 to the conference was among the most active and was noted for its ability to negotiate between all parties to progress the cause of nuclear disarmament. Australia will continue to play a key role, along with Russia and the USA, by providing the technical experts and the technologies to monitor the implementation of the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty.
All of this, I consider, gives us a special status in the debate about further proliferation of nuclear arms. We should use this status as an honest broker; that is how we have long been regarded in the UN process—a nation that is properly regarded and respected as an honest broker. But with India and Pakistan we must use that capacity to stop any further destabilising escalation of this regional nuclear armaments race. For future generations, we must ensure that we stop this escalation spreading, especially into the tinder box of Middle East politics.
I urge all Australians, across the political spectrum, to act cooperatively to further the aims of full and final nuclear disarmament. The government of Australia, along with ordinary Australians of all political persuasions, should show its displeasure with India and Pakistan. We did not want the French to test their nuclear weapons in the South Pacific, in our backyard, which had the potential to have disastrous environmental impacts on our eastern seaboard. This evening we do not want the Indians and the Pakistanis to escalate their regional nuclear arms race which will have a potentially disastrous environmental impact on our western seaboard.
I am very pleased to be associated with the developments to date. In my own way I have sought to suggest this evening that we must not cease the progress that has been made and that we must not rest on our laurels. Hopefully, further progress can be made over time to achieve full and proper nuclear disarmament. But the first challenge this evening is to impress on the governments of India and Pakistan that enough is enough. More importantly, we should not just send a loud and clear message to India and Pakistan that enough is enough, but we should make it 
 clear that we do not want it to go beyond India and Pakistan.",REPS,<title>COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR TEST-BAN TREATY BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Nugent, Peter, MP",LP,1998-06-01,"—I am pleased to rise in this debate on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Bill 1998 , which has obviously assumed a largely bipartisan approach. I was pleased to see that that tone was set by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) and carried in large measure by subsequent speakers, although I must say that I was a little disappointed to hear the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) suggest that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), who is at the table, might be resiling from our pursuit of the CTBT and associated matters. Of course that is not the case, and I congratulate the minister on his actions to date.
It is interesting that the first nuclear test occurred on 17 July 1945—more than 50 years ago, but within the lifetime of, if not most, certainly a large number of members of this chamber. The second explosion was about three weeks later at Hiroshima, which killed between 70,000 and 130,000 people. Three days after that there was another explosion at Nagasaki, which killed 45,000 people. It is those statistics that we need to stop and think about from time to time to remind us about why this is such an important topic.
It is good news that, after those two explosions, we have never seen nuclear weapons used in war again. But there have been approximately 2,000 nuclear tests since that time, including 12 British tests here in Australia between 1952 and 1954. And we went through all that long period of the Cold War where nuclear weapons were the `deterrent' that stopped further world-wide conflagration. Recently, of course, we have seen a number of other nuclear controversies over testing by China and more recently by France in the South Pacific. Over many years, all of this has led to a lot of calls for banning nuclear testing.
The CTBT was open for signature on 24 September 1996. We have heard that that there was groundwork done by the previous government, and that was carried on under the auspices of the present foreign minister. The CTBT was signed by the United States, the 
 UK, Russia, France and China—amongst the nuclear nations—and by Australia. The treaty enters into force either 180 days after some 44 signatory countries have ratified it or two years—whichever is later. France and the United Kingdom have already ratified, and I understand that we are likely to ratify this year. The purpose of the bill we are debating tonight is to give effect to Australia's obligations as a party to the CTBT. The treaty bans for all time the carrying out of nuclear weapons tests. It provides for a stringent verification regime, for the establishment and operation of Australian monitoring stations and for a number of other detailed measures.
In an earlier life when I was in the military—quite a number of years ago—I received training and exposure to films and other information about the ramifications of nuclear weapons. What I saw and learnt then was quite horrifying. When I learnt it as a young man in the military, I would have to say that I believe we thought it was a real prospect that it might occur—and that really was quite terrifying. As years have gone by and the prospect of nuclear conflagration has diminished, we have seen an exposure to the general population as to what nuclear weapons might bring through television, mass communications and other ways. Generally there is a total acceptance throughout most of the civilised world that it must not be allowed to come to that.
In this country we are aware of the residue of the British tests here in Australia. We have seen that in some of the ongoing legal battles here in Australia, particularly in South Australia, with the British government seeking to make good the damage that was done and some compensation for the residents, particularly indigenous people in South Australia. We are aware of the French tests in the Pacific and we are currently very much aware of the front page news in respect of India and Pakistan and the tests which they have conducted—and a number of previous speakers have alluded to those tests.
I had the opportunity to visit India and Pakistan in 1996 as part of a parliamentary delegation, and I know that the minister has been there since. One of the better analyses I 
 have come across amongst much of the media coverage in the last few days was in an article in today's Australian by Professor Amin Saikal. He talked at some length, but he made the point that Pakistan's economy is on the verge of bankruptcy and that its society is in the grip of deep social divisions, expanding sectarian violence, widespread corruption—both at government and non-government organisational level—and that it is noted for its human rights violations as well as for its extensive lack of law and order and political instability. It seems to me that in that environment you run into the problem where governments are inclined to look for external matters to raise in order to paper over the internal problems and to get the populace to focus on nationalistic issues.
Of course, one could say much the same thing about India. Although India is allegedly a strong democratic country, it has gone through a number of governments in short order, often minority governments. It has appalling poverty to deal with, and so it is a fact of history that governments throughout the ages, given a situation where they have had problems at home, have tended to try to divert attention to the wider or external issues that confront those countries.
When I was in India and Pakistan we as a delegation actually raised with both the Indian government and the Pakistani government the subject of CTBT because it was at a time when we were leading up to the vote on it and the commitment in the United Nations. There was a total non-acceptance of the view that Australia was putting forward. From the highest levels of government down to the man in the street, it was quite clear that there was strong support for the sort of action which the governments of India and Pakistan have taken today. There is no question in my mind that there is popular support in both of those countries.
I find it incredible that there are resources for developing a nuclear capability and, potentially, nuclear weapons and their delivery systems in countries that have such appalling poverty. It is almost incomprehensible. But there is a strong nationalistic spirit. We have seen the pictures on television of the 
 dancing in the streets and so on. That is representative of the attitude in those countries.
What worries me is that we are not only talking about a potential escalation of problems between India and Pakistan or—of course, the trigger might well be there—the Kashmir problem; and we are looking at a long history of enmity between the two countries, going back to when they were first formed and to subsequent events and wars. It seems to me also that there is a real problem with those two countries in terms of escalating the potential nuclear strife in other areas as well. For example, Pakistan has exploded its bomb fairly close to Afghanistan and it has sided very much with one side of the civil war in Afghanistan. It has perhaps issued something of a threat, de facto to places like Iran and certainly to some of those central Asian republics that have become independent since the USSR broke up. One can see some potential concerns there and one can see that some of those countries under the Russian nuclear umbrella might well look to their own defensive positions. India, of course, has concerns in respect of China and its nuclear capability. As one of the previous speakers mentioned, there may even be a flow-through from the Middle East on to Israel.
So it seems to me that we are not only debating tonight our concerns about India and Pakistan in that sense but talking about the potential spread of that damage, that potential danger, through far wider regions. Therefore, the only real way that we are going to deal with this problem is to implement things like the CTBT. It is through the United Nations—through all nations of the world coming together—that we are going to deal with this problem and we are going to apply pressure to some of those nations that may not otherwise willingly come to the table and fall into line in getting rid of their nuclear capability and nuclear weapons. I think it is important that the United States, China and Russia ratify and set an example in terms of this treaty. I would also like to see them go further and start to eliminate some of their stockpiles.
I think it is important that India and Pakistan start talking and not testing. For our part, 
 we must continue to be active participants in the international debate. I know the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the table will do that and he is to be congratulated on his efforts to date. I am sure he will pursue that vigorously in the future because it is important that we go down that line. A continuing step in that process is passing this legislation tonight and I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR TEST-BAN TREATY BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Hollis, Colin, MP",ALP,1998-06-01,"—On this most serious topic it is pleasing that in what some people call a robust chamber, where we so strongly disagree on so many issues, we can really speak this evening on this issue with, if you like, one voice. I think that might say something about the strength of feeling on this topic and, indeed, about us as members of parliament. This nuclear test ban treaty is the cornerstone of international security and Australia has played an important role in this. I do appreciate the need that some people feel for security and how people feel threatened, but I do feel that there has been an overreaction in some quarters. I do congratulate not only the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) at the table but also the preceding foreign minister, Mr Gareth Evans, as well. They have both worked diligently on this and they both bring to this topic not only a lot of experience but also deep feeling.
Just when we thought the world had finally come to its senses and understood the absolute destruction of civilisation as we know it that can be wrought by nuclear weaponry, over the past couple of weeks the world has seen two nations explode nuclear devices. The debate over the comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty legislation before us provides a timely opportunity for Australia to once again indicate to the rest of the world that we strongly oppose the testing and use of nuclear weaponry by any country.
Australia, under both political parties, has been a key player in the adoption of this treaty and we can be proud of our longstanding record on disarmament issues. It is therefore extremely disappointing that we have seen the explosion of nuclear weapons by India and now, over the last few days, by Pakistan—nuclear weapons explosions by two nations in this part of the world. India and 
 Pakistan have been playing macho games, trying with all their might to outdo one another in the testing of nuclear weaponry. Both nations have fundamentally thumbed their noses at international opinion and now both nations face the prospect of biting sanctions on economic, political, diplomatic and military fronts.
It is a matter of great tragedy that two countries within Asia, notwithstanding their great promise, have turned their backs on their own people and diverted hundreds of millions of dollars to develop and produce nuclear weaponry. Both India and Pakistan are, as the Prime Minister justifiably related last week in media reports, dirt poor countries. Both countries have huge populations with enormous social problems. Both countries are struggling to feed, water and shelter their people and to ensure that even basic health standards are maintained and developed for their huge populations. Yet this overriding need of their own people is ignored to develop and produce nuclear weapons. The leadership of both India and Pakistani governments, I am reduced to say, have their priorities mangled and confused.
I saw a cartoon by Prior over the weekend in the Sydney Morning Herald which really put this issue into perspective. It is in deep contrast to the television images we have seen of jumping, excited Indians and Pakistanis greeting another test explosion and their political leadership revelling in the so-called `glory'. The cartoon showed a woman with three small, thin children hanging off her back and shoulders squatting amongst smoke and ruins. There was no sign of relief on her face that her government had successfully tested a nuclear weapon; she was not up dancing with joy or excitement—in fact, as Prior captured it, her face revealed more of the same hunger, pain and poverty which have always been her lot in life. I get a little tired and cynical whenever a government in a poverty-stricken nation sounds off with such pride that they have tested nuclear weapons.
There is no greater supporter of Australia's foreign aid program in this parliament than I. I support Australia making a contribution to improve the living standards of our neigh 
 bours, be they here in our own backyard or in other troubled continents of the world. I, like, I suspect, all members of parliament, cop the usual questions about looking after our own before we look to others. I defend our aid program because it is right, it is principled and it is absolutely appropriate that Australia as a first world nation should contribute to the improvement of the living standards of people in other nations. It does become difficult, even for great supporters of aid contributions, to continually defend these contributions when nations like India and Pakistan—dirt poor—use their resources to develop weapons of absolute destruction. I have absolutely no argument with the stand the foreign minister took on this issue.
Periodically I get information from the Iraq Embassy—nice, neat tables of statistics indicating the suffering of many people of Iraq, particularly children. Yet Iraq has squandered resources to develop nuclear and chemical weapons and took the world to the brink of military action again quite recently. Only good commonsense and the leadership of the United Nations Secretary-General averted retracing the steps of Desert Storm after the war of 1991. There are so many nations with nuclear capacity in the world: the big five—the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Russia and China—and of course the would-be nations like Israel, Iraq, Iran, North Korea and Libya. And now we have India and Pakistan wrapped into the bargain.
It is also interesting that nations that explode nuclear weapons often call immediately for peace initiatives once they have done the deed. In the weekend media there were endless reports about the government of India wanting peace talks and the immediate convening of the conference on disarmament. It seems to me all just a little too late and a little too clever by half. India showed no sign of willingness to sign or ratify the test ban treaty and Pakistan indicated that her actions would be conditional on those of India. Now there are calls for convening yet another talkfest.
In all my years in the parliament, I have never before been critical of India. But as someone who has enormous affection for 
 India and who recognises the potential of India, I am appalled at what it has done. This is not the way. You in India have so much; there is no need for this. I also believe that a true friend of India, which I believe I am, will tell you when you are wrong. Some years ago I was part of the group of members of parliament that went to Tahiti to protest about what the French were doing in that part of the world. Again today I protest very strongly about what India and Pakistan are involved in.
It is good that we can approach this issue in a bipartisan manner. We recognise the tremendous contribution of the former foreign minister under the Labor government and the current foreign minister. I am very pleased to be associated with this legislation before the House.",REPS,<title>COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR TEST-BAN TREATY BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Anthony, Larry, MP",NP,1998-06-01,"—I am very glad to  endorse the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Bill 1998  and to see that it has bipartisan support. It is important to reflect on the history of nuclear explosions. The first nuclear test was detonated on 16 July 1945 in New Mexico by the United States. Soon after then, on 6 August 1945, the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima where 100,000 people were killed. Three days later it was dropped on Nagasaki where over 45,000 people were killed. Since then there have been over 2,000 nuclear tests conducted worldwide, even on the Australian continent—from 1952 to 1957 there were 12 nuclear tests carried out by the British.
As we look further down the history of nuclear tests, in 1963 a partial test ban treaty banning all but underground tests was negotiated. In 1970 the non-proliferation treaty entered into force, banning nuclear powers from passing technology on to other nations. This was particularly important for Australia and its exports of uranium.
Closer to home, in late 1995 there was great concern when France conducted a number of tests on Mururoa Atoll, much to the horror of all Australians and members on both sides of the House. On 24 September 1996 the coalition government under the stewardship of the foreign minister signed the comprehensive ban treaty with five declared nuclear pow 
 ers—the US, the UK, China, Russia and France.
Two countries have ratified the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty—France and Britain—and this bill will allow Australia to do the same. Clearly, the great concern to this House and to parliaments across the globe is the degree of urgency, given what is happening on the subcontinent in relation to the two countries, India and Pakistan. The decision by India to have five underground tests—

"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,1998-06-01,"—I rise to express concern with an article appearing in the Sydney Morning Herald  this morning written by a Mr Wainwright, not so much over the point of view of Mr Wainwright's opinions but because the article was entitled, `Aircraft noise targets missed, and same suburbs bear the brunt'. Mr Wainwright spoke of how the government's long-term operating plan is not achieving its results and of how the current mode of operating Kingsford Smith Airport is not achieving the percentages over the respective suburbs that the government had intended to achieve to supposedly `share the noise'.
My concern is that Mr Wainwright and so many other people have approached the topic with the view that those percentages are attainable. Anyone with commonsense will tell you that they are just not attainable. They cannot happen for two reasons: safety and efficiency. Any sensible person looking at a two-lane highway is going to tell you that that two-lane highway is going to operate far more safely, far more efficiently in terms of traffic flow and without the risk of accident if you have not got an intersection across it.
What we are talking about is akin to a two-lane highway at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport, with, of course, a parallel north-south runway and the long-term operating plan being dependent upon using the east-west 
 crossing runway mode of operation. So, effectively you are putting an intersection in a two-lane highway where jumbo jets are travelling at 300 kilometres an hour before they take off. Unlike a two-lane highway, you cannot put up a stop sign and you cannot put up traffic lights—those planes cannot stop. If an error is made, there is going to be a collision with devastating consequences.
It is about time that those on the government side admitted that the long-term operating plan cannot work. It cannot happen because of the safety consequences. The crossing runway mode of operation is operating only during non-peak periods because there is an acknowledgment by at least the experts who are operating the airport that to operate it at peak hour is just ludicrous. However, during the non-peak periods, to bump up these statistics—and Mr Wainwright referred to the intention to bump them up between now and September—there is a lot of pressure being put on pilots and on air traffic controllers to use the crossing runway mode of operation for the sake of mere statistics.
Pilots are complaining that they are being forced to use the crossing runway mode of operation in crosswinds of up to 25 knots, despite the fact that the international standard is only 15 knots. Air traffic controllers—or at least their association—have written directly to the minister expressing their concern. The pilots have written to the minister expressing their concern. Yet those on the other side of the House are continuing with this facade that these targets are attainable.
They are just not attainable and the consequences are going to be an accident with devastating consequences. I do not say that lightly because the figures indicate that 83 per cent of accidents occur within eight kilometres of an airport. Indeed, 60 per cent of accidents occur on take-off or landing: it is a very vulnerable time for an airport operation.
The environmental impact statement procedure into the third runway at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) said that, on the figures of 0.03 fatalities for every 100,000 landings, the probabilities are that there will be an accident at Sydney KSA within the next 40 years. So 
 we are talking about a situation where there is probably going to be an accident and we are talking about a situation where this minister—and this government—for purely political reasons is directing planes over people's homes instead of over the water for the sake of statistics and for the sake of in electioneering brochures—not for efficiency and not for safety but for purely base political motives that are unattainable.
It is about time this government woke up to the fact and admitted to the Australian public that the long-term operating plan is a farce. It is about time that it got on with the logical planning and operation of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport and got on with the job of building a second Sydney airport.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport</title>,Adjournment,20,1,speech
"Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP",LP,1998-06-01,"—In making my contribution to the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1998-99 I would like to spend the brief time available to me to speak about Australia's taxation system. For the first time in this nation's history, in 1997-98 the revenues available to the government as a proportion of GDP were down. They were reduced to some extent because of the reduced dividend from the Reserve Bank of Australia but principally because our taxation base is eroding. In thinking about change, and indeed reform of anything, I would like to present to the committee a passage from a book that was sent to me by a constituent last year entitled Revelation  authored by Bernhardt Philbert. He said this of change:
Progress leads to chaos if not anchored in tradition. Tradition becomes rigid if it does not prepare the way for progress but a perverted traditionalism and a misguided progressivism propel each other toward a deadly excess hardly leaving any ground between them.
I think in considering reform which is essential to Australia's taxation system it behoves all participants in the debate, and in particular political parties, to remember there is nothing worse, as Philbert has more or less said, than being caught with one leg on either side of the proverbial fence. Australia currently taxes everything that we are supposed to be encouraging. We tax productivity, we tax savings, and we tax employment.
Our revenue raising concentrates predominantly on income, both personal and corporate, in addition to wholesale sales tax on three principal goods: durables, motor vehicles and beer— 
 all of which represent a diminishing share of household expenditure as it shifts to services. In fact, now about 70 per cent of the Australian economy is services and is largely untaxed.
The problems of the taxation system as it is currently structured are these. In 1954 you had to be earning 19 times average weekly earnings to be paying the top marginal tax rate. In today's dollars, that is around $600,000 a year. Today you have to be earning around only 1.4 times average weekly earnings to be paying the top marginal rate. In seven years if we do not undertake reform you will be paying the top marginal rate at average weekly earnings.
The Income Tax Assessment Act in 1936 was 120 pages. It is now 3,300 pages, doubling in size over the past seven years. David Koch, the well respected economic and finance commentator for Channel 7 and other media outlets, advised me that the average tax agent has to read or interpret 25 pages of tax ruling every day just to keep up with changes to Australian taxation law.
—Sounds as though we need taxation reform.
—Indeed we do. An entire parasitic industry now exists to enable legitimately the high income earner, the self-employed and the well advised to minimise their tax liability. The 100 segmented markets we had throughout the world at the end of World War II are now coalescing into three major trading blocks. We are trying to survive increasingly in what is obviously a global economy. We rely on our export markets to improve our standard of living.
Yet Australian manufacturers have to pay wholesale sales tax, payroll tax and other input costs and then compete in international markets against competitors who face no such input costs. It is not easy to increase your prices to offset input costs if you are competing in a global market. It is all very well in a closed economy, perhaps the sort of economy that the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) might wish us to us go back to. But the fact is that we can no longer simply afford luxuries in terms of input costs, inappropriate taxation, regulation, transport, energy, waterfront and other regulatory imposts and then try to find markets in the rest of the world. If we subscribe to those sorts of views my children have no hope of having a job.
Only Australia, Botswana, Ghana, Jordan, Pakistan, Solomon Islands and Swaziland apply wholesale sales tax without some form of broad based consumption tax. Australia currently has seven different rates of wholesale sales tax and, as you would be aware Mr Deputy Speaker, it applies to biscuits and orange juice, for example, but not to crayfish and to caviar.
—Bizarre!
—Bizarre, indeed. A company operating across Australia from one end to the other has to confront 42 federal and state taxes before any industry specific taxes are applied. Taxes paid by businesses depend on the type of structure of that business, whether it is a company, a trust or some other sort of arrangement. There is an enormous amount of energy and money invested in complex structures to minimise taxation.
We also have an ageing population. In 1993 the age dependency ratio in Australia was 5.3:1. That means 5.3 Australians were between the ages of 15 and 64 for every person over the age 64 or under the age of 15. Over the next 40 years, according to the National Commission of Audit, that age dependency ratio will collapse to 2.6:1. In fact, the Commission of Audit also reported that over the next 40 years we will need to spend 10 per cent more of our GDP on the health and welfare costs of ageing above and beyond real growth from where we are 
 currently at just to sustain the level of services which we currently provide for older people in health and aged care.
If you had not seen it, the Retirement Incomes Modelling Taskforce report released several months ago estimates that over the next 33 years we will need to spend $32 billion in 1997 terms on the health costs of ageing alone. This, of course, is the equivalent to the drain in the Australian economy during the banana republic balance of payments crisis.
We also have a cash economy. It is not something that is easy to estimate. Some of the estimates are that we are losing between $3 billion to $15 billion a year in lost revenues. There has also been a lot of talk amongst those who are opposed to a broad based consumption tax that such a broad based consumption tax would increase income disparity in Australia. Those who wish to support such an argument I direct to the work of David Johnson and colleagues of the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 1995. These economists from Victoria found that in the decade from 1984 to 1994 the bottom 10 per cent of income earning households in Australia went from spending 14.2 per cent of their disposable income on indirect taxes in 1984 to 22.6 per cent by 1994.
In contrast the top 10 per cent of income earning households, a significant number of which are in my electorate by the way, went from spending 6.3 per cent of disposable income on indirect tax in 1984 down to 5.7 per cent in 1994. In other words, the poorest are spending a lot more of their disposable income on hidden indirect tax now than they were 10 years ago and the wealthiest are spending less. Also it is worth pointing out that the wealthiest 20 per cent in this country spend twice as much on food as the poorest. I suspect many of those people are in my electorate. The wealthiest 25 per cent spend twice as much on services, which as I said earlier are not currently being taxed—hotels, airlines, personal care and so on.
The other report to which honourable members ought to have their attention drawn is the Electronic Commerce Taskforce report of the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board which was released in March 1997. Amongst other things it found that a business may operate in a country without an established branch, that the digitisation of goods and services has blurred the distinction between the two and makes it very difficult to tax one and not the other. Digital transactions can be enormous whereas cash transfers are quite bulky. Also the techniques for deception are outstripping those for verification, despite whatever encryption surveillance that we try to implement and maintain.
As I said in my introductory remarks, we also have a shrinking taxation base. We are moving away from durables, motor vehicles, beer, tobacco and excise. We are also taxing income still predominantly, but in a low inflation environment.
Another aspect of the current inequities in the taxation system is the way in which the taxation system relates to and interacts with the social security system. If a single income family goes from earning $24,570 per year to $33,150 per year, they lose $6,435 in benefits. They pay $4,990 in tax. In other words, they are $1,270 per year, or $24 per week, worse off. That is, you earn $165 per week more but you lose $24 per week in rent assistance, child-care subsidies, minimum family payment, parenting allowance, newstart and a whole range of benefits.
Another pressing reason for taxation reform is symptomatic of the argument between the Commonwealth and the states over Australian hospital financing agreements. Real reform in health care will not come in this country until there is a reform of state-Commonwealth relations. As long as the states are raising only 30 per cent of the money that they have to 
 spend on health and education and essential services, it will be very difficult to reform the Australian health care system.
Another point that needs to be made in relation to state-Commonwealth relations is that those who quite rightly have a concern for our reliance on gambling revenues—states in total are now raising $3.4 billion per year from gambling revenues—ought to understand that a lot of that is being driven by vertical fiscal imbalance, which will not be addressed, I believe, until we have meaningful reform in the tax system.
Finally, to maintain a welfare system that condemns the poor to permanent dependency and which is financed on debt and asset sales is an abrogation of our responsibilities to the future of our country. The purpose of any taxation system ultimately is to finance the establishment and maintenance of social infrastructure; support and protect those in society with neither power nor influence; and to enable governments to strategically stimulate those sectors of the economy essential to growth and, with it, the creation of jobs. In essence, it is the poor who should ultimately be its greatest beneficiaries.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1998-99</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Wilton, Greg, MP",ALP,1998-06-01,"—Those of us on this side of the House certainly welcome the chance to have our input on the budget and the way it has been received, particularly in the broader community. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) having inherited a high growth, low inflationary economy, an economy that in his own words he said was better than good in parts, I venture to suggest that the economy is now not in such great shape. Overall, we have domestic demand that is high. The position of the dollar could at best be described as precarious. We have a level of national savings which is disappointing, notwithstanding the fact that the government abolished the superannuation guarantee charge and replaced it effectively with a 15 per cent surcharge. In the Reserve Bank's own words, the current account could well this year approach six per cent of GDP. Of course, a conjunction of these fundamentals is indicative of possibly recessionary activity. As I said, domestic demand in this country remains very solid, adding to the problems of an import-export imbalance. As the Reserve Bank recently said in its semi-annual statement:
The general pick-up in momentum (in the latter part of 1997) reflected stronger growth in most components of private demand, with strength particularly evident in consumer spending and housing construction . . . Early indications are that domestic demand has maintained momentum in the early part of 1998.
. . .              . . .             . . .
Moreover, the recent Federal Budget forecasts private final demand averaging 5% through 1998-99, with GNE at 4.75%. With GDP growth forecast at 3%, this represents a significant domestic imbalance.
These other factors in recent years have seen rises in interest rates, such as those which occurred over the 1980s. Like some commentators, I believe that there is good reason to conclude that these rates may soon rise once again. Again, this is primarily due to the crux of Australia's economic problems, which continues to be difficulties with our current account deficit. The current account deficit in the mid-1980s was a product of largely external shock, as the Treasury does record in budget paper No. 1, wherein it states:
The contribution of external factors to the rise in the current account deficit was dominant in the mid-1980s episode, with a large decline in the terms of trade and much slower growth in exports leading to a fall in domestic saving relative to investment and hence a deterioration in the trade balance.
History does not appear to be on the side of those who may well argue that rates will not rise due to difficulties on the current account. Australia ran a budget surplus of two per cent of GDP in the late 1980s, which was significantly higher than the 1998-99 forecast. Yet at that 
 time Australia encountered a current account of more than six per cent of GDP, leading most commentators at that stage to quite rightly question the application of the twin deficits theory. Again, strong similarities exist in previous current account blow-outs and the current circumstances. Indeed, the fundamentals of the Australian economy have largely remained unaltered. With regard to our chronic current account problem, we are, by and large, a small trading nation with a poor national savings record that cannot grow faster than those of our trading partners without what can only be described as a very undesirable overflow into the external account. In this respect, Australia's circumstances seem little different from the current account problems in each of the mid-1980s, late 1980s and mid-1990s.
I referred earlier to the fact that our rate of national savings is particularly disappointing—and indeed it is. Improvements in public sector savings have in the overall been at the expense of private sector savings, including some $5 billion in fiscal drag and significant cuts to essential services such as health, education and child care. Private savings have fallen, as many households have been forced to pay for higher tax liabilities and higher household user charges from household savings. The 1998-99 budget forecasts a significant drop in the savings ratio from 4.7 per cent in 1996-97 to 2.75 per cent in 1998-99; one of the lowest ratios in the Western world. It is something to which I will return momentarily.
Moreover, the abandonment of the previous government's plan for employee contributions in superannuation, albeit with a public co-payment and its replacement with a 15 per cent savings tax rebate, seems likely to produce an even weaker level of national savings. These trends are indeed confirmed by chart 1.12 of budget paper No. 1, which shows a decrease in national savings since 1996, with a rate stuck significantly below 20 per cent of our GDP. There are many economists who now expect recessions in several South-East Asian nations, plus sluggish growth in Japan. That will impact upon Australia to the point where our outlook similarly appears poor.
If we grow faster than our Asian trading partners, the current account deficit will invariably emerge as a restraint. If we slow the economy in response to the current account, there is no doubt that unemployment will rise, as it has in the past, in the short to medium term.
The Howard government's response to this is primarily to boast quite heartily about its surplus, while at the same time the current account has blown out from $18 billion in 1996-97 to $31 billion in 1998-99. As I alluded to earlier on, the Australian dollar is falling in response to pressure from what are largely foreign speculators, and of course we have consumption spending growing more quickly than national production. The growth in the rate of private investment is falling, as is the ratio, as I said, of household savings to disposable income at the rate previously alluded to, which, as I have already said, is currently one of the lowest rates of national savings in the Western world.
But it is no good crowing about how a surplus will possibly fund tax cuts. The issue is not one of budget deficit nor budget surplus. The serious issue for Mr Howard to address is the current account blow-out. As Kenneth Davidson said in a recent Age article:
Yet all the Government wants to talk about is how its surpluses will be available for tax cuts. It is as if the Budget deficits of the early `90s were the cause rather than the consequence of the 1991 recession.
The truth is if the Budget deficit didn't blow out during a recession—thereby pumping more money into the economy—the recession would be far worse.
If Howard is too blinded by ideology—
Davidson goes on:
and political point-scoring to see this in respect of the 1991 recession, he should at least be able to assess the relevance of the 1982 recession when he was Treasurer and the Budget deficit blow out, due to rising welfare spending and reduced tax receipts, helped revive the economy.
Of course those recessions of the early 1980s and early 1990s could easily have become economic catastrophes without the inbuilt stability provided by those budget deficit blow-outs during a recession to thrust more money into an ailing economy.
—They did!
—The member for Leichhardt retorts that they were catastrophes and indeed they were. But, as you will see in a moment from my submission, had the Treasurer at that time adopted the same policies as the Treasurer is adopting now we would have ended up with a 1930s depression type situation.
So the current account blow-out has worsened by what Davidson has called this huge amount of speculative capital washing around the globe which, as he said, particularly impacts upon East Asia and Australia. The current account, as he cites it, is the biggest problem confronting Australia today. As I alluded to in my opening remarks, if we are heading towards a recession then it has almost nothing to do with funding the budget. It is due largely to our exposure to foreign speculation, to our reliance on foreign debt to fund the current account deficit and not to any perceived budgetary financing problems.
Labor left this government with a level of government debt and a budget deficit which was low by world standards. This government was left with the third lowest level of budget deficit as a percentage of GDP of any of the industrialised OECD nations. Similarly, it was also left with the third lowest level of public sector debt, again as a percentage of GDP, amongst the OECD economies. So is it any wonder that the Prime Minister in April 1996 described our economy as better than good in parts.
—What were the lowest two?
—I do not know what the lowest two were. In the early 1990s we went from a budget surplus to a deficit by and large, at that time under a Labor government, because of a worldwide recession. Budget deterioration is a natural corollary of a recession because we have negative growth, we have cuts to revenues and we have increasing unemployment benefits to pay from government expenditure. That leads to an automatic budget deficit blow-out. Again, as I alluded to earlier, this is known as the automatic stabiliser effect in terms of Keynesian economic jargon. It helps minimise the recession by limiting the fall in demand during the recession. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) seems to believe in pre-Keynesian economics. He criticises Labor for the deficit and the consequently increased government debt in the context of a recession. He apparently believes, along with those like the member for Leichhardt, that Labor should have reacted to the recession by cutting expenditure or increasing taxes to keep the budget in surplus. This is an obvious consequence of what they are saying. This is 1930s thinking. It caused a depression so deep and disastrous that many of our fathers and mothers in many ways never recovered from it. As the former Treasurer, the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), recently submitted in his appropriation bill speech to the House on 25 May this year—again, this might be listened to by the member for Leichhardt—had Labor followed the now Treasurer's policies in the early 1990s we would have had a far deeper recession or a depression with much more unemployment. But because Labor followed a more sensible policy, including stimulatory action through the budget, the recession was relatively minimised but at the cost of a turnaround in the budget outcome from an underlying surplus 
 of some two per cent of GDP to a deficit of four per cent of GDP by 1995-96. Of course, at that time, with the economy recovering strongly, the underlying deficit was reduced to two per cent of GDP. So at that time Labor was not only reducing the deficit but also bringing it back into surplus in a way which was largely consistent with its objective of keeping economic growth high and rapidly reducing unemployment.
What this budget clearly shows is that even with no policy change whatsoever after the last election the underlying budget balance would have fallen to $2.7 billion in 1998-99 or half a per cent of GDP. Far from Labor's policies being this endless cycle of deficit, spending and debt, as the Treasurer continually claims, our policies, even with no further budget tightening measures, would have reduced the balance to at least half a per cent of GDP this year. Of course, it would have been reduced further because we would not have adopted this slash and burn approach in terms of the cuts that this government has so harmed the economy with, especially in its first two budgets.
In concluding, the current account is the issue. It is not the budget surplus or deficit. The sooner the government stops crowing about fortuitously obtained surpluses and focuses on the main game the sooner we will tack away from the recessionary course that we are on. It is with those words that I conclude and certainly commend the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's amendment to the House.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1998-99</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,1998-06-01,"—First of all, in rising to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1998-99, I would like to congratulate the Treasurer (Mr Costello) for delivering a budget that certainly gives all Australians the benefits of a very sound economic management and also delivers initiatives that will bring very significant benefits to regional Australia and, in particular, my electorate of Leichhardt. I can recall that it was not so long ago—about two and a half years—when we first came into government that we gave a commitment to the Australian people that we would be looking within our third year at delivering a budget in surplus and I would suggest that we have been able to fulfil that commitment in full.
The member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) I note was suggesting, in looking at the 1998-99 budget, that we are in trouble economically. I would suggest to him that in March 1996 we were absolutely haemorrhaging. To suggest that Australia had to go into a deficit because the rest of the world was doing so and we had to follow suit is a bit like suggesting that we should be now tipping ourselves into the same economic position as Indonesia or South Korea. I think that is not really a good idea and certainly not an option that I would like to pursue for myself or, for that matter, my family or the country generally.
I think it is also important to acknowledge the significance of our $2.7 billion surplus. It is certainly good news for all Australians. There have been some on the other side and some of those that are pushing the more extreme social agenda—I include my friends from the Democrats in that—that are suggesting absolutely dismayed that we have made a profit. They are saying, `That $2.7 billion should go into some new-found social program.'
They do not realise that it is all about paying back some of the debt. Any of them that had any fundamental business principle would understand that at the end of the day if you accumulate a debt somewhere along the line you have to start to pay it back. To suggest that it is a dreadful thing to have a bit of a surplus and you should be spending on something overlooks the fact that you forget completely that you still have a hell of a lot of interest that is eating away at your capital. It is just sound business practice to reduce that debt as quickly as possible.
I suggest that this surplus will deliver certainty and confidence right across the board to families and Australian business. That is something that we should be all very comfortable with. When Labor left office in March 1996, there was a $96 billion debt, representing 20 per cent of our GDP. That is very significant. Our current forecasts, with sound economic management, suggests that we will be down to about 10 per cent of GDP. That is a manageable level, I suggest, by the year 2001 or 2002. If we have the mandate to continue on with the sale of the balance of Telstra, we will be looking at levels down to 1.5 per cent of GDP. They are levels that have not been enjoyed in this country for decades. It will certainly give us the opportunity to have a new era of prosperity for our kids. That is something that we all should be focusing on.
Another very significant issue is that we have pulled back this deficit without increasing taxes. This is very important. This is the first government that I am aware of that has, for a full term, not increased any taxes and dealt with these problems that we had when we came into government. Interest rates, as I said, are the lowest since 1970. Home loans interest rates are at 6.7 per cent. Our overdraft rates are at 7.7 per cent. They are very low. Inflation is the lowest since the 1960s and forecast to remain in that two to three per cent band in the foreseeable future. Certainly it is not the gloom and doom that has been suggested by the other side. It is a very positive and a very comfortable outlook. I suggest to you, given the problems in our northern neighbours, if we had not taken this action, we would have been really in serious problems.
The unemployment level is another good one. It is very interesting. It is at 7.9 per cent. It is interesting to note that when we came in in March for the first six months there was an increase. There was certainly an increase. When you look at the graphs after that six months, you find a consistent drop. They said we would never go below eight per cent again, but we have. We are down to 7.9 per cent. That is quite an achievement. That increase in the first six months, if you look at it, is all about those that were on the merry-go-round called Working Nation. They were coming off those programs. These were the ones that were training and retraining and retraining but there was nothing to put them into. As that program was winding up in that six months, those people were coming back on to the unemployment queues. Suddenly, good responsible policy started to click in and we have this good steady decline.
Certainly it is not as sharp as one would like to see it, but it is certainly very significant given that we were told, `You will never go below eight per cent.' That is absolutely commendable. We have created 280,000 new jobs since we have got in. I am sure we will continue to foster that sort of job growth with the economic policies that we are putting into place. Businesses and families can now plan with certainty. Interest rate cuts, given the more disposable income, are cutting years off their mortgage.
The budget has helped protect us, as I said, from the worst of the Asian crisis. Australia's growth economic forecast in spite of the Asian crisis is still predicted at about three per cent of GDP. That is the highest in the region. It was the lowest in the region.
—Lowest in Australia's history.
—Adopting Labor's policy, we would be down there in the minuses. It is a great positive. I think it is also interesting to note the reaction of the press with regard to the budget. I could suggest to you that I read some of the comments from our lesser papers such as the Australian , the Sydney Morning Herald  or the Age . But I will read something that is 
 quite significant and that really knows all about these issues. It is called the Cairns Post —an excellent paper. In an editorial that they printed on 13 May it is stated:
Commendably, the Government resisted the inevitable pre-election temptation to make this Budget a heartily big-spending one aimed at buttering up the voters.
In resisting this temptation, Treasurer Peter Costello has made fiscal prudence an election issue by establishing clearly the Government's credentials as a responsible economic manager.
By turning a $10.3 billion Budget deficit inherited from the previous Labor government into an estimated $2.7 billion surplus in less than three years—
I did not say that there was a deficit; the Cairns Post  has also admitted that there was a surplus. They got their information from Gareth Evans. Gareth Evans told them that. It is amazing. This is a third party endorsement of this, confirming it.
The Howard government has laid down the gauntlet in no uncertain terms to opposition leader Kim Beazley. The newspaper goes on to say a bit about Kim, but we do not need to dwell on that tonight. It continues:
All in all, Mr Costello has good reason to be pleased with his efforts last night
I say to the member for Bradford (Dr Nelson) that it is absolutely commendable. We should be very proud of it. We have to be pleased as well. Time does not permit me to go on with comments of the lesser newspapers. I will continue, if I can, to comment on specific programs. Road funding in our electorate will deliver $334 million to Queensland in additional funding; $11.06 million will be reinstated in the black spot program. We have done very well from the black spot program. There has been cooperation with my local man, Mr Tom Pyne, who is a life member of the Labor Party. We worked very well together. We have secured over one-sixth of the entire state's allocation of black spot funding. There has been the upgrading of the Cook Highway to numerous works around the city. There have been bikeways, roundabouts, the funding of Bloomfield Road. The funds provided have covered a very significant portion of that funding. Recently, we had another $400,000 go to Mareeba and Mount Molloy to do roads there. Infrastructure has been major.
We have had great initiatives with health and programs such as Meals on Wheels, which I am very actively involved in. I still go very regularly whenever time permits. They are getting money as well, which is desperately needed. This is keeping people at home. The money goes into multipurpose centres. This has been a major problem in our electorate because people have been forced to move these from these little communities into Cairns and places such as that. Of course, they break away from their community. Now they are able to provide something within their community. A good example of that is the Douglas Shire nursing home steering committee which looks like for the first time in six years getting themselves a new nursing home. I think it is fantastic. That is through our network.
I will save what else I have here for later. I will say in finishing that it is a great budget. As the Treasurer said, we are back in the black. We are back on track. We are well on our way to paying off Labor's legacy of debt. I take great pride in the expectation that we will continue to reduce that debt. We will pay our own way so that when our kids start to take over the reins of this wonderful country, they can focus on the future rather than be burdened by the excesses of their forefathers. With that, I commend this bill to the chamber.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1998-99</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Sercombe, Bob,MP",ALP,1998-06-01,"—I certainly agree with the member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) that it is indeed a wonderful country. It is most disappointing, though, that it has such an unimaginative, narrowly focused government temporarily in control of its 
 affairs. One can understand, I suppose, when one looks at the budget and some of the underlying bases of the budget, why they are slinking off so rapidly to an election before some of the messages of the budget really sink into the community.
It is a budget really of no hope in a whole range of areas. No hope on jobs: fundamentally the only way to create real sustainable jobs is by rapid economic growth. We have a budget that is premised on a reduction from the average rates of economic growth achieved under Labor of 4.3 per cent to three per cent in 1998-1999 and no guarantees that that rate in fact is going to be sustained. Unemployment is stuck at eight per cent and is probably going to rise. Ironically, the very policies of lower growth that the government is pursuing are very likely to result, over the relatively short term, in the budget going back into the red because of the sorts of fiscal stabilisers that my colleague the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) referred to in his contribution. The reality is that the government is intent on talking down this economy's capacity, this country's capacity, and that is going to bring in those fiscal stabilisers in a negative way. There is no evidence really in the budget of fire proofing us, as is claimed by leaders of the government, from the problems of Asia. We have a current account deficit for the 1998-99 year blowing out to $31 billion, which is over five per cent of GDP. That is almost double the level of current account deficit as was the situation in 1996-97. So on those macro-measures, one can understand, as I said, why the government is slinking off to an election before some of the grim messages of this budget sink in.
It is a budget that really presents no hope for security for Australian people. We have a government that makes a virtue out of sacking workers. We have a budget that is continuing to attack the economic security of the Australian work force through its industrial relations approach and its attack upon organised labour. So how one sees that fitting into any vision of a secure Australia defies my capacity to understand.
We have a government that is intent on introducing an unfair, regressive tax proposal in the very near future. We are seeing a whole range of cuts to the most vulnerable in our society, whether they be the aged or whether they be families with young children. It is a budget that presents no hope to the Australian people in terms of health care and the crisis in our hospitals.
We are a country that ought to be the clever country. We often talk about this country's future as being based upon brain power and our capacity to harness that as a real competitive strength of this country. But this is a government that is determined to slash education. Australia is experiencing a six per cent fall in total education expenditure in the period 1996-97 to the year 2001-2002; a massive 20.6 per cent fall in higher education expenditures over the same period; a 3.2 per cent fall in expenditure on vocational education and training; and a 1.3 per cent fall in schools expenditure between 1998-99 and 2001-2002. So how that fits in with any vision of this country as a clever country defies logic as far as I am concerned. We have seen the slashing that has occurred in the government's support for essential research and development activities to underpin our manufacturing future and our capacity to add value to this country's production and exports along with a range of other cuts in industry programs.
The other huge problem of this government's lack of vision is in the foreign affairs area where Australia has traditionally been a country that has been seen to be able to box well above its weight in world affairs. Yet we have a government—
—We fight like Joe Bugner.
—That is right. We seem to have a government that is intent on winding back so much. The budget confirms, for example, an abysmal record in foreign aid following 
 slashing in its two earlier budgets. Overseas development assistance is at an all-time low of 0.27 per cent of gross national product. I noted the statements of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) the other day where he was offering Pakistan an increase, a doubling, of its aid to the grand sum of $6 million if that country did not respond to India's disgraceful nuclear testing. Needless to say Minister Downer's inducements were not adequate for that purpose.
But we do face a very dangerous world because of the proliferation of nuclear weapons that has been evidenced so dramatically in recent weeks with India and Pakistan. The Indian explosions and the flouting of international norms of behaviour that those explosions represented were quite dangerous not only because of the simple act of exploding nuclear devices but because of the configuration of those devices. A thermonuclear device was amongst the devices used as well as low yield devices which lend themselves to tactical battlefield use. India also foreshadowed further developments in its missile delivery system.
So we do live in a very dangerous world and one where we do need this government to build very strongly upon the achievements of the former government in terms of establishing Australia's credentials in world forums, boxing well above our weight on issues like the success we achieved in the comprehensive test ban treaty. That situation is now so clearly being threatened by the actions of India and Pakistan. We recognise that the security situation of both India and Pakistan is complex, but scarcely desperate in either case. The great power ambitions that India demonstrated and presented as the rationale for its actions really ought to be strenuously condemned. India's own citizens and the citizens of its neighbours would be much better served by focusing on achieving social benefits from economic growth and conferring those benefits on its own desperately poor citizens rather than engaging in the sorts of activities it has in recent weeks. We need to demonstrate sanctions, real and effective, on both India and Pakistan. Certainly the discussions that occurred last week in this House with the Pakistani parliamentary delegation prior to their early departure from the country showed that Pakistani opinion was certainly very strongly of the view, prior to their own tests, that world reaction in terms of real and effective pain on India for flouting international norms was not being perceived as being particularly strong, and they were particularly critical of the actions of Russia, France and the United Kingdom in that respect.
It is fundamentally important that the world community send a very strong message to both India and Pakistan in relation to their actions because there are other neighbouring countries that are going to be sorely tempted, if the reaction is not strenuous, to consider seriously their own nuclear options. One only has to look at Iran, for example, which is a neighbour of Pakistan and has a range of security difficulties in its relationships with Pakistan, particularly the ongoing tragedy in Afghanistan, to realise just how important it is for countries such as Australia to exercise very considerable leverage in world affairs. Frankly, the aid budget that we have is a sham as a minor ingredient in that and really shows, as I said before, a government with very limited vision about what this country can achieve.
We need to use our moral influence and our capacity to influence to play the sort of role that we have in the past in world forums on non-proliferation matters. We need to use our influence with nuclear powers to recommence the strategic arms limitation process between Russia and the United States. We need, as Minister Downer, in fairness to him, acknowledged today in question time, to play a role in encouraging further work on the fissile materials cut-off treaty. We need to be taking real steps on biological weapons. However, we need to not lose sight of the importance of the economic component of that.
A division having been called in the House of Representatives—
Sitting suspended from 8.50 to 9.03 p.m.
—As I was saying before we were interrupted by pressing matters downstairs, this is a budget that is characterised in its macro-economics by a pretty small-minded, inadequate view about Australia's future and certainly in its approach to foreign affairs, to the extent that that could be reflected in a budget. It is the same sort of small, narrow-minded view of Australia's position in the world that characterises this government and which shines through on the budget.
In the very limited time that I have left, I want to turn quickly to an area of the budget that relates very much to Victoria, especially my part of Victoria, the western suburbs of Melbourne. Those issues relate to pollution and waste matters. The Victorian government is currently engaged in an exercise of extraordinary environmental vandalism by approving three toxic waste dumps in the western suburbs of Melbourne. One is in my electorate at Niddrie, and the others are at Werribee and Tullamarine. There is a real irony in this situation where the Victorian government has its hand out for Natural Heritage Trust funds from the Commonwealth yet it is creating a situation where the leaching of toxic materials out of these tips into Melbourne's river system and Port Phillip Bay will very much undermine the whole rationale, as I understand it, for the Natural Heritage Trust.
Australia's total pollution abatement and control expenditure is only about one per cent of GDP. The overwhelming proportion of that expenditure comes from private sources, state and local government. Less than one per cent of environmental expenditure is carried out by the Commonwealth. That low trend is continuing in this 1998-99 budget. I am told that only 1.5 per cent of the Natural Heritage Trust is to be expended on pollution and waste related issues. The environment protection budget has been reduced by the extraordinary amount of 57 per cent between 1997-98 and 1998-99.
There is a range of quite specific measures the Commonwealth ought to be undertaking in relation to this important area of public policy. The national pollutant inventory is far too narrow. It does not involve waste transfer activity. It does not involve the registration of emissions to sewers, for example. There is a lack of funding from this government in the enforcement of Australia's international commitments to stop hazardous waste trade internationally.
There is a lack of funding for further work on the management of persistent organic pollutants. In the past, the Commonwealth has supported what is called the ANZECC schedule waste management process through an agreement with New Zealand which has sought to develop and plan for the management of old organochlorine chemicals.
Nonetheless, people in the western suburbs of Melbourne are only too starkly aware of the real situation, against a background of the Victorian state government engaging in outrageous activities by forcing local councils to issue planning permits for toxic waste dumps in residential areas. But that focuses attention on the Commonwealth's pitiful actions in relation to these important issues of pollution control. At a time when the Commonwealth is claiming to be capable of performing some sort of role in that respect through the Natural Heritage Trust, it seems to me that this is an area of public policy which the Commonwealth ought to pay very close attention to.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1998-99</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Nairn, Gary, MP",LP,1998-06-01,"—Debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1998-99  provides me with the opportunity to reflect on the positive effect responsible economic 
 management has had on my electorate of Eden-Monaro over the past 2¼ years. But allow me first to remind the House where we actually started.
Recently I was talking to a group of small business people in my electorate. I gave them this scenario. I said, `There is a business for sale. The business has a turnover of about $1.3 million. The business has experienced a loss on average of $140,000 per year for the previous five years. This business also is servicing a debt of about $900,000.' So I said to them, `Would you look at a business with a turnover of $1.3 million, losing $140,000 a year every year for the last five years, and also with a debt, an overdraft, to service of about $900,000?' Overwhelmingly the business people knew straight away that there was a real problem there and they probably would not even look at it, let alone go into any sort of negotiation to buy it.
But that is what we bought back in 1996, exactly that: Australia Inc, or the Australian government budget situation. That effectively is what we bought, translated into small business terms. Also recently I was talking with some seniors. I said to them, `How would you like a family situation such as this: income of about $35,000, a family having to take out an additional personal loan of about $2,500 every year for the past five years and also with a Bankcard bill of about $25,000?' I said to them, `Put yourself in that sort of family situation: income $35,000, going to the bank each year for the past five years and saying, ""Can I take out an extra personal loan of $2,500?"" and also having to service a Bankcard debt of $25,000.' Most of these people, who were quite senior in the community, were horrified at that sort of scenario where they could have relatives, or themselves be, in that sort of circumstance. But that also is what we took over—the family called Australia back in 1996.
Eden-Monaro is basically a mixture of small business and families. If you look at the sort of make-up that we have right throughout Eden-Monaro, that is the scenario really, the small business, family situation that we had. By winning the 1996 election, we were forced to buy that small business that I just detailed, and we were forced to take over that family situation.
Now we find with the bringing down of the budget a couple of weeks ago, three budgets later, that in fact we have turned that small business that I mentioned around, from experiencing that enormous loss year after year, into a profit making venture. We will actually make a profit this year. So within three years we have turned a loss making situation into a profit making one for a business that had been losing so much year after year for five years. This is the sort of result that no small business person would ever have contemplated when they looked at that scenario that I painted before. That has not been done just by clicking the fingers. That has been done through a lot of hard work by a lot of people. But what has it done to those small businesses and families in my electorate of Eden-Monaro as a result?
For small business it has meant that interest rates are now down to the lowest they have been for 30 years. That is an incredibly significant thing that people just cannot lose sight of. Most small businesses that are out there now that were around five or six years ago still remember the enormous interest rates that they paid, well over 20 per cent. I remember paying 21.75 per cent on my overdraft in 1990. That was a pretty hefty overdraft for a small business employing 20 to 25 people and it is something that I do not think I will ever forget in my whole life. You have to have experienced that. You have to have been in business, paying that sort of interest rate, servicing an overdraft and still trying to keep all your employees in place.
I managed to keep all my employees in place, but I still have the ramifications of that huge debt back then; so have many small businesses right throughout Australia and certainly right 
 throughout my electorate. They do not forget that situation at all. They remember those interest rates. We talk about small business rates getting up to 20.5. But that was the baseline of it. A lot of people were paying—and I remember, as I said, paying 21.75—even more than that.
—A lot of farmers were.
—A lot of farmers particularly, because they were seen as high risk, so the banks loaded on another couple of per cent. They are still trying to pay back that debt.
So one of the best things out of all of this budgetary situation that we have achieved over the last three years is to have brought those interest rates down to that sort of figure. That has made a significant difference to them. They know what that means.
The industrial relations situation that we have also brought about for small business in those 2¼ years since we won the election in 1996 is also a significant matter for small business. We need to make sure that that legislation that the Senate keeps knocking back in relation to businesses with fewer than 15 employees goes ahead. For families what this has meant—getting the budget back into surplus, paying off debt—is lower interest rates for them on their home mortgages. Probably one of the most significant aspects of a family is working on getting down that mortgage and buying the family home.
We are looking at interest rates at the lowest they have been for well over 30 years. Interest rates in the housing market have come down significantly more than the Reserve Bank rates have come down because there is competition there. Now, through the financial changes that we are making, we are seeing competition getting into the small business sector and also those interest rates coming down further.
The significance of both those issues for small business and for families is glossed over far too much. What it has meant in an electorate like mine is that we have seen now companies making decisions; they are feeling confident, with the interest rates down now for a couple of years, about going into an investment situation.
We have the Bega cheese people down there putting something like $20 million into a packaging plant to expand their export markets. They have realised the opportunities that are out there and they have gone from earning zero export dollars five years ago to something like about $15 million a year. So they have decided to make that investment because they are confident about the situation with interest rates, inflation and the stability of economics right across Australia.
We see also companies like the Cooma export abattoir which has just opened recently. The old domestic abattoir closed and we have seen it replaced with a significant investment, an enormous investment. Once again, companies are making these sorts of investments because they feel secure about the future, they feel secure about committing their shareholders to loans at reasonable interest rates, not the outrageous interest rates we have had.
These ramifications have gone right throughout my electorate. As I said, the electorate runs on small business and families. In the short time I have left, I will briefly also mention the timber industry, which is a significant industry within Eden-Monaro. I see the shadow minister for resources, the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), opposite me. He visited the timber industry in my electorate last Friday. We are in the middle of an RFA—regional forest agreement—which it is so necessary to get right for that whole south-east corner. He would have seen the devastation that has occurred over the last 10 years through policies which really 
 did not give anything to the people of the south-east of New South Wales, the people of Eden and Bombala. Bombala has really copped it over the last 10 years.
Export woodchip licences were taken away by the previous Labor government, and I do not think many people in this parliament understand the devastation that caused through that south-east corner. We got those export licences back within six months but, unfortunately, the damage was already done in the time before we got into government to fix up that problem. It is crucial that we fix up the further problem through a reasonable regional forest agreement.
Unfortunately, the state government is not helping the matter. I see today a leaked proposal by the environment minister in New South Wales, Pam Allen, to create an extra 52 national parks before the next state election, to pay off the people in Sydney, it seems. This is part of the problem we had in the RFA process there. The New South Wales government pre-empted the scientific work and declared something like 90,000-odd hectares of national park part way through. The RFA process is supposed to be science based, not politically based. But the New South Wales government decided to put in these national parks before the science was done and the socioeconomic studies were completed. They did not worry about the people of Eden and Bombala and the south-east; they just did what was necessary for the people in the concrete jungles of Sydney. That is what they did through this process. They pre-empted the whole process. It will now make it very difficult to get a decent decision out of it.
I will leave my comments there for this evening. I say in  conclusion that the appropriation bills are good bills. We have seen no tax increases in the last three budgets. That has not been done in a long time. We have seen a reduction of debt, and pressure off interest rates. All of that is good news for small businesses and families in the electorate of Eden-Monaro.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1998-99</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,1998-06-01,"—I have put on record both in this place and in the main chamber itself that  I regard as inappropriate the referral of the appropriation bills to the Main Committee. But, given the referral of these bills to this committee and given the agreement that we will all be briefer than usual, as shadow minister for resources and energy I will restrict my remarks tonight to one particular aspect of the budget as it relates to the resources and energy portfolio. Resources and energy is part of the primary industries and energy portfolio. The particular subprogram that I wish to refer to is contained within the appropriations of the Australian Geological Survey Organisation—or AGSO as it is known in the trade.
If you had reached for the budget papers at 7.30 on the relevant Tuesday night and you had read the press releases put out by the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer), you would have been forgiven for being left with the impression that AGSO had received $36.3 million additional funds for geoscientific work. That was the gloss that was put on it by the minister for resources. An amount of $36.3 million for geoscientific work is a good thing and I laud that. But, when you look at the detail, you will see that it is proposed to be expended not just for offshore petroleum—for oil and gas and condensate—but also for mineral areas onshore in conjunction with the states and the Northern Territory and the mapping accord. There are also proposals for exploration activity offshore within Australia's exclusive economic zone.
The sting in the AGSO budget, as in the resources and energy budget, is in the tail. What the minister does not tell you in his press releases, and what you need to read the fine print of the budgets papers to understand, is that on the one side you see the great lauding of this $36.3 million extra funding over four years but, on the other side, you discover that the 
 minister has, without any fanfare, announcement or detail, initiated a review of AGSO. In advance of the establishment of the review, without anyone knowing what the terms of reference are and without anyone seeing what the detail of that review will be, it has already been predetermined that it will save $11 million per year for three years. That is $33 million over three years. If you work on the basis that you get $11 million per year, and you assume that that is recurrent, that is $44 million over four years. The sleight of hand and the sting in the tail is that the Commonwealth is actually proposing to spend less on geoscientific work through AGSO over the next four years than is currently the case.
So we have two things which need to be the subject of criticism in this area. Firstly, we have an unannounced, undetailed review of AGSO, the Commonwealth's geoscientific survey agency. In advance of the detail of that review and in advance of the review itself, the minister has already determined that $33 million over three years will be taken out of AGSO funding. In the context of an alleged $36.3 million increase over four years, it is a net loss to AGSO.
The second subject of great criticism is that this is precisely that point in the cycle where a Commonwealth effort on precompetitive geoscientific work would actually be helpful. It would be helpful because it is now precisely that point in the cycle where exploration activity and effort are required for the next phase of minerals and petroleum resource development in Australia.
I might make as the starting point a quote from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in the House at question time on 28 May 1997 last year when he said that investment and mining in this country had been brought `virtually to a halt'. That was the assertion of the Prime Minister in May last year. What the Prime Minister did not tell the House on that occasion was that, at precisely that point in the cycle, if you looked at capital investment in mining and exploration activity you found that capital expenditure had been up 13 per cent to nearly $7 billion since 1992, that exploration expenditure had been up nine per cent to nearly $2 billion since 1992 and that at that time ABARE had forecast that new capital expenditure would be up 25 per cent to over $9 billion by the 1996-97 financial year.
The relevant ABARE study at that point in the cycle, the March 1997 ABARE Outlook 1997 study, said:
Over the past four years new capital expenditure in mining has increased at an average of 13 percent a year in real terms, reaching $6.7 billion in 1995-96. New investment in the metal processing sector has also been rising, up 54 per cent in 1995-96 to $2.2 billion. Similarly, the resources supporting future minerals and energy sector growth have been sustained by exploration expenditure, which has increased by an average of 9 per cent in real terms  over the past four years, reaching $1.7 billion in 1995-96.
In 1996-97, new capital expenditure in mining is forecast to increase by 25% to $9.2 billion.
So, two months before the Prime Minister had said things had virtually ground to a halt, the forecasts for capital expenditure or investment activity in petroleum and minerals resources were said by ABARE to be quite healthy. More recent statistics, such as the ABS December quarter private new capital expenditure release, which came out in late February this year, showed a 5.7 per cent real increase in mining industry investment. What we saw in the December quarter figures was that actual capital expenditure in mining had increased nearly 30 per cent in the year to the December quarter and the trend estimate for capital expenditure had been up for at least the last six quarters, and the expected future capital expenditure was also up.
The most recent ABS figures on private new capital expenditure for the March quarter, which came out last week on Thursday, 28 May—a year, almost to the day, after the Prime Minister said to the House that investment in mining activity had virtually ground to a halt—state:
In trend terms, the rate of growth of total new capital expenditure (at average 1989-90 prices) has been slowing over the past three quarters. Mining continues the pattern of strong growth evident over the past two and a half years.
Page 3 of the ABS release states:
Growth rates for expenditure by the Mining industry have been reasonably strong over the last ten quarters (between 2.8% and 7.7%). The current estimate of $2,594m is $516m (24.8%) higher than for March quarter 1997.
Bankers Trust, when commenting on the ABS release, said:
Investment in the mining sector rose by 3.1% following a 2.6% rise in the December quarter—continuing the pattern of solid investment within the sector. Investment in other selected industries . . . was flat, following a rise of 4.7% in the December quarter. In the past year, investment has risen by 2.3%, 15.7% and 0% in the manufacturing, mining and other selected industries sectors.
So, in the past year, according to Bankers Trust, investment in the manufacturing sector has risen by 2.3 per cent and investment in mining has risen by 15.7 per cent.
I detail those capital investment figures to make the point that often it is said by some, including the Prime Minister in May last year, that investment in this industry has ground to a halt. The capital investment figures belie that. That is not to say that there is not a range of issues or challenges which face the minerals and petroleum industries. There are a number of those which are worth drawing attention to. There has been a long-term decline in the commodity price cycle just about across the board so far as Australia's mineral resources are concerned. That is not just the cycle; it is the long-term trend. There has also been a long-term decline in the profits that the minerals resources sector in particular is making from invested capital.
Those capital investment figures in some respects give the lie to the old notion that capital follows profit. If you look at the Minerals Council of Australia and Coopers and Lybrand study, which comes out annually, that calculates that effectively, if you analyse the profit dividend in the minerals resources sector, the average from 1991 to now has been about seven per cent. In the last year, the profit on the invested capital was three per cent. For all the trouble that the industry has, it might just as well give the investment to you and me, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I am sure that we would be smart enough to work out that US treasury bonds and the exchange rate would give a better return than that for none of the problems. So you have a long-term potential decline in the profit made from the investment. You also have a long-term growing disinterest in resources as a vehicle for investment by institutional investors. That is reflected in that declining profit share that I have referred to.
There is also a bad market sentiment to the management of some Australian resource companies in some sectors of the industries. We have seen difficulties in gold following the RBA sell-off. We have the obvious difficulty so far as our export markets are concerned of the Asian difficulties and problems. So there is a range of long-term cyclical and structural difficulties which face our minerals and resources sector.
I was pleased to see that on 26 May the Minerals Council released a statement to coincide with its annual seminar and annual dinner which it holds in Canberra. Its executive director, Dick Wells, on behalf of the industry itself, released a statement which in part said:
The increase in competitive pressures resulting from the emergence of new low cost mineral deposits in other regions of the world, the growth in minerals supply from new sources opened up by global economic and political reforms places continued downward pressure on world commodity prices and changes the geographic flow of project funds and exploration dollars.
What is Mr Wells drawing attention to here? He is drawing attention to the fact that the chill wind of international competition is now very fiercely facing Australia's minerals and petroleum resource sectors. The competition for investment in the resource dollar is now a global competition and Australia needs to be up to the mark in that global competition. But the challenges are many and include the ones that I have referred to. Mr Wells goes on to say:
The ongoing long-term trend to lower commodity prices has meant mineral producers have had to continually improve operational efficiencies and reduce costs in order to maintain the profit margin necessary for the funding of additional developments and exploration programs.
The minerals industry understands that it does not operate in a vacuum and all that it does must occur in the context of the prevailing global and national economic circumstances. . . 
So what Mr Wells is drawing attention to, to use his words, is the need to maintain the profit margins necessary for the funding of additional development and exploration programs. He is drawing attention to the need for Australia to continue its international competitiveness in the minerals and petroleum resources sectors in general and minerals resources in particular. What does that focus on?
If you work on the basis that in the end capital funds follow exploration funds, you have got the chill wind of international competition, you have got the opening up of other countries which have previously been under exploited or under explored. You have a whole range of world class ore bodies being discovered in other countries which have not previously been kicked over by explorers. So at precisely that point in the cycle where the Commonwealth could well profit in the future by an additional extra effort in geoscientific survey and exploration activity, to provide the private sector with the best basis for proceeding with its exploration activities in the future, we find the Commonwealth doing exactly the reverse of that which it should be doing. Rather than a net increase in funds for AGSO, a net increase in funds for geoscientific work at the Commonwealth level, what we find is the Commonwealth denuding those funds and reducing them.
So, as I return to my starting point, that needs to be the subject of strong criticism in two respects. Firstly, it is the wrong point of the cycle to be withdrawing funds from geoscientific work when the Commonwealth should be increasing funds in that area; and, secondly, to predetermine in advance an undisclosed review is bad ministerial conduct and bad administrative conduct.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1998-99</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Causley, Ian, MP",NP,1998-06-01,"—I rise with some pride to support the government's budget of 1998-99 and particularly the direction in which it is certainly intended to travel. I want to make some comments on the position that we see ourselves in. I have listened with some interest to the contributions by previous members in this debate. I note in particular, I dare say, the position that has been taken by Labor Party members, in particular the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), the former Treasurer, who made a contribution to this debate and went to some lengths to explain the Labor Party position on the budgetary situation.
I have to say that, while I respect the member for Gellibrand, I think he was really saying that the former government was heading towards a position where it would have got the budget into surplus. He said, `We would have taken it gradually. We do not believe that this government is going in the right direction. We think the government is going too quickly. We were heading in that direction but we were going to take it in a gradual form.'
Of course, Mr Deputy Speaker, if you look very closely at the deficit situation of the previous government over a period of time, it was in fact adding up to a serious situation as far as Australian government debt was concerned. It was escalating at a very fast rate. There is no doubt that the electorate said in the last election that they wanted something done about this. They believed that there needed to be a reduction in this debt that was being driven and that we had to draw it back into perspective.
In fact, I asked the Treasurer (Mr Costello) a question on notice some time ago about how Australian government debt had built up over a period of time. It was very interesting to hear the reply from the Treasurer because he made it very clear that before the Whitlam era Australia had a very low level of Commonwealth government debt. In fact, it was a very small percentage of GDP. It was during the Whitlam era that Australian debt started to escalate at quite a dramatic rate. It was during the Hawke-Keating era that it really took off to where we have today a government debt close to $100 billion.
I have been in business, I understand business and I know that all businesses carry some debt. But it depends on the amount of debt that you carry as to whether you can be a viable business. There is no doubt in my mind that when you start to pay something between $3 billion and $4 billion a year in interest you are no longer a viable business. That is the position the Australian government found itself in. There is no doubt in my mind that this government had a responsibility to start to rein in that debt and to put the Australian people in a position where they did not have to pay those exorbitant amounts of interest and where they could use the money that was saved from that for the services that were absolutely necessary to the Australian community.
I have heard with some interest over the last few months the debate that has raged in this parliament, in particular from members of the opposition who have criticised the government for the winding back of some programs that they believe to be absolutely essential in our community. I dare say that members on our side of parliament probably see from time to time that some of these programs are vital. But if you do not have the money to pay for them, then you have to look very closely at where you expend the money that you have available.
The real problem is that such a profligate government preceded us. We are in a situation where we have to now draw back and say to ourselves, `We must consolidate our position before we can continue to fund some of the services that all of us might see as being fairly important in our community.' So therefore I see this budget as a very important budget. We are back in the black. That is a term I suppose that has been used fairly generally in this particular debate, but it is a very important point because we are back in surplus. It is a long time since Australia has been in surplus and we have a lot of ground to make up to draw back the debt that we have at the present time to put ourselves in a viable position.
One of the points I noted in the Treasurer's speech related to his comments on the sale of Telstra. I have heard since then some of the comments that have accrued from both the Labor Party and others to the sale of Telstra. I find some of those comments hypocritical because, having only been two years in this parliament, I certainly did hear some of the comments about 
 the sale of the Commonwealth Bank and the sale of Qantas. There are some hypocritical statements that we have heard in the past from the Labor Party about those particular sales.
One thing I want to make clear as a business person is that I have always believed that if you sell an asset then you have to reduce debt or you have to buy another asset. That is something that has never been very high in the Labor Party's priorities. In fact, in both those sales—the sale of the Commonwealth Bank and the sale of Qantas—the Labor Party used the assets in the recurrent budget and that is an absolute disgrace. It is like someone selling their own house and spending the assets, or the money accrued from those assets in one year. That is exactly what was done by the Labor Party, that is exactly what the Labor Party did in those particular sales, and that is an absolute disgrace.
The Labor Party vehemently opposes the sale of Telstra. I put to you that some of the arguments that they put forward stand some questioning. If you say on one hand that you still own two-thirds of Telstra and you are still entitled to two-thirds of the dividends from Telstra, I accept that. But I will put another point to you. Telstra at the present time is in a very competitive position. It is out there competing with Optus and with Vodafone and with probably some others who will come into this field. It is a very expensive and competitive area. Some of the technology that is available at the present time is very expensive and could cost hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars. So, while we might sit back and say, `Look, why do we need to sell Telstra because we are going to enjoy two-thirds of the benefits that will come from the dividends from Telstra?' I put to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that, if they have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars or, in fact, a billion dollars, then we are up for two-thirds of that as well.
That is something that I think the taxpayers of Australia should start to think very carefully about. Unless we do, unless the shareholders of Telstra—of which the Australian taxpayers at this particular time comprise two-thirds—spend that sort of money, then Telstra will not survive; it will go under. That is the hypocrisy of the Labor Party: they sit there and talk about this and they do not take into consideration the realities of business which are really going to drive this particular agenda. It was an agenda started by the Labor Party and, quite frankly, the agenda is now being driven by business. That is something that we must take into very clear consideration.
The Labor Party sits there and says to people like me who come from the country, `But rural Australia is going to be disadvantaged by this.' I put to you that rural Australia is going to be advantaged by technology. At the present time we have a great debate about whether analog telephones or digital telephones are the best forms of communication in the country. I say to you that neither of them are. We do not get good service from either. It may be a little bit better from analog, but we certainly do not get good service from either form of telecommunications in the country. But satellite telephones will certainly give us that advantage. Because the system is digital it will give us more than just a telephone. We will be able to access all sorts of technology through that digital system.
That is the type of system that the rural areas of Australia need. They do not want to be bogged down in the past that the Labor Party wants to set them in by saying, `You must remain with Telstra.' They want to get into the future. They want to get into the future where there is some communication. We have no communication at the present time—absolutely none. That is where the Labor Party want to leave us—in that time warp. We want to go further than that; we want to get into communications, we want to get into technology, we 
 want to go with this because that is where we are going to get some benefits as far as the rural areas are concerned.
I think this budget has addressed many areas. One of the areas that I believe is very important is the seniors card for superannuants in Australia. I have a great regard for those people because these are the people who have tried all throughout their lives to set aside something for the future, set aside something for their retirement. They have gone without. I have many people in my electorate who come to me and say, `Look, we have done without all this because we wanted to set ourselves up for our retirement.' But of course with the benefits of the low interest rates and the low inflation that we all think are great at the present time there is a double-edged sword. Those people who have set aside their income for investment are getting a very low return. Therefore, they need some benefit. The real disadvantaged people in this society at the present time are those who have tried to help themselves, who have saved and scrimped through their lives, who have set up some sort of asset and are now trying to live off that asset. I think this government has recognised that not only in this budget but in the previous budget. They have recognised that these people need to be supported because they are the real disadvantaged people in society at the present time.
I also want to mention the gold card for the returned servicemen from the Second World War. I think that there is no doubt that this government has done quite a number of things. I will say that the previous government did quite a few things for returned servicemen as well. These people have now been recognised; under this gold card they can get some benefits. It is for those who have returned—and I know there is great debate about whether you should receive it whether you were in Australia or outside of Australia; that has always been a criterion that has been debated within the Returned Services League. But this is certainly a benefit for those who have returned. It is a great step to help those people who have made a great sacrifice for this country. I am old enough to remember the Second World War. I remember the great threat that was occasioned to this country. Those people went out of their way: many of them were not asked whether they would serve; they were told that they would serve to support this country. This is the least that we can do to help them and to give them some support in their retiring years.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1998-99</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Smith, Tony, MP",IND,1998-06-01,"—Tonight I want to talk about the need for change in the Australian political landscape. I want to start by reflecting on a judgment by the late Mr Justice Murphy in a decision called the Queen v Percy Neal. Percy Neal was an Aboriginal agitator described by the magistrate in Cairns. Percy Neal spat at a white overseer. The case ended in the High Court of Australia. Mr Justice Murphy dissented, in one of his many dissents as a High Court judge. I met Mr Justice Murphy in 1982 when I was a judge's associate. He was a very nice bloke; I found him an absolute gentleman privately. Politically, it is fair to say that I and Mr Justice Murphy would have very little in common except that I had enormous respect for the fact that he, too, was one of the agitators, one of the dissenters, one of the people we need in society to challenge the system.
It is absolutely essential for a healthy and vibrant society to have people like Mr Justice Murphy. Equally, it is healthy and essential to have people challenging the system from the other side of politics. To have those sorts of challenges is not a threat to the system; it is part of the healthiness of that system. To not have those sorts of people makes the system unhealthy.
We live in an age, unfortunately, in 1998—particularly the 1990s—where to challenge the system in any way, shape or form is to be branded something: an agitator, a racist, a bigot, a redneck. There is something wrong with you if you challenge the system. You are a little bit odd. Accordingly, those who do challenge the system, unfortunately, frequently get isolated by the system. It is absolutely essential, in my view, in the Australian political landscape, that we have people who are prepared to resist the merciless attack that is made upon them by the media and the major political parties if they stand up to the system; if they say, `This system is wrong.'
Now I want to say something: this place here is wrong. When the House is sitting, this place should not be sitting. That is wrong, in my view. I would like to be down there listening to the debate about a fundamental problem going on at the moment in the world, which is the nuclear testing on the Indian subcontinent. There is a debate going on at this time that all members of the House should be addressing because it could fundamentally affect our way of life. Yet we have this little chamber here.
What is also wrong is that on this side of the building here we have only ministers instead of every one of us being in every part of the whole building. We have ministers here and members there. It is wrong, because ministers are no more important than members. Yet they are isolated from the system. The executive is somehow different from the great majority of the people who are representing the great majority of Australians. That is wrong.
Likewise we are constantly faced, as members, with the plethora of statistics that are thrown at us. The budget papers alone are a plethora of statistics. Every day we are told that statistics say this and statistics say that. There is no possible way for an ordinary member of parliament to challenge that. Yet government policy is being formulated by some of these things. Let me give you an example. Naomi Wolf wrote a bestseller called the Beauty Myth in which she said that in a particular year 150,000 American women would die of anorexia nervosa. The actual figure from American research was 54. That is a simple example in American statistics of how pathetic statistics are thrown at people and people basically accept them.
Here is one closer to home. Three or four years ago, Carmen Lawrence put out a statistic in a press release that said that 70 per cent of all police call-outs in New South Wales were to domestic violence incidents. The actual figure was 0.7 per cent. That gives you some idea. I will give a more recent example. The Minister for the Status of Women (Mrs Moylan) put out a statistic—she gave a speech to the WestNET conference a few months ago. She said that men have to stop bashing women and children. In fact, the figures, by gender, of women and men abusing children are that more women than men—it is very hard to get those statistics—are abusing children. I say at the outset that we need a major attack in this country on the accuracy of statistics so that proper policies can be formulated. That means attacking the precepts, the political correctness, the social engineering that so underlies what we say and do.
Last week we had what was, in my view, the sorry spectacle of the so-called Sorry Day. Let me say at the outset that the forcible removal of innocent children from caring parents by government or church officials is indefensible in a liberal democratic society. But it is absolutely essential that any inquiry into that matter do everything in its power to ensure that the accounts of past practices and its conclusion are beyond any reasonable question.
What does Dr Ron Brunton say about this in a very lengthy paper, an IPA backgrounder on the stolen generations report? And may I say that, without having even read his paper— 
 before I read it—having considered the stolen generation report I found it to be a very poorly written document that does not merit academic credence, that is rhetorical, that ought not to form the basis of government action. But I did not have the time to study it: that was my first impression of it. As a lawyer, you are looking for facts and something solid. Ron Brunton did have time to examine it. He was one of those who exposed the Hindmarsh Island fraud. He said this of the report:
Unfortunately, anyone who expects to find a rigorous, sober and factual assessment of the past in Bringing them home  will be sorely disappointed. The report is a most unworthy and tendentious document.
He considers the report to be poorly argued and demonstrating `considerable intellectual and moral confusion' leading to a `damned if you do/damned if you don't situation'. He says that `the report misrepresents a number of its sources and ignores crucial information, and readily makes assertions which are either factually wrong or unsupported by appropriate evidence.' He adds the most damning indictment of all:
It is one of the most intellectually and morally irresponsible reports to be presented to the Australian government in recent years.
Can we ignore that? Can we say, `We cannot talk about that issue'? The issue that we have to solve is why those things were done in the cases where they were done. We have to ensure that it does not happen again. But do we push aside this damning critique? Apparently we do not. We say, `We cannot talk about that. It is a bit sensitive. What we will do as a government is throw some money at it to try to get the people who are most raising the issue to be quiet; we'll assuage the consciences of the others and we'll try to buy a few votes elsewhere in the equation.' At the same time, as Dr Brunton concludes, we lose any authority that we have to occupy any sort of moral ground. As he says, `Too many members of the Howard government seem to have lost confidence in the moral authority of their supposed philosophical principles of liberalism, and seem to accept that they have no right to occupy the high moral ground. They need to remember that Martin Luther King's stirring wish that his children would see a time when people will not be judged by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character is a classic expression of the liberal ideal.'
How much more are we seeing this? We are seeing it in the absurd Office of the Status of Women. Why do we have the Office of the Status of Women in 1998? Why do we not have the office of the status of the family? Why are we trying to divide men and women? Why do women need protection in 1998? Women have come a long way, but why are we continuing to divide the sexes when we should be, as representatives of the people, be uniting people?
Why do we say that we are going to ensure that legislation is introduced to make superannuation fifty-fifty? Does that mean that a man can come home drunk from the pub every night, bash his wife, never do a tap of work, she works the whole time and he can claim 50 per cent of her super? Conversely, does it mean that a woman who does not provide for the home, who does not support her husband who is working, who has a multitude and string of affairs and relationships can get half of his super? What sort of a society is it when we are legislating from the state to tell people, `Notwithstanding your behaviour, you are going to part with 50 per cent of your superannuation because that is the law'? It is not good enough. This encroachment of the state into every facet of our lives effectively makes us little different to what Soviet Russia was or communist China was. The only difference is that we get a chance to vote every three years, but to hell with you after that. Many people are dragged kicking and screaming to the polling booths to vote for a very limited choice.
What are we going to do about these things? We heard the honourable member for Page (Mr Causley) talking about Telstra. I had grave reservations personally about the sale of Telstra. Unfortunately, when I had a look at the figures of the debt that had gone up sixfold between 1990 and 1996—that is our public debt—I concluded, `What can we do about that other than sell Telstra to pay it back? We cannot have $95 billion worth of public debt.' Reluctantly I concluded, as I would if it were my own situation and I had to decide whether I could keep my house going with the debt levels it had or sell part of my land to get rid of some of that debt, that I would have to make a decision to do that. Likewise, the government had to do it. I do not think it is a good thing that it has happened. But I believe that the government had to do it.
When we are talking about the debt levels, we have to ask ourselves why there are these debt levels. Why is it that we have such great levels of debt? What is happening at the other end? In relation to the tax debate, that is what we have to consider first. Surely we have to ask why it is that we need to raise so much tax to cover so much expenditure. Why is it, then, when we are spending more than $20 billion on the health system, that Kerry Packer and I can go to the doctor tomorrow for nothing? That is not right. We should have to pay to go to the doctor. I can afford to pay to go to the doctor. Kerry Packer can afford it a damned sight more. A lot of other people can afford to go to the doctor but they do not pay under this system. Why do they not pay? Because this system says that we make it fair for everybody. But it is not fair for everybody. With this system, we create a massive amount of debt and expenditure within the state that has to be paid back, or we increase our taxes to ensure that these debt levels are met.
	Do we want that to continue? Can we possibly have a tax reform structure without addressing the level of expenditure? It seems that we can; the government says that we can have tax reform without addressing expenditure levels. Yes, we have an expenditure level that has been reined in—and I give credit where credit is due. But I say this: we have a definite and urgent need in this country for a major capital works project, or several of them, to create real jobs. What are we doing about that?
What are we doing about the fact that our country is the driest country in the world? Are we looking at major capital works, something in the nature of the Snowy Mountains scheme, to do something about our dry continent? It is fundamental for the future of this country to address that need. What are we doing as urban sprawl swallows up more and more good farming land and more and more marginal land is opened up? What are we doing as our El Ninos come and go with monotonous regularity? We have not had a wet season for many years in the part of the world where my property is located. It is all changing, and we are not doing anything about it. But we have to do something about it. We have to create real jobs—not mickey mouse jobs, real jobs. We owe it to our youth to do that.
We also owe members of our society, including our youth, access to justice and an end to the division within society. In talking about access to justice, about a year or so ago I put forward a proposal to help provide access to justice to people who are unable to get access to justice because of the legal aid system cutting them out. If you are a criminal, you get it. But if you are in that middle range, just having your basic house, you get nothing and you miss out on access to justice.
My plan is very simple; it virtually will not cost the government anything. My plan is that every legal process to be filed in this country—and there are hundreds and hundreds of 
 thousands, probably millions, of legal processes which are filed—would attract a filing fee of just 50c. A fee of 50c would not hurt a soul, but all those 50c fees would amount to a great pool of money which could be replenished by people accessing that fund for damages claims and agreeing to part of any proceeds of their damages claims being taxed to the extent of a percentage going back into the fund. That is not going to hurt them. They would never have got near the court otherwise. They would have had their justice denied. But under that system which I gave to the Attorney-General (Mr Williams), they would have a chance.
There are a lot of people out there in that situation. Medical negligence is a classic case, with people not being able to get to court when serious consequences have arisen from an operation. In some cases people have died—and I have seen cases like that. There was one case in particular where a widow came to see me about her husband, and I have no doubt that there was medical negligence. But I had to tell that widow, `I am sorry, this will be a very hard case.' I gave the advice to legal aid for nothing; legal aid would not pay me for it, and it took me a week and a half to complete it. At the end of the day I had to say, `I am sorry, but this is a difficult case; sorry, no legal aid.' That woman went without access to justice.
There is a way through that, and yet we are cutting legal aid. Fine, I understand that we need to cut legal aid. But why aren't we looking at these other areas, taking the opportunity to use those sorts of things? Why aren't we opening up our minds to the fact that we need changes to the child support system, that we need to do something urgently—not just a little scraping around here and there at the edges? We need to address these situations urgently.
One chap rang me just tonight and said, `Two months ago I was up to date; today I have an $11,000 debt. Because of the way the system is calculated, I now owe $11,000. There was an error in some calculation and now I owe $11,000.' He said, `The children are well, they are healthy, they have their clothes, but I now owe a debt of $11,000. How can I possibly pay it? I'll never be able to pay it,' he said to me.
So we have all these situations that need addressing, yet we are not addressing them. We are trying to paper the edges. I get back to the fundamental issue: when I joined the Liberal Party, I believed that it addressed the rights of the individual. Now, unfortunately, I believe the Liberal Party stands for nothing.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1998-99</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Reid, Bruce, MP",LP,1998-06-01,"—It is a pleasure to speak on the appropriation bills, particularly with the national economy in such excellent shape with low interest rates, the lowest inflation rate for 35 years and unemployment below eight per cent for the first time in eight years. That puts the Australian community in a very strong position for the future, following the release of the 1998-99 budget.
The budget saw the elimination of the $10.5 billion deficit left to us by Labor mismanagement; the budget is now showing a $2.7 billion surplus, without the need by the government to impose any new taxes. This is a great result to be achieved after a little over two years of coalition government.
Australia under Labor governments, under both Prime Ministers Hawke and Keating, suffered the worst recession in 60 years. Interest rates went up nearly three per cent between August and December 1994, taking mortgage interest rates up to 17 per cent and in some instances more. More than one million Australians lost their jobs during this period, with national unemployment peaking at 11.2 per cent in late 1992.
The Keating Labor government was always a high taxing government and either increased or imposed wholesale sales tax, petrol excise, tobacco excise, fringe benefits tax, the Medicare 
 levy, motor vehicle and company taxes. During that period it drove many small businesses to the wall because of its high interest rate policy.
I have a few matters to report to the House about the state of the Bendigo electorate. The Bendigo electorate has seen many improvements over the past few years. Substantial progress has been made on our transport links, with the Calder Highway being declared a road of national importance by the federal government and the injection and commitment of funds in excess of $100 million to bring this highway up to four-lane freeway status. Telecommunications throughout the electorate has seen a vast improvement, with major upgrades of exchanges, mobile services and call centres, and the expansion of the work force in both the public and private sector.
Unemployment still remains a problem. However, there has been a vast improvement since the bad days of the ALP governments, when national unemployment did reach that 11.2 per cent figure in late 1992. The national unemployment figure at 7.9 per cent is still too high. The coalition has addressed this and introduced a number of employment programs throughout the Bendigo electorate that will have a lasting impact on our environment programs, particularly through the Natural Heritage Trust, the Green Corps, the work for the dole scheme and the black spot road safety program. They have all added to employment in our region as well as providing employment and training for the participants.
During my period as chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, I had the pleasure to be the overseer and an initiator of a lot of major improvements in the small business sector. The report that the committee made to the government on finding a balance in fair trading in Australia has brought about changes to the retail tenancy laws Australia-wide. Further progress is being made in that area. It is introducing a franchise code of conduct. It will ultimately strengthen the oil code for the petroleum industry and will provide equal protection for small to medium sized businesses in equal status with consumers and larger corporations under the Trade Practices Act for unfair or unconscionable conduct, a landmark decision after 20 years of ongoing debate and 17 early reports by governments.
Industry in the Bendigo region now has a clear path ahead, with the government's decisions on the automobile industry and the textile, clothing and footwear industry. The government's decision on the cessation of the book bounty attracted some criticism. Honourable members will recall it. However, the recent success of the book printer at Maryborough in central Victoria in winning a multi-million dollar contract to print Mills and Boon books indicates that Australia is able to compete against the rest of the world in book printing. 	Australian Defence Industries Ltd is now in a strong position as it moves towards privatisation with a new increased range of defence product, including the bushmaster vehicle and the high-speed engineered vehicle, which are both attracting attention overseas. There has been much interest in Australian Defence Industries from Australian organisations, major Australian manufacturing firms and some of the biggest defence firms in the world. I look forward now to the next stage in the privatisation process of ADI.
The Australian topographical survey establishment at Fortuna is in a very strong position for the future with the recent announcement of a $1.5 million allocation for the development of the Pararay system, which is the state-of-the-art in topographical and map making technology. Further defence expenditure during the 1997-98 budget included $8.9 million on upgrading all of the electrical equipment and mechanical services to enable this facility and 
 project to proceed. Also in the budget there was a $35 million defence multi-user depot allocation, which will be used and built in Bendigo for the use of defence department of Australia.
One thing I would like to indicate to the House is that there has been a marked increase in the population in Bendigo. I want to go back to 1997, because it is a fairly clear indication of the growth. When you look at the population of Bendigo at that time it was around 50,000. There has been a 20 per cent increase—one of the highest growth rates in Victoria—since 1976 to just under 60,000. I am talking only of the city area. The city of greater Bendigo, which extends further, is well over the 80,000 population mark. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, the population of the city of greater Bendigo between 1991 and 1996 increased by 3,786 persons. That figure beat the combined increase of Geelong and Ballarat of 3,473.
—A very active member.
—I thank the honourable member for Port Adelaide. The Bendigo electorate has shifted its emphasis somewhat away from the public sector employment into private sector employment. I am pleased to say that, as a result of this, the population is still increasing at a fairly substantial rate.
Another initiative that I was involved in was relocating the historic post office in Bendigo. That can always be a very traumatic experience. People become very attached to post offices. We relocated it with the assistance of the honourable Rob Maclellan, the state minister for planning. We moved it from Pall Mall to the corner of Hargraves Street and Williamson Street in the heart of the CBD. We converted the former post office—the old historic building is very beautiful—into a tourist information centre. I am pleased to say that it is one of the best tourist information centres in Australia.
Bendigo, Castlemaine, Heathcote and Elmore have all been recipients of substantial federal government tourism funding to develop tourism information centres and for Castlemaine and Mount Alexander there has been the opportunity to develop a major tourist attraction, a Mount Alexander diggings project. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
Leave granted; debate adjourned.
Main Committee adjourned at 10.16 p.m.

"Anderson, John, MP",NP,1998-06-01,"—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(1) Yes.
(2) (a) The matter of commercial finance is outside my portfolio responsibilities.
Matters for discussion in Cabinet are confidential.
(b) The Government has advised PIFCOL that it is unable to assist it in their request for a ""Letter of Comfort"".
(3) Legal advice obtained by my Department indicates that a ""Letter of Comfort"" which would enable PIFCOL to obtain a AAA rating could place the Government under a legal obligation to cover losses, should the organisation fail.
The Treasurer has also advised me that provision of a ""Letter of Comfort"" as requested by PIFCOL would result in shifting PIFCOL's financial risk and potential liabilities onto the Commonwealth.
The Government's approach to improving the cost of finance for all businesses is through further reform of the finance sector by implementing the recommendations of the Financial System Inquiry.
The Government's commitment to responsible macroeconomic policy, through reducing the 
 Budget deficit and committing to an inflation target, has ensured the maintenance of low inflation and continuing low interest rates. This has allowed real progress to be made in reducing business input costs and has provided a boost to Australia's international competitiveness.
The Government has also convened the Consultative Rural Finance Forum, chaired by my Parliamentary Secretary, Senator Judith Troeth. The Forum which was announced as part of the Agriculture—Advancing Australia initiative, is examining a number of issues impacting on the level of financial sector competition in rural areas. The Forum has been established to promote regular consultation between the rural sector, financial institutions and Government following a recommendation of the National Rural Finance Summit Activating Committee.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Primary Industry Financial Co-operative Limited: Submission</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,24,1,answer
