That this House:


(1) notes that:

(b) congratulates Israel on an amazing seventy years of democracy, growth and prosperity;

(3) notes that:


(a) the Australian Minister for Trade and Customs in 1938, Lieutenant Colonel T.W. White, declined to further assist the Jewish people, stating 'Australia has her own particular difficulties ... migration has naturally been predominantly British, and it (is not) desired that this be largely departed from while British settlers are forthcoming. Under the circumstances Australia cannot do more, for it will be appreciated that in a young country manpower from the source from which most of its citizens have sprung is preferred, while undue privileges cannot be given to one particular class of non-British subjects without injustices to others.

(5) notes that:


(a) in doing so, we seek to honour the memory of all those who lost their lives in the Holocaust and make right, a great wrong, perpetuated by Australia on the Jewish people;


(b) a request will be made for this motion to be presented to Yad Vashem this 70th year asking that the parliamentary apology be displayed beside Lieutenant-Colonel White's statement of 1938 that he issued on behalf of the Government of Australia; and

2 MR ENTSCH: To move:


That this House:


(1) notes that:


(a) 24 March is World Tuberculosis Day, and marks the anniversary of German Nobel laureate Dr Robert Koch's 1882 discovery of the bacterium that causes tuberculosis;


(b) tuberculosis is contagious and airborne, ranking as the world's leading cause of death from a single infectious agent;


(c) in 2016, 1.7 million people died from tuberculosis worldwide and 10.4 million people became sick with the disease, with over 60 per cent of cases occurring in countries in our region;


(d) large gaps in tuberculosis detection and treatment remain with 4.1 million cases of active tuberculosis that were not diagnosed and treated in 2016, including 600,000 children;


(e) Papua New Guinea (PNG) had one of the highest rates of tuberculosis infection in the Pacific in 2016, with an estimated 35,000 total cases including 2,000 drug-resistant cases, not taking into consideration the large number of cases that go unreported in many regions; and


(f) tuberculosis is:


   (i) the leading cause of death among HIV positive people globally—HIV weakens the immune system and is lethal in combination with tuberculosis, each contributing to the other's progress;


   (ii) now linked to non-communicable diseases like diabetes; and


   (iii) considered a preventable and treatable disease, however many current treatment tools—drugs, diagnostics and vaccines—are outdated and ineffective;


(2) recognises:


(a) the funding that Australia is providing to support the testing and treatment of tuberculosis in PNG, including the joint program with the World Bank, is already leading to an initiative to achieve universal testing for tuberculosis in Daru;


(b) the commitment of up to $75 million over five years for Product Development Partnerships in the Indo-Pacific Health Security Initiative to accelerate access to new therapeutics and diagnostics for drug resistant tuberculosis, and malaria and mosquito vector control—an increase in funding to build on the successes of Australia's previous investments;


(c) Australia's three year $220 million pledge to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (2017-2019)—a fund that has supported tuberculosis testing and treatment to 17.4 million people since 2002, including over 8.2 million people in the Indo-Pacific region;


(d) that through our endorsement of the Sustainable Development Goals in September 2015, we made a bold commitment to end the tuberculosis epidemic by 2030; and


(e) the scheduling of the first United Nations High-Level Meeting on Tuberculosis in September 2018, which will set out commitments to accelerate action towards ending tuberculosis as an epidemic and provide Australia with an opportunity to showcase the success of our investment in tuberculosis in our region; and


(3) calls on the Australian Government to attend the United Nations High-Level Meeting this year, and commit to increased Australian action and leadership on research and development, prevention, testing and treatment as part of the global effort to eradicate tuberculosis.

3 MS SHARKIE: To move:


That this House:


(1) notes that the:


(a) OECD:


   (i) calculates that the average old age dependency ratio in Australia was 25 in 2017, and is projected to increase to 41 by 2050;


   (ii) calculates that Australia's expenditure on age pensions is currently 4 per cent of public spending, and is projected to be 4 per cent in 2050—this compares with 9 per cent and 10 per cent respectively for the OECD;


   (iii) stated that 'The old age income poverty rate in Australia is high at 26% compared to 13% across the OECD in 2015'; and


   (iv) further stated that 'While taking out lump sums create flexibility in retirement it can also increase the risk of falling into poverty in case retirees outlive their assets'; and


(b) Benevolent Society:


   (i) released 'The Adequacy of the Age Pension in Australia' report in September 2016, concluding from its research that 'The Aged Pension in Australia is inadequate'; and


   (ii) concluded that 'Home ownership constitutes the single biggest factor contributing to financial hardship among pensioners. Age pensioners who are renting, in particular those who are single, are the worst off'; and


(2) calls on the Government to:


(a) establish an independent tribunal to assess the base rate of the pension and determine the best mechanism for annual review;


(b) increase the maximum rate of Commonwealth Rent Assistance to reduce the gap between aged pensioners who are home owners and those who are renters; and


(c) establish a roundtable to review services provided to age pensioners.

2 MR ENTSCH: To move:


That this House:


(1) notes that:


(a) 24 March is World Tuberculosis Day, and marks the anniversary of German Nobel laureate Dr Robert Koch's 1882 discovery of the bacterium that causes tuberculosis;


(b) tuberculosis is contagious and airborne, ranking as the world's leading cause of death from a single infectious agent;


(c) in 2016, 1.7 million people died from tuberculosis worldwide and 10.4 million people became sick with the disease, with over 60 per cent of cases occurring in countries in our region;


(d) large gaps in tuberculosis detection and treatment remain with 4.1 million cases of active tuberculosis that were not diagnosed and treated in 2016, including 600,000 children;


(e) Papua New Guinea (PNG) had one of the highest rates of tuberculosis infection in the Pacific in 2016, with an estimated 35,000 total cases including 2,000 drug-resistant cases, not taking into consideration the large number of cases that go unreported in many regions; and


(f) tuberculosis is:


   (i) the leading cause of death among HIV positive people globally—HIV weakens the immune system and is lethal in combination with tuberculosis, each contributing to the other's progress;


   (ii) now linked to non-communicable diseases like diabetes; and


   (iii) considered a preventable and treatable disease, however many current treatment tools—drugs, diagnostics and vaccines—are outdated and ineffective;


(2) recognises:


(a) the funding that Australia is providing to support the testing and treatment of tuberculosis in PNG, including the joint program with the World Bank, is already leading to an initiative to achieve universal testing for tuberculosis in Daru;


(b) the commitment of up to $75 million over five years for Product Development Partnerships in the Indo-Pacific Health Security Initiative to accelerate access to new therapeutics and diagnostics for drug resistant tuberculosis, and malaria and mosquito vector control—an increase in funding to build on the successes of Australia's previous investments;


(c) Australia's three year $220 million pledge to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (2017-2019)—a fund that has supported tuberculosis testing and treatment to 17.4 million people since 2002, including over 8.2 million people in the Indo-Pacific region;


(d) that through our endorsement of the Sustainable Development Goals in September 2015, we made a bold commitment to end the tuberculosis epidemic by 2030; and


(e) the scheduling of the first United Nations High-Level Meeting on Tuberculosis in September 2018, which will set out commitments to accelerate action towards ending tuberculosis as an epidemic and provide Australia with an opportunity to showcase the success of our investment in tuberculosis in our region; and


(3) calls on the Australian Government to attend the United Nations High-Level Meeting this year, and commit to increased Australian action and leadership on research and development, prevention, testing and treatment as part of the global effort to eradicate tuberculosis.

   (ii) calculates that Australia's expenditure on age pensions is currently 4 per cent of public spending, and is projected to be 4 per cent in 2050—this compares with 9 per cent and 10 per cent respectively for the OECD;


   (iii) stated that 'The old age income poverty rate in Australia is high at 26% compared to 13% across the OECD in 2015'; and


   (iv) further stated that 'While taking out lump sums create flexibility in retirement it can also increase the risk of falling into poverty in case retirees outlive their assets'; and


(b) Benevolent Society:


   (i) released 'The Adequacy of the Age Pension in Australia' report in September 2016, concluding from its research that 'The Aged Pension in Australia is inadequate'; and


   (ii) concluded that 'Home ownership constitutes the single biggest factor contributing to financial hardship among pensioners. Age pensioners who are renting, in particular those who are single, are the worst off'; and


(2) calls on the Government to:


(a) establish an independent tribunal to assess the base rate of the pension and determine the best mechanism for annual review;


(b) increase the maximum rate of Commonwealth Rent Assistance to reduce the gap between aged pensioners who are home owners and those who are renters; and

CREATION OF THE MODERN STATE OF ISRAEL: Debate to be resumed on the motion of Mr Robert—That this House:


(1) notes that:


(a) 14 May 2018 is the 70th anniversary of the creation of the modern state of Israel, a seminal event that occurred in 1948; and


(b) congratulates Israel on an amazing seventy years of democracy, growth and prosperity;


(2) recognises that 15 July 2018 marks the 80th anniversary of the end of the fateful Évian Conference, convened by President Roosevelt in 1938 in Évian-Jes-Bains France, with 31 countries, to discuss the issue of the plight of Jewish refugees fleeing the horror of Nazi persecution;


(3) notes that:


(a) the Australian Minister for Trade and Customs in 1938, Lieutenant Colonel T.W. White, declined to further assist the Jewish people, stating 'Australia has her own particular difficulties ... migration has naturally been predominantly British, and it (is not) desired that this be largely departed from while British settlers are forthcoming. Under the circumstances Australia cannot do more, for it will be appreciated that in a young country manpower from the source from which most of its citizens have sprung is preferred, while undue privileges cannot be given to one particular class of non-British subjects without injustices to others. It will no doubt be appreciated also that as we have no real racial problem, we are not desirous of importing one by encouraging any scheme of large-scale foreign migration…I hope that the conference will find a solution of this tragic world problem';


(b) post Kristallnacht, when the Nazis burned Jewish synagogues, businesses and books, Australia did reassess its policy to admit 15,000 refugees over three years, compared to the previous quota of 1,800 per year;


(c) an estimated 6 million Jews and millions of others died during the Holocaust, exacerbated by the failure of Australia and other nations of the world to more fully protect the Jewish people; and


(d) Lieutenant-Colonel White's statement on behalf of the Government of Australia is still visible at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem, as a representative response for all other nations' responses of indifference at the Évian Conference;


(4) states that this Parliament, as representative of all political parties and the people of Australia, issues a profound apology and says 'sorry' to the Jewish people for the indifference shown by the Parliament in 1938 that worsened the impact of the Holocaust; and


(5) notes that:


(a) in doing so, we seek to honour the memory of all those who lost their lives in the Holocaust and make right, a great wrong, perpetuated by Australia on the Jewish people;


(b) a request will be made for this motion to be presented to Yad Vashem this 70th year asking that the parliamentary apology be displayed beside Lieutenant-Colonel White's statement of 1938 that he issued on behalf of the Government of Australia; and


(c) this motion will be provided to the Knesset this 70th year, one parliament to another.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2018-02-28,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon—Minister for Social Services) (09:32):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


This bill will establish a two-year trial of drug testing for 5,000 new recipients of Newstart allowance and youth allowance (other) from 1 July 2018.


This is another component of a suite of measures announced in the 2017 budget to strengthen and simplify the welfare system. These changes will help people with drug abuse issues to get treatment, rehabilitate and get a job.


Research shows us that substance abuse is directly impacting the ability of some jobseekers to undertake job search or other activities to get them into work.


The community has a right to expect that taxpayer-funded welfare payments are not being used to fund drug addiction and that jobseekers do all they can to find a job. We don't want our welfare system subsiding drug dealers.


The welfare system is designed to provide a safety net for those who find themselves out of work or unable to participate in the workforce—not to help perpetuate people's drug habits.


The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's 2016 National Drug Strategy Household Survey shows that those who were unemployed were three times more likely to have recently used drugs such as ice and other amphetamines than those who were employed.


For too long, not enough has been done to try and deal with the real connection between drug abuse and unemployment.


While there are some existing mechanisms in place for identifying jobseekers with substance abuse issues and assisting them to seek treatment, the data clearly shows that more needs to be done to help these people.


The trial established by this bill will assess the use of drug testing as a means of identifying jobseekers with substance abuse issues that may be preventing them from finding a job, and supporting them to get treatment.


Importantly, the drug testing trial is complemented by the government's other substance abuse measures.


This includes, for the first time, ensuring that all jobseekers are able to undertake drug or alcohol treatment as an approved activity in their job plan. 


Since the commencement of that measure on 1 January 2018, 259 Stream A and B jobseekers have had drug or alcohol treatment included in their job plan. 


Other measures to ensure jobseekers with drug or alcohol abuse issues remain connected to their employment services provider are contained in the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017 currently before the Senate. 


Measures include removing exemptions from mutual obligations due to drug and alcohol use, and tightening the use of drug and alcohol issues as a reasonable excuse for not meeting obligations. 


These measures are scheduled to commence on 1 April 2018, subject to the passage of the bill. 


Together, these measures recognise that supporting jobseekers to address their substance abuse issues through appropriate treatment is a crucial first step to getting a job. 


Supporting jobseekers to take action to overcome their substance abuse will improve their chances of finding a job. This will benefit not just the jobseekers themselves but also their families, the wider community and the economy. 


The trial will operate in three locations: Canterbury-Bankstown in New South Wales, Logan in Queensland and Mandurah in Western Australia. 


Trial sites were chosen based on careful consideration of the available evidence and data, including: the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission's National wastewater drug monitoring program report; the AIHW's 2013 National Drug Strategy Household Survey; state and territory government crime statistics in relation to drug use and possession;  state and territory government hospitalisation data; and administrative data from the Department of Human Services. 


For the trial to be robust and successful, the government identified locations with varying profiles and sufficient support services. 


To complement this, the government has announced a dedicated treatment fund of up to $10 million to support jobseekers in the drug testing trial across all three locations.


The government will establish this fund to provide for additional treatment support in the trial locations where the existing state or Commonwealth services and supports are not sufficient to meet additional demand as a result of the trial. 


This is in addition to the almost $685 million the Commonwealth government has already committed over four years to reduce the impact of drug and alcohol abuse on individuals, families and communities. 


This includes an investment of almost $300 million over four years as a part of the National Ice Action Strategy to improve treatment, after-care, education, prevention, support and community engagement to tackle ice. 


Comprehensive rules will be set out in a legislative instrument relating to any additional illicit drugs tested for and the protocols for conducting the drug tests, including safeguards to ensure that testing is conducted appropriately and in accordance with relevant standards. 


This legislative instrument will provide the flexibility to ensure that expert advice from the contracted testing provider and the drug and alcohol sector can be taken into account in developing these protocols and safeguards. 


An exposure draft of the Drug Test Rules was tabled at the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee's public hearing into the welfare reform bill on 30 August 2017, and feedback has been gathered for input into further development of the rules. 


There will be appropriate consequences for people who deliberately miss an appointment without a reasonable excuse or refuse a drug test in order to avoid a possible positive result. 


If a jobseeker refuses to take a drug test, having acknowledged that they may be required to do so as part of their condition of payment, their payment will be cancelled and they will not be able to re-apply for a four-week period. 


Jobseekers who test positive to a drug test will have their payments placed on income management. This is designed to restrict their access to cash and limit their ability to use their payments to fund further harmful drug use, while not reducing the amount of payment they receive.


Jobseekers who test positive will also be subject to a second drug test within 25 working days and may also be subject to further subsequent tests. This will help to identify those for whom drug abuse is an ongoing problem that may require treatment.


Jobseekers who test positive to more than one drug test during the trial will be referred to a Department of Human Services contracted medical professional with experience in drug and alcohol treatment, who will assess their particular circumstances and identify appropriate treatment or support options.


If the report from the medical professional recommends treatment, the jobseeker will be required to participate in one or more treatment activities to address their substance abuse as part of their job plan. 


This could include activities such as rehabilitation, counselling or case management.


This trial is not about penalising jobseekers with drug abuse issues. It is about finding new and better ways of identifying these jobseekers and ensuring they are referred to the support and treatment they need. 


This measure has been specifically designed as a trial so we can assess the value of drug testing jobseekers as a way of identifying those for whom drug abuse might be a barrier to work and supporting them to undertake treatment.


There will be a comprehensive evaluation of the trial to determine which aspects have been successful in addressing welfare recipients' substance abuse and barriers to employment. 


The drug testing trial will test an innovative method of assisting people with drug abuse issues.


I ask the opposition and the crossbench to support this trial, as it will find ways to support and treat people with substance abuse.


It is imperative that we help these people so that they can find work and not live their lives on welfare.


Be brave enough to change your mind, because if we always do what we've always done then we will always get what we've always got, and that is simply unacceptable.


The government wants to ensure that the welfare system provides strong incentives for people with substance abuse issues to get treatment, rehabilitate and find a job.


Debate adjourned.

Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (13:30):  My community is home to a large Cambodian population, and I'm honoured to represent them here in this place. They are a peaceful people, they are wonderful contributors to our area and I count many of them as friends. I was proud to stand with 23 of them who drove a bus here to Canberra in December to protest against the denial of basic political rights and freedoms in Cambodia. One of the most basic rights is the right to peacefully protest. The non-violent voicing of dissent is a foundation of decent democracies like ours.


That's why I was so appalled to hear Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen's disgraceful, despicable, deplorable threats of violence against those who will voice their concerns when he visits in March. It's not acceptable for a national leader to say things like, 'I will follow you and beat you at home,' and, 'I will go to your houses and seize you.' This is a guy who has cracked down on media and NGOs in his country, dissolved the opposition party and arrested its leaders. I want to say to the Cambodians in my community and, indeed, right around Australia: you have every right to protest peacefully in this country. On your behalf, we condemn Hun Sen's threats in the strongest possible terms and we stand with you in your struggle for the basic political rights that you and your loved ones are being denied.

 (Wentworth—Prime Minister) (14:01):  The honourable member opposite knows full well that we are seeking to pay for the NDIS, which the Labor Party did not fund and which needs the guaranteed financial security Labor would not provide it with. We are seeking to do so in precisely the same way that the Labor government did in part when they were in power. 


But the honourable member asked me about big corporations and inequality. Well, most people, when they go snorkelling on the Barrier Reef, pay for it themselves, but not the Leader of the Opposition. Oh, no! We heard the indignation about Point Piper, the suburb I lived in. He's down on those millionaires in Point Piper, but he wasn't above taking thousands of dollars from the Australian Conservation Foundation. Geoff Cousins reported on the trip that they funded for the Leader of the Opposition, which was only disclosed after Mr Cousins came out with his report. It was amazing! 


Now, what was the name of that other donor to the Leader of the Opposition? Unibilt? Was that a donor that only came out after the event? Well, there's a bit of a pattern there!

The SPEAKER:  Could the Prime Minister resume his seat for a second. Whilst I'm appreciative that the Prime Minister's got off the previous topic, he's now onto another topic that I—



Honourable members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  Well, I don't think the question related to jobs. 




Mr Shorten:
  Wages growth!



The SPEAKER:  Wages growth, certainly. There was wages growth, large companies and tax increases.




Mr TURNBULL:
  Wages growth is driven by the laws of supply and demand. If there is no demand for the jobs of coalminers, their wages won't go up. There is no better way to stop—



Ms Butler interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Griffith is warned.




Mr TURNBULL:
  the growth in coalminers' wages than to do precisely what the Leader of the Opposition has done, which is to tell the miners he backs them when he is there on the picket line, but then, secretly, with a donation from a Point Piper millionaire—ooh they are dreadful people!—go up to the Barrier Reef and give a commitment to revoke the licence.

Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (15:14):  There are actually only five sitting days left before the Treasurer will deliver the 2018 federal budget—and that's if the budget date doesn't change without the Treasurer knowing it again, but, working on the published schedule, that is the case. Australians would hope and expect that their government brings down a budget which helps them with their concerns. In my experience, Australians are very understanding. They don't expect miracles from government. Australians don't expect the government to fix all their problems. Australians don't expect the government to wave a magic wand and improve their lives overnight. But Australians expect a government which understands their problems and tries to help them deal with the challenges in their lives, not make things harder for them. Australians want a government that's dealing with low wages growth and with concerns about job insecurity, casualisation and rising inequality in Australia. They want a government that actually gets these things and knows that there are policies that can be put in place which make a contribution to helping.


This government has got answers and it's got policies which no doubt we'll see again in the federal budget. They've got an answer on low wages growth: that is, to stand aside and let people who work on the weekend have a wages cut. That's the policy of this government. That's their answer to low wages growth: to actually reduce people's wages. And it gets worse. Their other answer to people on low and middle incomes who are worrying about where the wages growth is going to come from and how they're going to make ends meet to match their cost-of-living increases is that they want a tax rise for them. Anybody who earns more than $21,000 and less than $87,000 will get a tax rise if the Treasurer gets his way. That's what the Treasurer thinks: they don't pay enough. He wants more.


But the government have more answers for the Australian people about these challenges. They say they've got a plan. It's a great plan! What they're going to do is give a $65 billion tax cut to big business, and don't worry: it's going to trickle down to you. It's going to trickle down to people on low wages. They say that's their answer to wages growth, and they talk about the United States, because they say it's a good idea because President Trump's done it. That's the government opposite. They say it'll lead to increased wages because it has in America. That's what they say. The Treasurer says it and the Minister for Finance says it.


Let's just take a few moments of the House's time to look at that argument. They talk about Walmart—not famous as a best-practice employer—and say they've increased their minimum wage from $9 to $11. The government will tell you it is because of United States tax cuts. I wonder if the government also therefore says the tax cuts are responsible for Walmart laying off 10,000 workers at the same time. That's what is happening in America as we speak. Target had already increased their minimum wage to $11 before the tax cut had come into place, and many analysts say that Walmart would have struggled to get people to come and work for them with Target paying more. Kimberly-Clark, at the same time in the United States, is in the process of sacking 13 per cent of its workforce. Those tax cuts are working great for jobs and growth, aren't they?


That's the best that this government can come up with: an attempt to see it trickle down through osmosis, hope and prayer that somehow this will create jobs and growth. There is no requirement on businesses to increase wages and no requirement on businesses to invest. There is no obligation on businesses for them to get the tax cut—no, just a straight blank cheque and, 'Please, it would be great if you invested some of this; we don't want you to give it to share buybacks, but you can if you want to.' That's what's happening in the United States: more and more share buybacks as a result of the tax cuts.


The Treasurer's great myth, which he was perpetuating a few moments ago at the dispatch box, is that he tells us it's all paid for because it's in the budget. It's a great revelation the Treasurer gave us at question time—that it's in the budget! Of course it's in the budget; it's his budget and his policy. But just because you write something in the budget doesn't mean it's paid for. He argues that the NDIS wasn't funded. It was in the budget. He argues that the Gonski funding package wasn't funded. It was in the budget too. If the Treasurer applies his own logic, his argument collapses on other matters. The fact of the matter is that the corporate tax cut is unfunded and the budget would be $65 billion better off if they didn't proceed. That's the fact of the matter.


Then, of course, as I said before, we have personal income tax. Personal income tax is, of course, something we hear about a lot. The Treasurer said just late last year that it was their intention to provide income tax relief wherever and whenever possible. Well, they are providing income tax relief—I give them that—wherever and whenever possible for people who earn more than $180,000. That's all they're doing. If you earn $21,000, the government don't believe in personal income tax relief; they believe in a personal income tax rise of $300 a year for a moderate-income earner. Seven million Australians will pay more tax under this government compared to the policies of the Labor Party.


We saw some modelling, some analysis—and I use that term extremely lightly—that the government was referring to about Labor policies which was conducted not by the PBO but by the PMO, the Prime Minister's office. It was conducted not even by the Treasurer's office but by the Prime Minister's office. This so-called analysis conveniently ignored the fact that the Labor Party believes in lower taxes for people on low and middle incomes.


This is a government that does not believe in lower tax; it believes in different tax. They don't believe in shrinking tax; they believe in changing tax. They make a big point about increasing the tax threshold from $80,000 to $87,000. They say that was their 'great big tax cut'. Well, the fact of the matter is that if you earn $85,000, when you take into account that tax cut and the Medicare levy increase, you are worse off by $200 a year. Those people will say to the government: 'Next time, please don't bother helping. Thanks very much for the tax cut: we're $200 a year worse off because of the two successive budgets! Next time you have a bright idea, please keep it to yourself.'


This is a Treasurer for whom consistency is not a strong point. He has argued for an increase in the GST. He has argued for state income taxes—that was a doozy! He's argued for swingeing income tax cuts at the same time as arguing for an income tax rise if you earn between $21,000 and $87,000. But the one thing he is consistent on is that people in the top tax bracket deserve a tax cut, that big business should get a tax cut, but people on low incomes should get a tax rise. We do not agree and we will oppose the government on all those measures—because we have a different set of values.


As I said at the outset, the Australian people expect their government to understand their concerns—not to conduct miracles, not to wave a magic wand, but to understand their concerns and try and deal with them. Under this government, the Australian people know that the real value of their pay packet is going backwards. The cost of things like electricity and private health insurance is skyrocketing. We have a housing affordability crisis and plummeting home ownership, particularly for young people. We have household debt at record levels—the highest in the OECD—and we have record unemployment and job insecurity. 'Weighing up all the policy options, what could we do to deal with these things?' the cabinet say as they sit around thinking of new policies. They say, 'We will give big business $65 billion and we hope and pray that they will invest it and increase wages'—when all the evidence and experience from overseas suggests that may very well be a forlorn hope.


We need to ensure that our 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth continues—that is the responsibility of this House. But it needs to continue fairly. We need to see that growth shared across our community and shared across the country. We need to see the people in the regions benefiting from that growth. As my friend the member for Rankin pointed out last week, the people of Townsville believe in economic growth, they deserve economic growth, and our plan is to deliver a much bigger dividend for them than any $65 billion corporate tax cut ever will. People in the regions deserve a youth unemployment rate that is not above 20 per cent. The people of Australia's regions deserve to know that their children can get jobs. I'll tell you what, a $65 billion tax cut isn't going to do that, a $65 billion tax cut isn't going to deliver on those hopes and aspirations. What a $65 billion tax cut for big business will do is see shareholders, many of whom are overseas, better off, with no obligation for them to invest in this country, no obligation for them to make a decision to create jobs or increase wages, just a cheque from Malcolm Turnbull.

  A cheque from the Prime Minister. I'll tell you damn straight, we have a different idea, we have different plans. We won't go along with their $65 billion tax cuts for big business, we won't go along with their tax rise for low- and middle-income earners and we won't go along with seeing penalty rates cut. We will stand against them at every opportunity.

Mr LAUNDY
 (Reid—Minister for Small and Family Business, the Workplace and Deregulation) (15:24):  Well, there you have the current baton carrier for the New South Wales Liberal Party—Labor Party.




Honourable members interjecting—





Mr LAUNDY:
  Jump sides! Jump sides! Only on the weekend we read of the inspiration for the member for McMahon's economic career, Paul Keating. It's, what, half past three? Can you imagine Paul Keating, that battler for the westie out there in Bankstown, sitting in his Eames chair at Potts Point, in his Louis Vuitton robe and Gucci loafers—and, as it's 3.30, with a glass of sherry—listening to that? I know the member for McMahon's heart's not in it. I know his agenda. I know his heart's not in it, because, when it is, he rallies to the cry. You can't hear yourself over the top of his cheering for what he actually believes in. The reason you can't hear it now is that he doesn't believe in what he is saying. To argue that the $65 billion tax cuts are for the big end of town, when half of them go to small and family businesses, is just lunacy in the extreme. It is economic vandalism writ large. 


The reality of business in this country—I said it the other day—is that it doesn't exist in a vacuum. Businesses interact with businesses irrespective of size. We caught up with Qantas's Alan Joyce last Friday. There are 3,000 small and family businesses in their supply chain. That is how it works when you reduce tax, and the member for McMahon believes it in his heart of hearts. He has written it in books, time and time again. The quotes get regurgitated back at him at this dispatch box time and time again. And, in saying it, he was right. He was right. When you stand up—



Dr Chalmers interjecting—




Mr LAUNDY:
  I wasn't here, Member for Rankin! When you stand up and you say that you don't want to give tax cuts to big businesses but then argue that they won't interact with small businesses, you're just ignoring the reality. It's not trickle-down economics; it's the truth. It's how the economy functions. Those on the other side have written book after book, book after book, about this being the case. 


The first and last great reforming Treasurer, who the member for McMahon is so keen on, got it. He not only got it but he did it. And what happened? The economy was reformed. It works. Those on the other side are looking at big business in isolation. You are completely ignoring the fact that the economy is a dynamic and vibrant thing and ignoring interactions between companies.


As I said, many small and family businesses are in supply chains. At that Qantas hangar last week, I heard of a Toowoomba family that Qantas have given a go to. They used to get their planes painted offshore. A Toowoomba family has been given the chance of a contract to paint Qantas's planes—a small contract to start, but, if they can deliver consistently and on time, they will get a bigger bite of the cherry. I heard from Qantas that Cape Grim beef from Tasmania is served on their planes, along with wine from around Australia. They are actually the third biggest consumer of Australian wines, after Coles and Woolworths. The majority of those wineries are small, family owned businesses up to medium-sized businesses. There is this lunacy that happens in this place too often of defining the size of a business by turnover. 


I had a guy come up to me in my electorate a couple of weeks ago. He is a luxury car wholesaler. He works from his kitchen table at home, with a mobile phone as his instrument of trade. He sells, in a good week, three to four prestige cars, and in a bad week he sells a couple. He makes between 55 grand and 155 to 200 grand a year. He turns over $15 million to $20 million a year. He does not have one employee. He works on wafer-thin margins. Turnover to define business size in this country is absurd. If you turn over $10 million and run at two or three per cent—



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr LAUNDY:
  You can't argue that turnover is a part of this equation, along with arguing that businesses don't interact. I know the member for McMahon is being dragged there kicking and screaming, but then you get loony left policy being dictated by Sally McManus, being repeated within 48 hours by the member for Gorton and then wending its way into official Labor Party policy at the National Press Club.


There have been these figures of 20 per cent as the increase in company taxes and two per cent as the increase in wages in the last 12 months. Of that 20 per cent, the overwhelming majority—more than two-thirds of it—came in the December quarter of 2016 when commodity prices, especially for iron ore and coal, nearly doubled. In fact, the last two quarters of company tax profits in this country have actually gone backwards. If the system of minimum wage increases proposed by the Leader of the Opposition, which is purportedly supported only lukewarmly—and the member for Rankin and the member for McMahon, in their defence, have back away from these comments—is not decided by the independent umpire but by lunatic 28 per cent increases mandated in the minimum wage, you will have businesses across the board going out of business, and employees will be the losers, along with those business owners.


You are talking about irresponsible economic policy being made up because the Leader of the Opposition has become so weak internally that he has had to embrace the left wing of the Labor unions. That's the reality of it. The Leader of the Opposition, when he was the assistant Treasurer in this country, the minister responsible, espoused time and time again exactly what the member for McMahon has espoused in his career, along with what the former member for Blaxland did and delivered when he was in government in the late eighties to early nineties. This is the problem, and the problem is simple: there is a misunderstanding on that side. Some of them get it, but they've been hamstrung by those above them to fall into line with policy.


This policy and the platform that they are talking about is dangerous to the economic wellbeing of this country. If you attack business in this country, irrespective of size, you are by default attacking its employees. Any attempt to pit workers against employers is another frustration. It is the politics of envy. The reality, especially in small and family business land, is that the most valuable asset small and family business owners have at their disposal is their staff. They get it. They operate side by side with them on the front line. They go to their weddings, their christenings, their birthdays and their funerals. The staff on the front line of small and family businesses become a quasi part of the family. That is exactly what we are talking about. That is how business operates in the real world.


The proposed policies of those opposite, should they be elected, will go from minimum wage increases to completely tearing up and rewriting the industrial relations laws in this country to give their union mates unfettered access to labour markets across the board. Why? It is because the union model is broken. Unions now represent less than 10 per cent of the workforce in the private sector in this country. Unions are telling the Leader of the Opposition loudly and clearly that they need a new business model. The problem is that the policy platform that this team is describing will not only give them a new business model but, at the same time, unleash industrial wars the like of which we have not seen in this country since the 1970s. The result of that will be that businesses will close, irrespective of size. The real losers will be the workers—the people that those opposite purport to represent.


This is the reality of what goes on. The sad part is that I know the sensible economic minds on that side absolutely agree with what I'm saying, because they've said it time and time again. They've now been hamstrung by positions where they have to fall back and tow the company line. The real economic plan, as I keep saying, lies with lowering tax—both company and personal, irrespective of size—across the board so that this economy can be unleashed and its productive capacity harnessed. Wage increases will follow, and those employees across the country will be far better off.

"Chalmers, Jim, MP",ALP,2018-02-28,"



Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (15:34):  I don't know about you or the colleagues, but my favourite part of an otherwise pretty disappointing question time from those opposite was when the Prime Minister came to the dispatch box. He had all of that preening self-regard which explains the last 27 consecutive Newspolls. He had the tea pot; he had the sugar bowl; he had the glasses off, held with the thumb. There was all of the explaining about how he was suddenly the king of consistency. This is the guy that's turned his back on the republic, turned his back on climate change and turned his back on all the things he said on Q&A that he once believed in lecturing the Australian parliament about consistency. 


As the member for McMahon rightly pointed out, to give the Prime Minister his due there is one thing that he has always been consistent about. Since he's been in this place and before that, he has had one objective alone, and that is to favour the top end of town at the expense of middle Australia. This has been his agenda for as long as he's been in here. He will always go for the top end of town because he doesn't understand the people in this country who work and struggle for a living to provide for their families. They camouflage their company tax cut and their tax cuts for millionaires with all this flowery language that what they actually want is increases in wages and for blue collar jobs to be created. But we know from those 27 consecutive Newspolls that the Australian people know better. 


I was up in Townsville with the outstanding member for Herbert on Thursday and Friday. The Leader of the Opposition was up there earlier in the week. The member for Blaxland was up there last week. We go a lot to Townsville, in the member for Herbert's electorate. When I was up there with the member for Herbert, speaking with businesses and the local community, I was wondering why the Prime Minister and the Treasurer don't go to Townsville. They are hardly ever up there. We're up there all the time, as you know. I think the reason is that if they tried to go to Townsville and say, 'Guess what? We think that the big business tax cuts will flow through to your wages, people of Townsville,' they would get laughed out of town. That's why they don't go to Townsville. The people of North Queensland can spot a fraud a mile away and they know this argument is fraudulent. 


This is a con job about company tax cuts trickling down to people who work and struggle. This government look around and see record low wage growth, record high household debt, no consumption in the economy, rising inequality. They look around and see that, and they say that the main challenge that we need to deal with in this country is that currently multinational corporations from overseas pay too much tax in Australia. That's their conclusion when they see what's going on. They look around and they want us to believe that if they shower largesse on the top end of town it will miraculously trickle down to everybody else. That hasn't worked overseas and it hasn't worked here. We have 20 per cent growth in profits at the moment and two per cent growth in wages. That shows that a tax cut of this nature will not necessarily flow through. After all the lectures about a budget emergency they also want us to believe that all of a sudden there's a spare $65 billion lying around. They've used that budget emergency to justify hacking at the social safety net for people who need a bit of government support. 


We don't support this $65 billion ram raid on the budget for three reasons. It's unfair: it preferences the top end of town at the expense of middle Australia. It's unwise, because even the Treasury modelling says the benefits will be negligible and way down the track and we can't direct this money towards investing in the productive side of the economy. And it's unaffordable because it does even more structural damage to the budget, when we already have record debt which is growing faster per month than it was under Labor, which had to deal with the global financial crisis. 


We welcome a debate about these choices in the economy. It's all about getting the best value for money and growing the economy the right way. On this side of the House we choose to invest in people and their productivity and their infrastructure. We choose not to smash people's disposable incomes, their living standards and the demand in the economy by jacking up tax on seven million workers or taking away penalty rates. Those opposite make a different choice. They choose a tax cut for big foreign multinational companies. Their approach sows the seeds of division in this country by favouring one small group at the expense of everyone else, when we should be coming together and recognising that the only growth worth a cracker in this country is inclusive growth which doesn't leave people behind. We should be realising that a first-rate First World economy like ours needs growth to be inclusive. It needs work to be rewarded and it needs a decent social safety net as well.

Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks—Assistant Minister for Finance) (15:39):  We stand in the House today in an environment where we have just seen a year of the greatest job creation in Australian history—the biggest year ever for the creation of Australian jobs. In this House all of us should be praising the efforts of industry, the efforts of government and the efforts of everyone who has contributed to this extraordinary result. What we have seen in the past 12 months is that every single day, on average, more than 1,000 new jobs were created, and three-quarters of them are full-time. This is a phenomenal outcome, and it's something of which this government is justifiably proud, because those opposite had a very poor record on job creation when they were in office. 


We are creating jobs at a rampant speed. Part of the reason that's occurring is this government's very strong policies in relation to economic growth. Among them, most importantly, is business tax reductions. It's already happening, no thanks to those opposite. What happened last year, you'll recall, is that the government said, 'Let's reduce company tax rates for businesses with a turnover of between $2 million and $50 million.' You know what those opposite said? They said no. They said those businesses were too large. They described them as multinationals and as businesses that were undeserving of any tax support. It's very important that people understand the impact that these tax cuts are already having, because we already have a situation where there are literally millions of businesses in Australia with between $2 million and $25 million of turnover that have had—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Coulton
):  Will the member for Lindsay take that conversation outside. She is disorderly where she is at the moment. 




Mr COLEMAN:
  We're already seeing the benefits of these tax cuts, because smaller businesses are already paying only 27½ per cent. But those opposite voted against that. They said that for a business with $2.1 million of revenue—which probably has, on average, a profit margin of maybe five per cent, which means it makes $100,000, which is about the same as the average household income across Australia—that should not be allowed. They voted against it, and it's very important that people understand that. They said small and medium-sized businesses shouldn't be provided with tax relief. Presumably, they are therefore going to increase taxes on those millions of businesses that are already benefiting from tax reductions. 


We are seeing that the proof of the pudding is in the eating with the massive job creation that's occurring in this economy today, which is an objective fact. It's important that that tax relief is extended to more businesses, because larger businesses also employ millions of people. Those opposite might not understand that, they might not want to acknowledge that, they might not appreciate that, but it happens to be true. Larger businesses employ millions of people. The argument of those opposite appears to be that tax reductions make no difference to the level of investment. Think about that logically, because that's what they're saying. They're saying that if you reduce the level of corporate tax it does not flow through to increased investment and more jobs. That's what they're saying. The logical conclusion is that those opposite would say, 'The tax rate doesn't matter at all.' They're basically saying that, regardless of the level of tax, corporations will invest the same amount of money. That is plainly absurd. 


We've seen the US cutting their corporate tax rate down recently to 21 per cent. The UK is at 17 per cent and even France is going down to 25 per cent. But those opposite say that every business with $2 million or more of turnover should pay 30 per cent tax. That is a bad strategy for the Australian economy. This government understands how to create economic growth. There was 19 per cent growth last year in exports of rural products because of those blockbuster free trade agreements that this government has got into. There was $75 billion worth of infrastructure investment, putting to shame the appalling record of those opposite with delay and delay and delay in those critical infrastructure projects—like Western Sydney Airport, which will create thousands of jobs and is so important for my home state of New South Wales. 


We know that those opposite used to support company tax cuts, because the shadow Treasurer said reducing company taxes 'promotes investment, creates jobs and drives growth'. He's 100 per cent right. He should be true to his convictions and get the opposition to support these important reforms.

Dr ALY
 (Cowan) (15:44):  I'm very proud of my community of Cowan. They're a strong community, a resilient community and a community that truly embodies the heart of this great nation. When I go out and speak to the people of Cowan and talk to businesses, individuals, families and working parents, what do you think it is that they say to me? Do you think they say to me that what they want from this government is big tax cuts for foreign multinational businesses and millionaires? Do you think that the people of Cowan tell me that they want to pay more personal income tax in order to fund tax cuts for millionaires? Do the people of Cowan, and indeed the people of Western Australia, say that they want their wages to continue stagnating while watching this out-of-touch government back cuts to weekend penalty rates and give a $65 billion bonus to big business? No, that's not what they're saying. That's not what they want.


This government keeps crowing on about how great it is at financial management. I say to it: tell that to the people of Western Australia, where the former WA Liberal-National government's financial recklessness has just been exposed in a recent report. That report, the Langoulant report, exposes the worst case of financial risk in the granting of billions of dollars of contracts with no business case. Guess who that report implicates? None other than the current federal Attorney-General, who as WA Treasurer in the Barnett government failed to heed warnings of falling GST share, spent at a rate higher than WA's economic growth and increased spending by 10.8 per cent while revenue grew only by six per cent.


It doesn't stop there, because it seems that this federal Treasurer is working from the same playbook when it comes to economic mismanagement. For a start, he can't make up his mind on tax, revenue or spending. He fails to heed the advice of the RBA governor about the danger of funding company tax cuts through higher budget deficits and government debt. He continues to spruik the myth of trickle-down economics, as did the minister in his previous contribution today.


Trickle-down economics has actually never been tested in its purest form, so there is actually no real evidence to support it as an effective way to stimulate growth and jobs—or 'jobs and growth', as those on the other side would say. Former US Presidents Reagan and Bush were renowned for their belief in trickle-down economics, but what happened there? In both cases the exact opposite occurred. In fact, income inequality worsened, and between 1979 and 2005 after-tax household income rose by just six per cent for the bottom fifth. It sounds okay—the bottom fifth got a six per cent rise in their income—until you see what happened for the top fifth. The top fifth's income increased by 80 per cent. The top one per cent actually saw their income triple. So, instead of trickling down, the prosperity trickled up.


This is the road that this government wants us to go down. We have the Prime Minister going and rubbing shoulders with the President of the United States and coming here and saying that this is an economic model for Australia. Well, I don't think Australians want to be Americans. I can only wonder how this government is just so out of touch with everyday Australians that it continues its sole focus on these tax cuts for big business and millionaires.


Australians aren't stupid. They certainly aren't stupid enough to fall for the snake oil con that somehow, just somehow, they're going to be better off when big business gets tax cuts and when millionaires get a tax break. They're smart enough to know that under this government they've seen the real value of their pay packets go backwards, as the cost of living continues to increase while their incomes stagnate and they face job insecurity and underemployment. Australians are smart enough not to trust this government and this Treasurer to deliver a real policy agenda that prioritises their needs for lower energy costs, affordable health insurance, affordable housing and some relief on housing debts.

Mr WALLACE
 (Fisher) (15:49):  It's interesting that those opposite come in here today and try to rubbish our economic plan. The reality is that we have record jobs growth. You can't argue with the facts: 403,100 jobs have been created over the last 12 months. That's a little over 1,100 jobs each and every day over the last 12 months. I know that's an inconvenient truth for those opposite, but the facts remain the same. You don't like hearing about that—1,100 jobs. This government places great importance on everyday average Australians, and everyday average Australians are the beneficiaries of those 1,100-plus jobs every day.


Let's contrast that with what those opposite are doing under the Leader of the Opposition. They will be introducing $150 billion of extra taxes. There's no doubt that those opposite subscribe to the Jeremy Corbyn and the Bernie Sanders schools of economics. We stand for mums and dads. We stand for small business. We stand for jobs. Those opposite have absolutely no clue. They lead with their chins. They come in here and they bring butterknives to gunfights. It's quite amazing. Let's look at what those opposite stand for. Those opposite stand for a protection racket for you know who—a protection racket for the CFMEU. I notice that some of those opposite here today were proudly sitting in the Federation Chamber just a couple of days ago with their CFMEU badges on. They're not wearing them now. In his address to CFMEU workers at the Oaky mine, Mr Shorten said:



You should also say to your families that Bill and Brendan—


sounds like some sort of a movie—


have the highest respect for the mining and engineering division of the CFMEU. These people will be with you the whole way, always have been and always are, always will be. If we form a government, yeah, we'll do the right thing, we won't let you down.


For some of us who are a little bit more suspicious of the Leader of the Opposition, I'd say that he's up to no good, he's offering them all sorts of skulduggery.


Let's look at a recent case about the CFMEU. The CFMEU are the gift that keeps on giving, and yet those opposite still continue to come in here and support them—not only wearing their badges and but also taking their money for Labor Party donations. In a recent matter, just a couple of days ago, Federal Court judge Richard Tracey reiterated previous court findings that the CFMEU showed a repeated disregard for the law, spending millions of dollars of union funds on penalties when the money could have been used to benefit their workers. I've got some interesting figures here. Those opposite might be interested to know this. The ABCC told the court in that same matter that the construction and general division of the CFMEU's Victoria-Tasmania branch received revenue of $30.9 million in 2016. There would be many businesses in Australia that don't receive that sort of money. It had a net surplus of $226,000 and net assets valued at $58 million. Is it any wonder that the CFMEU treats fines imposed by the courts as the cost of doing business—as the cost of running a protection racket for the continued thuggery of its officers. (Time expired)

Ms HUSAR
 (Lindsay) (15:55):  I just want to remind the good member for Fisher that nowhere in this MPI did it talk about the CFMEU or unions; it actually talked about defending the government's own $65 billion cuts. But not one of the government's speakers has been able to get up there and speak in defence of these cuts and why they are good for this country. 


When it comes to being out of touch with the needs and realities of everyday Australians, this Prime Minister could win a Golden Globe award, a Logie—you name it. He could take the cake for it when he swans in here from his digs in Point Piper, his very modest accommodation, with his high-fibre NBN connection that gets him the most reliable speeds of anybody in this country. I've lived in Lindsay my whole life, and we're often subject to unfavourable stereotypes. Well, for the benefit of those opposite, including the member for Fisher, let me run through some of the ways in which the people in my community are more hardworking, more real and more deserving of some of this out-of-touch Prime Minister's investment. 


The cost of living in Lindsay is three per cent higher than that in the Prime Minister's electorate. Why? It is because we have so few local jobs that local residents can work in. Every household and every family needs two cars—one for each adult. When you travel to work you also get to pay the M4 toll, which is a bonus, because that road was paid for many years ago. We like the freeway. The member for Macquarie likes the freeway. We like the extension. But what we don't like is having to pay for a road that has already been paid for—and we don't want to pay for it for another 43 years! 


This was an abject failure of the Abbott government. When Labor supported the project, when we were in government, we did so with a caveat that we would not hand out any Commonwealth money if the New South Wales Liberals insisted on a toll. In walked Tony Abbott and, voila, just like that, the caveat was ripped up in favour of the toll operator, and we got the toll back. Of course you don't need to own a car to go to work. You could squish yourself onto one of the Western Sydney overpacked trains—very reliable, hardly ever air-conditioned in 47-degree heat; that's fine—but only after you drive to the train station! There's no equity in public transport. 


If you go to work, you'll have your penalty rates cut after the government take an axe to the industrial relations system—day after day after day. They hate unions and they hate workers. They'll cut your penalty rates. They expect you to work more hours for the same amount of money or less. They also don't want you to have a secure job, with casualisation taking over every industry that's out there. If you do have a job, you'd better hope your company isn't too reliant on energy, because your job will be even less secure. 


The cost of electricity has skyrocketed under these Liberals, and households and businesses are paying through the nose, especially in Sydney, where we've seen increases of close to $1,000 in four years. We were hoodwinked by this government. We were told it was all because of the carbon tax. Well, the carbon tax has gone but the prices are still rising every day. There is no energy policy for businesses, which is creating uncertainty, and you certainly don't hire people when you do not know what the future holds. 


For households, another thing chewing through their declining pay packets is the real cost of health insurance, which seems to favour the shareholders rather than the policyholders. The costs rise, value for money decreases and ordinary mums and dads can't afford to keep paying. We have plummeting home ownership—the lowest levels we have seen in decades—rentals that are priced out of ordinary pay packets and no real plan to tackle any of this. There is no investment and no idea about how the other half lives. 


With so much opportunity to help people, particularly those in Western Sydney who are already facing a high cost of living and reduced opportunity, why is this government focused on cutting Western Sydney University to the tune of $98 million, which is the highest cut to any university, cutting $21 million to every public school in our community and not investing in the most under pressure hospital in New South Wales? Well, it's no surprise, because it's too busy supporting a $65 billion tax cut to those who least need it, expecting it to trickle down the line and result in some kind of support in the take-home pay packets of people in my community. 


This government has no policy agenda to prioritise the everyday Australians who need support. At a time when this government has seen the budget deficit grow to $23 billion under its watch—which is quite ironic, given it is forever passing itself off as the best friend to Australia's economic bottom line—its $65 billion tax cut is unaffordable, and we will fight it. We will fight it for people in electorates like Herbert, Macquarie, Lindsay, Chifley and Cowan—for ordinary Australians. 


What a shame our Prime Minister is so inspired by the Trump administration and wants to follow his lead. What will inspire him next? Will it be a US-style medical system where the rich get cured, an education system where the wealthy and those born to privilege are educated, or even, heaven help us, a US-style industrial relations system where there is no minimum wage? While this merchant banker looks after his mates—multinationals and millionaires like his banker mate Mike Baird—with tax cuts, he's happy to fleece ordinary taxpayers. We on this side of the House will not stand for it. We will fight every day for the people who elected us to be here.

"Henderson, Sarah, MP",LP,2018-02-28,"



Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (15:59):  I'm not going to try to deal with the nonsensical contribution from the member for Lindsay. She talked about us trying to crash the industrial relations system in this country and yet, as the Leader of the Opposition has made clear, that is his absolute intention. What's quite confusing about this MPI, the government prioritising big business over ordinary Australians—I don't think members opposite realise this—is that big business employs half of all ordinary Australians. Big business employs millions of Australians. In deserting big business, in saying to businesses across Australia, whether they be small, medium, family or large, as the Leader of the Opposition has, 'We are going to create a war on business; business is going to get nothing from us,'  Labor is sending a very strong message. It's sending a message to the workers in the steel manufacturing companies, the mines, Bunnings and Qantas that they don't matter. That is the bottom line with this opposition. Half of all Australians work for large Australian companies. Ninety per cent of workers in this country work for private companies. This opposition is so dangerous in its loony left policies that it is willing and advocating to drive up the minimum wage by 30 per cent, which even it knows will destroy thousands of jobs across this country. Frankly, it is an embarrassment. The member for Rankin is sitting there, having written all the member for Lilley's speech notes promising four surpluses that never actually occurred, and sniggering. We have committed, as confirmed by the Parliamentary Budget Office, that we will be in surplus by 2021. We are on track to deliver that. We are actually going to have our company tax cuts paid as part of our budget forecasts. Frankly, the member for Rankin sitting there sniggering really just shows the embarrassment of what his contribution was when the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government was in power. 


I do feel for the shadow Treasurer, the member for McMahon, who has been completely rolled by the left of the Labor Party, by the Jeremy-Bernie-loony-left economics of Labor. The great economic messiah of the Labor Party, who talked about company tax cuts, who talked about the importance of what that would do for jobs and investment and growth and business confidence, that was backed by the Leader of the Opposition, has been rolled by the member for Sydney. The loony left of the Labor Party is coming at him in force and the member for McMahon is slinking around the boardrooms of Australia saying, 'Don't worry, fellas, we will deliver the company tax cuts. Just stay quiet. I know and you know that we need these company tax cuts for Australia, but we just have to run our agenda to get into power, then everything will change.' It is absolute hypocrisy. As the member for Reid has said in this debate, it's quite clear that the shadow Treasurer, here in the House, does not believe a word he has spoken. 


We need company tax cuts to make us internationally competitive. The Treasury modelling has shown this will add $30 billion in additional revenue and increase our GDP by 1 per cent. As the Governor of the Reserve Bank said in the public hearing before the House Economics Committee that I proudly chair, 'The worst thing we can possibly do is rack up more debt and deficit.' That's what the Labor Party's agenda is: more debt and deficit. They went to the last election with $16 billion more deficit to contribute to the economy. As the Governor of the Reserve Bank also said, 'The best way to combat inequality is to deliver jobs.' 


We are delivering jobs in spades: 403,000 more jobs in the last year, the best jobs growth on record. That is 1,100 jobs a day. Already we are seeing in some sectors of the economy a tightening of the labour market, which the Governor of the Reserve Bank has identified quite clearly and objectively. In contrast to the loony left policies of Labor, we are delivering for jobs and for the economy.





The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Coulton
):  Before I call the member for Herbert, I will remind the member for Chifley and the member for Rankin that a friendly reminder from the chair should be taken notice of, because there are other mechanisms to make sure that there is order in this House.

"O'Toole, Cathy, MP",ALP,2018-02-28,"



Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (16:05):  Let me be very clear: there is absolutely nothing confusing about this MPI. There is absolutely no doubt that the Turnbull government is a government for the top end of town. You only need to look at the coalition's track record in Townsville to know that this is a government that does not care about regional Queenslanders, as identified by the member for Rankin. This government does not care about families, it does not care about pensioners and it certainly does not care about workers.


Let's just look at the evidence regarding the Abbott-Turnbull governments' record in Townsville. Townsville's unemployment rate when Labor left federal government in 2013 was lower than both the state and national averages. Now Townsville's unemployment rate is higher than the state average and almost double the national average. Townsville's unemployment rate has almost doubled under the Abbott-Turnbull governments.


Under the previous Labor government, manufacturing in Townsville soared. When Labor left federal government in 2013, more than 8,400 people were employed in the manufacturing industry. But, under the Abbott-Turnbull governments, manufacturing has nosedived and we have seen job losses of more than 3,000. The manufacturing industry made up eight per cent of our local employment, but under the disastrous coalition governments manufacturing jobs and industry have spiralled down to 4.9 per cent. These were good-quality jobs, and now they are gone under the Abbott-Turnbull governments.


Then there has been the complete and utter decimation of our construction industry. Just yesterday, the Townsville workforce report commissioned by TP Human Capital showed that Townsville had 442 fewer construction industry business registrations last year than in 2012. That's a drop of 15.7 per cent. That's more jobs gone from Townsville under the Abbott-Turnbull governments.


Then let's look at the retail industry. The retail industry can often be a good yardstick to measure whether an economy is thriving. However, in Townsville, the workforce report clearly indicates that Townsville is not thriving, because we have lost 153 retail business registrations between 2012 and 2017. That's a fall of 17 per cent. That's more jobs gone. Let's not forget the coalition government's job cuts to the public sector: 110 ATO jobs gone, 50 Defence jobs gone and 40 aviation jobs at 38 Squadron gone. The coalition is a government of job cuts.


Whilst this government is killing industries and jobs in Townsville, it is giving big business a $65 billion tax cut. That shows the absolute nerve of the Turnbull government—giving big business a $65 billion tax cut and increasing taxes to low-income workers. Under this government, anyone earning between $21,000 and $87,000 a year will pay more income tax. Under the Turnbull government's plans to increase the Medicare levy, millionaires get a tax cut of $16,400 while someone earning $60,000 gets a tax hike of $300. This is a government for the top end of town, and regional Queenslanders have had enough. I will fight tooth and nail in this place every single day against the Turnbull government's job cuts and big business tax cuts.


Labor is committed to Townsville, and only Labor will deliver jobs for Townsville. Labor has committed $200 million to hydro power on the Burdekin Falls Dam. Labor has committed $100 million to address our long-term water security infrastructure. Just last week, Labor committed $75 million for the port expansion project, a commitment that will deliver more than $580 million in benefits to our regional economy. Labor has a jobs plan for Townsville.


The Turnbull government is out of touch and, frankly, doesn't appear to give a damn about pensioners, workers or families. It is completely unacceptable for a government to think that it's okay to give a $65 billion tax cut to big business while workers are struggling, penalty rates are being cut, people are flat out putting food on their table and pensioners in my community can't turn their air conditioners on because they simply can't afford the electricity bill. This government is beyond out of touch when it comes to regional Queensland.

"Wilson, Tim, MP",LP,2018-02-28,"



Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (16:09):  I've got to say the very tone and tenor of this motion is patronising. It's patronising from the very get-go, saying that the government is prioritising big business over 'ordinary Australians'. It's patronising because those opposite clearly don't have the most basic understanding of economics—that people pay taxes. So when you say, 'Reduce tax rates on businesses that are held and owned by people,' what you're actually saying is that people who have shares in publicly listed companies are not ordinary. I think that's a pretty spectacular proposition to put forward. When it comes down to it, we have hundreds of thousands of Australians who are self-funded superannuants, who stand on their own two feet and don't draw from the taxpayer for their basic livelihood. They are apparently, according to the modern Labor Party, not ordinary. I note everybody on the other side has basically left the chamber now. They are saying to pensioners who support their incomes with savings or shares that they also are not ordinary.


But perhaps the greatest hypocrisy in this motion comes from its mover, the shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen. He got up and moved this motion, so I thought, 'I wonder if he owns any shares and whether he, according to this motion, is not ordinary.' It's funny. If you go through his history, he was one of the people elected in 2004. You may recall that any member of parliament elected after 2004 no longer gets the defined benefit scheme for their superannuation. They have to hold an account with an industry fund, a retail fund or a self-managed superannuation fund to take care of their security. And, yes, Mr Bowen does have a superannuation fund. He does. So, if you and go check the register of interests, by his own standard he apparently is not ordinary, just like every other Australian he has slurred as part of this motion. In the end, it comes back to a basic principle of economics, which is that only people can pay taxes. There can be legal structures where people facilitate and organise economic activity, but only people pay taxes. By moving this motion, the shadow Treasurer has said that millions, if not all, Australians are not ordinary.


Now let's look at the simplistic lack of understanding from the shadow Treasurer and others in comparison to what this government is actually trying to do. It's actually trying to create jobs and opportunities to build this nation's future. It is actively working to try to make sure the investment necessary to build the economy is there in an increasingly globally competitive environment. It's actually delivering. It's actually creating the economic environment for the private sector to create hundreds of thousands of jobs. In fact, at the moment, we're talking about 1,100 jobs per day throughout the entire year of 2017. We had an annualised growth rate of 2.8 per cent, something that delivered enormous benefit to actual ordinary Australians. I say that without any sense of criticism, because ordinary Australians are the people who build this country. Ordinary Australians are the people who work, who save and who build their own future. Ordinary Australians are people, through their savings, who invest in this country, buy shares and find opportunities to create wealth for their families and their own security. Ordinary Australians are the people who actually benefit from the measures that are being implemented by this government. Ordinary Australians are the people who the Turnbull government is explicitly focusing on to make sure that people have those opportunities that those on the other side would rather deny. Instead, they're focusing not on ordinary Australians. What they're focusing on—and they always have and they always will—is the interests of the people who pay the salaries to stack their membership in the trade union movement. Ordinary Australians stand up against them and defy their interests.

Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (16:17):  These bills give effect to the government's announcement in their 2017-18 budget of the establishment of the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation. The corporation would operate an affordable housing bond aggregator and administer the National Housing Infrastructure Facility. The bond aggregator is intended to bring together the lending requirements of multiple community housing providers and finance those requirements by issuing bonds to institutional investors. Let me make it clear that the Labor Party supports the bond aggregator. In fact, this announcement came after Labor's housing affordability announcement in April last year, in which we announced that we would establish the bond aggregator to increase investment in affordable housing. So we are very glad that this idea has been taken up by the government. We welcome it and support it. 


We announced that the bond aggregator would help community housing providers access cheaper finance for new affordable rental housing. The housing bond aggregator would directly source cumulative funds from wholesale markets on behalf of community housing providers by issuing bonds to private investors. Funds raised by bonds issued could then be loaned to providers. The National Housing Infrastructure Facility is intended to provide financial assistance of up to $1 billion in the form of concessional loans, grants and other financial instruments. The facility comprises $600 million for concessional loans, $225 million in equity investment and $175 million in grants. 


The bill sets out the corporation's functions, which are, primarily: to make loans, investments and grants to improve, directly or indirectly, housing outcomes; to determine terms and conditions for these loans, investments and grants; and to provide to registered community housing providers business advisory services and other assistance in capacity building. The bills state that the Treasurer may give the board of the corporation directions about the performance of the NHFIC's functions, which constitute the investment mandate. The investment mandate may include directions about the strategies and policies to be followed for the corporation to function effectively; decision-making criteria for making loans, investments and grants; granting financial assistance to the states and territories; providing services and assistance to community housing providers; and risks and returns relating to the corporation's investments. The bill also establishes the corporation's board, whose members must have appropriate qualifications, skills and experience in one or more of the following fields: banking and finance; law; housing, including social or affordable housing; infrastructure planning and financing; local government; or public policy.


When the infrastructure facility was first announced last year, we did raise concerns that this was a $1 billion slush fund for the coalition. Treasury officials at Senate estimates said nothing had been set in stone and there would be flexibility in how the allocation of these funds would take place. Now we have received some degree of comfort from the investment mandate direction exposure draft, which suggests this is less likely to be the case. Concerns do remain over the extent to which the facility will actually contribute to increasing the housing stock, particularly affordable housing, as opposed to facilitating greenfield development of new private-market owner-occupied housing or new private-market investment or rental housing. We will suggest in the other place that there be a short Senate inquiry, which will in part go to this issue.


Given that we don't have any major issues with these bills, we won't be opposing them in this place. To be very clear, though, any housing affordability package or strategy which the government claims to have is simply a grab bag of ill-thought-out measures. Just last week the International Monetary Fund released the latest Article IV consultation with Australia. The Treasurer liked some of it, but he was not quick to point out a press release which said that the IMF had endorsed the Labor Party's policy, in effect, of changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax. The IMF surmises that the Commonwealth's housing tax settings favour leveraged housing investments in upswings that might encourage excess demand for housing—a point that we have been making for years. The Treasurer also failed millions of young Australians when it comes to adequately dealing with housing affordability. He has seen an Australian economy and housing market which is locking out young people from the housing market.


The IMF report expressly states:


On the investment side, the combination of high capital gains discount rates and unlimited negative gearing can encourage leveraged real estate investment in market upswings. While similar tax incentives are also present in other countries, they tend to be more limited …


This adds to the long list of bodies which have supported negative gearing or capital gains tax reforms. The IMF goes on to say that the capital gains tax discount on housing should be reduced and other tax incentives limited. It is a very clear position from the IMF. The other tax incentives are, of course, negative gearing, and our policy is, of course, to limit it to new housing only.


The IMF also adds that the government budget position is predicated on a rapid rebound of nominal growth at the time when the government's unfunded company tax cut will deliver a structural hit to revenue over the medium term. I also make the point, as I said before, that the IMF is one of a long list of organisations, experts and individuals who've called for negative gearing reform. This list includes, but is not limited to, the OECD, the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, the Grattan Institute, the Reserve Bank, former Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens and, indeed, former Treasurer Joe Hockey, who stood opposite during his farewell speech, before Labor had announced its policy, and called for exactly this policy to be introduced. The only people who don't seem to get it are the cabinet, who just simply refuse to deal with negative gearing, despite reports that the Prime Minister and Treasurer went to cabinet with a proposal to reform negative gearing—and they got rolled in the cabinet.


Any housing affordability package which doesn't include negative gearing reform is a damp squib, and it gives false hope for young people. We have the most generous property tax concessions in the world, and they should be reformed. You should not get more support from the taxpayer to buy your fifth, sixth or seventh home than you do to buy your first. It is warped. It provides warped incentives in the market. It distorts the market and provides an encouragement to overleverage. We have one of the highest household debt rates in the world—certainly in the OECD. If we wonder why that's the case, it's in part because we have the most generous property tax concessions in the world.


We provide more support to property investors through the tax system than any other country does, and that encourages leverage. It encourages people to buy more houses and to borrow more money for investment purposes, and that leads to the risk of financial instability. It leads to concerns that, should there be a change in the market, should there be a downturn, should there be an increase in unemployment, should there be increases in interest rates of some substantial proportion, that would lead to instability, which is in part due to the very high household debt in Australia. So there are multiple reasons to reform negative gearing and there are multiple reasons to reform the capital gains tax discount. 


We believe in budget repair which actually has a positive social outcome. The government believes in budget repair which does not deliver a positive social outcome—quite the contrary. They believe in cutting the age pension by changing indexation. They believe in scaling back support for families on low and middle incomes. They believe in all those things. But, where you have a proposal which would put first home buyers on a more level playing field, which would help with financial stability but which would provide a very strong return to the budget, particularly over the medium term, over the decade, the government reject it. They say: 'That's not good enough. It might improve the budget, it might improve housing affordability, it might actually deal with some elements of financial instability, but we don't like it.' That is because they are not prepared to take political risks. 


We've got a Prime Minister and a Treasurer who lack ticker when it comes to reform. They will not do negative gearing reform, and they should. Instead, they search around for measures like this, which are not objectionable in and of themselves, like most of the measures the government embraces, but which simply don't add up to much. They are not a reform package. They are not changes which will see people on low and middle incomes find it easier, young people in particular, to get into the housing market. They are simply not. What they are is a grab bag of measures cobbled together as an attempt to look like the government's doing something. Remember our old friend the assistant minister who said in the lead-up to the budget that the housing package reform would be amazing in its scope, breathtaking in its reform, unbelievable in its achievement? Expectations management was never his strong point. But this was the point he was making—he was suggesting that we would have a massive reform program. Of course, none of that happened. Instead we had the grab bag of measures, the minor matters involved in the budget, which amount to not very much at all. The Treasurer is casting around—



Mr Husic interjecting—




Mr BOWEN:
  As my friend the member for Chifley reminds the House—and I'm in his debt for doing so—the government instead attempted a scare campaign on negative gearing, and said it would crash the housing market. The Minister for Home Affairs said it would crash the stock market. And all the time they were sitting on that Treasury advice which said, 'Actually, Treasurer, that's not true. That's not the case.' Treasury made it very clear in their briefing to the Treasurer that they weren't entirely opposed to Labor's package. They could see the strong points in Labor's package. They didn't see that it was going to crash the stock market. 




Mr Husic:
  Any sledgehammers?




Mr BOWEN:
  They didn't see a sledgehammer. The Treasurer is very quick to trot out Treasury advice when it suits him. He's very quick to trot out advice which is actually from his own office when it suits him, but where he's got Treasury advice which contradicts him, he sits on it. Not only does he not release it; the government resists ferociously the FOI requirement and sits on it. It took two years to get that out of FOI. I give credit to the ABC for getting an FOI from the Treasury, eventually, released in January. The Treasurer still hasn't dealt with it, still hasn't provided commentary on it, still hasn't answered the questions about why he misled the Australian people, contrary to the advice he had. He knew what he was doing. He knew what he was saying was not true. Instead, he engaged in the scare campaign. 


The Australian people can look at both sides of politics and say, 'Well, maybe we don't endorse every single policy element of the Australian Labor Party,' and they're entitled to make that judgement, 'but the Labor Party has a very comprehensive housing affordability plan and the Liberal and National parties do not.' They do not care about housing affordability. They believe in a scare campaign. Their believe that their priority is to scare people about the impact of Labor's policies. We believe our priority is to put first home buyers on a more level playing field. On that basis, we do not oppose this legislation in the House, but we call on the government to do so much more.

Concerns do remain over the extent to which the facility will actually contribute to increasing the housing stock, particularly affordable housing, as opposed to facilitating greenfield development of new private-market owner-occupied housing or new private-market investment or rental housing. We will suggest in the other place that there be a short Senate inquiry, which will in part go to this issue.


Given that we don't have any major issues with these bills, we won't be opposing them in this place. To be very clear, though, any housing affordability package or strategy which the government claims to have is simply a grab bag of ill-thought-out measures. Just last week the International Monetary Fund released the latest Article IV consultation with Australia. The Treasurer liked some of it, but he was not quick to point out a press release which said that the IMF had endorsed the Labor Party's policy, in effect, of changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax. The IMF surmises that the Commonwealth's housing tax settings favour leveraged housing investments in upswings that might encourage excess demand for housing—a point that we have been making for years. The Treasurer also failed millions of young Australians when it comes to adequately dealing with housing affordability. He has seen an Australian economy and housing market which is locking out young people from the housing market.


The IMF report expressly states:


On the investment side, the combination of high capital gains discount rates and unlimited negative gearing can encourage leveraged real estate investment in market upswings. While similar tax incentives are also present in other countries, they tend to be more limited …


This adds to the long list of bodies which have supported negative gearing or capital gains tax reforms. The IMF goes on to say that the capital gains tax discount on housing should be reduced and other tax incentives limited. It is a very clear position from the IMF. The other tax incentives are, of course, negative gearing, and our policy is, of course, to limit it to new housing only.


The IMF also adds that the government budget position is predicated on a rapid rebound of nominal growth at the time when the government's unfunded company tax cut will deliver a structural hit to revenue over the medium term. I also make the point, as I said before, that the IMF is one of a long list of organisations, experts and individuals who've called for negative gearing reform. This list includes, but is not limited to, the OECD, the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, the Grattan Institute, the Reserve Bank, former Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens and, indeed, former Treasurer Joe Hockey, who stood opposite during his farewell speech, before Labor had announced its policy, and called for exactly this policy to be introduced. The only people who don't seem to get it are the cabinet, who just simply refuse to deal with negative gearing, despite reports that the Prime Minister and Treasurer went to cabinet with a proposal to reform negative gearing—and they got rolled in the cabinet.


Any housing affordability package which doesn't include negative gearing reform is a damp squib, and it gives false hope for young people. We have the most generous property tax concessions in the world, and they should be reformed. You should not get more support from the taxpayer to buy your fifth, sixth or seventh home than you do to buy your first. It is warped. It provides warped incentives in the market. It distorts the market and provides an encouragement to overleverage. We have one of the highest household debt rates in the world—certainly in the OECD. If we wonder why that's the case, it's in part because we have the most generous property tax concessions in the world.


We provide more support to property investors through the tax system than any other country does, and that encourages leverage. It encourages people to buy more houses and to borrow more money for investment purposes, and that leads to the risk of financial instability. It leads to concerns that, should there be a change in the market, should there be a downturn, should there be an increase in unemployment, should there be increases in interest rates of some substantial proportion, that would lead to instability, which is in part due to the very high household debt in Australia. So there are multiple reasons to reform negative gearing and there are multiple reasons to reform the capital gains tax discount. 


We believe in budget repair which actually has a positive social outcome. The government believes in budget repair which does not deliver a positive social outcome—quite the contrary. They believe in cutting the age pension by changing indexation. They believe in scaling back support for families on low and middle incomes. They believe in all those things. But, where you have a proposal which would put first home buyers on a more level playing field, which would help with financial stability but which would provide a very strong return to the budget, particularly over the medium term, over the decade, the government reject it. They say: 'That's not good enough. It might improve the budget, it might improve housing affordability, it might actually deal with some elements of financial instability, but we don't like it.' That is because they are not prepared to take political risks. 


We've got a Prime Minister and a Treasurer who lack ticker when it comes to reform. They will not do negative gearing reform, and they should. Instead, they search around for measures like this, which are not objectionable in and of themselves, like most of the measures the government embraces, but which simply don't add up to much. They are not a reform package. They are not changes which will see people on low and middle incomes find it easier, young people in particular, to get into the housing market. They are simply not. What they are is a grab bag of measures cobbled together as an attempt to look like the government's doing something. Remember our old friend the assistant minister who said in the lead-up to the budget that the housing package reform would be amazing in its scope, breathtaking in its reform, unbelievable in its achievement? Expectations management was never his strong point. But this was the point he was making—he was suggesting that we would have a massive reform program. Of course, none of that happened. Instead we had the grab bag of measures, the minor matters involved in the budget, which amount to not very much at all. The Treasurer is casting around—



Mr Husic interjecting—




Mr BOWEN:
  As my friend the member for Chifley reminds the House—and I'm in his debt for doing so—the government instead attempted a scare campaign on negative gearing, and said it would crash the housing market. The Minister for Home Affairs said it would crash the stock market. And all the time they were sitting on that Treasury advice which said, 'Actually, Treasurer, that's not true. That's not the case.' Treasury made it very clear in their briefing to the Treasurer that they weren't entirely opposed to Labor's package. They could see the strong points in Labor's package. They didn't see that it was going to crash the stock market. 




Mr Husic:
  Any sledgehammers?




Mr BOWEN:
  They didn't see a sledgehammer. The Treasurer is very quick to trot out Treasury advice when it suits him. He's very quick to trot out advice which is actually from his own office when it suits him, but where he's got Treasury advice which contradicts him, he sits on it. Not only does he not release it; the government resists ferociously the FOI requirement and sits on it. It took two years to get that out of FOI. I give credit to the ABC for getting an FOI from the Treasury, eventually, released in January. The Treasurer still hasn't dealt with it, still hasn't provided commentary on it, still hasn't answered the questions about why he misled the Australian people, contrary to the advice he had. He knew what he was doing. He knew what he was saying was not true. Instead, he engaged in the scare campaign. 


The Australian people can look at both sides of politics and say, 'Well, maybe we don't endorse every single policy element of the Australian Labor Party,' and they're entitled to make that judgement, 'but the Labor Party has a very comprehensive housing affordability plan and the Liberal and National parties do not.' They do not care about housing affordability. They believe in a scare campaign. Their believe that their priority is to scare people about the impact of Labor's policies. We believe our priority is to put first home buyers on a more level playing field. On that basis, we do not oppose this legislation in the House, but we call on the government to do so much more.

Mr HAMMOND
 (Perth) (19:30):  I was really struck by the government's announcements, both two days ago in relation to the new ministry and, more importantly, in relation to the reshuffle that occurred in December last year, because something appears to have dropped off the radar of almost anyone on the government side—well, one of two things may have happened. Either it dropped off the radar or it was just a convenient omission. I should take this opportunity to say that it was not all bad news, particularly in December. We saw, for instance, the most appropriate recognition of the hard work that the honourable member for Durack has been doing for so many years; her ascension to the front bench was entirely appropriate. But that might be a silver lining to what is otherwise a very dark cloud, and it's a very dark cloud because of this: a funny thing happened on the way to the drafting office, because there is no longer a minister for consumer affairs. I have many failings, and one of them is not paying attention to detail sometimes. But I looked at the list three, four, five times. It's gone, vanished like Houdini: no minister for consumer affairs. Now, that means either the government don't care about vulnerable consumers or they just find them to be an inconvenience—so much so that, if they just pretend they don't exist, the problem might go away.


I'm really proud to be part of a Labor team that not only championed reforms for vulnerable consumers through the introduction of the Trade Practices Act but improved those reforms with the introduction of the Competition and Consumer Act, annexing of course the Australian Consumer Law. All of those things were done by Labor governments for the benefit of vulnerable consumers. But it is not just us who are working for vulnerable consumers. I'd like to take this opportunity to acknowledge all the incredible hard work that the groups who champion the cause of vulnerable consumers do. In no particular order, they are CHOICE, who do a terrific job all around the country; the Consumer Action Law Centre, who do a great job, particularly in the financial space; my local team, Consumer Credit Legal Services, on Adelaide Terrace in Perth, which many, many moons ago I was once a member of; and all the other not-for-profit groups who stick up for and champion the rights of consumers every day of the week.


What is the result of the government's omission? The result is telling and completely clear when you look at the litany of dropping the ball it has done in relation to vulnerable consumers. You may have heard me bang on ad nauseam about the way in which this government has pushed under the carpet reforms to protect consumers in the small-amount-credit-contract, rent-to-buy and payday-lending spaces. They just don't exist, as far as the government is concerned, notwithstanding the fact that it had legislation approved by its cabinet for introduction into this place—gone, absolutely gone. That does not happen on our watch. We have introduced such legislation.


What else do we see? Today is the latest example of what happens to vulnerable consumers when this mob is left in charge. Every single day, the risk of injury increases as a result of faulty Takata airbags in vehicles. It was only today that we saw this government finally do something about them, although it was abundantly clear if not years ago then certainly by 16 August last year, when the ACCC said on the record, in response to questions from the House Standing Committee on Economics:


… it's critical that the alpha airbags be replaced immediately.


That should have triggered alarm bells. It should have triggered the Competition and Consumer Act. The minister had the power to stop it; the minister did nothing. Vulnerable consumers are left wanting every step of the way under this government. (Time expired)

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (10:00):  Today I want to recognise the life of Jim Stott. James Stott, known to everyone as Jim, was a giant of lifesaving in bayside Melbourne. Jim spent much of his life in the ocean or as a servant of the many lifesaving clubs in Melbourne's south-east. Jim was well known and loved at the Chelsea, Edithvale, Aspendale, Mentone and Hampton lifesaving clubs. Though Jim gave his time generously in administration, being a board member of Life Saving Victoria and the Victorian branch of Royal Life Saving Society Australia, a Life Saving Victoria district supervisor, a district officer of 15 years, a club delegate and a radio panel member, Jim's passion was volunteer development. Jim trained generations of lifesavers in bayside Melbourne.


Jim started his association with lifesaving in the 1940s when he joined the Chelsea Longbeach Surf Life Saving Club, gaining his Royal Life Saving Society Australia bronze medallion with reel and line in 1945. Jim had a lifelong passion for the ocean and later joined the Hampton Life Saving Club in 1985, where he held the position of vice-president. Jim was active in the Mentone Lifesaving Club from 1995 until his passing. At Mentone Jim patrolled and officiated for 17 years until 2012. His generous service to the Mentone community was rightly recognised with the honour of life membership at the Mentone Lifesaving Club.


Even in recent years, when Jim was in his late 70s and early 80s, he could be found at a local lifesaving club, organising Nippers classes and doing his bit training the next generation of lifesavers. He was a frequent figure at the Mentone, Edithvale and Aspendale lifesaving clubs and was always willing to lend a hand.


A few weeks ago I swam in the locally renowned club-to-club swim between the Aspendale and Edithvale lifesaving clubs. The clubs held a minute's silence for Jim in tribute to his great contribution to local lifesaving. Jim's tireless volunteering was recognised with the Royal Life Saving Commonwealth Certificate of Thanks, the Royal Life Saving Commonwealth Service Medal, the Life Saving Victoria 10 years service award and the 2013 Life Saving Victoria Assessor of the Year award.


I offer my condolences to Jim's wife, Helga, to his three children and to the Victorian lifesaving community. Jim was a much-admired club member and a legendary figure in the lifesaving community in the great electorate of Isaacs. I pay tribute to Jim Stott for his great contribution to our community. He will be missed.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield—Minister for Urban Infrastructure and Cities) (10:30):  I'd like to thank the members who have contributed to the debate on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Deregulation and Other Measures) Bill 2017. The bill will amend a range of telecommunications and broadcasting legislation to reduce the regulatory burden on the broadcasting and telecommunications industries. The bill will amend the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to remove duplicative requirements for licensees, publishers and controllers to notify the Australian Communications and Media Authority of certain changes in control. It will deliver a single classification scheme for all television programs by removing the requirement for certain television broadcasters to apply a separate classification scheme for films when developing industry codes of practice.


In the area of telecommunications, the bill will amend the Telecommunications Act 1997 to enable a transition to an industry based scheme for the management of telephone-numbering resources, subject to strict policy safeguards. The amendments have the potential to enable greater efficiency and innovation if industry develops a suitable scheme.


The bill will also remove unnecessary arrangements for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, to issue tariff filing directions to certain carriers and carriage service providers under part XIBof the Competition and Consumer Act 2010. The information captured by these provisions is readily available to the ACCC through other avenues, including through public sources.


It will reform the statutory collection powers of ACMA under the Telecommunications Act 1997 and of the ACCC under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 to ensure that the information collected from industry is relevant and serves a useful public policy purpose. The bill will also simplify the annual report publication requirements for ACMA and the ACCC by requiring the reports to be published online.


The bill will also abolish the requirement for ACMA to consult with an advisory committee specially established under the submarine cable protection regime before declaring, varying or revoking a submarine cable protection zone, reducing administrative costs and on the basis that ACMA must consult publicly anyway on such proposals.


The bill will amend the Telecommunications Act 1997 to repeal the power of NBN Co to issue a statement that it is not installing fibre in a new real estate development, as it is not appropriate for NBN Co, as an industry player, to exercise a quasi-regulatory power. Changes will also be made to the National Broadband Network Companies Act 2011 to allow NBN Co to dispose of surplus goods without altering the fundamental line of business restrictions on NBN Co.


The bill, as now amended to repeal schedule 2, will preserve the status quo for ACMA's broadcasting, content and datacasting complaints-handling and investigation powers under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. Amendments to be made to schedule 3 of the bill will also align it with the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Misuse of Market Power) Act as it was enacted in August last year.


Amendments to be made to schedule 4 of the bill will provide clarity to commercial broadcasters that the pro rata refund of tax imposed on the issue of a transmitter licence only applies to the amount paid in the financial year ending on 30 June 2017.


An amendment will also insert schedule 9 into the bill to ensure that a transitional support payment for the switchover to the commercial broadcasting spectrum tax goes to the intended party. The schedule ensures that Network Investments Pty Ltd and not Northern Rivers Television Pty Ltd will receive the transitional support payment under the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Act 2017. This recognises that Network Investments Pty Ltd held the relevant licence at the time of the passage of the broadcasting reform act.


Finally, the bill will make other amendments to remove redundant and unnecessary legislation, including repealing over 50 spent acts in the Communications portfolio. The bill is a further step in this government's ongoing commitment to boosting productivity by reducing onerous regulation while maintaining consumer and competition safeguards. I call on members to support the bill.

(b) the reference to 1 November 2017 in subitem 39(2) were a reference to the day that is 28 days after the day on which this item commences.


At the outset, I thank the opposition for engaging constructively with the government on this bill and these government amendments. The proposed amendments on sheet KN135 will modify schedule 3 in the bill to align it with the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Misuse of Market Power) Act 2017. As introduced, the bill contained two sets of consequential amendments to part XIB of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 that were contingent on the commencement of the misuse of market power act. This was because, when the misuse of market power act was introduced as a bill into parliament, it proposed to amend the same provisions in part XIB as this bill. As the timing of the passage of the bills was uncertain, contingent amendments were included in the bill to address different timing scenarios.


The misuse of market power act was enacted in August 2017, with amendments such that it does not amend the same provisions in part XIB. As a result, the relevant consequential amendments in the bill are no longer contingent on the misuse of market power act. The amendments reflect the original intention of the bill to be aligned with the misuse of market power act.


The proposed amendment on sheet KN136 will remove schedule 2 from the bill. As introduced, schedule 2 streamlined two separate and distinct frameworks for the broadcasting complaints-handling and investigation functions of the Australian Communications and Media Authority, or ACMA, under the Broadcasting Services Act. Due to a recent Federal Court decision, the complaints-handling framework was found to unnecessarily duplicate the investigation framework. As a result, the government considered the complaints-handling framework redundant, and schedule 2 would have repealed the framework. The schedule also introduced minor consequential amendments to create a combined complaints-handling and investigation framework, which better reflected ACMA's current complaints-handling procedures.


A number of members of the broadcasting industry expressed concerns with the amendments contained in schedule 2. The opposition has also indicated concerns with this schedule. In order to not delay other, non-controversial, reform measures, the decision has been made to remove schedule 2 to the bill.


The proposed amendment on sheet GX170 will correct a provision of the Radiocommunications Taxes Collection Act 1983, which was inserted by the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Act 2017. The provision entitles a person to a pro rata refund of tax imposed on the issue of the transmitter licence if particular criteria are met. The intention is that the pro rata refund only apply to tax on transmitter licences paid in the financial year ending on 30 June 2017. However, this intention is not properly reflected in the provision and, if unamended, could result in higher payments to some commercial broadcasters than was intended. As such, the amendment will ensure that the provision operates as intended.


In addition, the proposed amendment on sheet GX 170 will replace Northern Rivers Television Pty Ltd with Network Investments Pty Ltd as a specified company eligible to receive a transitional support payment under the broadcasting reform act. This payment supports commercial broadcasters in transitioning from commercial broadcasting licence fees to the new spectrum tax. To be eligible for payment, recipients must hold a commercial television or radio broadcasting licence. However, on 1 June 2017, after the introduction of the relevant legislation, Northern Rivers transferred its commercial television broadcasting licence and assets to Network Investments, making it ineligible. The government was only made aware of this transfer after passage of the relevant legislation. The amendment will specify Network Investments Pty Ltd as an eligible company. This recognises that Network Investments held the relevant licence at the time of the passage of the broadcasting reform act and will ensure that it receives a transitional support payment to support the relevant broadcasting licence as intended. I commend the amendments to the House.
