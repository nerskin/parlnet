Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (12:32): I will draw the committee's attention to where we are up to. I had asked the Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Work­place Relations a question in relation to subclause 19-38(4)(f). To remind the parlia­mentary secretary, my question was whether the phrase 'promoting the health or welfare of students' would prohibit student clubs or organisations from promoting a political cause. For example, it might be argued that the promotion of a carbon tax or a campaign such as Your Rights at Work might be for the welfare of students. So my question is: will subclause 19-38(4)(f), on the promotion of the welfare of students, prohibit the use of student moneys for that purpose?

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2011-10-11,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (12:34):  I remind the Senate that, on the last occasion, many questions such as this were canvassed before the Senate. I think the provisions in the clause about the health and welfare of students are fairly obvious as read. The suggestions put forward by the coalition about carbon tax and Work Choices are perhaps among some of their wilder claims about what this bill will do, such as force students into student organisations.


I take this opportunity to thank the senators who have made a contribution during this debate. The bill before the Senate amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to bring to an end to the damage that has been done to student services and amenities on university campuses. The bill is an important step in rebuilding key student services while retaining the government's commitment not to return—I stress that—to compulsory student unionism. The bill allows higher education providers to choose to charge a compulsory student services and amenities fee of up to $263 for 2012. Fees will be collected by higher education providers and the providers will be accountable for fee revenue. Contrary to some of the wilder claims that have been made by senators opposite, no student will be required to join a student organisation as a consequence of this bill, and the provisions in the clause that Senator Mason just referred to are pretty clear on accountability for fee revenue and its collection by higher education providers.


We heard from 17 coalition senators during the second reading stage of the bill. Further to that, six coalition senators have continued to make points during the commit­tee stage. Some of those points have been valid; some have been wilder extensions seeking to make ideological points during the discussion. It is becoming increasingly clear that the coalition's intent is to frustrate and delay consideration of this bill. On each occasion this bill has been before the Senate, we have seen from the coalition its obstruct­ionism aimed at delay. I hope that will not be the occasion this morning. This is not just a theoretical or ideological argument; univer­sities will need time to get systems in place to introduce a fee in time for the 2012 academic year. They will need time to properly consult their student bodies on the proposed uses of the fee. To allow this to occur in a timely way, in a way that is consistent with the policy that the govern­ment has outlined and which the universities have relied on and supported, it is important that we bring this debate to a vote. The government's view is that students are entitled to better services when they start university next year.


Over the last fortnight the particular area of student services that was stressed to me was mental health support and counselling and the opportunity to get better support in place for the next student year. After years of ideological opposition by the Liberal Party, it is urgent that this bill be passed. I remind the chamber that on the last occasion that this was before the Senate we had eight hours and 23 minutes of debate on the second read­ing, including 23 speakers, and a committee discussion of seven speakers.




Senator Mason:
  I'm just warming up!




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I would encourage Senator Mason and other senators to consider not frustrating this matter any further.

"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2011-10-11,"



Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (12:38):  I have some questions for the parliamentary secre­tary, but before that I will address some of the points she just raised. The parliamentary secretary claimed that there are accounta­bility measures in this bill. That is not a claim that is backed up with any evidence. It is not a claim that has been demonstrated. The truth is that students will not be able to withdraw their funding from the services nor the organisations that the government or the university are levying this fee for and which the university determines to pass this fee onto. The mere repetition of slogans about accountability, the repetition that this is somehow about student services, does not actually make it so. The government has failed to demonstrate this, and that is one of the reasons this debate has gone on. There have been many questions from coalition senators, led by Senator Mason, precisely because the government has failed to answer very basic questions about this legislation.


The government has not explained how this accountability is meant to take place. How on earth is a student going to make the university accountable? They may be a part-time or off-campus student who is not able to access the services that the university chooses to levy the fee for, whether that be the ski lodge at Mount Buller which I have been heckled occasionally for raising—it is an extreme example—whether it be the cafeteria that is closed when they come onto campus at night, or whether it be the sports facilities that are closed when this student is on campus. The truth is that without the ability to withdraw the funding, without the ability to choose the way you spend your money, that accountability does not exist at the student level. The student cannot withdraw the funding from the university or simply tick a box and say, 'I don't wish to fund those particular services because I can't access them.'


You may not agree with the ideological or philosophical commitment that we on this side have to a user-pays system, the commit­ment to the fact that we should not be taking money from people based upon a poll tax so that regardless of your ability to pay, regard­less of your means, you should be forced to pay for these services equally. We do not levy any other tax in society on that basis, yet the only argument we hear from the government is that somehow these services are so important.


The other question that we have not had answered is about the example we just heard from the parliamentary secretary of mental health. How is this not a responsibility shared by society at large? We do not levy any other group of people involved in a particular activity with a poll tax to say, 'We are going to fund these services for you.' If the government is serious about addressing mental health—and the opposition would welcome the government being serious about this—then why on earth are students not able to access the mental health services that everyone else in the community should be able to access as well?




Senator Mason:
  They are.




Senator RYAN:
  As Senator Mason says, they are. So we do not have a rationale for levying a separate poll tax. The parliament­ary secretary and the government have not answered how they will protect this money from being misused. While the parliamentary secretary talks about ideology, I can talk about experience, because the experience I had at the University of Melbourne student union in the early 1990s was of money being directed towards a subsidised cafeteria and then the money coming out of that till being used for political activities. In one particular case, it famously paid for legal representa­tion for a group called the Austudy Five who allegedly stormed parliament and broke the Premier's office window. How on earth was it in students' interests for an amenities and services fee to be directed towards the legal representation of those people? It betrays the emptiness of the claim regarding the impor­tance of services like those for mental health.


But I do have a specific question which I am interested in. It is about the operation of the levy to pay back the deferred component of this fee. In my day it was called HECS. We would have a tax component levied essentially at a flat rate upon your taxable income. If a student accumulates a debt for the student assistance component of this fee, is that levied as a separate tax or is it simply added to what I would call a HECS debt? Is it a single levy put on someone's taxable income? My question is: are there two income levies or is it a single income levy?

The administration will collect this levy—if you wish to call it that, Parliamentary Secretary—of $250 a head. I believe it is stated that that cannot be used for political purposes. Is it the case that the administra­tion can distribute some of that money to the student union, who may then set up a tuckshop, for example, at the university? Is it the situation that that money can be handed to the student union to establish a business like a tuckshop, a retail outlet or whatever? Can you confirm that is the case?

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2011-10-11,"



Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (12:52):  We have just seen the gagging of a very important debate. This is a debate that has been fought over for about 35 years. It is a critical debate for the welfare of Australian students. What is really appalling is that the critical questions on the enforcement mecha­nisms of the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Ameni­ties) Bill 2010 have still not been answered. I know the Minister for Employment Partici­pation and Childcare is doing her best, but the questions about how this bill will be enforced by universities and by the depart­ment responsible have not been answered. There has not even been an attempt to answer these questions, and the Australian Greens have facilitated this gag. They did it because—I think it was Senator Brandis the other day who said this—those with an authoritarian shape of mind will do anything to close down debate.


This bill has not been thought through. I asked questions when we kicked off this morning about, in effect, the peace, order and good government of the legislation. The phrase was the 'welfare of students'. That is a very, very broad phrase. The minister was unable to tell the chamber whether that phrase would prohibit the use of money by student organisations for political causes. She could not or would not tell us. We have been asking that question now for days and yet there has been no answer. Senator Williams asked a good question—and, not that I am a good lawyer, in a sense the argument is one about the fruit of a tainted tree or the tainted fruit of a tree—which was this: 'A student operation subsidised by student money makes a profit. How then is that money to be used?' Is that covered by the legislation? In other words, can the profits of a student cafe or bar be used for political purposes? There was no answer to Senator Williams's question. It is a critical question because in effect money can be laundered through student organisations for political purposes. That is a disgrace. That is what I object to about this bill. Clearly, it is an open debate that we are having and there are strong opinions on both sides, but what I really object to is the failure of the govern­ment to answer these fundamental questions.


What about the enforcement mechanisms? How will universities enforce this legisl­tion? Specifically, what enforcement mechanisms and penalties are available to universities to enforce this legislation? Guess what: we do not know of any. We do not know what enforcement mechanisms are available to universities—we do not have a clue. This still has not been answered. After days of debate, these fundamental questions about the utility of this bill have not been answered. 


It would seem from the debate thus far—and the government is right—that you could not have money spent, for example, on bumper stickers that said 'Vote Labor'. The government is right: that would be a political purpose and would be inappropriate. It could not say 'Vote Liberal'—that is also true. But what would happen if the bumper sticker said 'Put Liberals last'. Under the bill I think that would be all right. What would happen if student money was used to support the carbon tax? Would that be money well spent? We still do not know, and that is why we oppose the authoritarian shape of mind that promotes this sort of legislation. We have no idea. So it is okay to say 'Don't vote Liberal' or 'Don't vote for the coalition', but you cannot under any circumstances say 'Vote Labor' or 'Vote Liberal'. We under­stand that, but it does not inhibit the scope of the legislation. 


We oppose this bill and I will be saying more, I might add, on the third reading. Suffice to say that the reason we take these issues so seriously is that many of us were involved in student politics—I certainly was a long time ago back in the early 1980s—and I will never forget that as a 17-year-old my money was paid to student organisations and then used for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. That is how it was used back in the early 1980s. Somehow, that was okay; that was an expression of student will! There was never any expression of student will. Only five per cent of people ever voted at the ANU in the early 1980s. The Left got hold of the money and spent it on causes they believed in. The rest of the students—the 95 per cent—would never have supported the PLO. Yet, fundamentally, we still do not know whether this could happen again. We do not know whether, for example, money could be spent on overseas political causes or, indeed, any political issues. Those fundamental questions have not been answered. We do not know about enforce­ment mechanisms—we do not know how universities are going to enforce it and we do not even know what the department is going to do to monitor the situation. People might say: 'The coalition is hyperbolic about this. They are trying to filibuster the bill.' But do you know what I think? I think it is a very important issue. I think, as a matter of princi­ple, the idea of forcing young Australians to potentially pay money for political causes that they do not believe in is outrageous. That is why we on this side have never, ever stopped in our opposition to forcing young Australians to pay for political causes they do not believe in. It is worse than that and I will say more on this during the third reading speech in a few minutes. Australian univer­sities have changed. The demography of Australian universities has changed. It is not like it was just after World War II. Universities are no longer elite institutions. They are not even really mass institutions. They are nearly universal institutions. It is no longer like Brideshead Revisited. There are no echoes of that through universities I have worked in. Most students today are older, study part time and do not have the time or the inclination to pay for services the government and the Greens believe they should pay for. Most people at universities, most staff members among them, are working. They do not have the time or the inclination to use the services that the government and the Greens are forcing them to pay for. That is the disgrace of this bill. 


Times have changed. The world has moved on. It is not like when all students were teenagers living on campus and able to use all the facilities—the gymnasiums and creches and, indeed, student organisations. What has happened—Professor Bradley in her report makes this so evident and so very clear—is that most students today, three-quarters of them, work part time. They do not have the time or the opportunity to make use of the services that this lot believe should be paid for by students. What is more, the vast majority of students today are mature-age students. This came as a surprise to me, because things have clearly changed in the 30 years since I was an undergraduate. About two-thirds of students at Australian universities are mature age; they are over 21. That is an enormous change from 30 years ago. It is a huge demographic change in the make-up of the Australian undergraduate population. Even though there are more women, more disadvantaged kids and more people working part time, this lot believe that people should be forced to pay for what the inner-city left-wing activists believe should be the priorities of Australian students. That is what we find so offensive. 


The Labor Party say they speak for the disadvantaged. They always claim: 'The coalition do not care about disadvantaged students. The coalition do not speak for kids from the western suburbs of Sydney or Melbourne, or for Indigenous students or indeed for rural or regional students.' The Labor Party say, 'We care.' No, they do not. I can tell you now that the people that benefit from the expenditure of this money will be those people able to take advantage of it, and that will not be the people that work part time. Those kids who are disadvantaged will be working at the local pizza store or the local laundrette, or they will be working as a brickie's labourer or a truck driver. They will not be sitting in student unions collecting their pay cheques and spending money on fashionable left-wing activist causes. They will be working. Apparently the Labor Party speak for Indigenous students. Those kids will be out working. They will not be sitting on university campuses lolling in the bright afterglow of a 21st century Brideshead Revisited. That is not going to happen. The world has changed under the foot of the Left in this country and they do not quite get it. 


In a few years 40 per cent of young Australians will be going to university. That is two out of five. The vast majority of them, three-quarters of them, will be working. Two-thirds of them will be studying part time and an increasing number will be study­ing externally using modern technology. How are they going to take advantage of the great facilities they are going to be forced to pay for? The Labor Party do not care about that. They argue that they speak for the underprivileged. It is the coalition that speak for those students that work part time, the vast majority of whom cannot take advant­age of the services that they are expected to pay for. The coalition speak for young Australians that have to work. We speak for them, not this lot. They do not speak for them. The government are forcing kids that have to work or indeed study part time to pay the bill. We speak for those kids that work when they go to uni and we speak for part-time students. We speak for those kids that have no alternative except to work to put themselves through university. What is this lot doing about that? Absolutely nothing. What about kids from rural and regional Australia that have no alternative except to pay their own way? This lot know they do not have access to those services. Australian universities and their make-up have changed under the foot of the Australian Labor Party. 


This is an issue I know many people find arcane and perhaps even slightly overbearing at times. But this is such an important issue to the coalition. I want to make this point and I will make it again shortly. This is such a critical issue because none of us on this side of the chamber believe that any student, any young Australian, should have money compulsorily exacted from them and used for purposes they cannot or will not use. As Senator Cormann, Senator Humphries, Senator Fifield and many of my friends have said in the course of this debate, 'We have no problem—students can spend their money on any political cause they want.' None of us have any objection to that. But they will not spend the money of young Australians on political causes we find distasteful or, in my case, as you will remember, Temporary Chairman, abhorrent. Any of us that went to university over the last 20 or 30 years are so attuned to the potential horrors of this legislation that we cannot allow this bill to go through without a fight. Let me say this, because the government have not answered the legitimate questions that coalition senators have raised: we will be doing everything to monitor how this legislation is implemented and how it is monitored.

 (South Australia) (13:07):  I rise for two reasons. Firstly, I want to correct the record in relation to the last vote. The division was on whether the question be put. In error, I assumed that it was a vote on an amendment to the legisla­tion, which I supported. I apologise for that. I was in the middle of a committee meeting. My vote was in error, and I bear the responsibility for that—although I note that it would not have changed the outcome, because as a general principle I am always loath to support what is effectively a guillotine. I do note that this debate has been going for some time—




Senator Cormann:
  No, it has not.




Senator XENOPHON:
  No, Senator Cormann. I want to make it clear that my true voting intention was not to support that the question be put in relation to the division, but the outcome would not have been differ­ent. Having said that, I still support the government's legislation, for the reasons I outlined in my contribution to the second reading debate. I think it is important to point out that the Howard government, when it introduced this legislation, did set aside a specific fund—I think it was about $100 million—to make up for the loss of facilities and loss of services. Also, vice-chancellors across the country have expressed dismay about the impact VSU has had on campus facilities. To me, this is a pragmatic way to deal with those problems. It is legislation that I do support. I believe there are sufficient safeguards in it to ensure that it is not abused and that universities have control over it. For those reasons I still support the legislation, but I do want to make it clear that it was not my intention to support a guillotining of the further debate of this bill.

Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (13:17):  In my quiet way, I would like to make a further contribution on this important bill, the Higher Education Legislation Amend­ment (Student Services and Amenities) Bill 2010. Before the apparent sad passage of this bill, I just want to remind senators of what this means for students—in other words, those who are footing the bill. This is a tax on students, forcing them to pay for services that many will not or cannot use. It will be levied on all students: the rich and the poor; the old and the young; the black and the white; part-time students and full-time stu­dents; external students and internal students; men and women—all irrespective of whether they will or are able to access the student services that they are being asked to pay for.


I am not one for technology, I am afraid, but I have been receiving tweets in relation to this bill. I am moving into the 21st century as best I can. I received a tweet from 'mickthejones', and he said: 'I'm never on campus. Why should I have to pay for others' entertainment?' I think 'mickthejones' asks a very good question that goes to the heart of this bill. Then there is Mr 'gilalbertson', and he says in his tweet to me: 'If you have to rely on legislated theft for funding, you should probably explore alternative revenue-raising methods'—again, a most appropriate and apposite tweet. I have to say they go to the core of this debate.


This bill is a subsidy for largely middle-class, fashionable, left-of-centre student acti­vists. That is who is being subsidised here. The disadvantaged students that I mentioned in my previous contribution are out working. They are working in the pizza shops, they are working in the laundrettes, they are working in the car lots and they are driving the trucks, while the middle-class, left-of-centre acti­vists are in the union court protesting about causes that most students do not agree with. The only place on earth that these people are popular is on university campuses.




Senator Ryan:
  And they're not that popular there.




Senator MASON:
  And they are not that popular there. Of course, these people expect their interests, their obsessions and their fetishes to be subsidised by other students. Let us face it. And, no doubt, culturally the twin triumphs of the left in the late 20th century, both moral vanity and self-loathing of their own community, also are subsidised by those students who are not middle-class, left-of-centre student activists. Perhaps my friend Senator Hanson-Young thinks I am being a bit naughty in describing these stude­nts as left-wing activists, because the Greens would describe them as their base. That is where the Greens get their support from.


What has changed is this, and it is pretty simple: those that sponsor this bill, the government and the Greens, do not under­stand that the university world has changed almost beyond recognition within one generation, and that is the key point that I cannot stress enough to the Senate. It is no longer Brideshead Revisited or Chariots of Fire. Changing demography and changing culture mean that most students today simply do not have the time or the inclination, or even the opportunity, to use the services offered. Universities have changed enorm­ously since the mid-1970s—more than 35 years ago—when this debate first took place. Universities today are mainstream; they are not elite. Today's students are older and many more of them study part time and in the evenings due to competing and family commitments. Many more take advantage of the greater flexibility and opportunities that new communications technologies bring to external study.


Despite all that, this lot says that this new type of student should foot the bill for the inner city, middle-class, left-wing activists. This lot says that the people out there—the mature age women raising families and studying part time—should pay for the interests of those activists. I do not accept that; I never have and I never will. The government still assumes that universities are filled with 18- to 22-year-olds who are studying full time on campus.


It is no longer like that. I have visited vice-chancellors on the principal campus of every single university in this country—all 39. There are no echoes of Brideshead Revisited, not any more anyway. As the Bradley review makes clear, in 2007 more than two-thirds of Australia's students were mature age. That fundamentally changes who the potential beneficiaries of these services are. But those mature age students are expected to pay for the services that this lot are ensuring the left-wing, middle-class, inner city activists can and will use. Moreov­er, full-time students are now considerably less than half of the student population. This is an enormous change since I was at university 30 years ago. Yet the arguments that the Greens and the government raise are still the same—access. These people do not have the time or the inclination to use the services that you are forcing them to pay for.


I accept the government has pushed—and I have said before, about the Prime Minister when she was the Minister for Education, that I believe it was a noble push—to create greater access to and greater equity in tertiary education. I have always given the Prime Minister credit for that. I have given credit to Senator Evans and to my old friend and sparring partner Senator Carr—and they deserve credit for that. But then they expect, despite the enormous change in the demo­graphy and the make-up of the student population, all students—all of these new people coming into universities, all of these disadvantaged kids, the Aboriginal kids and the kids from rural and regional Australia—to pay for services that the government know those students cannot use. That is what we fundamentally object to.


As my colleagues have said, eloquently I think, today we live, sadly perhaps, in a credentials culture. Whether that is good or bad, let us face the fact that it is largely the case. Today's students see their higher educa­tion much more vocationally than I saw mine. I think that is a fair comment. When I was a student, I studied philosophy and political science because I wanted to enlarge my mind. Perhaps my lecturers failed, but today I think it is a fair point to say that most kids going to Australian universities do it with a vocational outcome much more in mind. Again, that means that those who can make use of the sorts of services available have changed enormously. Yet this lot—the government and the Greens—expect every­one to pay for services that most people, most young Australians, cannot or will not use.


In my own office, three members of my staff study part time. None of them has access to these services. Even if in theory they will have access to these services, they will not be able to use them because they are busy working for me. Again, they are expected to pay for services that they cannot or will not use. That is just not fair. But the government does not care. The government thinks it is okay to ask students who cannot or will not access these services to pay for them. The coalition resolutely says no and never. I again refer to the Bradley review commissioned by the government. On page 49 of her report, Professor Bradley concludes:


In 2006 nearly 71 per cent of full-time domestic undergraduate students reported working during semester


That is 71 per cent in 2006. Over the last five years that has increased to over three-quarters. Three-quarters of Australia's under­graduate population now work part time. Again, those students have much less access to the services this lot are saying those students should pay for. It is outrageous. Professor Bradley continues: 


On average these students were working about 15 hours per week. One in six of the full-time undergraduate students who was working during the semester were working more than 20 hours per week.


I suppose they are supposed to pay for services which, again, they cannot or will not use. 


This trend will only continue. More students will be working while they are studying and more will be older. Increasingly students do not have the time to access student services that they are expected by this government to pay for. That is a fundamental issue for the coalition. The government does not understand this. The culture and the demography of Australian universities has changed fundamentally in the last generation. Students at universities have changed. They are older, they are far more mature and they work. They cannot take advantage of these services which they are supposed to pay for. The proponents of this student tax like to use this analogy: they argue that universities or student unions are really akin to local government, that they provide valuable services at the local level and therefore need to tax everyone within their catchment area to pay for those services. That analogy is a farce. Universities are not another tier of government. We have only three tiers as I understand it: federal, state and local. But the government and the Greens seem to believe that it is appropriate for universities to tax the entire population, whether students will use those services or not.


Universities are the only entity outside government with a power to compulsorily extract money from Australians, even in cases where those students will not or cannot use the services provided. As my friend Senator Cormann and his committee that has been doing great work on taxes said, this is not a fee for service. The vast majority of students will not or cannot access these services. It is a tax. Labor and the Greens like the idea of allowing universities to tax students, just like a tier of government, because it is the only level of government where they can still be elected—that is, of course, outside Marrickville Council. That is about it.


To the coalition, the system remains open to political abuse and is devoid of effective enforcement mechanisms. I mentioned this before. The coalition is concerned at the effective enforcement of this legislation. While the bill prohibits universities or any third parties which might receive money from spending it in support of political parties or political candidates, there is nothing to prevent the money being spent on political campaigns. As my friend Senator Ryan said, political causes are not excluded, or quasi-political organisations per se, whether the students whose money is being spent agree with those purposes or not.


Indeed, while student funded stickers cannot say 'vote Labor' or 'vote Green', under the bill there seems no reason why they cannot say 'put the Liberals last' or 'don't vote Nationals', and so on it goes. Thus, despite repeated questions from the opposition regarding the meaning of the provisions of section 19-38(4)(f)—that is, the provision that will allow the use of money compulsorily extracted from students to promote the welfare of students—it might, for example, then be used to support the carbon tax or promote issues such as Your Rights at Work on the basis that they promote the welfare of students.


I know the minister did her best but there was still no direct answer to that fundamental question after days of debate. What about instances that Senator Williams spoke of where a student-subsidised business makes money and then uses that money for political purposes? In other words, the money is 'washed' first at the student bar and then is used to fund political activities. What about that? But even with a prohibition on direct support for political parties and candidates, one has to ask: how will the bill be policed? Neither the bill nor guidelines provide any credible enforcement and sanction mechani­sms, none at all. The bill merely states that it is up to the universities to ensure that the money is not spent on political parties and candidates, without providing universities with any powers to enforce it. Make no mistake, the opposition will monitor the enforcement and the operation of this bill. Even if the government will not, we will protect the rights of the majority of students.


In the end it comes down to this: there are two groups at play here. First, those who have to pay the fee. Let's call them the unwilling, unhappy givers. There are about one million of them, so let us call them the 'reluctant one million'. Overwhelmingly, they do not want to pay the fee. The second group is the one that gets the money. The first group pays it; the second group gets it. Let's call them the happy and the self-righteous takers. These are the rent seekers. The government and the Greens believe it is just and appropriate that the unwilling, unhappy givers—the 'reluctant one million students'—have to pay the tax, because that is what it is, to the rent seekers. That, ultimately, is what the government and the Greens say.


Nothing has changed on that side of politics in 110 years of federal parliament and, certainly, nothing in the 35 years of this debate. This is a government, supported by its coalition colleagues the Greens, that believes it is okay that the unwilling and unhappy one million students—those who foot the bill—pay this money to the rent seekers. The government is always on the side of the rent seekers. It has been since Federation and it will be forever after. We now know that. It is always on the side of the rent seekers, always asking someone to pay for their issues, their concerns, their projects, their priorities and their fetishes. That is what that side has been doing for the last 110 years in this nation and it is increasingly pathetic.


Never in the history of Australian politics have so many paid so much to so few for so little. That alone is sufficient for the opposi­tion to maintain the rage and emphatically oppose this bill. We opposed it yesterday; we opposed it 35 years ago; we oppose it today and we will oppose it tomorrow. We will never, ever support this bill.

 (Queensland) (12:32): I will draw the committee's attention to where we are up to. I had asked the Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Work­place Relations a question in relation to subclause 19-38(4)(f). To remind the parlia­mentary secretary, my question was whether the phrase 'promoting the health or welfare of students' would prohibit student clubs or organisations from promoting a political cause. For example, it might be argued that the promotion of a carbon tax or a campaign such as Your Rights at Work might be for the welfare of students. So my question is: will subclause 19-38(4)(f), on the promotion of the welfare of students, prohibit the use of student moneys for that purpose?

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (12:34):  I remind the Senate that, on the last occasion, many questions such as this were canvassed before the Senate. I think the provisions in the clause about the health and welfare of students are fairly obvious as read. The suggestions put forward by the coalition about carbon tax and Work Choices are perhaps among some of their wilder claims about what this bill will do, such as force students into student organisations.


I take this opportunity to thank the senators who have made a contribution during this debate. The bill before the Senate amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to bring to an end to the damage that has been done to student services and amenities on university campuses. The bill is an important step in rebuilding key student services while retaining the government's commitment not to return—I stress that—to compulsory student unionism. The bill allows higher education providers to choose to charge a compulsory student services and amenities fee of up to $263 for 2012. Fees will be collected by higher education providers and the providers will be accountable for fee revenue. Contrary to some of the wilder claims that have been made by senators opposite, no student will be required to join a student organisation as a consequence of this bill, and the provisions in the clause that Senator Mason just referred to are pretty clear on accountability for fee revenue and its collection by higher education providers.


We heard from 17 coalition senators during the second reading stage of the bill. Further to that, six coalition senators have continued to make points during the commit­tee stage. Some of those points have been valid; some have been wilder extensions seeking to make ideological points during the discussion. It is becoming increasingly clear that the coalition's intent is to frustrate and delay consideration of this bill. On each occasion this bill has been before the Senate, we have seen from the coalition its obstruct­ionism aimed at delay. I hope that will not be the occasion this morning. This is not just a theoretical or ideological argument; univer­sities will need time to get systems in place to introduce a fee in time for the 2012 academic year. They will need time to properly consult their student bodies on the proposed uses of the fee. To allow this to occur in a timely way, in a way that is consistent with the policy that the govern­ment has outlined and which the universities have relied on and supported, it is important that we bring this debate to a vote. The government's view is that students are entitled to better services when they start university next year.


Over the last fortnight the particular area of student services that was stressed to me was mental health support and counselling and the opportunity to get better support in place for the next student year. After years of ideological opposition by the Liberal Party, it is urgent that this bill be passed. I remind the chamber that on the last occasion that this was before the Senate we had eight hours and 23 minutes of debate on the second read­ing, including 23 speakers, and a committee discussion of seven speakers.




Senator Mason:
  I'm just warming up!




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I would encourage Senator Mason and other senators to consider not frustrating this matter any further.

"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2011-10-11,"



Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (12:38):  I have some questions for the parliamentary secre­tary, but before that I will address some of the points she just raised. The parliamentary secretary claimed that there are accounta­bility measures in this bill. That is not a claim that is backed up with any evidence. It is not a claim that has been demonstrated. The truth is that students will not be able to withdraw their funding from the services nor the organisations that the government or the university are levying this fee for and which the university determines to pass this fee onto. The mere repetition of slogans about accountability, the repetition that this is somehow about student services, does not actually make it so. The government has failed to demonstrate this, and that is one of the reasons this debate has gone on. There have been many questions from coalition senators, led by Senator Mason, precisely because the government has failed to answer very basic questions about this legislation.


The government has not explained how this accountability is meant to take place. How on earth is a student going to make the university accountable? They may be a part-time or off-campus student who is not able to access the services that the university chooses to levy the fee for, whether that be the ski lodge at Mount Buller which I have been heckled occasionally for raising—it is an extreme example—whether it be the cafeteria that is closed when they come onto campus at night, or whether it be the sports facilities that are closed when this student is on campus. The truth is that without the ability to withdraw the funding, without the ability to choose the way you spend your money, that accountability does not exist at the student level. The student cannot withdraw the funding from the university or simply tick a box and say, 'I don't wish to fund those particular services because I can't access them.'


You may not agree with the ideological or philosophical commitment that we on this side have to a user-pays system, the commit­ment to the fact that we should not be taking money from people based upon a poll tax so that regardless of your ability to pay, regard­less of your means, you should be forced to pay for these services equally. We do not levy any other tax in society on that basis, yet the only argument we hear from the government is that somehow these services are so important.


The other question that we have not had answered is about the example we just heard from the parliamentary secretary of mental health. How is this not a responsibility shared by society at large? We do not levy any other group of people involved in a particular activity with a poll tax to say, 'We are going to fund these services for you.' If the government is serious about addressing mental health—and the opposition would welcome the government being serious about this—then why on earth are students not able to access the mental health services that everyone else in the community should be able to access as well?




Senator Mason:
  They are.




Senator RYAN:
  As Senator Mason says, they are. So we do not have a rationale for levying a separate poll tax. The parliament­ary secretary and the government have not answered how they will protect this money from being misused. While the parliamentary secretary talks about ideology, I can talk about experience, because the experience I had at the University of Melbourne student union in the early 1990s was of money being directed towards a subsidised cafeteria and then the money coming out of that till being used for political activities. In one particular case, it famously paid for legal representa­tion for a group called the Austudy Five who allegedly stormed parliament and broke the Premier's office window. How on earth was it in students' interests for an amenities and services fee to be directed towards the legal representation of those people? It betrays the emptiness of the claim regarding the impor­tance of services like those for mental health.


But I do have a specific question which I am interested in. It is about the operation of the levy to pay back the deferred component of this fee. In my day it was called HECS. We would have a tax component levied essentially at a flat rate upon your taxable income. If a student accumulates a debt for the student assistance component of this fee, is that levied as a separate tax or is it simply added to what I would call a HECS debt? Is it a single levy put on someone's taxable income? My question is: are there two income levies or is it a single income levy?

Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (12:52):  We have just seen the gagging of a very important debate. This is a debate that has been fought over for about 35 years. It is a critical debate for the welfare of Australian students. What is really appalling is that the critical questions on the enforcement mecha­nisms of the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Ameni­ties) Bill 2010 have still not been answered. I know the Minister for Employment Partici­pation and Childcare is doing her best, but the questions about how this bill will be enforced by universities and by the depart­ment responsible have not been answered. There has not even been an attempt to answer these questions, and the Australian Greens have facilitated this gag. They did it because—I think it was Senator Brandis the other day who said this—those with an authoritarian shape of mind will do anything to close down debate.


This bill has not been thought through. I asked questions when we kicked off this morning about, in effect, the peace, order and good government of the legislation. The phrase was the 'welfare of students'. That is a very, very broad phrase. The minister was unable to tell the chamber whether that phrase would prohibit the use of money by student organisations for political causes. She could not or would not tell us. We have been asking that question now for days and yet there has been no answer. Senator Williams asked a good question—and, not that I am a good lawyer, in a sense the argument is one about the fruit of a tainted tree or the tainted fruit of a tree—which was this: 'A student operation subsidised by student money makes a profit. How then is that money to be used?' Is that covered by the legislation? In other words, can the profits of a student cafe or bar be used for political purposes? There was no answer to Senator Williams's question. It is a critical question because in effect money can be laundered through student organisations for political purposes. That is a disgrace. That is what I object to about this bill. Clearly, it is an open debate that we are having and there are strong opinions on both sides, but what I really object to is the failure of the govern­ment to answer these fundamental questions.


What about the enforcement mechanisms? How will universities enforce this legisl­tion? Specifically, what enforcement mechanisms and penalties are available to universities to enforce this legislation? Guess what: we do not know of any. We do not know what enforcement mechanisms are available to universities—we do not have a clue. This still has not been answered. After days of debate, these fundamental questions about the utility of this bill have not been answered. 


It would seem from the debate thus far—and the government is right—that you could not have money spent, for example, on bumper stickers that said 'Vote Labor'. The government is right: that would be a political purpose and would be inappropriate. It could not say 'Vote Liberal'—that is also true. But what would happen if the bumper sticker said 'Put Liberals last'. Under the bill I think that would be all right. What would happen if student money was used to support the carbon tax? Would that be money well spent? We still do not know, and that is why we oppose the authoritarian shape of mind that promotes this sort of legislation. We have no idea. So it is okay to say 'Don't vote Liberal' or 'Don't vote for the coalition', but you cannot under any circumstances say 'Vote Labor' or 'Vote Liberal'. We under­stand that, but it does not inhibit the scope of the legislation. 


We oppose this bill and I will be saying more, I might add, on the third reading. Suffice to say that the reason we take these issues so seriously is that many of us were involved in student politics—I certainly was a long time ago back in the early 1980s—and I will never forget that as a 17-year-old my money was paid to student organisations and then used for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. That is how it was used back in the early 1980s. Somehow, that was okay; that was an expression of student will! There was never any expression of student will. Only five per cent of people ever voted at the ANU in the early 1980s. The Left got hold of the money and spent it on causes they believed in. The rest of the students—the 95 per cent—would never have supported the PLO. Yet, fundamentally, we still do not know whether this could happen again. We do not know whether, for example, money could be spent on overseas political causes or, indeed, any political issues. Those fundamental questions have not been answered. We do not know about enforce­ment mechanisms—we do not know how universities are going to enforce it and we do not even know what the department is going to do to monitor the situation. People might say: 'The coalition is hyperbolic about this. They are trying to filibuster the bill.' But do you know what I think? I think it is a very important issue. I think, as a matter of princi­ple, the idea of forcing young Australians to potentially pay money for political causes that they do not believe in is outrageous. That is why we on this side have never, ever stopped in our opposition to forcing young Australians to pay for political causes they do not believe in. It is worse than that and I will say more on this during the third reading speech in a few minutes. Australian univer­sities have changed. The demography of Australian universities has changed. It is not like it was just after World War II. Universities are no longer elite institutions. They are not even really mass institutions. They are nearly universal institutions. It is no longer like Brideshead Revisited. There are no echoes of that through universities I have worked in. Most students today are older, study part time and do not have the time or the inclination to pay for services the government and the Greens believe they should pay for. Most people at universities, most staff members among them, are working. They do not have the time or the inclination to use the services that the government and the Greens are forcing them to pay for. That is the disgrace of this bill. 


Times have changed. The world has moved on. It is not like when all students were teenagers living on campus and able to use all the facilities—the gymnasiums and creches and, indeed, student organisations. What has happened—Professor Bradley in her report makes this so evident and so very clear—is that most students today, three-quarters of them, work part time. They do not have the time or the opportunity to make use of the services that this lot believe should be paid for by students. What is more, the vast majority of students today are mature-age students. This came as a surprise to me, because things have clearly changed in the 30 years since I was an undergraduate. About two-thirds of students at Australian universities are mature age; they are over 21. That is an enormous change from 30 years ago. It is a huge demographic change in the make-up of the Australian undergraduate population. Even though there are more women, more disadvantaged kids and more people working part time, this lot believe that people should be forced to pay for what the inner-city left-wing activists believe should be the priorities of Australian students. That is what we find so offensive. 


The Labor Party say they speak for the disadvantaged. They always claim: 'The coalition do not care about disadvantaged students. The coalition do not speak for kids from the western suburbs of Sydney or Melbourne, or for Indigenous students or indeed for rural or regional students.' The Labor Party say, 'We care.' No, they do not. I can tell you now that the people that benefit from the expenditure of this money will be those people able to take advantage of it, and that will not be the people that work part time. Those kids who are disadvantaged will be working at the local pizza store or the local laundrette, or they will be working as a brickie's labourer or a truck driver. They will not be sitting in student unions collecting their pay cheques and spending money on fashionable left-wing activist causes. They will be working. Apparently the Labor Party speak for Indigenous students. Those kids will be out working. They will not be sitting on university campuses lolling in the bright afterglow of a 21st century Brideshead Revisited. That is not going to happen. The world has changed under the foot of the Left in this country and they do not quite get it. 


In a few years 40 per cent of young Australians will be going to university. That is two out of five. The vast majority of them, three-quarters of them, will be working. Two-thirds of them will be studying part time and an increasing number will be study­ing externally using modern technology. How are they going to take advantage of the great facilities they are going to be forced to pay for? The Labor Party do not care about that. They argue that they speak for the underprivileged. It is the coalition that speak for those students that work part time, the vast majority of whom cannot take advant­age of the services that they are expected to pay for. The coalition speak for young Australians that have to work. We speak for them, not this lot. They do not speak for them. The government are forcing kids that have to work or indeed study part time to pay the bill. We speak for those kids that work when they go to uni and we speak for part-time students. We speak for those kids that have no alternative except to work to put themselves through university. What is this lot doing about that? Absolutely nothing. What about kids from rural and regional Australia that have no alternative except to pay their own way? This lot know they do not have access to those services. Australian universities and their make-up have changed under the foot of the Australian Labor Party. 


This is an issue I know many people find arcane and perhaps even slightly overbearing at times. But this is such an important issue to the coalition. I want to make this point and I will make it again shortly. This is such a critical issue because none of us on this side of the chamber believe that any student, any young Australian, should have money compulsorily exacted from them and used for purposes they cannot or will not use. As Senator Cormann, Senator Humphries, Senator Fifield and many of my friends have said in the course of this debate, 'We have no problem—students can spend their money on any political cause they want.' None of us have any objection to that. But they will not spend the money of young Australians on political causes we find distasteful or, in my case, as you will remember, Temporary Chairman, abhorrent. Any of us that went to university over the last 20 or 30 years are so attuned to the potential horrors of this legislation that we cannot allow this bill to go through without a fight. Let me say this, because the government have not answered the legitimate questions that coalition senators have raised: we will be doing everything to monitor how this legislation is implemented and how it is monitored.

  No, Senator Cormann. I want to make it clear that my true voting intention was not to support that the question be put in relation to the division, but the outcome would not have been differ­ent. Having said that, I still support the government's legislation, for the reasons I outlined in my contribution to the second reading debate. I think it is important to point out that the Howard government, when it introduced this legislation, did set aside a specific fund—I think it was about $100 million—to make up for the loss of facilities and loss of services. Also, vice-chancellors across the country have expressed dismay about the impact VSU has had on campus facilities. To me, this is a pragmatic way to deal with those problems. It is legislation that I do support. I believe there are sufficient safeguards in it to ensure that it is not abused and that universities have control over it. For those reasons I still support the legislation, but I do want to make it clear that it was not my intention to support a guillotining of the further debate of this bill.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (13:48):  The coalition will be supporting the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 but will be opposing the Trademarks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011. There are about 15,000 tobacco and smoking related deaths in Australia each year and there are many more cases of illness and hospital admission. It is sensible public policy to take action to reduce rates of smok­ing, as noted by the opposition's support for the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill. The Trademarks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill, however, is not written to reduce rates of smoking. By the most gener­ous interpretation it is designed to enable the Minister for Health and Ageing to make regulations with respect to anything related to trademarks. By the least generous inter­pretation the bill would enable the minister to make regulations significantly contrary to the Trademarks Act 1995. Before I explain the opposition's support for the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill and its opposition to the Trademarks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill I must make mention of the Minister for Health and Ageing and her discussion of tobacco plain-packaging legislation.


While not discounting the public health benefits of reducing smoking, Ms Roxon has applied herself with incredible zeal to this task. Unfortunately, the zeal has sat uncom­fortably beside the hypocrisy of the health minister. Ms Roxon, it was revealed, had sent a fundraising request to a major tobacco company in 2005, the year after Labor banned tobacco company donations. This was just a year after the then Labor leader, Mark Latham, had banned the party from taking donations from tobacco companies. As recently as June 2011, New South Wales ALP secretary, Sam Dastyari, wrote to the same company, Philip Morris, offering a $5,000 place at a business dialogue and country business forum. It was deceitful of Minister Roxon to tell the public one thing and then do something completely opposite behind the scenes. The minister even failed to front up at the annual committee sessions in the other place to consider the govern­ment's budget bills in detail this year. This was obviously so that she could dodge questions about her attempts to solicit funding from the cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris in 2005. Her hypocrisy was to say one thing in public and then do something else.


The Gillard government protected the minister on 15 June when it refused to debate an opposition motion that the minister expl­ain to parliament why she publicly criticised tobacco company donations to political parties but privately sought their financial support. The minister has sought to politicise the issues surrounding plain packaging and tobacco control for her own political gain. The Minister for Health and Ageing has taken the attitude that if you do not agree with her 100 per cent then you must be in the pockets of tobacco companies. She has no proof other than her belief that this is so. What we now know is her own relationship with big tobacco was much closer and cosier than anyone ever realised. The minister has never fully disclosed the extent to which she was in the pockets of big tobacco. In a ministerial statement on 14 June 2011, Ms Roxon said: 


… Big Tobacco will try and pull all sorts of tricks along the way to discredit me, discredit the policy or discredit the Government.


Well, Minister Roxon, the only thing big tobacco did was offer you tickets to the football and the tennis. They did not try to hide the minister's attendance. The minister did all that by herself.


Not everyone has been happy with the minister's stand. In April, on the ABC's Lateline program, Ms Roxon said that health warnings and graphic pictures would make up the majority of the olive green packaging. She said:


We've done a lot of research to ensure that we make the cigarette packs as unattractive as possible …


…   …   …


Apparently dark olive is the least attractive colour - olive green - for any smokers and particularly for young people.




Senator Chris Evans:
  I changed all my suits as a result!




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  I can just see you, Minister Evans, in olive green! The Australian Olive Association was outraged, as was reported by the Sydney Morning Herald online, and said the move would 'denigrate their brand and cost them money'. The report said:


Association chief executive Lisa Rowntree has sent a cease-and-desist letter to Health Minister Nicola Roxon, asking her to stop using the term ''olive green'' and instead adopt the term ''drab green''.


''Our members are having enough problems countering the flood of imported olive products being dumped in Australia via the large supermarket chains without the government promoting to the community that there is something negative about olive green,'' the letter says.


Ms Roxon reportedly said:


''I'd be happy to offer an (olive) branch to the association and support their bid for greater publicity.''


In her speech to the plenary session of the United Nations High-Level Meeting on Non-Communicable Diseases in New York recently, Minister Roxon extended that olive branch. She told the meeting:


From next year, all tobacco products are sold in Australia will be required to have the same packaging in an unattractive drab dark brown colour. 


Here's hoping Cadbury are not offended!


The coalition has a proven track record with regard to tobacco control and reducing the rates of smoking in Australia. It was Robert Menzies who first introduced a voluntary tobacco advertising code for television in 1966. It was the Fraser Liberal government in 1976 that first implemented a ban on the advertising of tobacco products on TV and radio. Dr Wooldridge, in June 1997, announced what at the time was the biggest ever national advertising campaign against smoking, with a federal government spend of $7 million over two years. The Howard government reformed cigarette taxation from a weight basis to a per stick excise in 1999. It was the Howard govern­ment and Tony Abbott, as health minister, who introduced the graphic health warnings on tobacco products in 2006. It was the coalition which first proposed an increase in the tobacco excise in 2009, a measure later adopted by the government. The coalition presided over the biggest decline in smoking rates whilst in government, with the prevalence of smoking declining from 21.8 per cent in 1998 to 16.6 per cent of Australians over the age of 14 by 2007. This was amongst the lowest rates of smoking in the world. The decline in smoking rates in Australia—a fall of 40 per cent for men and 44 per cent for women between 1989 and 2007—was amongst the biggest in the OECD. The fall in smoking rates amongst women was the biggest in the OECD. So any suggestion that the coalition is soft on tobacco companies is just plain nonsense.


There is no silver bullet. There must be a comprehensive tobacco control strategy, and no one measure will work by itself. There have been concerns raised by stakeholders regarding the legality of this proposal, under three different avenues. The first is that it would constitute acquisition of property on other than just terms according to section 51 of the Australian Constitution and that it may violate article 20 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, the TRIPS agreement, which came into effect on 1 January 1995. This is a minimum standards agreement which allows members to provide more extensive protect­ion of intellectual property if they so wish. Members are left free to determine the appropriate method of implementing the provisions of the agreement within their own legal system and practice.


The second is as follows. The TRIPS agreement is an agreement made under the World Trade Organisation and is a multilat­eral agreement on intellectual property. Article 20 says:


The use of a trademark in the course of trade shall not be unjustifiably encumbered by special requirements …


There is, however, a health exception to the TRIPS agreement, and this is where the legal contention lies—that this legislation may violate the 1993 Australia-Hong Kong investment treaty, and Philip Morris may sue the Commonwealth over plain packaging under the expropriation and investor state dispute settlement provisions of the treaty. This was explained by Deborah Gleeson and David Legge of the School of Public Health and Human Biosciences at La Trobe Univer­sity. As they wrote in the Conversation on 7 July 2011:


Expropriation, in ordinary usage, means dispossessing property owners of their property. But it has a much broader meaning under trade law.


The government and the minister have on many occasions assured the opposition that the legal advice surrounding their plain packaging proposal is robust and that they are on strong legal ground. The coalition has accepted the government's assurance regard­ing this on face value. This is because the government have refused to provide a copy of their legal advice to the opposition. Despite this, proposed section 15 of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill provides that this bill would not apply to the extent that it would cause acquisition of property on other than just terms under section 51 of the Australian Constitution. This means that they must have some doubts as to the strength of their legal advice.


There is also a small retailer impact. The government's consultation with small business retailers over this issue has been lacking. Small retailers are concerned at the way the government's plain packaging proposal will impact their stock management and at their point of sale, with the difficulties in differentiating between packets that look almost identical.


There are also issues with counterfeit, illicit tobacco. While Australia is generally seen by its peers as a country which has a lower rate of illicit and counterfeit tobacco, there are some concerns that plain packaging may increase this rate. The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service annual report shows that over the past three years it has seized—

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (13:48):  The coalition will be supporting the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 but will be opposing the Trademarks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011. There are about 15,000 tobacco and smoking related deaths in Australia each year and there are many more cases of illness and hospital admission. It is sensible public policy to take action to reduce rates of smok­ing, as noted by the opposition's support for the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill. The Trademarks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill, however, is not written to reduce rates of smoking. By the most gener­ous interpretation it is designed to enable the Minister for Health and Ageing to make regulations with respect to anything related to trademarks. By the least generous inter­pretation the bill would enable the minister to make regulations significantly contrary to the Trademarks Act 1995. Before I explain the opposition's support for the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill and its opposition to the Trademarks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill I must make mention of the Minister for Health and Ageing and her discussion of tobacco plain-packaging legislation.


While not discounting the public health benefits of reducing smoking, Ms Roxon has applied herself with incredible zeal to this task. Unfortunately, the zeal has sat uncom­fortably beside the hypocrisy of the health minister. Ms Roxon, it was revealed, had sent a fundraising request to a major tobacco company in 2005, the year after Labor banned tobacco company donations. This was just a year after the then Labor leader, Mark Latham, had banned the party from taking donations from tobacco companies. As recently as June 2011, New South Wales ALP secretary, Sam Dastyari, wrote to the same company, Philip Morris, offering a $5,000 place at a business dialogue and country business forum.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (14:01):  First, on the issue of why now, I make this point: the opposition will always say that, because they have said that before. The reality is that it will never be the right time according to Senator Abetz and those on that side of the chamber. It does not matter what is occurring in the global economy, those on the other side have a very clear position: they do not wish to deal with this economic reform. They do not wish to start to shift the Australian economy towards the clean energy economy of the future; they do not wish to take that responsibility. They do not wish to take responsibility for acting on climate change. They would rather turn their faces away from reform. They would rather run a scare campaign. They would rather simply throw bombs. That is the approach of the opposition. That is the reality.


We on this side of the chamber are very cognisant also of the advice that was provided to Prime Minister Howard and that has consistently been provided to govern­ments by experts, including the Treasury. That advice is simply that the longer we delay the higher will be the costs. We know that, when you are making an economic transition, if you make that transition later rather than earlier you lock more investment in the old economy, which then has to be unwound, rather than direct investment to the new economy, to the clean energy jobs of the future. We know that the coalition will not be responsible on this; they would rather increase costs. They have, in addition to their $70 billion black hole, a policy which is all about slugging Australian taxpayers, Australian households, to fund a reduction in Australia's carbon pollution.

  Mr President, a point of order on relevance: sessional orders require that the minister be directly relevant to the question asked.

Nothing in the minister's answer relates to the question which was asked.




Senator Ludwig:
  Mr President, Senator Abetz tries to make the point that the minister is not answering the question. In fact, the minister is answering the question and is being directly relevant. That the minister is not answering the question in the way the opposition wants her to answer the question is not a point of order. The minister is being directly relevant to the question being asked.

  The minister has 31 seconds remaining to answer the question. There is no point of order at this stage.

  I was asked about international action. I would make the point that Australia's top five trading partners—China, Japan, the US, Korea and India—are implementing or piloting emissions trading schemes, carbon taxes and coal taxes at various governmental levels. China has indicated it will introduce pilot emissions trading schemes in a number of provinces, including the industrial centres of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong.

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity) (15:02):  On 22 September 2011, Senator Waters asked me a question about coal seam gas regulation. I seek leave to incorporate further information in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The answer read as follows:



Senator Waters: Given the minister's view that the regulation of coal seam gas mining is primarily a matter for state governments, is the minister alarmed at admissions made by the Queensland government's head of LNG enforce­ment last week that the coal seam gas industry will have aquifer and regional scale impacts, and that the Queensland government is only monitor­ing 10 per cent of coal seam gas wells for leaking methane and aquifer connectivity?


The Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities has provided the following answer to the honourable Senator's questions.


The separate roles and responsibilities of state and Commonwealth governments in regulating the coal seam gas industry are determined by legislation. The Commonwealth government is responsible for managing compliance with the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act).


Compliance with the Queensland regulatory regime is a matter for the Queensland govern­ment. The statement the honourable senator refers to relates to matters of state responsibility and concerns wells that have been approved under state laws. None of the three coal seam gas projects approved under Commonwealth legisla­tion has yet reached production.


In deciding to approve three coal seam gas projects, proposed respectively by Queensland Gas Company, Santos, and Australia Pacific LNG, the minister received detailed advice from Geoscience Australia and another independent expert on groundwater issues, including aquifer connectivity. That advice, and the conditions attached to the approval of those projects, addressed the question of regional impacts. The conditions require the companies to each submit detailed plans for the management of aquifers, groundwater and surface water for the minister's approval, and to undertake aquifer connectivity studies, and carry out ongoing monitoring and reporting of their activities throughout the life of their project. The conditions provide for precau­tionary drawdown thresholds, to provide an early indication of any unacceptable groundwater-related impacts. If those thresholds are exceeded, the companies must restore pressure, for example, by reinjection or other approved means.


The conditions also require the companies to contribute data to a regional groundwater model that will inform the adaptive management of these projects at both the project scale and the regional scale. The regional groundwater model is being developed by the Queensland Water Commission, with the involvement of the coal seam gas companies, independent experts and officers from the Commonwealth and Queensland governments.


Senator Waters: Mr President, I have a further supplementary question. Given the mounting scientific and community concern, and the inade­quate state regulation of coal seam gas, will the government now adequately resource depart­mental monitoring and enforcement of those federal conditions, reconsider its refusal to add a water trigger to our environmental laws, and reconsider its refusal to impose a moratorium until the full impacts of coal seam gas are understood?


The Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities has provided the following answer to the honourable Senator's questions.


The Department of Sustainability, Environ­ment, Water, Population and Communities includes a dedicated compliance and enforcement branch for enforcement of federal conditions under the EPBC Act. Since the federal approval of three Queensland coal seam gas projects, the department has established an additional section dedicated specifically to monitoring compliance with the conditions attached to the minister's approval of coal seam gas projects.


The independent review of the EPBC Act, led by Dr Allan Hawke AC, considered but did not recommend a water trigger. Dr Hawke concluded that including water extraction or use as a matter of National Environmental Significance was not the best mechanism for managing water resources.


Under the EPBC Act, the Australian Govern­ment considers the impacts of proposals on defined matters of national environmental significance. The EPBC Act does not include a provision for the minister to refuse to assess and decide on proposals. The possibility of a general moratorium on coal seam gas would be a matter for state and territory governments, which have wider regulatory responsibilities for exploration and mining.

That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation (Senator Wong) to questions without notice asked today.


This week is a very sad week for our nation. It is a nation that went to an election and was given a warrant by the highest elected office holder in the land at that time that there would be no carbon tax under the govern­ment she led. Now we are apparently going to go down that path. Unfortunately, we will have no government under the carbon tax she leads. It is sad that at this point in time, with all the precarious things that are happening on the global economic front, we would be foolish enough to go down this path, ignoring the fallout that is happening in Europe as we speak.


We are on the edge of a precipice. This government is just completely and utterly self-indulgent. It also shows the power in our nation that the Australian Greens have now. The Labor Party is obviously tied in the most intricate form in its policy structure to what was in the past a peripheral party. The Greens' desire for Australia is one in which there is no coalmining. The Greens do not believe in a coalmining industry for Australia, they do not believe in live cattle exports, they do not believe in the irrigation industry of the Murray-Darling Basin—they do not believe in so much of what is fundamentally important to keeping our nation strong.


They say all these mystical things. They talk about compensation. You only need compensation if you have been hurt. No one ever pays compensation to somebody who has not been afflicted. That in itself is an admission of the sorts of problems we are going to have. They talk about the compen­sation package for the steel industry. Quite obviously they recognise that the steel industry will get smashed. They talk about the compensation package for pensioners, and of course that is a recognition that the pensioners are going to get smashed. They talk about giving people back some of their own money, and they expect people to say thank you for it. It is just an absurd kafkaesque policy.


The whole point of a carbon tax is a pricing mechanism to make things dearer. That is how it works. If that does not happen, there is no point to it. If it does work, then it is totally dangerous and we should not be doing it. Power is not currently free. There is a very high price for power. Many people struggle with the price of power as it is and they do not need any more incentive not to use power. We are seeing in the United States the highest levels of poverty since 1964, and we see similar things in Europe. We should be doing everything we can in our nation to draw the wagons into a circle, to make our nation strong. 


It is absurd that we are going down this path right now. When I last checked our debt was $211,392 billion. We borrowed in excess of $2 billion just last week. Jeffrey Sachs says that $3 billion would be the annual cost of curing malaria in Africa. We borrowed that in 1½ weeks. We have to pay this money back. If we do not pay this money back, our nation will be in so much strife and so much trouble. How do we pay the money back? We put ourselves in a strong position. We accentuate the areas where we are strong. We are strong in the export of minerals and in the production of agriculture. What on earth are we doing putting a tax on these things? One of the greatest fundamentals we ever delivered to this nation was a fair standard of living. This is a direct attack on our Australian standard of living.


The question at the essence of this tax that those opposite never answer is how much will this tax that they are about to impose on Australia cool the temperature of the globe? The answer is that it will do absolutely nothing to the temperature of the globe. It is merely a gesture. We are inflicting the privations of poverty on people who cannot afford it, all for a gesture. And this has come from the Labor Party. They used to represent the people who are doing it tough, but now they are not—they have been hijacked by a very particular group in Australia, the Australian Greens, and this will destroy our nation and it will destroy the Australian Labor Party.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2011-10-11,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (15:11):  Senator Joyce started off by saying what a sad week it was, but what is really sad about this week is that those on the other side are still naysayers and sceptics. Everybody on this side knows that introducing a price on carbon is the right thing to do for the economy and that cutting carbon pollution will help to drive investment in clean energy technologies and the infrastructure asso­ciated with that in areas such as solar, gas and wind. It will help build the clean energy future that future generations deserve. I have great concern about what we are leaving future generations. When there is a chance for us to make something better and try to repair some of the damage that has been done, it is incumbent upon the government to take action to do that—not to just, like those on the other side, misrepresent, misconstrue and misreport anything that comes across the desk in regard to clean energy and carbon pricing.


Most of question time was taken up with this issue today and I am sure that will continue to occur for the rest of the week. A number of mistruths or misconceptions were put forward in question time. I did hear one big misconception put forward—although, due to the number of interjections by those on the other side, it gets a bit hard to hear sometimes. 



Senator Boyce interjecting—




Senator BILYK:
  I rest my case. We sit here patiently and listen to all they have to say but their manners are astounding—they have to interject. They cannot help themselves. Obviously they like the sound of their own voices. Areas like China, Japan, the US and India are moving in a similar direction, yet those opposite are saying that other countries are doing nothing. I have heard them say that on many occasions, and it is simply not true. As I have said, it is important that we do this for future generations—for our children, our grandchil­dren and our great-grandchildren. Delaying this action will cause enormous problems. We are well aware that those on the other side like to oppose for opposing's sake. They consistently and persistently do it, as we heard all through question time and as we hear out there when they have their mates running ads to try to stop carbon pricing going through. They run the scare campaigns but I think people are seeing through them. I consider it an absolute abuse of power by those on the other side. I think they need to come clean about what is happening. 


Mr Deputy President, this will probably be of great interest to you. I have some statistics about how carbon price household assistance will help Tasmania, which is the home state of both you and me. In case you were not aware, Mr Deputy President, more than 102,300 pensioners in Tasmania will receive in their pension payments an extra $338 extra per year if they are single and up to $510 per year if they are a couple. This is very important to pensioners within Tasmania and, in fact, throughout the nation. More than 45,600 families in Tasmania will receive household assistance through their family assistance payments.


Yes, we are compensating people for the fact that there needs to be a carbon price, but those on the other side have the audacity to say that we should not have to compensate people unless they are damaged. I do not think taking $1,300 off every person is any better. In fact, the direct, no-action policy that those on the other side and Mr Abbott adhere to has big problems. On the Gillard government side, we are working hard to make sure that more than 5,300 self-funded retirees in Tasmania will receive an extra $338 a year in assistance for singles and up to $510 per year for couples combined.


Mr Deputy President, I know you will be interested in this because you are quite concerned with people in jobs: more than 18,900 jobseekers in Tasmania will also get up to $218 extra per year for singles and $390 per year— (Time expired)

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2011-10-11,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (15:16): The carbon tax is a bad tax based on a lie. The original deception of the Australian people was in the lead up to the last election, when the Prime Minister promised that there would be no carbon tax under a government she leads. Even now, the Labor-Green alliance continues to deceive the Australian people. The reason it wants to rush this legislation through the parliament this week is because it knows that every day that goes by with more parliamentary scrutiny, more flaws and more deceptions will be exposed.


The Labor-Green alliance wants people to believe that the carbon tax and the emissions trading scheme which is to follow will reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, but the carbon tax will do nothing of the sort. It will not even reduce emissions here in Australia. In the past, when we debated the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation proposed by the former Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, I was concerned that the proposal was to reduce emissions in Australia in a way that would just shift them overseas into areas where emissions would be higher than they would be in Australia. To a degree that is still true under this bad carbon tax because, while emissions under the carbon tax will be somewhat lower in Australia than they otherwise would be, under the government's carbon pricing package emissions in Australia will continue to grow.


Do not take my word for it. When I asked Senator Wong today during question time to explain and confirm that she was not prepared to do so, but this information comes directly out of the Treasury's own modelling; it is there in black and white. Emissions now are 578 million tonnes. According to the Treasury modelling, under the carbon tax and the emissions trading scheme, emissions in 2020 will be 621 million tonnes. So emissions will go up. The government argues, 'Yes, but emissions will be lower than they otherwise would have been, so it is fair for us to claim that somehow emissions will go down.' Okay, if your argument is that something is falling even though it is going up, on the basis that it will be lower than it otherwise would have been, what about jobs? What about real wages? What about the economy? The Treasury modelling shows that, under the carbon tax and the emissions trading scheme, Australia's GDP will be 2.8 per cent lower by 2050 than it otherwise would have been. Using the government's rhetoric and spin in relation to emissions, that means that the economy is actually going to shrink. Economic growth is going to fall. This is the government's language. The Treasury modelling indicates that under the carbon tax real wages will be more than five per cent lower by 2050 than it otherwise would be. So real wages are falling. If you use the government's argument that emiss­ions in Australia are falling even though they are going from 578 million tonnes to 621 million tonnes, because they will be lower than it otherwise would have been, then that means that real wages will fall, because they will be lower than they otherwise would have been.


The point here is that the carbon tax—a tax that the people of Australia do not want and which the government is pursuing and ramming through the parliament in defiance of the Australian people—will push up the cost of everything, will reduce our interna­tional competitiveness, will cost jobs and will result in lower wages. It will do all of that while emissions will continue to grow.


One final observation in relation to some of the comments by Senator Carr on local content is that if the Prime Minister were serious about achieving more local content she would scrap her carbon tax, which will make locally manufactured goods more expensive. Under the carbon tax we are in a ludicrous situation where higher emitting manufacturers overseas will become more competitive than lower emitting businesses in Australia. As higher emitting businesses overseas take market share away from us emissions internationally will go up, not down. This whole carbon tax is a joke. It is a bad tax based on a lie. The Labor Party knows it, which is why it wants to ram it through the parliament.

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (15:21):  I start by acknowledging and thanking Senator Wong for the information, the education and the conviction that she gave in her answers in question time today on issues relating to our clean energy bills and in relation to climate change. However, what we know on this side of the chamber is that the opposition continues to oppose everything in relation to clean energy and climate change despite the science, despite the activity in our global economy and despite what is happening in other countries introducing their own emiss­ions trading schemes. Instead, the opposition would prefer to continue to run scare campaigns that will do nothing to move Australia's economy into a transformed, clean energy economy, will do nothing for prosperity and will do nothing to ensure that we are playing our part in the global arena, both environmentally and economically, in relation to climate change—something that, as I said, the science is clear on and something that needs our action.


We believe in moving Australia forward into a clean energy economy. We believe in that important transformation that needs to take place. That is why, like the rest of the globe, Australia will have a price on clean energy goods and services, to ensure that we have a competitive economy with the rest of the globe in relation to clean energy. That relates very much to manufacturing, as Senator Cormann touched on, in his most negative fashion, just previously. That is because manufacturing is an important component in our transformation to a clean energy economy. That is why the Clean Energy Future package includes extensive support for Australia's manufacturing industry—a $9.2 billion Jobs and Competi­tiveness Program which will shield heavy industry sectors like steelmaking, aluminium production and glass and paper manufactur­ing from the carbon price and support jobs in Australia. On top of that, it will provide an additional $300 million for steel transform­ation, with a Steel Transformation Plan to provide extra assistance for steelmakers in this transformation to a clean energy future.


This is an incredibly important week. We have not had our chance yet in this place to debate the clean energy bills, but this week in the House of Representatives they will be doing just that. They will be voting this week on the government's Clean Energy Future legislation, which will let us get on with the job of tackling climate change, playing our role as a nation by putting a price on carbon so that we can ensure that we can play a competitive role, along with other nations, including the European Union, with an emissions trading scheme. The legislation that we will get to debate in here puts the price tag on only around 500 of our biggest polluters, and every cent of the revenue raised will be used to assist households, to support jobs and competitiveness and to invest in clean energy and climate change programs.


These are good things that are coming out of putting a price on carbon, something that the opposition continue to simply ignore. They do not want to know about the good things that come about from these clean energy bills. They do not want to admit and accept that what we have here in this significant reform for this nation will in fact be good for people, good for the environment, good for the climate and good for our Australian economy as we play the role that we need to in a globally competitive environment.


Some of those good things include assisting households with tax cuts and raising the tax-free threshold to $18½ thousand—something that will benefit thousands upon thousands of low-income Australians. That is a really good thing that is coming out of these clean energy bills. On top of that, we are increasing family payments and raising pensions and allowances—another good thing that the Gillard Labor government are doing for people in these bills. Not only is this package good for people and for the economy but it is also— (Time expired)

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2011-10-11,"



Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (15:26):  I am indebted to the Queensland Resources Council for pointing out that tomorrow is Pudding Day. It is the 93rd anniversary of the publication of The Magic Pudding, Norman Lindsay's book—which I think everyone here will know—about a pudding that could be eaten over and over again and magically resume its wholeness. The magic pudding, of course, has come to be emblematic of situations where various vested interests have sought to take a piece out of a growth sector of the economy and believed that the sector would suffer no harm and simply renew and reform itself. How very appropriate, the Queensland Resources Council points out, that the vote on the Gillard government's carbon tax legislation is going to be on Pudding Day.


The so-called Clean Energy Future set of bills is a classic case of magic pudding public policy. The government seem to think that we can go it alone. Despite the protestations of the government there are very small sections in Europe, China and some states of America where carbon tax policies or emissions trading schemes have been introduced, and there is nothing with the sort of cost that is going to be imposed on Australia. There will be no magic pudding when we are talking about the world's biggest carbon tax, a tax that is based on a lie perpetrated by the Prime Minister during the election campaign in 2010.


The great magic pudding will in fact turn out to be a little piece of blancmange on the toes of the Gillard government. The analysis of federal Treasury modelling shows that the carbon pricing scheme will reduce national income by $1 trillion by 2050 and there will be a fall of 0.1 per cent every year from the introduction of the tax until 2050. When this is compounded, we are talking about a 2.8 per cent reduction in GDP. Minister Wong liked to claim that the opposition was running a scare campaign about jobs on the carbon tax. I am sorry, but the opposition has some very, very good company. This is not a scare campaign; this is the truth that the government fail to recognise. Probably they would include Mr Dick Warburton from Manufacturing Australia as one of the scare campaigners. The Rudd government did not think that when it appointed him to run an advisory group on emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries. It did not think that when he was a director of the Reserve Bank. Both positions put him in a position to have a very good view of what will happen when this tax is introduced. He is not a scare campaigner; he is a genuine, committed Australian who wants to act in the national interest.


Let us look also at the National Generators Forum, which makes the remarkable comment—remarkable to this government, anyway—that it will pass on increased costs to consumers. What a bizarre idea. That should not happen, according to the government. The National Generators Forum says that the carbon tax will cost $40 billion extra in the generation of power to the end of 2019-20. The government can compensate all it likes, but there will not be enough.


There is a better way: it is to accept the coalition's direct action plan and support for renewable energy growth. It is to pass the amendments, which will be put to the House of Representatives this evening, to delay any proclamation of this bill until after an election. That would allow this government to find out and be brave about introducing this disastrous tax. (Time expired)

"Boswell, Sen Ronald",Nats,2011-10-11,"



Senator BOSWELL
 (Queensland) (16:14):  It is very timely that this matter be debated in the Senate. This is a disaster facing Australia—a carbon tax—and it will be a greater disaster for rural and regional Australia, where everything has to be carried in or taken out. It is going to be not only a carbon tax but a tax on transport that fits in with a carbon tax, and rural Australia is going to pay a very heavy price for this.


It does not really have to. The Labor vote in New England was eight per cent, and the Labor vote in Lyne was 13 per cent, yet those representatives are going to vote for a carbon tax that is going to hit rural and regional Australia desperately. When you think about this, you would have to think this is the greatest sell-out since Judas Iscariot took 30 pieces of silver. That is what it amounts to. These people have betrayed their electorates. The National Party whip took a survey the other day in New England and in Lyne, and that vote was 89 per cent against a carbon tax in New England and 87 per cent against a carbon tax in Lyne. Yet these two people are going to vote for a carbon tax that is going to hit their electorates harder than any other electorates. What a betrayal! What an absolute, total betrayal of the people that they represent! I expect both of them are looking for alternative areas to get an income from after the next election, and that next election is going to come around one way or another—maybe in three months time; maybe in six months time—and the people are going to seek their vengeance for this carbon tax. But none will be seeking it harder than the people in regional Australia.


But, before we get onto the effects of what is going to happen in regional Australia, this carbon tax really is unworkable. The Labor Party say that it is the greatest thing for Australia, but there is no modelling done. Senator Wong has said today that the modelling is available. ABARES modelling is not available. The ABARES modelling that this carbon tax is based on is not available. I have asked questions in the estimates committee. People have gone down and tried to buy it and have been refused. So how can anyone go to Australia and say, 'Here is a plan, and that plan is based on a model, but no-one has seen the model'? It is not just Senator Ron Boswell saying that; it is people like McKibbin and Ergas, who are some of the most prominent economists in Australia. They cannot get the model. They do not know what is in the modelling.


The modelling is based on assumptions, and the assumptions are that the rest of the world is going to do this by 2016. The rest of the world have shown no indication of doing it at all—none whatsoever—yet the Labor Party merrily goes along and says, 'The modelling is there.' The modelling is not there, and I will give a donation to the Labor Party if it produces this modelling. I will even give it to your union, Senator Cameron. That is how confident I am that the modelling is not available and never will be available, because if it were available then it would be out there in a package put in every letterbox if it proved that the Labor Party modelling was accurate and that there would be more jobs and more income coming in. The reason that modelling is not available and never will be available is that it would disprove what the Labor Party have said. The committee has written to the Treasurer, and the Treasurer has said the modelling is not available. People in various peak bodies have gone down and tried to find the modelling, yet we are told it is not available.


So the whole thing becomes a farce. The whole carbon tax is a farce because there is nothing it is based on—only the assumption that the rest of the world is going to get there by 2016. India is not going to get there. America is not going to be in it. Tokyo will not do it if America does not do it. India has said it is not going to do it. Jakarta cannot do it. The rest of the world will not get there. Yet we proceed down here, and the people that are going to get crunched the hardest are going to be the people from rural and regional Australia.


When you go through it and look at all industries out there—the dairy industry; the aviation industry; abattoirs; fruit; vegetables; fish processors—everything that moves in and out of Australia's regional areas is going to get hit. The greatest creator of jobs in Australia at the moment—it employs 200,000 people in rural and regional Australia—is the mining industry. It has 200,000 direct employees and 600,000 indirect employees, and it accounts for 55 per cent of the exports in Australia. One in four regional jobs depends on exports, and a carbon tax is going to hit that industry to the tune of $25 billion. That is what the carbon tax is going to cost. That is not what the mining tax is going to cost on top of that; that is what the carbon tax is going to cost. Then to come in here and say, 'Well, we're going to create jobs; everything's going to be all right in rural Australia,' is just an absolute nonsense, and the fact is that everyone knows it. That is why the vote of the Labor Party is so low. That is why the Labor Party is bottoming out at around 26 per cent. The sooner the election comes, the better it will be for all of us. I had a call the other day from a very irate person. He said I could use his name, so I will use his name. People in Brisbane will know the company I am talking about. It is Morgans Seafoods from Redcliffe. Morgans have a fishing company and they have a restaurant. In the restaurant, electricity charges are going to go up $7,856 in 2013 and by 2015 they will have gone up by $8,679. That is for the restaurant. For their wholesale fish coldroom, electricity charges will go up $16,982—effectively $17,000—in 2014 and by 2015 they will have gone up by $18,762.


Every farm that produces fruit or vegetables has a coldroom. The carbon tax will mean those coldrooms will cost an extra $15,000, $16,000 or $18,000 to run. Every farm that produces food puts it in a coldroom. It is transferred in a refrigerated truck into another coldroom. So there is going to be a carbon tax on every piece of food that goes into or out of a farm.


There is going to be a carbon tax on fuel. It starts off at 6c a litre and it works its way up. For vehicles that are under 4½ tonnes, it starts off at 5.52c in 2013 and in 2014 it goes to nearly 7c. That is going to add to the cost of every piece of food— (Time expired)

 (New South Wales) (16:24):  I always like following Senator Boswell in a debate on climate change because I always like to say that at least Senator Boswell is not like the majority of the coalition in the Senate—he does not hide the fact that he does not believe in climate change. Senator Boswell does not think that the sea level will rise; Senator Boswell does not think it is going to get warmer; Senator Boswell does not think that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat; and Senator Boswell thinks that we can keep ploughing CO2 into the atmosphere, polluting the atmosphere, with absolutely no consequences. At least Senator Boswell actually believes that.


The ones who are the problem are those in the coalition who actually know that CO2 is damaging to the future of this planet and who actually know that future generations will pay a huge price in their living standards and in terms of the environment. They are the ones who will pay the price—future generations. It is clear on any economic analysis that the best way to deal with carbon pollution is to put a price on that pollution. Senator Boswell says that no-one is doing anything. That is part of the misinformation; that is part of the fear campaign that is underpinning the coalition's approach to this very important issue. In fact, the opposite is the truth. China is the biggest producer and user of renewables—




Senator Williams:
  And coal.




Senator CAMERON:
  Senator Williams says they are also the biggest producer of coal. That is correct—they are the biggest producer of coal, they are the biggest user of coal and they are at the forefront, along with the Australian government, in trying to produce carbon capture and storage processes to make sure that we can continue to use coal.


The scare campaign which has been run by the coalition is simply short-termism. It is about trying to get short-term political advantage. It is about saying, 'We do not really care about future generations.' You do not care about my grandkids. Some of you do not even care about your own family's future if there is some kind of short-term advantage politically. The scientific facts are clear—there is an imperative to deal with climate change. Some in the coalition understand this. The member for Wentworth, Malcolm Turnbull, knows that full well. He knows that you have to deal with climate change. Your former leader was knocked off because he actually spoke the truth in the coalition party room. He was knocked off because he said the best way to deal with climate change is to put a price on carbon.


The majority in the coalition actually reject the science. They are antiscientific. They are absolutely antiscientific.



Senator Bernardi interjecting—



Senator Williams interjecting—




Senator CAMERON:
  You can hear the groans coming from the coalition—the groans and moans: 'They've got us again. Yes, we are antiscientific, but please don't tell us, because we don't like being told that we are antiscientific.' You are absolutely antiscientific, because the science says that you have to deal with climate change and what is your answer to that? Your answer is: direct action. What is direct action? Direct action is a fraud. Direct action is the biggest fraud anyone has ever attempted to perpetrate on the Australian community. It is such a fraud—the CSIRO has looked at the argument that you can have all of this climate abatement through soil carbon and has said that it is not achievable.


You will be consigning future generations to ever-increasing sea levels, ever-increasing carbon in the atmosphere and ever-increasing environmental problems, affecting their ability to have a decent life. There is a sound economic basis for what the government is doing; there is absolutely no economic basis for the coalition's policy. The argument that we are acting alone is wrong. The European Union has its carbon abatement scheme in place—a carbon trading scheme—and the rest of the world is moving to reduce carbon. The Commonwealth's modelling is the most effective modelling around to predict what will happen.


We heard a bit said earlier about Professor Henry Ergas. It always amuses me to hear the coalition use Professor Ergas as an expert on what should be done. This is a man who ran a company that was put into liquidation. He tells us at committee after committee: 'I can't run my own company. My company went into liquidation but listen to me and I will tell you how to run the country.' What an absolute joke! Up comes Professor Ergas time and time again, telling people what they should be doing when he could not even run his own company. Maybe it was because the coalition did not pay their bills. I am not sure because he was the chief economist for the coalition in opposition and he was the guy who ran all of the coalition's arguments on economic policy. All of them were wrong; all of them were bad; all of them were crook. So do not quote Professor Ergas as some authority on anything when he could not even run his own company.


We heard the argument that there was all doom and gloom out there in the regions. I just had the good fortune to hear Mackay Sugar—what could be more regional than Mackay Sugar, a 140-year-old canegrowing company?—say that, yes, you have to put a price on carbon and yes, it is going to mean great opportunities for us. What are their opportunities? They are going to diversify their operation and they are constructing a $120 million renewable co-generation plant which will supply about one-third of Mackay's electricity. How can they do that? They can only do it because there is a price on carbon and there is a renewable energy target. It is a federal government initiative. That is the only thing they can do.




Senator Sterle:
  It's gone all quiet over there.




Senator CAMERON:
  It has gone all quiet over there. These are canegrowers, people who actually understand the economics of doing something. They said that they will contribute to Australia's renewable energy market. Their perspective is that it is not a job destroyer, that the $120 million co-generation plant was based on the 20 per cent renewable energy scheme. They say, 'The carbon tax should enhance our revenue from co-generation.' That is what is happening. 'And we are hoping it will allow us to go ahead with another co-gen plant within a couple of years. These projects typically employ about 250 people during the construction period and a dozen or so under operations.' So, hundreds of construction jobs and dozens of full-time jobs being created because we are taking an initiative to put a price on carbon. It is only those on the other side who would deny this. Not only do they deny the science, but also they deny the economics. If you accept the science then you have an obligation to put up a proposition that reduces our carbon pollution at the least cost price. That is what the government has done. We have taken advice and that advice is to put a price on carbon and let the market determine the price. You put your cap in place, you put your price in place and you allow the market to determine the process. That is what is important for this country because we are about the future, not the past. We are about science and not being unscientific. We are about ensuring that future generations have a way forward for a decent environment in this country.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2011-10-11,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (16:34):  I must comment on the 'short political gain' to the coalition that Senator Cameron referred to on this issue. I wonder then how he regards Ms Gillard's promise four days before the election that 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' I wonder if that was 'short political gain'? I think it would have been. What if she had said, 'If we win this election, we are going to introduce the biggest and most expensive carbon tax in the world and after three years we will move to an emissions trading scheme and, by the way, after two years we will inflict what Mr Sheldon from the Transport Workers Union calls a 'death tax' on the transport industry'?


But back to the debate about regional Australia. Senator Cameron only ever mentioned Mackay—he did not mention any more of regional Australia, where we now pay the highest electricity bills. In regional New South Wales we spend 25 per cent more on electricity than those consumers in Sydney. People in regional Victoria spend 30 per cent more on electricity than those in Melbourne. In regional Queensland, they spend six per cent more on electricity than those in Brisbane. This is the point that Senator Boswell made today about the cost on regional Australia.


We cannot have a Senate inquiry into this legislation. The house of review in our federal parliament cannot have an inquiry into the carbon tax. The government just shuts down the Senate and does not let it do its job. But in the recent inquiry by the Joint Select Committee on Australia's Clean Energy Future Legislation—it was an inquiry of just a few-weeks; it had to be guillotined and then shut down—the Nationals member for Dawson, Mr Christensen, quoted the following statement from Mr Garnaut's report:


From the commencement of an emissions trading scheme costs of agriculture inputs—electricity, liquid fuel and fertiliser—will rise. This will particularly affect parts of the sector where energy costs and energy-dependent costs are a large proportion of total costs.


These are the words of Professor Garnaut. When questioned about that quote Professor Garnaut said:


Yes, that is quite true and not at all inconsistent with what I have said before.


Mr Christensen, the member for Dawson, again quoted from Mr Garnaut's report, which said:


... imposing a carbon price in Australia ahead of similar carbon constraints in our trade competitors ... could result in some movement of emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries from Australia to other countries that impose less of a carbon constraint.


That is what Professor Garnaut says. This is the point—what is going to happen to regional Australia?


We know about the deal done with the Greens. But the Independents—Tony Windsor, the member for New England, and Rob Oakeshott, the member for Lyne—said the deal for putting this government in place was all about protecting regional Australia. It is not uncommon for Mr Windsor to do surveys in his electorate. He did a recent survey on taxation reform, euthanasia and same-sex marriage. He got 1,600 responses to the survey from right throughout his electorate. Recently I sent out 57,000 survey forms on the carbon tax in the seat of New England, where there are about 93,000 voters. I did not get 1,600 back—more than 5,000 were returned. Nine per cent of the forms were returned to my office. Those 9 per cent indicated that 89 per cent of the people in New England opposed the proposed carbon tax put together by Mr Windsor. He was the one who said proudly that one of the aspects of the deal to put Ms Gillard into the Lodge and Labor and the Greens alliance into government was the formation of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee, driven by Mr Windsor. 


In the last parliament Mr Windsor put up a private members bill for a massive 30 per cent reduction in emissions by 2020 based on 1990 levels, and by 2050 a massive 80 per cent. On ABC radio prior to the 21 August election last year, Kelly Fuller asked Mr Windsor why he put those bills in and he said they were not his bills; he was just putting them in on behalf of some of his constituents, representing his constituents. He ran adverts saying he was the people's representative, but he will not survey the people of New England on his proposed carbon tax that he has worked on putting together with the committee.


I sent 62,000 survey forms out into the seat of Lyne, held by Independent Rob Oakeshott, and 3,740 households want Rob Oakeshott to vote against the carbon tax and just 542 want him to vote for it. On that basis, 87 per cent of the people in Lyne do not want this carbon tax to proceed. These are the two Independents that keep the government in government. Are they the people's representatives? Not only were those forms returned, but there were many comments. There was a comment from Glen Innes saying:


... disgusting the way Labor twists their failures and blames others, Tony Windsor betrayed us. Labor do not care for the people—they are self driven.


One person in Inverell said they:


... will not vote for an Independent again State or Federal.


From Tamworth, where we had the biggest opposition to the carbon tax, 1,278 households opposed the carbon tax and just 217 supported it. Tamworth people said:


Windsor sold us out. We cannot get any poorer. What is next—will Gillard send us out in boats and get more in?


They are some of the many comments written on the survey forms. So what do we have? We have a carbon tax proposal for regional Australia. As I said, we already pay the extra electricity costs. We have the extra cost of many goods because of the freight component, and that is going to go up. There is even a tax on domestic airlines. What about crop dusters and other agricultural planes? They have been classified as domestic airlines. Crop dusters in Armadale will be paying an extra $40,000 a year on their fuel costs alone—to do what?


Last year China increased their consumption of coal by 434 million tonnes. Australia's total production of coal last year was 420 million tonnes. We are one of the few countries that actually burnt less than we did the year before—3.6 per cent less. China is now producing 51 per cent of the world's coal and they consumed, last year, 3,200 million tonnes of coal. As I said, their consumption increased by more in one year than the whole of Australia's output of coal—and we are going to save the planet! According to Treasury figures, this year China will produce 10.3 billion tonnes of CO2. That will go up to 17.9 billion tonnes by 2020—a 7,600 million tonne increase in CO2by 2020. Australia's production is going to go up 43 million tonnes—and we are going to change the planet. After this tax there will be no more droughts in regional Australia, no more floods, and cyclones will disappear. 


This is outrageous. The cost is greatest on regional Australia. As I said, people in the Labor Party, supported by the Transport Workers Union, should hang their heads in shame—a $510 million tax a year on the truckies when they have already introduced their Euro 5 motors, which are far cleaner than the older style motors, with far less pollution, though they do use 10 per cent more fuel. Hence the truckies have already paid their tax by cleaning up their motors. Tony Sheldon from the Transport Workers Union told the Senate inquiry, chaired by my colleague Senator Cormann, that this is a death tax on truckies. I think the words he used were that we were sweating the drivers longer and sweating the trucks longer, putting drivers' lives at risk. That is what the Transport Workers Union says. I wonder whether those on the other side, who are supported by the Transport Workers Union, will heed the warning of Mr Sheldon. This is a cost on regional Australia when we need the truckies to take our exports to the waterfront, when we need so much brought into our regions where we do not have rail networks. If only we had spent what we spent on school buildings on the rail network, or if the pink batts money had been spent on our rail network or our ports, then we would really have been making progress.


Today at question time I asked about the effect of the carbon tax on abattoirs. There will be a $1.74 million cost to the Bindaree Beef abattoir, in Inverell, in the first year. That cost will not be inflicted on abattoirs in America or Brazil, who we compete against—especially America. We are battling to keep our markets in Japan and Korea et cetera, but the Americans will not face that cost. They will simply be emitting more. That is why this is so wrong. It is a cost to the very sector that provides our nation's wealth. We have heard from the Australian coal industry what effect it will have on them. As I said, last year China increased its consumption of coal in one year by more than the whole of Australia's production of coal—but somehow we are going to change the planet, change the atmosphere, lower the temperatures and the lower the sea levels. It is a farce.

",Senate,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Carbon Pricing</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,19,1,speech
"Thistlethwaite, Sen Matt",ALP,2011-10-11,"



Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (16:44):  This matter of public importance on carbon pricing before the Senate this afternoon is a clear demonstration of just how out of touch those opposite are when it comes to protecting the environment and the welfare and living standards of Australians living in rural and regional communities. If there is one group within those communities which stands to lose the most from inaction on climate change it is people in rural and regional economies. That is why this government is taking action on climate change. That is why we are acting to protect the long-term sustainability of our climate, regions and communities.


We believe that climate change is real. We believe that human induced activities are causing the warming of our planet. We heed the expert advice of scientists who, throughout the world and in Australia, have overwhelmingly said that the warming of the planet will see a greater incidence of floods, of extreme drought conditions, of coastal erosion and of extreme weather events. The nature of our climate and habitat and of our country and its position in the world mean that these risks associated with climate change will have a proportionately larger effect on many rural and regional commu­nities and industries, in particular Australia's agriculture and aquaculture industries.


This is a point that was very well made by a farmer who attended a forum put on by the member for Calare, John Cobb, in Bathurst on 29 August. I attended that forum as the duty senator for the seat of Calare. Unfortunately, the organisers of that forum did not allow me to speak. They did not want to hear what the government was doing to take action on climate change. But I was surprised when a farmer—quite a brave farmer—stood up in that forum and said that he believed that climate change was real. This person was a farmer who grew grapes for the wine industry in the local community, and he believed in climate change because he was beginning to see the effects on his crop. He was seeing changes in weather patterns. He was seeing a greater incidence of extreme weather events, including hail, and the potential damage that these would have on his crop. He was seeing pests appearing at times of the year that they were not supposed to appear. Most importantly, he said that he was investing in China. He had been to China and visited a number of regions there because of investment opportunities, and he was blown away by the fact that the Chinese government was taking action on climate change, that the Chinese economy is the biggest producer of wind turbines and of solar energy in the world and that the Chinese government has a five-year plan to transition to an emissions trading scheme. His message to those people at the forum was: we need to get on board. We, as a community, a government and a nation, need to take action on climate change, and the longer we wait the greater the cost will be for our communities—particularly for those who live in rural and regional areas.


The Garnaut climate change review highlighted some of the potential effects of climate change on rural and regional communities. It highlighted that changes in climate will produce extreme changes in temperature, rainfall and extreme weather events that will affect water availability and change water and soil quality. It will pose increasing fire risks for rural and regional communities. It will see an increasing incidence of pests affecting crops and an increasing incidence of noxious weeds and disease. Those who work and live in our regions and those who work the land understand the effects of climate change and the potential risks that it poses for their livelihoods and for their communities. Most importantly, they also understand the potential damage that is done by us not acting and the potential increase in costs that they will bear if we delay in taking action. They are the most vulnerable. They are the people at the front line, who will potentially be affected the most by climate change if we do not act.


The Garnaut climate change review found that irrigated agricultural production in the Murray-Darling Basin could decline by 92 per cent by 2100 if we do not take action to reduce carbon emissions. It also highlighted increases in sea temperatures and the effects that this will have on aquaculture. Again, those who are working on the front line understand the importance of taking action.


I want to draw the Senate's attention to a report by Surf Life Saving Australia. The erosion of our coastline is a potentially damaging effect of rising sea levels, and Surf Life Saving Australia has commissioned a study to develop a climate change adaptation road map that will assist in the management of projected climate change impacts. These are the people on the front line, protecting our communities in surf life saving week in and week out. This study has shown that of the 128 surf clubs in New South Wales 47 per cent are located in coastal zones classified as zones of potential instability. Many of these are in rural and regional communities. Here we have a well-respected community organisation understanding that we need to take action on climate change and supporting what the government is doing.


The government also understands that there will be impacts associated with the transition to a clean energy future, and that is why we are working with rural and regional communities to make sure that transition is a smooth one and that we protect the livelihoods and incomes of people who work our land. That is why the government has excluded agricultural land sectors from the carbon price. However, there will be opportunities for those in these land sectors to secure economic rewards under the Carbon Farming Initiative. If farmers do take voluntary action under the Carbon Farming Initiative then there will be opportunities in terms of the way that scheme works. I attended a carbon farmers conference in Dubbo on 29 September. I was pleasantly surprised by the submissions that were made to that conference. That conference drew together carbon farmers not only from throughout Australia but from throughout the world. Many of them understand the opportunities that the Carbon Farming Initiative and the government's Clean Energy Future package will pose for those who work, day in, day out, on our land. I was really heartened by the fact that many at that conference expressed the view to me and to those present that Australia leads the world when it comes to carbon farming initiatives and new carbon farming techniques. Many of those farmers presented to the conference on some of the initiatives that they were taking on their land, particularly their non-arable land, their hilly country, and the plantings that they were using as carbon sinks and the opportunities that will come from the Carbon Farming Initiative once it is up and running. So there is widespread support for the scheme amongst the farming community. I was pleasantly surprised and heartened by the representations from those carbon farmers at that conference in Dubbo in late September.


Senator Boswell has raised the issue of modelling. I find this surprising, given the Liberal Party's performance when it comes to modelling on the carbon tax. I draw the Senate's attention to the modelling that was undertaken by the New South Wales government on the potential effects of carbon pricing on regions. They found through their modelling that there would be effects on employment in the Hunter Valley and the Illawarra. That is disputed and I will not go into that. But what they did not disclose to people was the fact that the modelling also showed that in other regions, including northern New South Wales, the mid-north coast and the south-east coast, there would be more job opportunities associated with the carbon pricing legislation—a clear demonstration of this misleading campaign that those opposite are running to try to hoodwink the public when it comes to this very important environmental issue.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2011-10-11,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (16:54):  What we are seeing this afternoon from the Labor Party—and it was quite a tragic performance from the last speaker, I have to say—is regional Australia being represented by speakers from the Labor heartland on this matter of public importance debate on the impact on regional Australia of Labor's carbon tax. They have sent in speakers in from Labor's heartland, senators who have their offices in Sydney, in Springwood, in the CBD of Sydney and in North Melbourne—the heartland of regional Australia! The old adage comes straight to the fore: do not listen to what the government say; look at what they do. The description of the Carbon Farming Initiative that was given by Senator Thistlethwaite a moment ago just staggers me. He was obviously sent in here to do a job. I understand that. That is the role that the government senators have been given—they are sent in to defend the government's position. But at least have some understanding of what you are talking about.


I spent two days at the Burnie Show just a week ago talking to farmers. They were lining up to talk to me as we were setting our stand up, telling us what the impact was going to be on them and their farms, particularly the dairy farms. They know that the government's carbon tax is going to cost them on average $10,000 per dairy farm in direct costs and another $10,000 in costs back from the processor. The processing sector for food in this country—Australia's largest manufacturing sector—is severely hit by the carbon tax, and they know that the costs will be passed back to them, because that is what happens. So they are not fooled by all this rhetoric that is run out by the Labor Party in relation to the carbon tax.


Senator Williams talked about polling that he conducted in a couple of seats in New South Wales. There was some polling released in Tasmania on the Friday before last—in Burnie, just outside the show. That showed that 62 per cent of Tasmanians polled were either opposed to or unsure about the carbon tax—51 per cent of them directly opposed it and 11 per cent were unsure about it. The best that the government could do was 17 per cent—




Senator Carol Brown:
  Whose survey was that?




Senator COLBECK:
  It was done by EMRS actually, an independent poll. Only 17 per cent strongly supported the carbon tax. They cannot even do half the percentage of those that oppose it in Tasmania. That is also showing through in the more general polling about the government. In fact, there are predictions in Tasmania that the Labor Party will be third in the next poll, behind the Greens. You might be interested in that, Mr Acting Deputy President Ludlam. I know you cannot comment from the chair, but it might bring a smile to your face that the Labor Party could even be the third party in Tasmania at the next poll that comes along.



Senator Marshall interjecting—




Senator COLBECK:
  Another one of the city-centric senators has come in to talk about regional Australia. Welcome, Senator Marshall. It is good to see you here. It really is delightful to see you here to talk about regional Australia.


I was at a growers meeting on Wednesday night last week. They actually understand the climate. They understand seasonal varia­bility. What they are concerned about is their R&D dollar—how it is apportioned, how it is spent, how the extension from that works. They are not running out telling me that they want a carbon tax. In fact, the attitude to it in the room was quite contrary to what we are being told about, particularly by Senator Thistlethwaite, who obviously has ventured outside the city on the odd occasion to talk to some constituents—which is encouraging, I have to say.


But then you look at the direct impacts. I have already mentioned the impact on the dairy industry, which is significantly impacted. The dairy industry and the beef industry, which Senator Williams has already mentioned, are the two agricultural sectors that are most severely impacted. Prime Minister Gillard—the name that the Labor Party dare not utter in the current debate—dropped into King Island a few weeks ago on the way to Tasmania to have a chat to the locals about the carbon tax and a number of other things. She tried to convince constituents that the impact would be less than one per cent. Unsurprisingly, they did not believe the Prime Minister, because they know that the cost of shipping will increase because there is no exemption for shipping fuel and that the cost of aviation will increase because there is no exemption for aviation fuel. Everything that comes in and goes out of King Island is either shipped or flown. People know that they will disproportionately be impacted in their regional community because of the impact of the carbon tax.


It would be nice if members of the government were prepared to actually address the impact on regional Australia in their contributions to this debate. But they are not. They trot out the government's 'modelling' because that is all they have. Of course, regional Australia is expected to believe that the modelling which is done on a broad base can be extrapolated back to regional Australia. Regional Australians know it cannot be. The compensation, which is based on this broad based modelling, also does not fit regional Australia.


When the Prime Minister told constituents on King Island that they would be compen­sated for this less-than-one-per-cent cost to their economy (a) they did not believe that the cost would be limited to less than one per cent and (b) they obviously did not believe that the compensation would be adequate, either, because it will not. They know that the cost of their goods that come in by either ship or air will go up by more than that number. They know that, and that is borne out by the polling that has been done in Tasmania, which has the most regionally dispersed population of any state in the country. They know that and they understand that.


ABARES held their outlook conference in Launceston last week. The farmers actually do understand the real deficiencies in things like the Carbon Farming Initiative, where you cannot even plant a windbreak, because the government says it is common practice. We are not doing the things that we ought to be encouraging.


Then you come to what is as regional as anything that you will get, and that is my portfolio area, which is forestry. The government are not doing anything in that area that might be supportive of one industry that has a really strong capacity to benefit the globe. If that is what they say they want to do in respect of carbon storage, then they are driven by green prejudice and dogma. They exclude biomass from the carbon tax. Why? I have no answer to that, except for green dogma and prejudice. If you look at biomass—and the Greens have mentioned in this place our life-cycle costings of energy generation—you will see that it has four per cent of the emissions that coal has. So reduce your emissions by 96 per cent by using biomass. What do the Labor Party do? Obviously, at the insistence of the Greens—the Green masters say 'exclude biomass'—it is out of the carbon tax. Here we have a method where you could generate 8,000 gigawatts of energy without touching another twig or tree. Yet the Greens and the Labor Party rule this out. The Labor Party say that they are looking to reduce Australia's carbon emissions but what they really do in their legislation does not actually achieve that.


The Carbon Farming Initiative does not achieve that and the farmers know it. The carbon tax is a disaster for regional Australia and the farmers know it and they tell us. The Labor Party are right: the farmers are prepared to work with seasonal variation, they are prepared to manage their country sustainably, but the Labor Party's policy platform does not allow them to do that and does not provide incentives. Why rule out the opportunity to put in a windbreak? If a farmer is not doing that and you can put those trees, that biomass, which will store carbon as it grows, back into the landscape, why deny the capacity to do that? It is just absurd.


We hear rhetoric from the Labor Party, the dogma about the science and all that sort of stuff. I am not sure they actually believe it, because their policy at the end of the day does not achieve it. It certainly disadvantages regional Australia. Their modelling does not look at regional Australia; it just lumps them in with the rest of Australia and we are expected to accept this 0.7 of a per cent. Less than one per cent is what we are told time and time again, and it just will not work for regional Australia. (Time expired)

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2011-10-11,"



Senator MARSHALL
 (Victoria) (17:05):  The difficulty in engaging in this matter of public importance debate with the opposition is that they do not actually believe in climate change at all. They do not believe that the climate is changing and they certainly do not believe that the climate is changing due to human activity. The problem they have when coming into this place is that they do not want to engage in the science and they do not want to engage in a rational debate. All their utterances are about generating fear and trying to scare the public for their own short-term political opportunity. We see this because, while those over there say they do not believe in it and they do not believe that pollution is a bad thing for the environment, they still have their own policy, which seeks to reduce carbon emissions to the same level that we seek to reduce them to.


But the fundamental difference between the way the government goes about it and the way the opposition propose to go about it is that they say: 'You're still free to pollute. Pollute as much as you like. The biggest polluters in this country are free to continue to pollute our environment as much as they like.' The opposition will take taxpayers' dollars and give those taxpayers' dollars as a gift to those companies in the hope that they may introduce some carbon abatement and may reduce their emissions. They say, 'Pollute as much as you like,' and they expect us and the taxpayers to actually give those companies who are the biggest polluters taxpayers' money to help them through the process. Our approach is the one that is supported by the market. It is the approach that John Howard supported in the previous Liberal government. It is the approach that they came to after a long, detailed and lengthy study by Peter Shergold, on behalf of John Howard, for the previous coalition government. They came to the conclusion that the way to reduce our pollution of the environment was to put a price on it. There are a number of ways in which to put a price on it and, clearly, with our legislation we are now proceeding down a path of putting a price on pollution.


What is the importance of putting a price on pollution? We know the market reacts to price signals. Every time you put a price into the market, the market that has to pay that price will seek to avoid it. How will it avoid it? It will be avoided by doing things in a more efficient manner, by investing in clean technology and in materials that cost less to heat and less to cool and by having buildings that cost less to heat and less to cool. New products will be developed in order to avoid paying that price signal, which will affect the way business conducts itself.


It is very important to keep focused in this debate. We know that the tax that will apply to pollution will apply to the 500 biggest polluters, not to anyone else. But we know that many of those companies, certainly in the first instance, will simply seek to pass on some of those costs, and it will work its way through the economy. But all the money raised through that tax still sends that price signal. It still puts a price on pollution so that people will try to avoid that process all the way through the economy, all the way through the market. Every cent raised will go into supporting households, jobs and new technologies that will help industries and our society adapt to the very important challenge ahead of us—that is, reducing pollution and the impact of human induced climate change.


I do believe in the science, and right across the world everyone else does. Australia is a little odd in the sense that we are having this debate when, really, the science has been settled for a long time. As a developed country we are in the position of knowing the effect of human induced climate change. We know what we have to do about it. We know that we can do something about it, yet those in the opposition simply seek to avoid the whole issue and use it as a political opportunity. Instead of taking the responsible path of acknowledging that the science is there, that overwhelming science is there, that we need to act and that we need to change the way in which we act in our society to reduce pollution, instead of acknowledging that we need to do something about it, they simply say: 'It's not real. It doesn't exist. Pollution is safe.' In fact, I think they have started up Friends of CO2. I think that former senator Nick Minchin and several other senators that I see on the other side—well, there are only three of them—




Senator Cash:
  The three likely culprits.




Senator MARSHALL:
  But three of the best ones, and they have probably joined the club too. Really, it is such an irrational process they have engaged in; they seek to engage in an irrational debate. But on this side of the chamber we know what we have to do and we know why we have to do it. I for one am not going to be condemned by my children and my grandchildren, and everyone else's children and grandchildren, for being part of the generation that probably consumed more of the Earth's resources than any other and that knew about the impact of climate change but refused to stand up and take responsibility for doing something about it when we could do something about it. We know, and every economist will tell you, that the earlier we act to reduce human emissions the cheaper it will be. John Howard knew it because that was the result of Peter Shergold's study. That is why the coalition had a plan which was effectively a carbon tax plan, and that is why we have one too. We know that the sooner we act the cheaper it will be for our economy.


We are not doing it for me; we are doing it for the next generation and the generations after that. We are taking responsibility for what has happened before us, but previous generations did know the impact of what we now know—that is, human induced climate change is actually happening. So we have an absolute obligation to act. We have a responsibility to future generations to act. We have an absolute responsibility to the environment to ensure that the market can help solve this problem for us. We as legislators need to do that. We need to put in place those market based signals and put a price on pollution.


That will drive many new industries. It will certainly change in many respects the way in which we work in our economy. But we will make sure that nine out of 10 households are not worse off. In fact they will be better off because we will put in place a compensation package to ensure that, whatever the impact of climate change is on them—and extensive economic modelling has been done on that—they will be compensated by the very tax that is raised from the biggest polluters. So we put the price signal on through the 500 biggest polluters, raise the money and compensate people with that money.


I have heard people say that that is just the money churn, but what they forget is how the market operates and how businesses will seek to become more cost-effective and more efficient. It will drive new technologies. It will drive R&D. People will seek to reduce their electricity bills. People will seek to reduce a whole range of polluting activities because that will now add a cost and, if they can avoid that cost, they will. If they do not try to avoid it, someone else will come along with a different style, a different technique or a different process, and they will avoid the cost and they will be cheaper. That is the way the market works. That competition will be there and it will drive innovation; it will drive a change in the way that we act in our environment. It is essential to this country that we do that not only in the cities but also in the country.


We are not the only country that is acting. Right around the world people are well ahead of us in what they are doing to fight human induced climate change and its impacts. It is happening all around the world. We really need to get over this scare campaign, this irrational position that is constantly put by the opposition. Accept the science and let us get on with our responsibility as legislators and as Australians to do this thing.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (17:50):  I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the response by the Minister for Trade that has just been tabled.


Leave granted.




Senator LUDLAM:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


This document has been provided to the President on behalf of Craig Emerson, the Minister for Trade. It relates to a motion that I put to the Senate a number of weeks ago, in July, around the ability of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi to move about Burma on one of her first field trips since being released from house arrest. Under the enormously difficult political and human rights circumstances that she and her allies face, and the people working for democracy in Burma face, conditions have barely changed since the brutal crackdown of 2008 in which thous­ands of people were arrested and killed, and many still remain behind bars. The world celebrated—as did, I think, all of us in this place—when Daw Suu was released from many, many years of house arrest in Rangoon. But we are very well aware that the situation in that country is still extraor­dinarily tense and that people who are doing the kind of work that in Australia we would simply take for granted are subject to harassment, brutal treatment, imprisonment, arbitrary detention, torture and extrajudicial killing. The establishment of a so-called parliament, which remains a parliament in name only, last year after a flawed election, based on a corrupt constitution, has changed nothing. In fact, senators in this place would be horrified if they realised how their colleagues in the so-called Burmese parliament are actually treated and if they knew the kinds of things that they are subject to, such as not being able to speak to the media and not being able to organise, as we do freely in this place. It is really difficult to even conceive of it being called a parliament.


We appreciate the tabling of this letter by Dr Emerson and also the work that Mr Rudd has done on his visit to Burma, in subsequent correspondence and in meetings that he had with Daw Suu while he was there. The advocacy that is occasionally undertaken by the Australian government on behalf of the pro-democracy movement in Burma and its diaspora is greatly appreciated.


However, the main reason why I wanted to rise and add a few comments as to the tabling of this letter today concerns a recent report by the Kachin Women's Association of Thailand which documents human rights violations carried out in Northern Burma between June and September 2011. This document is utterly hair raising, giving us a bit of an idea of, or a bit of an insight into, the internal civil war that is still occurring in the north-eastern part of Burma against the backdrop of what I think most of us believe is a gradual process of democratisation. This report tells us that we should not be fooled, that we should not ease trade sanctions and that we should not let up on our campaign, which we have been pleased to see the Australian government join, to establish a United Nations commission of inquiry to investigate crimes against humanity and war crimes that have taken place and war crimes that are taking place in Burma. This particular study highlights the issues that are occurring in a quite remote part of the country bordering Thailand and China. It is difficult to get to, and I am not sure that senators would be all that aware of the kinds of horrific abuses that are being perpetuated there. But what we are still seeing and what this report documents is the systematic use of rape as a weapon of war against women and girls, with the youngest victim documented in this study being nine years old and 15 of those victims being killed; villagers being forced to be pack animals and human minesweepers as they are forced to go in advance of the army to set off any landmines that might have been laid in the area; and unarmed civilians being killed or driven out of their villages.


I understand that people here working for Democracy in Burma have written to the foreign minister but I think it is certainly not well understood within the Australian population and perhaps not well understood within this parliament just how bad the situation is there. The reason I put these remarks on the record tonight is to reinforce the actions that the Australian government has taken but also to urge the Australian government not to relax but to press the case and not be fooled by talk of release of political prisoners, talk of democratic elections and talk of parliamentary assemblies, because all of these things are simply talk at the moment.


The international community is called on in this study:


To condemn the … regime’s atrocities against the Kachin people as well as against other ethnic nationalities and to call on the regime to put an end to such human rights violations.


To provide urgently needed humanitarian assistance to internally displaced persons and refugees fleeing the conflict—


and, as we understand that the Australian government is reviewing this issue, there is an important role here for cross-border aid. This is undertaken by many of our aid partners on the Thailand-Burma border and up and down that particular part of the world, that extremely troubled zone. Australian aid could actually fund food and medical equipment being taken across into the war zone on the Burmese side of the border where no other aid groups can go and where no help—no form of primary health care or any other assistance—can go. That is one very important thing that the Australian government could do.


The study also called on the international community:


To impose an international arms embargo to avoid supplying the Burmese regime with weaponry that can be used against civilians.


Again let us acknowledge that the Australian government got on board with this campaign, as we did sign on, but since then we have done nothing. Every three or four months I get to ask the senior bureaucrats during budget estimates hearings this: 'As we have signed on to the arms embargo and we have signed on to the commission of inquiry, what are we doing? Who have we spoken to? What diplomatic initiatives have we launched? What have we done on the margins of the General Assembly?' They always come back and say: 'Well, we've done nothing. We just signed on. We thought that was the whole point.' It is not enough to put our name on a list when these kinds of horrific human rights violations are occurring right now as I speak. We take more or less for granted the democratic freedoms that brought each of us into this place. The people working in Burma and their colleagues on all sides of that border who are working on that campaign interna­tionally do not take those things for granted.


Lastly, I turn to cracking down on trade with Burma, an area on which we have found the Australian government to be simply intractable. It is absolutely unacceptable for a company in my home town of Perth to be profiting from oil and gas deals with the regime. It is unbelievable. There is less than $50 million in two-way trade between Australia and Burma. We are not even going to be offending the kinds of interest groups that periodically terrorise Australian govern­ments when we talk about sanctions with particular regimes. This one is dead easy. Twinza Oil, operating out of an office in Nedlands in Perth, is doing deals with the Burmese regime for oil and gas extraction. That is how the regime funds the civil war that it is conducting against its own people. It is horrific to imagine that Australia could even be complicit indirectly. So I think this direct complicity would be horrifying to most right-thinking Australians. One thing that the Australian government could do right now is simply cease two-way trade between Australia and Burma, whether it be in gemstones, forestry or, indeed, oil and gas. Burma is being pillaged at the moment, and it is appalling that Australia would consider being part of that. I thank the Senate for leave to raise these important issues.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:03):  On behalf of the Community Affairs References Committee, I present the report on the effectiveness of special arrangements for the supply of Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to remote area Aboriginal health services, together with documents presented to the committee.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator SIEWERT:
  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


This is a very important report because it pertains to the health of Aboriginal communities and to helping to close the gap. Many people are probably not aware of this scheme, which comes in two parts. It has special arrangements for the supply of PBS medicines to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in remote communities. This is obviously in place to promote and improve access to and use of PBS medicines. The two main programs we looked into are the section 100 supply program, which provides payments to community pharmacies for dispensing PBS medicines in bulk to remote area Aboriginal health services, and the section 100 pharmacies support allowance, which provides payments to community pharmacists to help Aboriginal health services to improve the way that their patients use PBS medicines. 


These are very important programs, and I would particularly like to thank those who made very substantive submissions to this inquiry. In fact, they were so substantive that we did not have to hold a hearing, because such excellent information was supplied to us. I would like to thank the submitters and also the secretariat for the work they did. Many people will be aware of the workload that the Community Affairs Committee has had, both with legislation and references, this year, so I would like to thank the secretariat very much for their report.


We made a number recommendations in this report, and I hope that the government takes them on. One of the things the committee found is that other inquiries have made recommendations about these programs, but unfortunately those recomm­endations have not been implemented. I suggest that that is one of the reasons we have had to review this again and, in some cases, make some similar recommendations. We have made 10 recommendations, one of which related to the information we have showing that the effectiveness of the scheme, in terms of the amount of medication that is being supplied to remote communities, has gone up. We know the program, from that point of view, is successful in getting medicines out there. What we do not know is the clinical impact this has had. We are making an assumption that we are helping to close the gap by having this program in place, but we cannot really say that it is. So the committee made a recommendation that the government undertake an evaluation to ascertain whether the increased supply of PBS medicines provided by the program is having a clinical impact on the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in remote communities. I personally think that is a particularly important recomm­endation.


We have also made a recommendation about ensuring accurate and legible labelling on medicines. What we are finding is that some of these medicines are going out with handwritten labels, for example, and there is concern around that. So we have made a recommendation about ensuring that there is a universal system in place to provide for accurate and legible labelling and recording of medicines. The evidence given to us indicated that the Aboriginal health services needed more access to pharmacists in-house. Where we see pharmacists in-house in Aboriginal health services, we are seeing much better quality use of medicines. What we are trying to ensure here is quality use of medicines so we have good clinical outcomes. So there is a recommendation that various mechanisms be looked at in terms of enabling Aboriginal health services to have pharmacists in-house. There is also a recommendation about dose administration aids. At the moment, if they are funded under the scheme, they have to be funded out of the money for medications, and of course we want to see that money being used for medications. So we believe these aids need to be used. There was good evidence supplied to us that showed the effectiveness of using those particular aids.


There is also a recommendation around integrating some of the programs. There are a number of programs about increasing the supply of medications but also looking at the better quality use of medications. So we are recommending that there be a review, not to review the programs per se but to bring about better integration of some of those programs, because we established that there are some gaps in the supply of medica­tions—for example, to aged-care facilities. It is unclear whether these people can access medications through this particular program.


I will conclude there because I know there are other senators who want to speak on this matter. I commend these recommendations to the government. I for one can tell the government and put them on notice that I will be pursuing the implementation of these recommendations, and I am sure no-one would expect any less.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (18:09):  I also want to make some remarks on the recommendations and the process we followed in this Community Affairs References Committee inquiry. Certainly this is a much reviewed process. The remote area Aboriginal health services program, which includes the section 100 supply program and also the section 100 pharmacy support allowances, has been reviewed a number of times since it was introduced in 1999. There was a clear need identified in 1999. It was shown that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, particularly but not exclu­sively those in remote areas, were not receiv­ing the benefit of our wonderful PBS system. At the time, 1999, the Centre for Remote Health noted that a review found that only 33c were spent on the PBS for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people for each $1 spent on non-Indigenous people. This comparison made a benchmark about where we were moving in the process of allowing medication to be available for people who have great need. No-one denies the great need in remote Aboriginal and Islander communities and also in non-remote communities.


Through a number of submissions that came to the committee, we looked at the fact that since 1999 there have been extensive advances made in allowing medication to be available. The Department of Health and Ageing submission said, and I will put these figures on record, that from 1999 the remote area Aboriginal health service program:


… has grown from servicing 35 remote Aboriginal Health Services to 173 in 2011.


The supply of PBS items has increased from around 250,000 in 1999-2000 to more than 1.4 million in 2010-11.


In 2010-11, expenditure under the RAAHS Program had grown to $43 million from $3.9 million … in 1999.


Further, it is believed:


Around 170,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are estimated to benefit from the increased access to PBS medicines and better quality use of medicines …


So we do have that baseline data but, as Senator Siewert pointed out, we need to have more than just knowledge of how much medication is supplied. There is so much more that is needed. We need to look at the impact of the medication, and certainly one of the things we considered was: how do you actually see where people's chronic illness has been improved by this attention? We know it has. Intrinsically, we know that from 1999 until now, with the greater access to medication, of course people's health issues have been addressed, but we need to know that in greater detail.


We received very detailed information from people who wanted to do research in this area who said they had difficulty in getting the data. There is a good reason for that, but there is one issue that we should be able to respond to. What happens in areas of small populations is that the Privacy Act comes in and says that data cannot be released because of the possibility of individuals being able to be identified by the release of that data—a noble concern and one of which we should be aware. However, we need to be able to think and work smarter. There have got to be ways that the government and the stakeholders can work together effectively to see how we can understand on what this whole program is based—that is, clinical health improvements for people who most need it.


Certainly one of our recommendations is that we work together. It seems a sensible enough recommendation that we get together all the people who have such great goodwill in this area who are trying to ensure that people in remote areas get access to the appropriate medication and then that their health is improved. As we often say here, we need to have ways of assessing that. That was one of the things that were picked up most clearly by our report.


I note that Senator Siewert also referred to one of the more interesting recommendations I have seen from any of our committee reports, which is in fact that we should go back and check all the recommendations that have been made in this area and see what is happening to them—common sense. It happens so often that people have issues which need to be considered, they evolve, more information becomes available, needs are identified and then we go into a quite in-depth inquiry to find out that this work has been done before. Recommendations have been made but somehow the recommend­ations have been lost and we have not been able to pick up on the knowledge and the professionalism that we know is available. So I really like that recommendation. Certainly our community affairs committee has worked very hard in the past to ensure that we have this process, that we consider issues and that after a certain period of time we go back and see what has happened. This is because in areas of social welfare we consistently have incremental improvements. So rather than going back and identifying all the issues again, we see what work has been done, the kind of recommendations that have been made by various governments and various groups of public servants working in the area and what has happened. It is almost a standing recommendation so that we can understand that we are working effectively to ensure that remote health issues are moving forward in our community.


Another one—and I know Senator Siewert mentioned it—was to do with the basic things that we take for granted in our own medical processes in terms of medical aids. The pure stupidity of the process means that people cannot get the basic help they need to learn about their medication and to use it more effectively through such things as the small pill blister pack that we have available all the time and which have proved to be deeply effective. That is not actually part of the process. It is extra expenditure and, as we know, expenditure is so tight that that kind of process is not provided. Straightforward processes about things that we all know and understand can be translated effectively to make the system work better.


I also take the note about the labelling process. Having worked with pharmacies over many years, I know the need to have a standard process of labelling and clarity so that people can understand their medication is so important and is something that once again at this time we need to restate.


A lot of good work has been done. We have seen that there have been advances, but there needs to be further consideration. Basic understanding of the whole process is not wide in the community. There has got to be more education in the way that professionals can work more effectively with communities so that people, again, understand their medication and are able to get the best use out of it. It is not just about spending the dollar; it is about how the dollar is spent and how effectively the community can benefit from it.


This is a necessary report. It is one that will stimulate further discussion. I note that the government will be considering it. I share with Senator Siewert a commitment to follow up so that the recommendations are discussed openly and we see some change not just in this place but more effectively in communities.


There is also the issue that we discuss so often in this place, and which the Commun­ity Affairs References Committee will be picking up in another inquiry, of rural and remote workforces. There is a great need to have more professional work done in comm­unities and not just outside with people flying in and flying out. So I am looking forward to talking about that again in the future.


I commend the secretariat, who worked hard to prepare this particular report. We will be following up with all the people who have shown such great interest and goodwill in the process. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2011-10-11,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:03):  On behalf of the Community Affairs References Committee, I present the report on the effectiveness of special arrangements for the supply of Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to remote area Aboriginal health services, together with documents presented to the committee.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator SIEWERT:
  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


This is a very important report because it pertains to the health of Aboriginal communities and to helping to close the gap. Many people are probably not aware of this scheme, which comes in two parts. It has special arrangements for the supply of PBS medicines to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in remote communities. This is obviously in place to promote and improve access to and use of PBS medicines. The two main programs we looked into are the section 100 supply program, which provides payments to community pharmacies for dispensing PBS medicines in bulk to remote area Aboriginal health services, and the section 100 pharmacies support allowance, which provides payments to community pharmacists to help Aboriginal health services to improve the way that their patients use PBS medicines. 


These are very important programs, and I would particularly like to thank those who made very substantive submissions to this inquiry. In fact, they were so substantive that we did not have to hold a hearing, because such excellent information was supplied to us. I would like to thank the submitters and also the secretariat for the work they did. Many people will be aware of the workload that the Community Affairs Committee has had, both with legislation and references, this year, so I would like to thank the secretariat very much for their report.


We made a number recommendations in this report, and I hope that the government takes them on. One of the things the committee found is that other inquiries have made recommendations about these programs, but unfortunately those recomm­endations have not been implemented. I suggest that that is one of the reasons we have had to review this again and, in some cases, make some similar recommendations. We have made 10 recommendations, one of which related to the information we have showing that the effectiveness of the scheme, in terms of the amount of medication that is being supplied to remote communities, has gone up. We know the program, from that point of view, is successful in getting medicines out there. What we do not know is the clinical impact this has had. We are making an assumption that we are helping to close the gap by having this program in place, but we cannot really say that it is. So the committee made a recommendation that the government undertake an evaluation to ascertain whether the increased supply of PBS medicines provided by the program is having a clinical impact on the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in remote communities. I personally think that is a particularly important recomm­endation.


We have also made a recommendation about ensuring accurate and legible labelling on medicines. What we are finding is that some of these medicines are going out with handwritten labels, for example, and there is concern around that. So we have made a recommendation about ensuring that there is a universal system in place to provide for accurate and legible labelling and recording of medicines. The evidence given to us indicated that the Aboriginal health services needed more access to pharmacists in-house. Where we see pharmacists in-house in Aboriginal health services, we are seeing much better quality use of medicines. What we are trying to ensure here is quality use of medicines so we have good clinical outcomes. So there is a recommendation that various mechanisms be looked at in terms of enabling Aboriginal health services to have pharmacists in-house. There is also a recommendation about dose administration aids. At the moment, if they are funded under the scheme, they have to be funded out of the money for medications, and of course we want to see that money being used for medications. So we believe these aids need to be used. There was good evidence supplied to us that showed the effectiveness of using those particular aids.


There is also a recommendation around integrating some of the programs. There are a number of programs about increasing the supply of medications but also looking at the better quality use of medications. So we are recommending that there be a review, not to review the programs per se but to bring about better integration of some of those programs, because we established that there are some gaps in the supply of medica­tions—for example, to aged-care facilities. It is unclear whether these people can access medications through this particular program.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2011-10-11,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (18:57):  I rise tonight to speak about a man who has spent the best part of his life representing the people of Launceston and surrounding areas in my home state of Tasmania. I feel honoured to call Ray Shipp a friend and I feel it is only appropriate that I say a few words about his 27 years in public office. A local boy, he grew up in Launceston where he and his father, Bill, built their driving school. Ray worked in the driver education business in Launceston, teaching new Australians and young people of Tasmania road safety and the correct attitude and responsibilities when driving. Ray spent many of the following years giving driving tips and road safety advice on local television and radio.


Ray was a member of the Legislative Council for the seat of Launceston from 1968 to 1982. He then stood successfully for the Launceston City Council in 1985. He was re-elected at each election thereafter. Ray also held the position of Deputy Mayor from 1994 to 1999. Ray's dedication to his council responsibilities has been unwavering. I cannot overemphasise or overstate the contribution Ray has made to our community. I also need to mention his wife, Gail. I know she has been Ray's biggest supporter over the years and I would like to place on the public record my thanks—and I am sure I speak on behalf of our local community in thanking her—for her wonderful support to allow Ray to make the contribution he has over so many years.


It could be said that Ray is of the old school. He was and is a true gentleman. He has always been first and foremost a listener. Then, when he needed to make a contribution, it was always well thought out and relevant to the conversation, debate or discussion that he was participating in. His long career added to these discussions, as he has an example or story for almost every situation. His life experience enabled him to contribute and participate in the Launceston community with knowledge and experience like no other. He would often tell stories of his days teaching young people how to drive. He has seen many changes in legislation, both in local government and in his years as a legislative councillor. His council committee involvements include the Strategic Planning and Policy Committee, the Tender Review Committee, the Code of Conduct Panel and the Launceston Access Advisory Committee. Ray was also chairman of the York Park committee at the time of the sporting precinct's first major development in the late 1990s. He also played an important role on a Legislative Council select committee to investigate all aspects of the Tamar River, which is a local icon in the city of Launceston.


Martin Gilmour, the Editor of our local newspaper the Examiner, said recently:


The decision by Alderman Ray Shipp not to recontest his seat on the Launceston City Council marks the end of an era.


To spend more than 20 years on the council, in addition to 14 years as an MLC for Launceston, is an extraordinary commitment to civic duty by any measure.


Many people regard Alderman Shipp as the council's unofficial historian and there is no doubt that this corporate knowledge has served the city well.


I could not agree more with these comments.


True to form, Ray's decision not to contest the next election was not based on any selfish motives, nor is he in ill health. Ray has decided to make way for someone new because he has, and always has had, the best interests of the people of Launceston at heart. Ray said it had occurred to him that if he was successful this election, the next time he was faced with the decision to stand or not, he would be almost 90 years of age. He said:


I thought it was probably time to make way for another person from Launceston who may have their eyes on a council career.


I truly believe that the elder individuals in our society, such as Ray, still have so much to offer the community. Their presence in the workforce is highly valued. Ray sets an example of how older Australians can continue to contribute to their communities well into their 70s and 80s. It is a well-known fact that we are now living about 25 years longer. The community benefits from retaining the older and more experienced individuals in the workforce but I also believe these individuals gain a great deal of purpose and satisfaction from contributing to society in an active way. It is no longer necessary to retire at 65 and wonder what to do for the next 20 years of life. Like Ray, we can continue to take an interest in our community and contribute for many years.


You may be wondering why I have chosen to stand here tonight and speak about a local council alderman. I believe Ray Shipp is a shining example to all of us. Ray is a man who has devoted his life to the betterment of his city and surrounding area. He has given his time to the community and he has been a voice on important issues for the people of Launceston. In my opinion, Ray is a man who reminds us all that we are here for a very important purpose. We are all representatives. We are here to be the voice for the voiceless, to stand up for the marginalised and to always ensure that the best outcomes are achieved for our country and communities.


As I said, Ray has made an outstanding contribution to our local community. He was never politically aligned during his time as a legislative councillor. He was an Independent—a true independent. In later years he joined the Australian Labor Party but when he was first elected to the Launceston City Council, once again he stood as an Independent. For me, it has been an honour to know Ray, particularly so over the last decade on a more personal basis. He has always been a good supporter, someone who is prepared to talk quite frankly to you, to put his point of view. But always at the forefront of his mind and his argument was what was best for our community.


Those genuine gentlemen are not always as obvious in our community as I think they ought to be. He was renowned, as I said, for speaking up for our community, for being there, for being a very good listener, being able to contribute to the debate but to bring a common sense point of view to whatever debate he was participating in. I wish Ray every best wish for his retirement from the Launceston City Council. He may believe that he is 'retiring' and is not going to have a public life in future but I think he will find it very hard to totally retire. He has certainly earned his stripes and the community's respect. I hope he has many more years ahead to enjoy his children and grandchildren and takes the opportunity to spend time with Gale and to reward her with his presence and his undivided attention as he has been able to have her support in enabling him to make a contribution to public life.


One of my colleagues said, 'Has something happened to Ray?' I said, 'No, I am making a contribution and acknowledg­ing his contribution to our community. I can assure you he is in very good health.' Health is not a reason for him to consider retirement. He is one of those people who has come to the realisation that it is time to let someone else share some of the burden, some of the responsibility and leadership of our community. I acknowledge a job very well done and thank him for his contribution to our community. I also note his contribution in more recent years to the Australian Labor Party and its Tasmanian branch and, on a personal note, thank him for his guidance, his always very frank advice and his encouragement.
