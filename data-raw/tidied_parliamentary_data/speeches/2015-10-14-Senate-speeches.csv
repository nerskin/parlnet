Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (09:31):  I rise to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Debit Card Trial) Bill 2015. The bill seeks to amend the social security law to enable a trial phase of new cashless welfare arrangements in response to the 'healthy welfare card' recommendation from Mr Andrew Forrest's review of Indigenous jobs and training.


The trial is proposed to be conducted in three locations, involving up to 10,000 people. Locations will be selected on the basis of high levels of welfare dependence; where gambling, alcohol and/or drug abuse are causing unacceptable levels of harm within the community; and where there is a level of community support. The participants in this trial are people who reside in the trial locations and who are on working age payments, including Newstart, disability support and carer payments. Age pensioners and wage earners can volunteer.


In rising to speak on this bill I acknowledge the significant harm caused by alcohol abuse and the related violence. The Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill heard from residents about the devastating impacts that alcohol abuse and violence have in communities across Australia, in particular the committee heard about the destructive impact they have on Ceduna, the first trial site for this initiative, and the surrounding communities.


I had the pleasure yesterday of having a delegation from Ceduna come and meet with me to talk about this piece of legislation. Labor understands the need to take action to address these problems. However, in seeking to do so, this debit card legislation should not be rushed or avoid proper scrutiny. Indeed, the Labor senators' report from the Community Affairs Legislation Committee goes to this very point. The proposed trial will have significant implications for the lives of those living in the trial sites and, if it is planned and implemented well, these implications will be positive. However, if the proposed trial is rushed and implemented without the appropriate supports, the trial will not only likely fail but will also have a negative impact on people's lives. Unfortunately, this is what Mr Tudge has sought to do. The bill was introduced without important details being worked out, and we heard that concern in some of the contributions to this bill by other senators yesterday. This concern was evident throughout the Senate committee inquiry process, with the department being unable to explain crucial details about the trial, particularly the supports that would accompany this.


Rushing proper consideration of this legislation and its impacts is nothing more than irresponsible and could potentially undermine the very outcomes that the trail seeks to achieve. I acknowledge that Mr Tudge has provided further detail about the trial in a letter to our shadow ministers, Jenny Macklin and Shane Neumann. However, significant issues remain unresolved. In fact, this additional information was provided by Mr Tudge only on Sunday afternoon and only after the shadow ministers wrote to him expressing Labor's concerns. Mr Tudge used his response as an opportunity to attack Labor and question our commitment to supporting community leaders to respond to the harm caused by alcohol in their communities. Mr Tudge must realise that this is not about playing politics, it is not about scoring cheap shots; this is about making long-term change. This type of long-term change will be possible only if this trial is implemented properly, and this can happen only through proper consideration of the debit card trial legislation and its implications.


Labor will not be badgered into rushing its consideration of the legislation. Labor wants to ensure that the debit card trial achieves the best outcomes for participating communities, and this will happen only if we properly consider the proposal. The proposal in the bill stems from the healthy welfare card recommendation from Mr Andrew Forrest's review of Indigenous jobs and training. The trial, which has been designed in response to the report's recommendations and would be established through this bill, intends to test whether significantly reducing access to cash can reduce the habitual abuse and associated harm from alcohol, gambling and illegal drugs. Under the trial, access to cash for income support recipients would be limited by placing a significant proportion of a person's welfare payments into a restricted bank account. The bill will also enable a community body to be involved in determining welfare arrangements within a trial location. We note that the bill does not include where these locations will be and that, instead, these trial areas will be specified later through legislative instrument. We do know, however, that the bill allows the trial to be conducted in up to three locations for up to 10,000 people.


As my colleagues have mentioned, a memorandum of understanding has already been signed for Ceduna and the surrounding area to be the first trial location. The trial sites are to be determined on the basis of need—selected on the basis of high levels of welfare dependence, where gambling, alcohol and drug abuse are causing unacceptable levels of harm within the community. The bill establishes that in these locations 80 per cent of regular payments and 100 per cent of lump sum payments received by people on a working-age income support payment will be placed in a restricted bank account. The remaining 20 per cent of payments will be put in the bank account of the recipient's choice. This money will be available for use at the individual's discretion. Trial participants will include people in receipt of Newstart allowance, parenting payment, disability support pension and carer payment. Age pension recipients will not be part of the trial automatically, but they could volunteer to be included. A trial participant will not be able to use the debit card linked to the restricted account to access cash or purchase gambling products and services, alcohol or illegal drugs.


I think it is important to note that the new debit card arrangements are very different from the income management program. Unlike with income management, participants on the new debit card will receive no assistance from Centrelink workers with budgeting and to make sure that the income support payments are directed to life's essentials, like rent, food and items of clothing. The new debit card will ensure only that the majority of income support payments cannot be spent on alcohol or gambling products. For this reason it is critical that the trial include the appropriate support services to ensure that the proposal can support people to tackle the very complex and often intergenerational problems that confront these communities.


The need for a comprehensive package of support to accompany the debit card was raised in a number of the submissions to the Senate inquiry. The submission from Empowering Communities put it clearly when they stated:


The card alone will not solve the underlying factors which lead to drug, alcohol and gambling abuse, or the harm they cause.


The submissions highlighted that supports and services had to be part of any effort to meaningfully respond to the harm caused by alcohol abuse. In their submission to the Senate committee inquiry, Yalata Community Incorporation states:


It is the strong view of Yalata and other Aboriginal leaders that the cashless debit card by itself will not address the problems caused by alcohol. The success of the trial will be determined by the other support measures that are implemented at the same time.


If these accompanying supports and services are not provided, this trial is surely bound to fail and to merely act to penalise income support recipients in trial sites. As such, this new card should not be seen as a solution for all the problems in these communities.


Labor is unwavering in its commitment to helping communities tackle alcohol and drug abuse and the harm it causes. Labor is firm in our commitment to protecting individuals, particularly women and children and those who are most vulnerable within our community, from these harms. Frankly, it is appalling that Mr Tudge has sought to colour Labor's insistence on appropriate oversight and consideration of the trial as anything but a commitment to making certain that the proposed debit card trial will help these communities and protect vulnerable people.


Labor wants to ensure that the trial is sufficiently comprehensive to drive the long-term positive change needed for all communities that may be impacted. Labor knows that alcohol abuse and the harm it causes is having a devastating impact on the lives of people in some communities. However, Labor is concerned that the proposed debit card trial and related bill is not sufficiently comprehensive to meet its stated aims—to tackle alcohol, drug and gambling abuse and the harm it causes to particular communities. We are also concerned that insufficient evidence was provided about how the bill will operate and note that many of the details are yet to be worked through.


As I previously indicated, during the Senate committee inquiry we heard that there was a level of confusion about what had been agreed for the proposed trial. I share the concerns expressed during the inquiry that the consultations on the trial have been unsatisfactory to date. This does not undermine Labor's commitment to addressing alcohol abuse and harm. It does not undermine Labor's understanding of the desperate need for action to support long-term change. I completely reject Mr Tudge's characterisation that Labor is turning its back on what community leaders are saying or that we are placing the trial at risk by asking additional questions about the trial. This is scaremongering and avoidance of fulsome scrutiny of the legislation.


Rather, it is Labor's commitment to addressing these issues and our understanding that action is needed that drive our consideration of this bill. Labor is committed to supporting community leaders in responding to the harm caused in their communities through fulsome consideration of the legislation and its implications. We believe that this will ultimately support a better long-term outcome for people living in the proposed trial communities. As I have already stated, Labor is working hard to make sure that the trial is robust and will support its stated aims: tackling alcohol abuse and the harm it causes. That is why we are working hard to make sure that additional supports will be in place for participating communities, like drug and alcohol services, family violence services and financial management programs. I welcome the commitment of these supports to Ceduna, but this trial will impact on other locations and it will be critical that they receive similar adequate supports and services.


Another important element of the proposal, that Labor supports in principle, is the community panel model. However, it was clear from the evidence to the Senate committee inquiry that there is a lack of shared understanding about how a community panel could operate and when it might commence. This is largely due to the fact that there has been insufficient information from the government about the role and responsibilities of such a panel. The lack of detail and public information about exactly how the trial would operate was a consistent theme throughout the submissions to the Senate inquiry. Submissions from organisations such as Financial Counselling Australia, Consumer Action Law Centre and the National Welfare Rights Network highlighted a number of details and issues that they believed had not been worked out or made public.


These submissions raised concerns that many of the details about how the debit card will operate are yet to be finalised or sufficiently worked through, including how funds were to be managed, by which financial institution, privacy considerations and compliance monitoring. Submissions also raised concerns with the fact that the debit card trial would apply to all people on a working-age payment, with no mechanism for people to come off the debit card.


Many people in receipt of income support payments are responsibly managing their payments and in the interests of their family and children. These people may not individually benefit from the debit card. For this reason Labor would support further consideration as to whether people should be able to come off the debit card if they meet certain criteria. A mechanism like this would also act to encourage positive change for people who may be on the debit card. And while I welcome Mr Tudge's belated efforts to provide some of the details about the trial, it is simply unacceptable that the government thinks that the Senate should pass this legislation without having properly considered the detail and implications of the proposal.


Another significant issue which Labor is seeking assurances from the government on is the trial evaluation. Ahead of the commencement of the trial it is vital that a robust evaluation framework is in place. Without this type of evaluation any trial is pointless and we will not develop the evidence on the impacts. This is precisely the reason for having a trial.


Labor will continue to hold the government to account and to make sure that any outstanding details are worked through and agreed prior to a trial commencing. Once the government has provided the additional information sought we will be prepared to vote on the bill.


The trial of the proposed debit card is a significant measure that has implications for communities across Australia, beyond those where the trial will proceed. Labor acknowledges that it could have benefits for communities affected by alcohol abuse. It is important that the legislation is developed robustly and not be rushed. Labor, in government, followed a far more comprehensive and detailed process in developing substantive welfare reform measures of this type. Labor hopes the government will work hard in the coming months to rectify the shortcomings so that we can reach agreement on this bill.


We look forward to the government providing a full and detailed response on the outstanding issues that will then enable an informed debate on the bill. Again I note that the concern about the lack of detail that has been expressed by other senators in their contributions is, I believe, widespread in groups that are interested in this trial. I recommend that the government take up the Labor senators' recommendation in terms of the Senate community affairs inquiry into this bill, which asked that the bill not be progressed until there are sufficient consultations carried out in all the possible trial communities and a consultation report with proposed trial communities is made public.


There are a number of other points that the Labor senators on the committee made in their recommendation 2 on this bill. We again ask the government to make public the details of consultations, exactly how the debit card will work and the operations of the bill—including possible community involvement; income quarantining decision making; how people will transition from income management; agreement on the financial institutions; and, as I and other contributors to this debate have already mentioned, privacy considerations. Of course, very importantly, the compliance monitoring is to be made public.


I think it is quite clear from the contributions to this debate—not just from Labor senators but from other senators—that there are a number of concerns that a lot of details on how the debit card will work in the trial areas are not in this bill. A lot of questions have been asked that are currently unanswered, and the government needs to provide those answers to enable a robust and fully-informed debate to take place.

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2015-10-14,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (09:51):  This is a very important piece of legislation and I know that is appreciated by all colleagues in this place. I thank them for their contributions not only to this debate but also to the Senate committee process that has looked at the legislation. I particularly acknowledge at the outset the incredible work of Mr Alan Tudge, the Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister and also Assistant Minister for Social Services, for whom this has been an area of great interest not just professionally in his ministerial capacity but also in his previous role as deputy director of the Cape York institute as Noel Pearson's deputy. 


This bill when enacted will enable a trial phase of new cashless welfare arrangements and a cashless debit card. The main objective of the trial is to test whether restricting discretionary cash can reduce the overall social harm which is caused by welfare-fuelled alcohol, gambling and drug abuse, particularly against women and children. This is an important social reform and, importantly, it is one that the community is calling for. Excessive alcohol consumption, drug use and gambling are—as you know, Mr President, from your previous incarnation as a senior police officer—harmful and costly to the broader community and are a cause of health problems, high crime rates, domestic and community violence, family breakdown and social dysfunction. Alcohol-related harm results in 3,000 deaths and 65,000 hospitalisations every year in Australia. The total cost of alcohol-related problems in the nation is estimated to be between $15 billion and $31 billion per year. Problem gambling is associated with a range of health, social and economic problems. Problem gambling costs the Australian community an estimated $4.7 billion per year, and individuals with gambling problems lose, on average, $21,000 per year—a third of the average Australian salary. These are significant social issues. 


The trial will be conducted in up to three locations and will be limited to 10,000 people. Trial locations will be selected on the basis of high levels of welfare dependence and where gambling, alcohol and illegal drug abuse are causing unacceptable levels of harm. Community interest and willingness to participate will also be a factor.


We have undertaken an extensive community consultation process. Consultations to date have included community leaders, proposed trial participants, state and local governments, industry, merchants and welfare groups. These genuine community consultations are enabling a better understanding of local needs and help to gauge the interest in a trial in several communities. The consultation process has provided government with valuable feedback and insight into the issues these communities face.


Ceduna in South Australia will be the first site under the trial to commence. Ceduna signed an MOU with the government on 4 August to participate in the trial, and the leadership in the community have publicly called for this trial and see it as a mechanism to address some of the welfare-fuelled alcohol and drug abuse that is devastating the community.


In Ceduna the statistics are pretty stark. In 2013-14, presentations to the hospital emergency department due to alcohol or drug use exceeded 500—that is more than one per day. The local sobering-up facility had a staggering 4,667 admissions that same year from a regional population of 4,425. The Ceduna community heads group, a key leadership group in the community, had endorsed the reform and said:


We want to build a future for our younger generation to aspire to and believe we cannot do this if our families are caught up in the destructive cycle of alcohol or drugs that destroys our culture, our lands and our communities.


…   …   …


At the heart of this reform, is a change that is being shaped specifically to meet our local needs.  It has been a true collaboration to ensure that we can give our mob and our Communities every chance to create real and genuine change in their lives.


…   …   …


We have grasped this initiative; we have helped shape this initiative; and we are confident that this initiative is for the betterment of all people within our region.


We are also in advanced discussions with the leaders in the East Kimberley region. Key leaders in the region, led by Ian Trust of the Wunan Foundation, Ted Hall Junior of the MG Corporation and Desmond Hill of the Gelganyem Trust see the trial as a worthy idea to address many social issues facing their communities. The three leaders wrote to the government saying: 'We acknowledge that agreeing to the East Kimberley being a trial site for the restricted debit card may seem to some a rather drastic step. However, it is our view that continuing to deliver the same programs we have delivered for the past 40 years will do nothing for our people and, besides wasting more time and money, will condemn our children and future generations to a life of poverty and despair. As leaders in the East Kimberley, we cannot accept this.' The leaders also urged federal members of parliament from all sides to: 'Listen to us on this matter and take a non-partisan position in order to allow this trial to proceed. We believe that this trial could be the catalyst for breaking the cycle of poverty and despair in the East Kimberley.'


When local leaders stand up and call for reform, parliamentarians should listen and respond, and that is what we are seeking to do here. The community harm statistics from the East Kimberley are also shocking. In a place such as Kununurra, the hospitalisation rate from assaults is 68 times the national average.


To effectively test whether a reduction in cash leads to a reduction in harm, 80 per cent of payments received by all people in the community receiving a working-age welfare payment such as Newstart allowance will be placed on the cashless debit card. The trial aims to support income-support recipients and is not Indigenous-specific. People who receive the age pension and veterans pension will not automatically be placed on the trial; however, they will be able to volunteer to participate in the trial if they wish.


Recognising that we do not live in a cashless society and that people need cash for minor expenses such as children's lunch money or bus fares, the remaining 20 per cent of the payments will be available for use at the person's discretion. The figure of 20 per cent cash was decided through consultation with communities.


The cashless debit card will work as similarly as possible to any other bank card. The card will work at all shops except those selling alcohol and gambling products. The only difference between this card and any other bank product is that it will not support cash withdrawals or allow the purchase of those products contributing to community harm. Restrictions on the withdrawal of cash will also help combat expenditure of welfare dollars on illicit drugs like ice which we know are devastating many communities across the nation. Participants in the trial will automatically receive an everyday mainstream debit card. Participants will have access to online banking, a mobile app and a customer call centre; this will give participants easy access to their bank balance and transaction histories and a simple way to report lost or stolen cards.


Participants will also have the option of receiving SMS alerts or mobile phone push alerts. These alerts will notify participants when money is received in their account, provide an updated balance after purchases over a particular amount and warn participants when their bank balance is getting low. All of these services will be available at no cost to the participants.


Community education workshops will be held before the trial commences in each location. At these workshops participants will be provided with information on how the card will work and how to use online services. These workshops will ensure participants are supported during transition to the trial. Because the card will work everywhere except at shops selling alcohol or gambling products, most merchants will not have to do anything to accept the new card. Retail staff will not require any additional training, and there will be no extra paperwork. If there is a business that sells alcohol or gambling products as well as other goods, they may still be able to enter into a contract to accept the card. This will involve agreeing to ensure their customers cannot use the card to buy these products. If a business only sells alcohol or gambling goods and services such as poker machines, sports wagering, keno and casino games, they will not be able to take part in the trial.


Government and the cashless card provider will work closely with merchants prior to and during trial implementation to ensure a smooth transition to the trials for merchants. The bill also empowers the minister to authorise community bodies in trial locations. An authorised community body will be able to reduce the percentage of a person's welfare payment that is placed on the cashless debit card. This recognises that the community has an important role to play in the trial and in encouraging socially responsible behaviour. It also supports community autonomy and reinforces that the trial is being community led.


An evaluation of the trial will be undertaken. The evaluation will contribute to a robust knowledge base and will explore the impact on levels of community harm following implementation of the trial. The evaluation will also canvas the opinions of trial participants, service providers and individuals in the community in order to develop our understanding of the influence of the trial on broader community functioning. Findings from the trial will make a vital contribution to future options for reducing community harm and dysfunction exacerbated by welfare fuelled alcohol and drug abuse at both individual and community levels.


The income management program and the BasicsCard in place across a range of locations throughout the nation is another valuable tool which helps to support individuals and families. It will continue for an additional two years, maintaining support for vulnerable people. Income management and the trial, however, will not be run in the same locations in Ceduna and any other trial site that is an existing income management location. Income management will be switched off before the trial starts.


We acknowledge that, for some people, using a debit card rather than cash to pay for everyday items will be an initial inconvenience. We do not underplay that. However, the potential upside is a transformed community where people are safer; less money is spent on alcohol, gambling and illicit drugs; and more money is available to support children and families. This trial has the support of communities which are desperate to try to curb the impact of alcohol and drug fuelled violence. For these reasons the government is very strongly of the view that it is a concept worth trialling. I think there is broad support for this concept around this chamber. I think colleagues around the chamber know that that which has been done before has not worked. We know what the outcomes will be if we just continue more of the same. It is important that we do test and trial another approach. I commend the bill to my colleagues.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:11):  I have a series of questions that I would like to ask, and I know that Senator Xenophon does to, so perhaps we can explore things topic by topic.


The government has committed $1 million in additional funding—as I understand it through the letter that has gone to Ms Macklin, the opposition shadow on social services—specifically for the trial in Ceduna. My first question is: will there be similar levels of funding for the other trial sites, such as in the East Kimberley, and whatever other towns the government manages to get to agree to this process? Will there be similar levels of funding, or is it just because this one is the one that the government needs to get over the line to get this legislation over the line?

At that time the department said there was no designated amount and that there was no cap, that it would actually be worked out with the community at the time. I am very interested to hear whether there has been any further discussion beyond those generalisations that we received at the committee stage, because now we are actually talking about specifics.

 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (10:13):  Thank you, colleagues. In relation to other communities, there will be support packages that will be developed in a similar way as the one for Ceduna. But the first thing that has to happen is that the government needs to announce the intention for a trial in a particular location. Once that announcement has been made the government will work with local communities through a co-design process on the support package for the trial location.


It is important to see this as enabling legislation. We are in a position where we can confirm Ceduna and where we have announced the support package arrangements for that. But once other trial sites are finalised and announced, then there will be a similar process that will be gone through with those communities to work out similar support arrangements. In relation to Senator Moore's specific question about funding and whether there is a pot of money, we will find the resources that are needed for these support packages.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (10:18):  Minister, in the committee hearing we were told that this particular funding would come out of a contingency fund. I have a long history of not understanding contingency funds; I have had them explained to me a number of times. But in terms of the process, I am interested in the last letter from Minister Tudge, which arrived yesterday, I believe. It listed the number of services that would be enhanced by the $1 million payment. It also listed the number of services that were already in place. We were told there was a mapping exercise within the community, working with the community to see what services would be needed. I am very keen to know whether that is going to be the ongoing process, should there be other trial placements, and whether there would be any attempt to say that, because $1 million was appropriate to a trial in Ceduna, there could not be greater or lesser amounts in other trial sites, should such trials happen. What I want to find out is whether the process that we have seen in Minister Tudge's letter, which is working with the community to do a gap analysis and then looking at what other services there could be, would be the model and whether there would be any link between the amount of funding that has been given to this trial and the other trials having to have a similar amount of funding. It would be a similar model, but with no linkage to the amount of funding?

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:21):  Does that mean that services that should be available to other towns that would be paid for from the money that pays for these types of supports will not be available to other communities that require them? What happens if other communities put up their hands and say, 'Hey, we need a detox centre, we need a rehab centre, we need these wraparound services'? Does that mean that the trial sites will be prioritised and they will not get those things? How will that decision making occur? Secondly—this relates to evaluation, and I will go to evaluation later, but it does relate to budgets too—the evaluation will need to compare this approach, because it is a trial supposedly, to a centre that does not have the debit card. Will similar services be provided to another regional centre that does not have the debit card, to differentiate the debit card process and effect from the sorts of wraparound services that we all know are needed—in other words, comparing like with like? At the moment what you will be doing is looking at the trial and comparing it with the provision of the debit card and the services, whereas it is a lot of our contention that if you provide some of these early intervention services, rehab services, detox services and wraparound services it will in fact help tremendously to address issues around substance abuse and the sorts of things you say you are aiming for in this trial. That is a series of quite large questions. I appreciate that. Will other towns get this? Will you be specifically investing in these sorts of services in another town in order to be able to carry out a proper trial?

I do not think anyone should think support arrangements for these trials would be to the detriment of any other community in the nation. If there are propositions that are put to government for support in other communities then they will be considered through the usual government processes. So I do not think anyone should see what is proposed here as being at the expense of other communities. There will be an evaluation of these trial sites. The community will be heavily involved in that evaluation process, and if there are other inputs that communities or colleagues in this place think should be looked at in that evaluation process then I am certain that Assistant Minister Tudge would be only too happy to sit down and talk to colleagues to explore these matters.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:25):  I am fascinated by that response, in that I know through the IAS process—and we have a Senate inquiry into this—that applications that were made for these sorts of joined-up wraparound services we are talking about now did not get funded, and there were some in the Kimberley that did not get funded. So, I think a lot of the communities that put in applications through the last round of IAS funding will be (a) fascinated by this debate and (b) coming back to government to ask, 'Can we now have access to these services, given that other communities now seem to be able to get these services?'


My question there is: will the government now be willing to take applications from other communities for these sorts of services? It is a straightforward question: are you opening this process now to applications from other communities who want similar sorts of services for which you have now come up with funding all of a sudden? It is not that I think it is a bad idea to give them services. Will other communities now be able to put up their hand and say, 'We want some funding the same as Ceduna is getting'?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (10:27):  I might just take Senator Siewert through the advice that has been given to me on the evaluation process. It is expected that the evaluation will involve comprehensive analysis of multiple datasets from both qualitative and quantitative sources. The government is working closely with the Ceduna District Council and the South Australian government and will do so with local and state governments in other trial sites to build a comprehensive community baseline dataset before the trial commences early next year. This is critical for measuring community-level change during the trial. The Premier of South Australia has specifically committed to cooperating with state based data. This data may include state and territory collections, such as alcohol related hospitalisations, emergency department presentations and child protection data; Commonwealth collections, such as Centrelink administrative data related to drug and alcohol dependence, homelessness and housing, employment, recent trauma and domestic violence; local services data, including admissions to drug and alcohol services, mental health services, homelessness services and Aboriginal health services; and local merchant data, such as demand for alcohol and gambling products.


The government is working hand in hand with the Ceduna Community Heads Working Group, which will perform an important role in monitoring the trial and providing advice to government in relation to any unintended consequences or findings whilst the trial is on foot. In terms of the evaluation framework, the cashless debit card evaluation will have three components. The first will be the community change evaluation. An independent organisation will conduct interviews with trial participants and a wide cross-section of the community to explore the impact of the trial on levels of community harm, community functioning, alcohol consumption and rates of gambling, among other key issues relating to community safety. Second is the data monitoring project, where the government, in consultation with local and state governments, will collect data to monitor the effect of the trial in making communities safer on alcohol consumption and its wider negative effects in the community. A specialist with expertise in statistical methods will analyse the changes in these datasets during the trial. Thirdly, specialised product analysis. Recognising the debit card is a new innovation the government will engage a specialist to monitor and analyse the effectiveness of the card during the trial, and the evaluation will be made public.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:30):  Thank you for that additional information. There was some of that in the exchange of letters with the opposition. Thank you for outlining the additional data sets.


With all due respect, I appreciate the information but you did not actually answer my question, which was: will there be the ability to compare like with like? What you are doing is putting in place the debit card process and you are pouring in $1 million worth of additional services. I will repeat again that I think the additional services are really important, so I am not saying—and I do not want anyone for one second to say that I am saying—that those services are not important, because they are. But you have the debit card and the additional services. How are you going to differentiate the impact of the debit card from the additional services? In other words, you need another, similar community to be able to compare it. If you put in $1 million worth of services to a similar community, given the evidence base that we have seen before you are going to see a damn sight better response in that community than if those services were not there. So how are you going to differentiate the impact of the services and of the debit card?

 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (10:31):  You are right, Senator Siewert. I guess there are two broad elements to an evaluation. One is comparing the circumstances in the given community, looking at what the baseline was and how things have improved or otherwise. The other is comparing a trial site to a similar community, and that will be part of the trial. There are other communities that would be receiving some equivalent forms of community support and that is what the evaluation will look at.

In terms of being culturally appropriate, the local community has been involved and will continue to be involved in every step of the way.

We'll do it in a way that is.' Well—I have not heard the minister say it will be done in a culturally appropriate way, but just saying that it will be done 'collaboratively' is not saying that it will be done in a 'culturally appropriate' way.

 (Western Australia) (10:43):  I appreciate that, and I was not necessarily going to say that government was dictating how this would work. I appreciate that it is at a local level, but these are important considerations and I am mindful that we need to ensure that this process is culturally appropriate. Particularly in Western Australia, where I know the trial is not up, given the shocking history of intervention, of non-Aboriginal people dictating to Aboriginal people what will happen, of many Aboriginal people being part of the stolen generation and living on reserves and so on in Western Australia, I would be very concerned about how we roll out this authorised person. 


It is not appropriate for somebody to have to go into a Centrelink office and speak to someone, with a glass panel between them, and present some evidence that they want to reduce the percentage on their card. Whilst it is a local level thing, for me it is a very important issue. We have to have confidence in this trial. If there are four or five people on a panel, it is intimidating to have to sit before them and outline your most basic need. That in and of itself does not seem to me to be appropriate. 


Is it going to be a collaborative arrangement where an authorised officer works with that person? To have to front a panel and present some evidence to show that you should be entitled to a smaller percentage on your card is almost like begging. I appreciate that it is at the local level, but I think it is something that we have to get right; otherwise it just smacks of the appalling history we have, particularly in Western Australia, between the interface with white Australians and Aboriginal Australians.

I do not think we as government should dictate the way it should be. I do not think the senator opposite should dictate it. But, if she happens to think that she knows what would be the ideal arrangements, she is perfectly at liberty to share those with the local community. If she wants to do that, she should feel free to.


I will outline the situation with community bodies in a little more detail. The bill allows the local community body to support participants by varying the amount that is placed on the card down to a minimum of 50 per cent in response to demonstrated socially responsible behaviour or back up to the original amount if this behaviour is not maintained. It would also recommend support services, such as drug and alcohol rehabilitation or financial capability support. The local community body would not have the power to determine who would participate in a trial and it would be voluntary for a participant to appear before it. There is no compulsion here; it is voluntary. The local community body would be made up of local leaders who can represent the community and who have appropriate skills and standing in the community. The government is holding ongoing consultations with community leaders to determine the appropriate make-up of the body. That is what this is about. It is about consultation. It is far too early to be setting up straw men and knocking them down, Senator.


The local community body would make decisions to reduce an individual's restricted percentage based on agreed criteria, which may include evidence of meeting community norms, including meeting participation requirements and children attending school, and evidence that there is no misuse of drugs or alcohol or involvement in problem gambling. References from community members could be presented to support the individual's request. That is the schema, and we as a government are not dictating the way that people operate on the ground.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:47):  This goes to the heart of one of the failures of this process. This community body is a thought bubble. I do not know how many people currently in this Senate and debating this right now have lived in a small town. I have. I lived in a small town for quite a long time, where we all knew each other. Ceduna and the other towns we are talking about are probably slightly bigger than the town I lived in, but I would hazard a guess that a hell of a lot of people in Ceduna know each other.


Why we are questioning this is that it is obvious that the government has not thought this through. The minister is saying, 'We don't want to dictate every detail,' but that is because the government has not thought through what this means. So if I am on a carer payment, even though I do not have any substance abuse issues or gambling issues, I will be subjected to this and I will only get access to 50 per cent of the cash. So I have to front up to a community body of people I know, in a small community, and start talking about my personal financial arrangements. I am a carer providing care to one of my loved ones, and I have to go through this demeaning process—because that is what it is—with people I live down the street from or people I meet in the shopping centre or down at the shops. That is what we are talking about. That is what the government is setting up.


So how is this trial going to work? That is what we want to know. So what we are saying is that people who are living perfectly normal lives, other than trying to make ends meet on a carers payment, DSP or Newstart, for example, will have to go and expose all their lives to a so-called community body. How is it going to work? How are you going to ensure that people are able to go through this process without feeling demeaned and without feeling like that they have to go begging to a community body to get more access to cash? How can you assure this chamber that people will not be put off going to this body because of the very issues that I have just outlined?

 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (10:50):  I probably should go back to the first principles here—that is, the card can buy anything except for alcohol and gambling and no-one has to go before or be part of the local community body process in relation to varying the amount that is placed on the card unless they want to. No-one has to. Again I say that the card can buy anything except alcohol and gambling, and there will still be the 20 per cent that is available for the individual in cash.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:50):  I do not think the minister was here—and I apologise if you were—for the whole of the second reading debate, where a number of us outlined why you might need more cash. People have talked about the loss of dignity and feeling demeaned because they cannot access cash if they need to. There are a whole lot of reasons that people may need to access cash. People have talked to me about wanting to be able to access more cash for various reasons. One of those is to be able to go to markets. I have not been to a fresh food market where too many operators have an EFTPOS machine, for example. The op shop in Ceduna does not have an EFTPOS machine. Some op shops do and some do not. There are a whole lot of reasons that people may need access to cash.


They do not have to go before the panel, but people who want to will be dissuaded from going because they will potentially be going to a panel of people who they know really well and who they do not want to have access to their private lives. They do not want to explain their financial difficulties, how they happen to do their shopping or if they want to travel and need more access to cash, for example. The National Welfare Rights Network has outlined their case with examples of having to travel and needing cash or having to have a large amount of cash to contribute to a joint present for somebody.


Again, I am sorry—and I am not trying to be rude—but, honestly, you are displaying the fact that the government does not understand how this will operate and what impact it will have on people at the community level and how they relate to their community.

In terms of the community body, you talk in the letter—and if I just refer to the letter, I presume everyone knows what I mean—about an appropriate review process of the community body decisions. It does not outline what form that will take, how the review will work. Is it envisaged that DSS will do that or some other body? What are the time lines? What are the processes that will be used—in other words, enabling an appeal process of the community body decisions?

It is a real-life experience that somebody could well lose their card on a Saturday or Sunday and, despite the Prime Minister saying that we live in a seven-day economy, I do not agree with him. I am asking a legitimate question about how the replacement will occur. I appreciate that you have told me that it will not take weeks but, for example, if you get the trial up in Kununurra and you have to wait for some 'okay' from Canberra or Perth, that can take weeks. I am asking a legitimate question in a reasonable way about what happens when a card is lost on the weekend. I want to know what access there is for people to get food for their family or whatever else it is that they need. That is a reasonable question and I think the government really should have thought through the answer to that question.

The point I am making is that there will be appropriate arrangements to make sure that people can get replacement cards. We will make sure that in consultation with the community there are arrangements that satisfy the community. Why you would think that we would do anything other than seek to put in place arrangements through consultation with the community that satisfy the community I am not too sure. Given your interest in these particular aspects, I am sure that the minister would be very happy to provide a briefing for you that goes into the detail of what will happen from the moment someone losses a card to when they get their replacement card.

I was not suggesting for one moment that the government would deliberately withhold moneys, but we all know what happens when bureaucracy comes into play. The reality is that agencies that deal with cards, such as Centrelink and so on, are not open on Saturday and Sunday. What is the contingency? If somebody has lost their card, do they have to have documents that prove that they are who they say they are to get a replacement? And how do they get access to food on a Sunday morning? It is a legitimate question, and quite frankly the government should have a proper answer to that.

The advice I have is that the longest period would be until the next business day, but these are things that can be worked through with the community. These are things that can be worked through in the trial. Let me emphasise: this is our trial. This is a trial that we are embarking on here. There are still some details to be worked through with the community.

I have had personal experience of this, having had my credit card stolen in a regional centre. It actually took more than two weeks to replace it. I alluded to this point in my contribution to the second reading debate last night. Say I am travelling, for example, to Maningrida for some family and cultural business, and I lose my card on the way, and I am in Maningrida. It is not just about having a stock in Ceduna. I could have gone to Melbourne. I could have gone to Perth. How do I do that? Is everyone going to have a stock? Whichever financial institution is going to do this—and we will get to that in a minute—how can they guarantee that those stocks are going to be there? And how do I get access to cash in the meantime? I was able to access cash when my card was stolen, because I do not have a limit imposed on how much of my salary I can spend in cash. They do, so they will be able to get only a certain amount of cash. How do they get by when they are away, let alone in Ceduna, without being able to access cash before they get their card in those remote centres? And can you guarantee that the same deal that you do for Ceduna will apply everywhere else in Australia?

People have always lost their wallets, lost their purses, lost those things that are within them. It is always inconvenient when you lose your wallet or your purse and the things that are within it. There is always a period of time that it takes to replace that which is lost which was within your wallet or your purse. This is not a concept which has been created by the introduction of the concept of this card. Yes, I recognise that when people lose things it is inconvenient. What we will do is make sure that people can get a replacement card in the quickest possible period of time.

So, sorry, the 20 per cent answer does not cut it, because I need access to more cash than that 20 per cent. It is a relatively small amount of money.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:10):  I will give this one more go. I will give you a real-life example. This is what happened to me. I got my whole wallet stolen. I could go into my bank, prove who I was through answering a series of questions and get enough cash to take me through at least till I got back home and for a few days after that. I was away. I could access enough cash to do that. I have a limit, just to stop people being able to go in and use my cards to steal my cash. There is a limit there, but it is quite a high limit, as probably most of us have, for the amount of cash per day. But I could get that money because I do not have a limit on how much money I can take out of the bank. A person on Newstart could do the same thing as me—go and prove who they were through answering a series of questions so that they could take money out. I think I actually took out $500 so that I had enough cash, because I knew I was not going to be able to buy things electronically. That is what a person in the same situation as me would want to do—take out enough cash so that they could access things before they got their card back. In this case, they cannot do that. They may have already used the 20 per cent that they can access for the two weeks of the pay cycle. Even if they have a little bit of that left, they may not have enough left, potentially, because there is a limited amount of cash they can get. So, yes, they can access the cash, but only a tiny amount. So what do they do then for the rest of the time, when they cannot access any more cash because they do not have the card? This is not a made-up scenario. It is a real-life scenario. That is why we are asking, because this is what it means to people on the ground when they are trying to get through this process. They will be surviving trying to use the card. You have got to think of what it means day to day, and this is a really live situation. Lots of people in the community travel quite long distances, but, even if they do not, it also happens if they are still in town and it is not the travelling scenario that I am outlining.

If someone is away from home for an extended period, there could be arrangements for the replacement card to be sent to that Centrelink office, I guess in a similar fashion as to what might happen with a bank. But let me indicate again: where there are particular issues that the community identify as issues, then they can certainly be looked at.

Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (11:21):  Credit card surcharging is a topic that I am quite passionate about talking about. I just want to get my understanding of this right. I have not been as on top of the details of this issue as other senators, so I apologise if some of this has been explained. With these cards, at the moment, if I want to withdraw money from the bank—and I am entitled, as I understand it, to withdraw up to 20 per cent of it as cash—I can use it at every normal ATM, as I would with a Keycard or a Visa card or a MasterCard? It functions in the same facility if I want to withdraw? It is as if it is a CommBank, ANZ or NAB card to operate?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (11:22):  I am not entirely sure what Senator Dastyari's question is, but there are ATM fees often for withdrawing cash. I know that various banks have various arrangements—that there are X number of transactions that might not have a fee before you start having fees.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Security Legislation Amendment (Debit Card Trial) Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2015-10-14,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (11:23):  Minister, the bit that I guess I am interested in is that the way in which it works tends to be fairly consistent. As you know, the Senate is doing a separate inquiry into these matters at the moment to do with credit cards, which kind of relates to this. The consistency seems to be that, if you are using a card at an institution other than the institution that has issued that card, there is a fee for withdrawal of money, as there is also a fee for checking your balances. That is across every card, and that is across every bank.


The concern, I think, in part is the huge discrepancy in what these fees are in different parts of Australia. If I am in the CBD of Sydney, I can find a bank that is not my bank—let us say I have a Commonwealth Bank card; I can go and find an ANZ ATM—that may have a fee associated, but it is only, say, $1.50. But, if I am in a rural or regional area or a remote Indigenous community, there are reports of up to $3.70 being charged for that same function. Some would argue that this is a discrepancy relating to a lack of competition in these more rural and regional kinds of areas.


The concern, Minister, would be that, if I am being charged a fee of $3.70, the simple act of, say, on two occasions checking to see how much money is in my account, plus one withdrawal, suddenly means an amount of $10, which may seem small to those of us earning close to $200,000 in this chamber, but somebody who is on Newstart, disability support or another type of pension would obviously see it as quite significant. The question would be: have the practicalities of the fees associated and what the fees will do been looked at and modelled, and has there been any discussion with the financial institutions for these trials on how we can minimise that?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (11:25):  I think it is important to recognise that this is a debit card, not a credit card. In relation to taking it to a store, the only thing that someone will pay is what the merchant rings up on the cash register. What comes up on there is what the individual will pay. In terms of checking people's balances on the debit card, people can do that without cost.

You cannot withdraw cash from the debit card. The cash component, the 20 per cent, would go into your bank account or whatever the mechanism is that you specify. There are no fees associated with the debit card account.


In terms of a merchant, what someone pays is what the merchant rings up, which may include a charge that they have for people using cards. As I said earlier, there is work going on, particularly in the trial regions, to try to ensure that merchants have that as low as possible.

In other committees I have been involved with, on assessments, we were usually given some guidance at least as to what were the minimum expectations, so I would have thought that was a fairly fair thing to do. We are talking about people's access to income support here; it is not an arbitrary thing. There are fairly set rules around it from the government and from others, so surely you would have some minimum level of requirement that you would expect from a community body? If you do not, what would you do if they came up with a scenario that in fact you did not think was acceptable?

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:38):  I have a couple of questions around that, and you may want to take them all at once. Firstly, people do not just stay in Ceduna; people travel. So what happens then? That occurs all around Australia. So what do you do when they travel outside Ceduna? We have been focusing on Ceduna because we know that the memorandum is already signed, but is the same level of negotiation going on in East Kimberley and in any other proposed trial location?

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (11:47):  I think it is a point, in terms of clarifying exactly the position of where we proceed, that he legislation before us is the enabling legislation for the three trials and the agreement is that the future activity around where the trials will exist will be done by disallowable instrument. I want to clarify that in terms of the kinds of questions that people have been asking today around how trials will operate. What kind of detail and exchange of information process is going to occur before disallowable instruments are developed and brought to the chamber?


We have had a Senate inquiry on the enabling legislation and how the general legislation will operate, and I think that has generated a lot of questions about detail. We have yet, now, to go down the process of saying Ceduna or other places where trials will exist. Can you give us any indication of what the interaction is going to be with us—with the parliament and with the Senate—about, even now, how the trial in Ceduna will actually progress, in particular for the disallowable instrument? Should you have other locations in mind, what will be the degree of detail that will come forward to explain to us how they will operate?

It was more a case that they felt that across a range of programs and portfolios they had plenty of trials in their area and that they perhaps would want to first benefit and learn from the experience of another region that had a trial rather than to have the trial themselves.

This is what we are trialling here. This is why we are asking. How am I, as an income support recipient who is now caught up in this trial, supposed to be confident that the banking institution and the Department of Human Services are not going through and looking at every purchase I make to check whether I have spent my money appropriately. That is what this is about. Can you please reassure the Senate, and hence the community: what is the process by which that the bank goes through and looks at suspicious purchases?

This is supposed to be non-discriminatory.

 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (12:00):  I have just been given an example of the Ceduna Foreshore Hotel Motel, where they have different terminals—if you like—for different transactions. So there is one terminal where you might pay for your food and another where you might pay for your alcohol through the bar. There are mechanisms and means for organisations that sell a range of products, some of which are appropriate and allowed under the debit card trial and some of which are not.

The way that alcohol and gaming transactions are prevented in the trial areas, in relation to the 80 per cent that is on the card, is that the particular businesses will not accept the card for those purchases on the basis of what is negotiated locally.

 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:06):  Thank you. Coming back to your previous answer: I would not in fact be able to attempt to use my card to buy a meal, depending on what is negotiated in Ceduna at the moment. So if you negotiate that it is not going to include restaurants that serve alcohol I could not go in there and I would not be able even to use the card—even to use it to purchase a meal.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (12:06):  It depends on what is negotiated locally. It could be locally negotiated that there are arrangements in a particular restaurant to differentiate between the alcohol purchase and the food purchase.

 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:07):  That gets back to my original question of how that will occur and the original issue about being treated differently to other customers, in that I will have to signal that I have this special card that I cannot buy alcohol on. How do I organise it? This is what people are bringing up with me. I have to flag that I am on income support, that I have a different card and that I have to pay for my alcohol out of my limited amount of 20 per cent cash.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:07):  My concern is that people will be treated differently. This is not just a normal card that you can use anywhere, with no-one knowing that you are on income support and without you being signalled as somebody who is caught up in the trial. In fact in these stores in these particular situations in Ceduna you will be signalled, because you have to flag a different arrangement.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (12:08):  Let me clarify the arrangement where there would be two terminals. It would not just be people on the debit card who would need to split their bill. Everyone would be required to split their bill, regardless of whether or not they are on the debit card.

 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:08):  This is really fascinating. I wonder whether the people in Ceduna who are not on income support know that, from now on, they will have to pay separately for their alcohol. Is that what we are saying? If that is what I just heard, that is exactly what is happening. Have you canvassed the whole of Ceduna to find out whether they know that that is what they are going to be doing, if in fact that is what you mean?

 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (12:09):  A further point of clarification: someone who was not on a debit card would be able to pay their full account through the alcohol terminal. They could split their bill if they wanted to, but they would not have to it. Someone who was on the debit card would need to split their bill.

 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:09):  It may be just me who is confused, but in your previous answer I heard you say that it would be the same for everyone; now you are saying that it would not be, that it would just be people on income support who then have to organise things so that they pay for their alcohol separately.

 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:10):  This is doing my head in. It is doing all our heads in—it is not just me—for those who are listening. It still means that you differentiate between those on income support: they pay for their food on a separate terminal?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (12:10):  Let me see if I can seek to clarify this issue so that there is no confusion. The debit card will work only on the food-only terminal. Someone who had a debit card but was wanting to pay for alcohol with cash or with another card linked to their own account would do so on the same terminal as everyone else. There would be a terminal that all alcohol purchases would go through and, if someone were using the debit card for food, that would go through the debit card terminal—and anyone else could use that terminal as well.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:12):  Okay, we are getting a bit closer. So my original question and scenario-painting were in fact correct. Anyone else can use that terminal—yes, they can if they are not buying alcohol. So there are still two separate terminals. I am in there, I have had my meal and I am coming out. I will come back to the sign issue in a moment. But it is clear that I will have to use two different terminals if I have had a drink with my lunch or dinner. That is correct, is it not?

 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (12:13):  That depends.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:13):  I understand that, but if there is a special occasion and I am out for dinner, these days the food is probably going to take up my fairly limited supply of cash. Therefore, because I need to save my cash to buy other things, I am probably going to want to put that on the debit card. So, yes, you can get out of it by saying that you could use your cash, but the fact is that that will get used up pretty quickly. Is that not the point? Before I walk into the restaurant, is there a process whereby people will know where they can and cannot use these cards? I can imagine this is going to be complicated. There will need to be splitting of bills. Restaurants do not do splitting of bills really well. Will a sign be up so that I am not embarrassed when I am confronted with this process?

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:14):  I asked about the situation before I go in. To be really clear here: we are talking about everyone in Ceduna who is on a payment being subjected to this—whether you are a carer or whether you are on DSP, Newstart or Youth Allowance and there are a couple of other categories. So all of these people are going to have to find out whether these restaurants, cafes and other places are ones that do this process or are ones that do not?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (12:15):  An individual who has a debit card knows that they cannot use the debit card for alcohol or gaming. That knowledge should guide people, and will guide people, as to what particular card they use to pay for which particular transactions. So someone going into a place that serves alcohol would know that they would not be able to use their debit card to purchase alcohol. I think the arrangements on the ground in individual stores are probably more straightforward because people essentially self-select on the basis of what they can and cannot purchase on the basis of whether or not they are a holder of a debit card.

 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:17):  That was why I was asking the question about whether there would be something on the window or whether there would be a document published, so that before I go in—and before I get embarrassed; let alone being embarrassed when I am having to split the bills when I am in there—I know whether it is a restaurant or a premise that actually does do that.

At this stage, I think the debate has been very good. I have only a few questions, and I do apologise in advance if they have already been asked. I have not had a chance to listen to every single bit of the debate. You will have to forgive the cynic in me, but I do have concerns that the trial is being targeted at low-socioeconomic groups to guarantee success of the trial and to make it easier to justify expansion into the future. In the event that this trial is successful for this particular socioeconomic group, would the data be used, and how would it be used, to predict success for potential future implementation of this type of policy to socioeconomic groups that do not match the trial group?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (12:22):  Thanks, Senator, for the question. The trial site in Ceduna has been chosen because of the very high indicators of hospitalisation and other abuses—and I am just flicking through my notes to give you some of the statistics, specifically, in relation to Ceduna.


In 2013-14, presentations to the hospital emergency department due to alcohol or drug use exceeded 500—and that is more than one presentation per day. The local sobering-up facility had 4,667 admissions that same year from a regional population of 4,425. I will just share with you a quote I sighted a little earlier from the Ceduna Community Heads Group, a key legislative group in Ceduna who have endorsed the concept of the trial. They said:


We want to build a future for our younger generation to aspire to and believe we cannot do this if our families are caught up in the destructive cycle of alcohol or drugs that destroys our culture, our lands and our communities.


At the heart of this reform, is a change that is being shaped specifically to meet our local needs. It has been a true collaboration to ensure that we can give our mob and our Communities every chance to create real and genuine change in their lives.


We have grasped this initiative; we have helped shape this initiative; and we are confident that this initiative is for the betterment of all people within our region.


You are right, Senator Muir, that the area has been chosen because of some particular issues—the level of alcohol abuse, the level of hospital admissions, illegal drug use and the recognition of gambling as being a factor that also harms families. Part of the rationale for having a defined component of someone's payment that can only be accessed through the card is to limit the amount of money that could be used on illicit drugs, gambling or alcohol. 


The purpose of the evaluation, which will be put in place, is to see to what extent some of these really bad statistics are reduced through the trial of the card. I emphasise: it is a trial. There will be evaluation, and we do want to learn from the trial.

Considering this is a low-socioeconomic area with these issues, will the data be used to predict success into the future and to roll out the policy into the broader community?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (12:26):  The intention at the moment is that it is targeting areas where there are high rates of harm. It is not necessarily tied to socioeconomics, because there can be some low-socioeconomic areas where you do not have these kinds of statistics. It is not that a low-socioeconomic area has been chosen as such; it is the rates of harm that are present that has determined the one community at this stage that the trail is aimed at. It is not something that seeks to characterise low-socioeconomic communities. It is something that recognises that there are some communities that have a higher incidence of harm, and we are seeing if, through this mechanism, we can reduce that. I am advised that the intention was always to target the areas, if you like, of greatest need with some of these really appalling statistics.

 (Victoria) (12:28):  In the area that has been chosen for the trial to be rolled out, I understand the Ceduna area had 500 hospitalizations and the sobering-up program had 4,667 people.

Will the government commit to a process in the future where communities can choose to opt in or out on a community by community basis in the event that the government does decide to use the data collected after this trial to roll out the policy further?

We take the evaluation seriously. We will want to have the trial, look at the evaluation, see if it is a success and, if it is, then at that point we would make a determination as to whether to seek to expand it to other communities. Our approach with this trial, and possibly with another two, is to work with local communities, to be consultative and to see if there is a willingness as there is in Ceduna. In Ceduna there is a really, really strong desire for this to be in place, but we take the evaluation seriously and I would not want to prejudge that evaluation or any decisions that we might take after that.

 (South Australia) (12:34):  I know we have 10 minutes before we go to senators' statements, but hopefully I can deal with two discreet issues in respect of that. The first relates to the location of the trial. I have had some very good and productive discussions with Assistant Minister Tudge in relation to this—and I want to express my gratitude to the assistant minister and to his office for their level of cooperation and goodwill.


When I went to Ceduna with Senator Lambie on 2 October, there was a concern felt by a significant part of the community who had expressed concerns about the trial; they felt that there had not been an adequate level of consultation. I know that Assistant Minister Tudge has made it very clear that there has been extensive consultation with a number of key stakeholders. The assistant minister has indicated to me that there will be a public meeting in Ceduna that will go for two to three hours—I think that the minister's adviser is helpfully nodding, and hopefully that nod can be translated through the minister into Hansard. Before any regulations are tabled, before any final decision is made, can the minister indicate that there will be a public meeting in Ceduna that will allow a robust exchange of views with the local community, and that the public meeting will involve the assistant minister?

Senator FIFIELD:
  before any regulations, that is right—and we will work to find a date that works for you.




Senator Xenophon:

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:36):  For the benefit of the taxpayers, we will not be going to Ceduna by helicopter from Adelaide. I am grateful for that, and I think that it is going to be very important. I am sure that it will be a feisty, robust meeting. It is important in a democracy for those concerns to be raised. I will raise some of the concerns that were put to me in the community gathering that I went to at the Ceduna community hotel.


There is one issue that I happened to speak to Assistant Minister Tudge about just a few moments ago, and I want to get this on the record. It is an issue that I have discussed with my colleagues Senator Moore and Senator Siewert. It relates to the regulations for the trial. The concern that I have had is that, at the moment, in terms of subordinate legislation, there are 15 sitting days to disallow a regulation, so, if a problem is apparent, if there is a serious problem with the trial—and I hope that will not be the case; I want to make that clear—we have only got 15 sitting days to deal with that. I was going to move an amendment to extend that 15 days to 30 days, but that would involve some technical difficulties. I would be grateful if the government could indicate and give a firm undertaking that any regulations would be established for a period of six months only, with the intent that there be a further period of six months, effectively giving the Senate an opportunity to consider a disallowance of those regulations on two occasions, with 15 sitting days each time. I think that would give us a greater level of scrutiny, in a sense, and scrutiny with teeth, in respect of this. Again, I make it clear that I want this to work, as does the government, but I think it is important that we have that additional level of safety and scrutiny for the communities involved.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:39):  I have got to put on the record that I think this is slightly better but it still does not get it over the line for us. However, if we are going to do that, is there a commitment that information that is collected as part of the monitoring process will be made available so that, when we are then considering the next regulatory process, we will have access to that information? Otherwise it is a moot point, because, if we do not have access to information, we will not be able to make a decision about whether we support the next regulatory instrument.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:40):  Could I just take up Senator Siewert's point? I guess I look at it from a slightly different perspective. By having two legislative instruments, by having two periods of six months, if the government is not being transparent in the process—and I would shocked if it were not, and I say that with a straight face, because I think it is in the government's interest for there to be transparency in the process. I genuinely believe that. I know some more cynical in the chamber might not have that view, but the fact is: if there is not, then that itself could be a factor for the disallowance. I think the government would know that, in order to ensure that the regulation not be disallowed in the second six-month period, there would need to be a level of transparency and accountability in the process. So I think that itself would act to be useful.


I will just ask a question of the minister that I raised briefly with Assistant Minister Tudge. This is what happens when you pass people in the corridors of this building. We had a useful conversation but sadly none of it was recorded for the purposes of Hansard. This relates to online gambling. Yesterday, just parenthetically, I had a very useful discussion with former New South Wales Premier Barry O'Farrell, who is heading up—




Senator Dastyari:
  Over wine?




Senator XENOPHON:
  Senator Dastyari, hopefully Hansard did not pick that up. Through you, Chair, Senator Dastyari needs to know that there was no wine consumed, only water.


In his review of online gambling, there was an issue about the distinction between illegal online gambling providers—those that operate out of Gibraltar and the Caribbean and goodness knows where else, which are unauthorised and illegal—and those that are authorised under the Interactive Gambling Act. My question to the minister—and I happy for some of this to be taken on notice—is: given that some of these illegal operations have innocuous-sounding names that do not sound anything like a gambling provider for their merchant ID, will the healthy welfare card prohibit overseas transactions, and which overseas transactions will be allowed? If you are dealing with Amazon.com to buy a book, I would have thought that someone should be able to do that transaction—or if they are dealing with any online retailers that might be overseas or they want to subscribe to The New York Times, which might have a special subscription deal that goes to an overseas website. How do you distinguish between those overseas transactions and, in particular, overseas online gambling transactions?

 (South Australia) (12:44):  We are about to go to senators' statements, but I want to ask a question about a point that was put to me in a very powerful, poignant way by one of the people that I met in Ceduna on 2 October. This person had never been on welfare for 40 years. They had fallen on hard times and needed welfare, needed that support. They had paid their taxes for 40 years or so and they felt a level of stigma in having such a card and that they would have to go to a panel to get approval for some pre-existing payments they had to make. Perhaps we could address that when we get back to this bill.


Progress reported.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2015-10-14,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (09:31):  I rise to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Debit Card Trial) Bill 2015. The bill seeks to amend the social security law to enable a trial phase of new cashless welfare arrangements in response to the 'healthy welfare card' recommendation from Mr Andrew Forrest's review of Indigenous jobs and training.


The trial is proposed to be conducted in three locations, involving up to 10,000 people. Locations will be selected on the basis of high levels of welfare dependence; where gambling, alcohol and/or drug abuse are causing unacceptable levels of harm within the community; and where there is a level of community support. The participants in this trial are people who reside in the trial locations and who are on working age payments, including Newstart, disability support and carer payments. Age pensioners and wage earners can volunteer.


In rising to speak on this bill I acknowledge the significant harm caused by alcohol abuse and the related violence. The Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill heard from residents about the devastating impacts that alcohol abuse and violence have in communities across Australia, in particular the committee heard about the destructive impact they have on Ceduna, the first trial site for this initiative, and the surrounding communities.


I had the pleasure yesterday of having a delegation from Ceduna come and meet with me to talk about this piece of legislation. Labor understands the need to take action to address these problems. However, in seeking to do so, this debit card legislation should not be rushed or avoid proper scrutiny. Indeed, the Labor senators' report from the Community Affairs Legislation Committee goes to this very point. The proposed trial will have significant implications for the lives of those living in the trial sites and, if it is planned and implemented well, these implications will be positive. However, if the proposed trial is rushed and implemented without the appropriate supports, the trial will not only likely fail but will also have a negative impact on people's lives. Unfortunately, this is what Mr Tudge has sought to do. The bill was introduced without important details being worked out, and we heard that concern in some of the contributions to this bill by other senators yesterday. This concern was evident throughout the Senate committee inquiry process, with the department being unable to explain crucial details about the trial, particularly the supports that would accompany this.


Rushing proper consideration of this legislation and its impacts is nothing more than irresponsible and could potentially undermine the very outcomes that the trail seeks to achieve. I acknowledge that Mr Tudge has provided further detail about the trial in a letter to our shadow ministers, Jenny Macklin and Shane Neumann. However, significant issues remain unresolved. In fact, this additional information was provided by Mr Tudge only on Sunday afternoon and only after the shadow ministers wrote to him expressing Labor's concerns. Mr Tudge used his response as an opportunity to attack Labor and question our commitment to supporting community leaders to respond to the harm caused by alcohol in their communities. Mr Tudge must realise that this is not about playing politics, it is not about scoring cheap shots; this is about making long-term change. This type of long-term change will be possible only if this trial is implemented properly, and this can happen only through proper consideration of the debit card trial legislation and its implications.


Labor will not be badgered into rushing its consideration of the legislation. Labor wants to ensure that the debit card trial achieves the best outcomes for participating communities, and this will happen only if we properly consider the proposal. The proposal in the bill stems from the healthy welfare card recommendation from Mr Andrew Forrest's review of Indigenous jobs and training. The trial, which has been designed in response to the report's recommendations and would be established through this bill, intends to test whether significantly reducing access to cash can reduce the habitual abuse and associated harm from alcohol, gambling and illegal drugs. Under the trial, access to cash for income support recipients would be limited by placing a significant proportion of a person's welfare payments into a restricted bank account. The bill will also enable a community body to be involved in determining welfare arrangements within a trial location. We note that the bill does not include where these locations will be and that, instead, these trial areas will be specified later through legislative instrument. We do know, however, that the bill allows the trial to be conducted in up to three locations for up to 10,000 people.


As my colleagues have mentioned, a memorandum of understanding has already been signed for Ceduna and the surrounding area to be the first trial location. The trial sites are to be determined on the basis of need—selected on the basis of high levels of welfare dependence, where gambling, alcohol and drug abuse are causing unacceptable levels of harm within the community. The bill establishes that in these locations 80 per cent of regular payments and 100 per cent of lump sum payments received by people on a working-age income support payment will be placed in a restricted bank account. The remaining 20 per cent of payments will be put in the bank account of the recipient's choice. This money will be available for use at the individual's discretion. Trial participants will include people in receipt of Newstart allowance, parenting payment, disability support pension and carer payment. Age pension recipients will not be part of the trial automatically, but they could volunteer to be included. A trial participant will not be able to use the debit card linked to the restricted account to access cash or purchase gambling products and services, alcohol or illegal drugs.


I think it is important to note that the new debit card arrangements are very different from the income management program. Unlike with income management, participants on the new debit card will receive no assistance from Centrelink workers with budgeting and to make sure that the income support payments are directed to life's essentials, like rent, food and items of clothing. The new debit card will ensure only that the majority of income support payments cannot be spent on alcohol or gambling products. For this reason it is critical that the trial include the appropriate support services to ensure that the proposal can support people to tackle the very complex and often intergenerational problems that confront these communities.


The need for a comprehensive package of support to accompany the debit card was raised in a number of the submissions to the Senate inquiry. The submission from Empowering Communities put it clearly when they stated:


The card alone will not solve the underlying factors which lead to drug, alcohol and gambling abuse, or the harm they cause.


The submissions highlighted that supports and services had to be part of any effort to meaningfully respond to the harm caused by alcohol abuse. In their submission to the Senate committee inquiry, Yalata Community Incorporation states:


It is the strong view of Yalata and other Aboriginal leaders that the cashless debit card by itself will not address the problems caused by alcohol. The success of the trial will be determined by the other support measures that are implemented at the same time.


If these accompanying supports and services are not provided, this trial is surely bound to fail and to merely act to penalise income support recipients in trial sites. As such, this new card should not be seen as a solution for all the problems in these communities.


Labor is unwavering in its commitment to helping communities tackle alcohol and drug abuse and the harm it causes. Labor is firm in our commitment to protecting individuals, particularly women and children and those who are most vulnerable within our community, from these harms. Frankly, it is appalling that Mr Tudge has sought to colour Labor's insistence on appropriate oversight and consideration of the trial as anything but a commitment to making certain that the proposed debit card trial will help these communities and protect vulnerable people.


Labor wants to ensure that the trial is sufficiently comprehensive to drive the long-term positive change needed for all communities that may be impacted. Labor knows that alcohol abuse and the harm it causes is having a devastating impact on the lives of people in some communities. However, Labor is concerned that the proposed debit card trial and related bill is not sufficiently comprehensive to meet its stated aims—to tackle alcohol, drug and gambling abuse and the harm it causes to particular communities. We are also concerned that insufficient evidence was provided about how the bill will operate and note that many of the details are yet to be worked through.


As I previously indicated, during the Senate committee inquiry we heard that there was a level of confusion about what had been agreed for the proposed trial. I share the concerns expressed during the inquiry that the consultations on the trial have been unsatisfactory to date. This does not undermine Labor's commitment to addressing alcohol abuse and harm. It does not undermine Labor's understanding of the desperate need for action to support long-term change. I completely reject Mr Tudge's characterisation that Labor is turning its back on what community leaders are saying or that we are placing the trial at risk by asking additional questions about the trial. This is scaremongering and avoidance of fulsome scrutiny of the legislation.


Rather, it is Labor's commitment to addressing these issues and our understanding that action is needed that drive our consideration of this bill. Labor is committed to supporting community leaders in responding to the harm caused in their communities through fulsome consideration of the legislation and its implications. We believe that this will ultimately support a better long-term outcome for people living in the proposed trial communities. As I have already stated, Labor is working hard to make sure that the trial is robust and will support its stated aims: tackling alcohol abuse and the harm it causes. That is why we are working hard to make sure that additional supports will be in place for participating communities, like drug and alcohol services, family violence services and financial management programs. I welcome the commitment of these supports to Ceduna, but this trial will impact on other locations and it will be critical that they receive similar adequate supports and services.


Another important element of the proposal, that Labor supports in principle, is the community panel model. However, it was clear from the evidence to the Senate committee inquiry that there is a lack of shared understanding about how a community panel could operate and when it might commence. This is largely due to the fact that there has been insufficient information from the government about the role and responsibilities of such a panel. The lack of detail and public information about exactly how the trial would operate was a consistent theme throughout the submissions to the Senate inquiry. Submissions from organisations such as Financial Counselling Australia, Consumer Action Law Centre and the National Welfare Rights Network highlighted a number of details and issues that they believed had not been worked out or made public.


These submissions raised concerns that many of the details about how the debit card will operate are yet to be finalised or sufficiently worked through, including how funds were to be managed, by which financial institution, privacy considerations and compliance monitoring. Submissions also raised concerns with the fact that the debit card trial would apply to all people on a working-age payment, with no mechanism for people to come off the debit card.


Many people in receipt of income support payments are responsibly managing their payments and in the interests of their family and children. These people may not individually benefit from the debit card. For this reason Labor would support further consideration as to whether people should be able to come off the debit card if they meet certain criteria. A mechanism like this would also act to encourage positive change for people who may be on the debit card. And while I welcome Mr Tudge's belated efforts to provide some of the details about the trial, it is simply unacceptable that the government thinks that the Senate should pass this legislation without having properly considered the detail and implications of the proposal.


Another significant issue which Labor is seeking assurances from the government on is the trial evaluation. Ahead of the commencement of the trial it is vital that a robust evaluation framework is in place. Without this type of evaluation any trial is pointless and we will not develop the evidence on the impacts. This is precisely the reason for having a trial.


Labor will continue to hold the government to account and to make sure that any outstanding details are worked through and agreed prior to a trial commencing. Once the government has provided the additional information sought we will be prepared to vote on the bill.


The trial of the proposed debit card is a significant measure that has implications for communities across Australia, beyond those where the trial will proceed. Labor acknowledges that it could have benefits for communities affected by alcohol abuse. It is important that the legislation is developed robustly and not be rushed. Labor, in government, followed a far more comprehensive and detailed process in developing substantive welfare reform measures of this type. Labor hopes the government will work hard in the coming months to rectify the shortcomings so that we can reach agreement on this bill.


We look forward to the government providing a full and detailed response on the outstanding issues that will then enable an informed debate on the bill. Again I note that the concern about the lack of detail that has been expressed by other senators in their contributions is, I believe, widespread in groups that are interested in this trial. I recommend that the government take up the Labor senators' recommendation in terms of the Senate community affairs inquiry into this bill, which asked that the bill not be progressed until there are sufficient consultations carried out in all the possible trial communities and a consultation report with proposed trial communities is made public.


There are a number of other points that the Labor senators on the committee made in their recommendation 2 on this bill. We again ask the government to make public the details of consultations, exactly how the debit card will work and the operations of the bill—including possible community involvement; income quarantining decision making; how people will transition from income management; agreement on the financial institutions; and, as I and other contributors to this debate have already mentioned, privacy considerations. Of course, very importantly, the compliance monitoring is to be made public.


I think it is quite clear from the contributions to this debate—not just from Labor senators but from other senators—that there are a number of concerns that a lot of details on how the debit card will work in the trial areas are not in this bill. A lot of questions have been asked that are currently unanswered, and the government needs to provide those answers to enable a robust and fully-informed debate to take place.

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2015-10-14,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (09:51):  This is a very important piece of legislation and I know that is appreciated by all colleagues in this place. I thank them for their contributions not only to this debate but also to the Senate committee process that has looked at the legislation. I particularly acknowledge at the outset the incredible work of Mr Alan Tudge, the Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister and also Assistant Minister for Social Services, for whom this has been an area of great interest not just professionally in his ministerial capacity but also in his previous role as deputy director of the Cape York institute as Noel Pearson's deputy. 


This bill when enacted will enable a trial phase of new cashless welfare arrangements and a cashless debit card. The main objective of the trial is to test whether restricting discretionary cash can reduce the overall social harm which is caused by welfare-fuelled alcohol, gambling and drug abuse, particularly against women and children. This is an important social reform and, importantly, it is one that the community is calling for. Excessive alcohol consumption, drug use and gambling are—as you know, Mr President, from your previous incarnation as a senior police officer—harmful and costly to the broader community and are a cause of health problems, high crime rates, domestic and community violence, family breakdown and social dysfunction. Alcohol-related harm results in 3,000 deaths and 65,000 hospitalisations every year in Australia. The total cost of alcohol-related problems in the nation is estimated to be between $15 billion and $31 billion per year. Problem gambling is associated with a range of health, social and economic problems. Problem gambling costs the Australian community an estimated $4.7 billion per year, and individuals with gambling problems lose, on average, $21,000 per year—a third of the average Australian salary. These are significant social issues. 


The trial will be conducted in up to three locations and will be limited to 10,000 people. Trial locations will be selected on the basis of high levels of welfare dependence and where gambling, alcohol and illegal drug abuse are causing unacceptable levels of harm. Community interest and willingness to participate will also be a factor.


We have undertaken an extensive community consultation process. Consultations to date have included community leaders, proposed trial participants, state and local governments, industry, merchants and welfare groups. These genuine community consultations are enabling a better understanding of local needs and help to gauge the interest in a trial in several communities. The consultation process has provided government with valuable feedback and insight into the issues these communities face.


Ceduna in South Australia will be the first site under the trial to commence. Ceduna signed an MOU with the government on 4 August to participate in the trial, and the leadership in the community have publicly called for this trial and see it as a mechanism to address some of the welfare-fuelled alcohol and drug abuse that is devastating the community.


In Ceduna the statistics are pretty stark. In 2013-14, presentations to the hospital emergency department due to alcohol or drug use exceeded 500—that is more than one per day. The local sobering-up facility had a staggering 4,667 admissions that same year from a regional population of 4,425. The Ceduna community heads group, a key leadership group in the community, had endorsed the reform and said:


We want to build a future for our younger generation to aspire to and believe we cannot do this if our families are caught up in the destructive cycle of alcohol or drugs that destroys our culture, our lands and our communities.


…   …   …


At the heart of this reform, is a change that is being shaped specifically to meet our local needs.  It has been a true collaboration to ensure that we can give our mob and our Communities every chance to create real and genuine change in their lives.


…   …   …


We have grasped this initiative; we have helped shape this initiative; and we are confident that this initiative is for the betterment of all people within our region.


We are also in advanced discussions with the leaders in the East Kimberley region. Key leaders in the region, led by Ian Trust of the Wunan Foundation, Ted Hall Junior of the MG Corporation and Desmond Hill of the Gelganyem Trust see the trial as a worthy idea to address many social issues facing their communities. The three leaders wrote to the government saying: 'We acknowledge that agreeing to the East Kimberley being a trial site for the restricted debit card may seem to some a rather drastic step. However, it is our view that continuing to deliver the same programs we have delivered for the past 40 years will do nothing for our people and, besides wasting more time and money, will condemn our children and future generations to a life of poverty and despair. As leaders in the East Kimberley, we cannot accept this.' The leaders also urged federal members of parliament from all sides to: 'Listen to us on this matter and take a non-partisan position in order to allow this trial to proceed. We believe that this trial could be the catalyst for breaking the cycle of poverty and despair in the East Kimberley.'


When local leaders stand up and call for reform, parliamentarians should listen and respond, and that is what we are seeking to do here. The community harm statistics from the East Kimberley are also shocking. In a place such as Kununurra, the hospitalisation rate from assaults is 68 times the national average.


To effectively test whether a reduction in cash leads to a reduction in harm, 80 per cent of payments received by all people in the community receiving a working-age welfare payment such as Newstart allowance will be placed on the cashless debit card. The trial aims to support income-support recipients and is not Indigenous-specific. People who receive the age pension and veterans pension will not automatically be placed on the trial; however, they will be able to volunteer to participate in the trial if they wish.


Recognising that we do not live in a cashless society and that people need cash for minor expenses such as children's lunch money or bus fares, the remaining 20 per cent of the payments will be available for use at the person's discretion. The figure of 20 per cent cash was decided through consultation with communities.


The cashless debit card will work as similarly as possible to any other bank card. The card will work at all shops except those selling alcohol and gambling products. The only difference between this card and any other bank product is that it will not support cash withdrawals or allow the purchase of those products contributing to community harm. Restrictions on the withdrawal of cash will also help combat expenditure of welfare dollars on illicit drugs like ice which we know are devastating many communities across the nation. Participants in the trial will automatically receive an everyday mainstream debit card. Participants will have access to online banking, a mobile app and a customer call centre; this will give participants easy access to their bank balance and transaction histories and a simple way to report lost or stolen cards.


Participants will also have the option of receiving SMS alerts or mobile phone push alerts. These alerts will notify participants when money is received in their account, provide an updated balance after purchases over a particular amount and warn participants when their bank balance is getting low. All of these services will be available at no cost to the participants.


Community education workshops will be held before the trial commences in each location. At these workshops participants will be provided with information on how the card will work and how to use online services. These workshops will ensure participants are supported during transition to the trial. Because the card will work everywhere except at shops selling alcohol or gambling products, most merchants will not have to do anything to accept the new card. Retail staff will not require any additional training, and there will be no extra paperwork. If there is a business that sells alcohol or gambling products as well as other goods, they may still be able to enter into a contract to accept the card. This will involve agreeing to ensure their customers cannot use the card to buy these products. If a business only sells alcohol or gambling goods and services such as poker machines, sports wagering, keno and casino games, they will not be able to take part in the trial.


Government and the cashless card provider will work closely with merchants prior to and during trial implementation to ensure a smooth transition to the trials for merchants. The bill also empowers the minister to authorise community bodies in trial locations. An authorised community body will be able to reduce the percentage of a person's welfare payment that is placed on the cashless debit card. This recognises that the community has an important role to play in the trial and in encouraging socially responsible behaviour. It also supports community autonomy and reinforces that the trial is being community led.


An evaluation of the trial will be undertaken. The evaluation will contribute to a robust knowledge base and will explore the impact on levels of community harm following implementation of the trial. The evaluation will also canvas the opinions of trial participants, service providers and individuals in the community in order to develop our understanding of the influence of the trial on broader community functioning. Findings from the trial will make a vital contribution to future options for reducing community harm and dysfunction exacerbated by welfare fuelled alcohol and drug abuse at both individual and community levels.


The income management program and the BasicsCard in place across a range of locations throughout the nation is another valuable tool which helps to support individuals and families. It will continue for an additional two years, maintaining support for vulnerable people. Income management and the trial, however, will not be run in the same locations in Ceduna and any other trial site that is an existing income management location. Income management will be switched off before the trial starts.


We acknowledge that, for some people, using a debit card rather than cash to pay for everyday items will be an initial inconvenience. We do not underplay that. However, the potential upside is a transformed community where people are safer; less money is spent on alcohol, gambling and illicit drugs; and more money is available to support children and families. This trial has the support of communities which are desperate to try to curb the impact of alcohol and drug fuelled violence. For these reasons the government is very strongly of the view that it is a concept worth trialling. I think there is broad support for this concept around this chamber. I think colleagues around the chamber know that that which has been done before has not worked. We know what the outcomes will be if we just continue more of the same. It is important that we do test and trial another approach. I commend the bill to my colleagues.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Lines
):  The question is that this bill be now read a second time.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2,speech
"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2015-10-14,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (12:45):  A couple of weeks ago, the Leader of the Greens, Senator Di Natale, gave a nationally televised address to the National Press Club. He said that one of Australia's most important wealth- and export-generating industries, in his words, is 'on the way out'. No prize for guessing which industry he was talking about. It was the coal industry. Senator Di Natale said:


Thermal coal in Australia is in structural decline and no-one is more exposed than Australia.


…   …   …


… the Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis reported that our major export markets for thermal coal are disappearing and there are no new growth markets appearing on the horizon.


The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis is not an independent research body. It is a renewable energy think tank that is funded by large trusts such as The Rockefeller Foundation that have a history of opposing fossil fuels. Their work is not independent and, in this instance at least, it clearly does not accord with the facts. Their story on coal is a fairytale. This is not a matter of hiding a decline. The figures are all out there for everyone to see that our coal sector is not in decline. Last year, in fact, we produced and exported a record volume of coal. When it comes to this record performance of the Australian coal industry, the Greens party are acting like a bunch of denialists. 


Australian coal production was 491 million tonnes in 2014, an increase of almost five per cent on 2013 levels. Production volumes have been steadily rising over the past decade, with an increase in the average annual rate of more than three per cent over that period. Total volumes increased from 363 million tonnes in 2004 to 491 million tonnes in 2014, an average increase of around 13 million tonnes a year. If only the Greens' logic could be applied to my waistline! I have put on a few kilos in the last year, but according to the logic of the Greens I have actually lost weight—so happy days for me. Australia's coal export volumes are indeed expected to increase even further from this 400 million tonnes today to around 433 million tonnes over the next five years and will boost our national income by $200 billion. This growth means that Australia is forecast to overtake Indonesia as the world's largest coal exporter in 2017. But, of course, that does not mean that growth is always smooth or that prices will not fluctuate. Global coal prices have been at multiyear lows but they remain much higher than they were at the beginning of the century. That is the world of commodity prices. They are volatile.


Leading energy forecasters agree that the continued industrialisation and urbanisation of Asia will drive enduring growth in coal demand. The International Energy Agency estimates that the world will use one billion tonnes more coal in 2019 than today. It explicitly states that the danger of stranded assets for the coal industry is 'limited'. The IEA concludes that, even under its most stringent climate change policy scenarios, no oil or gas field currently in production would shut down prematurely, and only the oldest and least efficient coal mines would close. It also expects coal to continue to be the biggest single source of electricity generation. In 2030, coal is expected to fuel 10,200 terawatt hours of electricity, around 31 per cent of global generation and nearly twice as much as hydro, four times more than wind and eight times more than solar.


The conclusion of Australia's official energy forecaster is that China's energy and climate change policies are unlikely to result in a rapid shift away from coal. Australia's official energy forecaster said that it is unlikely that India will be able to cease thermal coal imports within the next three years as widely claimed. Certainly we have heard concerns about a short-term decline in coal demand but these are largely short-term issues. Growth estimates in Chinese coal use between 2012 and 2040 vary from 70 per cent in an MIT study done in 2014 to over 50 per cent in an International Energy Agency outlook study done a couple of years ago.


Even putting China aside, there is enormous potential for increased coal demand in other countries of Asia. I have here an audit that has been done of coal power stations either under construction or proposed for a selection of Asian countries. Those countries include India, Vietnam, South Korea, the Philippines and Taiwan. These are the plants that are under construction in Asia—more than 750 individual coal fired power units. Some of them are part of one station. They collectively amount to more than 500,000 megawatts of extra power capacity that is projected to be supplied from new suppliers of coal over the next few decades. All of these power stations. These are the facts that the Greens want to ignore. That increased amount of coal capacity—500,000 megawatts of extra coal fired power capacity in South East Asia—will mean that there will be an increased demand for coal of just under two billion tonnes per year to supply that capacity.


I go back to the figures I mentioned earlier. Currently in Australia we produce just shy of 500 million tonnes a year and we export just over 400 million tonnes a year. The increased demand swamps even our own total production of coal today. There will be an increased demand of two billion tonnes and that is not even including China. That is just South East Asia. We as a country only produce around 500 million tonnes today. We will not be able to meet that increased demand but we have an enormous opportunity to continue to increase coal production, as we have in the past 10 years, to help meet the burgeoning economies of South East Asia and to help them to deliver electricity to more of their peoples.


We also want to take that opportunity because we know that Australian coal is much more efficient than coal from other countries. Australian coal leads to lower carbon emissions for any given level of electricity generated. Australian black coal from Queensland is the most energy efficient in the world in terms of energy output per unit of coal burned. Therefore, the most efficient outcome for the world's environment is to use more of Queensland's coal and less coal from overseas countries. Australian thermal coal exports are of the highest quality coal found anywhere in the world, with an energy content above 5,500 kilocalories per kilogram, which compares favourably to Indonesian coal, which has an estimated range of between 4,200 and 5,200 kilocalories per kilogram. New mines in places like the Galilee Basin should be developed as quickly as possible. It would create jobs in Queensland and reduce emissions internationally.


So anti-coal activists trying to stop production in Australia are doing a disservice to the global environment. Even the international Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is on board with this view. It states that, without a clean coal solution, a global solution to climate change would be more than 130 per cent more expensive. It would push up mitigation costs and would likely lead to more people being in poverty. There will be lower economic growth and less opportunity to protect the natural environment. Last year, the Chair of the IPCC dismissed the idea that fossil fuels would become redundant. He said that new technologies will ensure that 'fossil fuels can continue to be used on a large scale'.


This ethical case for the use of fossil fuels is often overlooked. We should always remember that we are very lucky in this country. We are very lucky to all have access to cheap and affordable electricity, although it is a bit more expensive than it was in the past. According to the World Bank, over half of the world's population, around four billion people, have limited access to any energy at all, at any price. Rachel Kyte, who is the Vice President of the World Bank, said recently that over 1.2 billion people in the world are without access to any electricity, and most of them are concentrated in about a dozen countries in Africa and Asia. Another 2.8 billion rely on wood or other biomass for cooking and heating, resulting in indoor and outdoor pollution to which 4.3 million deaths a year are attributable. This energy poverty is contributing to these more than four million premature deaths, and we have a responsibility, as a country with great access to cheap, efficient and affordable forms of energy, to export those to those countries to help them prevent such deaths in the future. We should not deny the benefits to other nations that we have been able to benefit from, given our country's exploitation of fossil fuels.


As I said, we are a lucky country. We are a lucky country to have had these cheap and accessible energy sources close to our centres of population. They have helped drive the development of this country. They have helped put us where we are today. They have indeed given us the luxury of being able to better protect our environmental assets and have the resources and income to do so, and it is great that they have. The best solution to help improve the environment all around the world is to make sure that other countries have access to such energy in a cheap and affordable way. We have a choice. Either we can have cheap energy, or we will have cheaper wages for some of the poorest people in the world. I personally would choose cheap energy, high wages and coal.

Currently, there are about 600,000 subscribers. By the middle of 2018 we will be getting close to nine million people who will potentially have access. The NBN is on target to be fully rolled out by 2020.




Senator Moore:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order on direct relevance. The minister got to it before he sat down, but the question was specifically on time frames. It was not about numbers, but about the time frame and whether it has been increased from the previous process.



The PRESIDENT:  The minister was addressing the question.




Senator FIFIELD:
  As I was going to say, under the coalition's plan the NBN will be rolled out nationwide six to eight years earlier than would have been the case under those opposite. It is very interesting to note today that Mr Jason Clare has declared that it remains the Labor Party's intention to introduce a full fibre network. What that means is billions of dollars of additional costs and massive delays to the full completion of the NBN.

Under Senator Conroy's plan—the one which we all remember was worked out on the back of a coaster or an envelope on a VIP flight—the NBN was not going to be completed until 2028 and Labor's cost was going to be $20 billion to $30 billion more. Under the coalition the NBN will be rolled out, completed, six to eight years sooner than would be the case under those opposite. We are making sure that Australians will get the services that they want and that Australians will get the services that they need sooner and at a better price than those opposite. We wait to hear from Jason Clare and Mr Shorten on how they are going to fund a full fibre network.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:05):  That is a very important question, if I may say so. Overnight the Dutch Safety Board released the investigation report into the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 on 17 July last year. The report is the result of a meticulous forensic investigation, and Australia has been closely involved in that investigation through the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. The final report sets out compelling evidence indicating the type of missile and the launch site of the missile which brought down MH17. Its findings are based on a forensic technical analysis of all of the available evidence. It does not attribute responsibility for the incident. The report concludes that flight MH17 was brought down by a surface-to-air missile—to be precise, by a warhead fired from a Russian-made Buk surface-to-air missile system. It ruled out any other possible cause of the incident. The trajectory of the missile indicated that it was launched from within a 320 square kilometre area in eastern Ukraine.


I know it is difficult to find comfort for families in the face of this news. We continue to grieve for all 298 people on board, and in particular those who called Australia home. Our thoughts are with the families and loved ones of those victims as they process the findings of this report. The Australian government thanks the investigators for their very detailed and tireless work in establishing beyond doubt the cause of this outrage.

It is a crucial step in securing justice for all of the victims. The investigation is being coordinated by the Dutch prosecution service. The focus of the joint investigation team is to ensure that the investigation is thorough and robust. On 20 August I met with the Dutch Prosecutor General, Mr Bolhaar, when he and officials from the Dutch police and prosecution office came to Canberra to discuss investigations with the government and the Australian Federal Police, and I took the opportunity to assure them of the Australian government's full cooperation in the investigation.

We are deeply disappointed that Russia used its power as one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council to veto the draft resolution. Those responsible for crimes connected with the shooting down of MH17 will not, however, be able to hide behind the Russian veto, for the members of the JIT remain resolute that the perpetrators be held to account.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (15:03):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Communications (Senator Fifield) to a question without notice asked by Senator McAllister today relating to the National Broadband Network.


We know that recently there has been a change in the leadership of this country. We now have Malcolm Turnbull as the Prime Minister. He has said quite up-front that he believes his government is a government of the 21st century. Nothing could be further from the truth. I would respectfully suggest that he should revisit that statement. Quite clearly, some of the worst parts of the policies that were brought down by the Abbott government are still in place. You can change the leader, but you have not changed the policies. It is still the same terrible, out-of-touch, harsh policies that this government is carrying on with.


If you look at Mr Turnbull's own experience, we can see what he did about the rollout of the NBN when he was Minister for Communications. He has doubled the cost of the rollout of the NBN and given us less than half of the quality of service that the Australian community has demanded and deserves. He may have been a formidable opponent in the past, but what has overshadowed his performance has been the mistakes that he made in the communications portfolio.


We had a Labor government that initiated the rollout of the NBN. They set Tasmania up as the pilot state to have the first rollout. What has this government done? It has stopped or slowed down the rollout of the NBN, and is now saying to rural and regional Australia, 'You are only worthy of a second rate system that will cost more money and will take much longer to roll out.' That was the performance of the now Prime Minister when he was the Minister for Communications.


To top that off we have a failed assistant minister responsible for aged care now having the responsibility of the portfolio of communications. In his former responsibilities as assistant minister responsible for aged care we know that he did not have his eye on the ball for the last two years. He failed dismally in aged care. The sector knows that and the Australian community certainly knows that.


All I can say is that we on this side will continue to keep an eye on the new Minister for Communications, because this country cannot afford, and the economy cannot afford, to have another failure. We are expecting a greater performance when it comes to the rollout of the NBN. Quite seriously, the cost has blown out. From those on that side who harped and harped when they were in opposition, what have they delivered when it comes to the rollout of the NBN? A much slower service and a much, much more costly service.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Don't be silly.




Senator POLLEY:
  Senator Macdonald, I will take that interjection—because no-one listens to you. No-one listens to you. But as somebody who continually bleats in this chamber about representing the great state of Queensland you should be appalled by your government's record when it comes to rolling out the NBN in your home state. 


So that is what we are left with. That is the legacy of Mr Turnbull as communications minister.


Those on the other side who bleated and made all sorts of accusations about the time we changed our leadership when we were in government have done exactly the same thing. The only difference is that, on the other side, they have the same old policies and the same arrogance, believing that they know it all. They do not listen to the sectors. They do not take advice. The government might have changed leaders, but they certainly have not changed their policy priorities.


We know how important the NBN can be, will be and should be to the Australian economy. We know the benefit it will bring to the tourism industry. We heard the responses to Senator Bushby's question in, I would have to say, a very weak performance from the new minister for tourism, Senator Colbeck, when trying to promote the fantastic Tasmanian food and wine event tonight. He could not even sell that. We know the NBN has already delivered great outcomes for the Tasmanian economy, and Senator Bushby should be very much aware of that.


This is a government that is yet again failing the Australian people when it comes it to the rollout of the NBN. (Time expired)

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2015-10-14,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (15:08):  It is very difficult to follow Senator Polley in this chamber, particularly after that contribution, because it was like a random walk through an individual's thought bubbles. There were very few joining words or coherent linkages between one random thought bubble and another. They dealt with Senator Fifield, who of course was an outstanding minister for disability services, and no-one has disputed that in this place—



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator BERNARDI:
  except for Senator Polley, of course, who was saying how terrible he was. But the whole disability network were full of praise for him. They were effusive in their praise for Senator Fifield in that capacity. Senator Fifield is now taking that same rigor, that same discipline, into the communications portfolio. That is what has those on the other side so upset. Senator Polley is mortified that someone is going to do a better job than her hero, Senator Conroy. We know that, for a long time, Senator Polley has been a great admirer of Senator Conroy, but he was an abject disaster in the portfolio of communications. We know he had a penchant, if you will, for skiing—we knew that—and for hobnobbing with the big end of town, but that is not what we do. We get down to doing the tough work, the hard yards. We do not do our costings on a coaster in a private jet flying to the ski fields of Aspen.




Senator Fifield:
  I don't ski!




Senator BERNARDI:
  Senator Fifield does not ski—but he would be an excellent skier if he chose to do so! All I would say is that Senator Fifield, unlike Senator Conroy, is absolutely committed to delivering value for money and to delivering on time. To this government, it is not suitable or appropriate to pursue a massive agenda that has been cobbled together, literally on the back of a napkin or coaster on a private jet, between Senator Conroy and then Prime Minister Rudd that and that was going to commit this nation to tens of billions of dollars in costs. Over the last two years, the costs have been detailed and the appropriate cost-benefit analysis has been done, and we are delivering to the people of Australia what Australia can afford in order to upgrade us into the internet century.


I am one of the beneficiaries of the NBN, I have to say—much to the chagrin of the other side! I am quite diligent in my communications via the internet, including setting up various appropriate organisations that will facilitate political discourse in this country. The NBN is a fantastic service. It is an extraordinary service that has been delivered to my house, to my neighbours, to my suburb and to my community by the Abbott and Turnbull governments. The beautiful thing about it is that it allows my family, like every other family in the street, to access content-rich media, the requirements of work practices and the new transmissions of digital content on demand and video on demand et cetera in a manner which was hitherto unavailable to us. Rolling out that sort of technology—developing it and delivering it on time in an efficient manner—has been a priority of this government, and I for one am absolutely delighted with it. 


I regret that Senator Polley was not able to put aside politics and her personal and partisan attacks to celebrate the fact that we now have a minister in charge of communications who has applied himself so diligently to what has sometimes been a fraught area of policy concern in terms of how we were going to manage to deliver the maximum benefits to people with disabilities, those most in need. He has dealt with that in an exemplary manner. If we can do that in other areas of policy—and, in this regard, it is up to ministers like Senator Fifield to deliver—the nation will be much, much better off.


So, rather than petty point-scoring, using trumped-up numbers and expressing confected outrage, as Senator Polley just did, I urge the opposition to join the government in delivering for the people of Australia. I urge and encourage them to be positive about the opportunities that are before us, because our priorities for the country should be the same. They are about the economy. They are about delivering jobs. They are about delivering infrastructure. That is what is important to the people of Australia. It is a pity it is not important to the opposition. (Time expired)

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2015-10-14,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales) (15:13):  I rise to also take note of Senator Fifield's answers to my questions about the NBN. Unhappily, those answers confirm what most concerns us on this side of the chamber, which is that the big promises that were made about the NBN, a very cheap NBN with a very high level of service and a very high level of penetration that could be delivered by the then Minister for Communications—who knew everything about the internet!—have absolutely failed to materialise.




Senator Kim Carr:
  He invented it!




Senator McALLISTER:
  He did invent the internet, as Senator Carr observes!




Senator Fifield:
  I thought that was Al Gore!




Senator McALLISTER:
  Unhappily for Senator Bernardi—and I enjoy Senator Bernardi's contributions—these are not trumped up numbers. These are numbers that are available in the public domain. These are numbers that were presented to all of us when nbn co released its corporate plan earlier this year. The particular numbers that interest us most, of course, are that, despite the promise that all homes will be connected by 2016, we now learn that that level of penetration of high-speed broadband will not occur until 2020. We also know that—despite the promise that this could be undertaken for $29½ billion dollars—it could now cost as much as $56 billion. The rollout that is projected in the corporate plan sees a very, very gentle start and then a very, very fast ramp up, coincidentally, just after the next election, when it seems that the nbn co intends to connect most of Australia within just a couple of years. I suggest to people here who are observing the progress of this project that those claims really do stretch credibility. I politely suggest to the new Minister for Communications that he examine very closely the assumptions that underpin that rollout, because my very great concern is that that will be yet another promise that is not able to be delivered to the Australian people.


The very great shame about all of this is that Australia's international competitiveness is absolutely dependent on us making this project work. Even in our region we see our closest neighbours, our trading partners, making very great investments and pursuing the very kind of project—the very kind of excellent NBN—that Labor envisaged. What are South Korea pursuing? They are pursuing fibre to the premises. What are Japan pursuing? Fibre to the premises. What are Singapore pursuing? Fibre to the premises. In New Zealand, where they have fibre to the node, they are working swiftly to replace it with fibre to the premises.


As our shadow minister for communications, Jason Clare, told the CommsDay conference just today, two years ago Australia ranked 30th for average peak connection speed. That was just two years ago. We are now ranked 47th. We are falling behind in our connection speed and, again, when we look around our region, we see that, for peak connection speed, the No. 1 spot is held by Singapore. The No. 3 spot is held by South Korea. The No. 4 spot is held by Japan. The US, Canada and most of Europe are ahead of us. We are falling behind, and it is my very great concern that—in a desperate attempt to justify the decisions that were made by the former communications minister—this government is not addressing a very significant problem that is coming towards us as a country.


We know that there is significant research that links internet penetration and internet speed to economic growth, economic productivity and innovation. Internet penetration and internet speed help in so many ways. They work by facilitating the adoption of more efficient business processes, by accelerating innovation and by introducing new consumer applications and services, and they lead to efficiencies by better linking different parts of the economy—different labour pools, raw materials and different businesses to one another. 


But we are missing out. We are at risk of missing out, because the former communications minister—who is, of course, now the Prime Minister—thought that he knew best. He thought that he could change horses midstream and that, through his own understanding of the industry, he could deliver this. Of course, what we are seeing is that the project—based on old technology based on copper—is not proceeding at the speed that is required, and it is a very great shame for this country.

"Edwards, Sen Sean",LP,2015-10-14,"



Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (15:18):  I also rise to speak on the motion to take note of answers given by Senator Fifield to questions from Senator McAllister earlier. Before I move on to my comments I will suggest that Senator McAllister moves out of the densely populated area in which she lives and comes and has a look around the state in which I live and at places like Buckleboo, Cummins and Roxby Downs, where connecting fibre to the premises—under the plan that Mr Clare announced today—is simply fantasy. Fantasy is exactly what you have to consider in terms of how this opposition would seek to govern if it were ever entrusted to do so. 


Does the shadow communications minister talk to the shadow Treasurer about how they are going to cost this fantasy? The published nbn co 2016 corporate plan forecast that an all-fibre-line build would require a peak funding of somewhere between $74 billion and $84 billion. Quite honestly, given the earlier musings of previous minister for communications Senator Conroy of $40 billion, that number is somewhat fanciful. Extra civil works required for fibre to the home would cost tens of billions of dollars more and take vastly more time to finish—Australians would wait some 10 years longer if these operations of the NBN were taken up. 


Senator McAllister mentioned countries like Japan, South Korea and Singapore. I must remind Senator McAllister that those countries are highly populated with areas no bigger than the Wimmera in Victoria—the size of Gippsland in this country. We are an island nation sparsely populated all around the coastal regions, which is why it is so exciting that we have just seen the launch on 1 October of the new NBN satellite, Sky Muster. 


Sky Muster is the first of two satellites built to deliver fast broadband to outback Queensland, outback New South Wales and outback Western Australia—all the remote areas in Australia. It was launched from French Guiana on the 1st and will be in place tomorrow. From there on out—they call it 'parking the satellite'—it will be tested from the 15th until March next year. They will ensure that all the retail services—all the services which are going to be so important to education and to ensuring that we have medical services delivered to those regional areas—will be in place. The entire Australian mainland, Tasmania and five other islands—Christmas, Cocos, Lord Howe, Norfolk and Macquarie—will be covered by this satellite. 


This is what this coalition government does: it gets things done. It does not talk about it. It does not put fanciful operational plans in place that are unfunded and unlikely to ever be part of what this country will see. It is a bit like now when you see the shadow minister for defence—the minister for communications in a previous government—talking about submarines and shipbuilding and all that. It is gay abandon, no corporate responsibility and corporate welfare everywhere. It is just the unfunded recklessness that we have come to understand about the way in which the Labor Party operate. They are, frighteningly, the alternative government in this country. The NBN's uniform national approach is a good system. It will roll out on time. It will deliver to 10 million customers in gig time, and I am surprised it was question No. 1 today. (Time expired)

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2015-10-14,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:23):  The Prime Minister has again broken a promise, and here I want to talk about Tasmania and the NBN. His solemn promise to Tasmania was that existing NBN contracts would be honoured. That includes the master contract that would deliver a fibre-to-the-premises network across the state. 


On the 17 August 2013 in The Examiner,Mr Turnbull confirmed a previous pledge to honour all existing contracts signed by NBN Co to roll out fibre to the premises in Tasmania. He said: 


…the alternative would be to breach them and that is a course we would not countenance …


I want to talk specifically about the West Coast of Tasmania. The West Coast of Tasmania faces twin challenges of geographic isolation and the need to build a diverse economic base. To achieve this, they need the fibre-to-the-premises broadband that was planned by the Labor government. When we were in government, we planned to have fibre to the premises to Queenstown, Zeehan and Rosebery. Those are the three major centres on the West Coast of Tasmania. What this government has now promised them is satellite. Satellite is fine. It is great for small remote areas—it operates quite well—but not for vital regional hubs, which these communities are. In fact, not only is it vital for the West Coast to have a proper NBN service of fibre to the premises, which is what was promised; it is economically sensible to do that. This is a region that has gone through a very difficult time over the past 12 or so months, with two mine closures, hundreds of jobs going out of that town and the town crying out for economic diversity to look beyond the mining industry to what other opportunities they can provide to the people who not only live in their region but also who want to come and live in their region or visit their region. But, more importantly, it is for businesses to build their base and for business coming out of that region. 


One of the things that the West Coast Council has done is develop a West Coast Community Plan up to 2025. They did that in consultation with the entire community. It features a number of broad aspects, but there is one particular section in it that talks about our economy. In that section it talks about a sustainable, dynamic and resilient business sector. In that section it also talks about identifying opportunities to improve access to broadband and wireless technologies for business. The West Coast needs these sorts of things. They need it for e-health. They need it to diversify their economy and to grow business and jobs. 


There are also emerging businesses on the West Coast. Last week, I attended an industry conference on the West Coast. There were about 10 speakers at that industry conference, and most of those speakers again focused on a proper NBN service for the West Coast to be able to deal with the business needs within that community. There is a lot that could be offered in that community. Mayor Phil Vickers and the general manager, Dirk Dowling, thought the best thing that they could do was to go up and talk to the local member, Mr Brett Whiteley. So off they went up the coast—about a 3½ hour drive—to visit Mr Whiteley on a Monday morning. They had a reasonable discussion, I understand, about NBN. But what he said to them was: 'Try the satellite. If, after six months, it is no good then come back to me.' That is no security for business. There is no future in that for this region to try and diversify. It is just simply not good enough that a member of parliament who represents a region that is going through a specifically difficult time could contemplate not even trying to fight for that region in providing them with a proper NBN service. 


The service that is being offered to them via the satellite will not work on the West Coast. It simply will not work there, because it is a vital regional hub. Also, satellite broadband in that area is prone to failure and service disruption in heavy rain conditions. The West Coast averages 2,450 millimetres of rain a year. So it is just not acceptable.

That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



Today I introduce the Defence Legislation Amendment (First Principles) Bill 2015 to amend the Defence Act 1903.


In 2013 the Government made an election commitment to deliver a First Principles Review of Defence. The report on this Review was released on 1 April 2015. The Review determined that while Defence has an outstanding operational record, it is clear that there needs to be a better balance between operational excellence and organisational effectiveness.


To achieve this better balance, the Government has begun one of the most significant reform efforts to ensure Defence delivers the capabilities we need to ensure Australia is safe and secure.


The Government engaged a number of prominent and experienced individuals to conduct the First Principles Review. The Review made 76 recommendations, 75 of which were agreed or agreed-in-principle by the Government. We are committed, and the Defence senior leadership is committed, to delivering on these recommendations.


This requires Defence to move from its current, inefficient, federated approach, into a single, integrated organisation that delivers enhanced joint capability.


A key recommendation of the Review was to 'establish a strong, strategic centre to strengthen accountability and top level decision making' in Defence. As part of the focus on the joint force, this Review highlighted the need to update legislation to formally acknowledge the key role played by the Chief of the Defence Force (the CDF) and the Vice Chief of the Defence Force (the VCDF) in the modern Australian Defence Force.


This Bill amends the Defence Act to formally recognise the authority of the CDF and the VCDF so that:


The CDF will have full command of the Australian Defence Force by removing the legislative limitations on the CDF's command power;


The VCDF will be recognised as the 'Deputy' of the CDF. This amendment will clarify that the VCDF has command responsibilities as well as administrative responsibilities in relation to the Defence Force as directed by the CDF; and


The Service Chiefs will be explicitly subject to the direction of the CDF. A legislative amendment removing their statutory authority will ensure absolute clarity of the CDF's command and authority.



This Bill seeks to make some other changes to streamline the legislative foundation of the Australian Defence Force.



In addition to strengthening the command roles of the CDF and the VCDF, the Bill also streamlines the statutory treatment of the components of the Australian Defence Force in the Defence legislation, repealing the Naval Defence Act 1910 and the Air Force Act 1923, incorporating the substantive provisions of these Acts in the Defence Act 1903.


These provisions include the recognition of the Regular Army, the Permanent Air Force, and the Permanent Navy, together with the reserve components of each of the services, and the ability of the Governor-General to call out the Australian Defence Force Reserves under certain circumstances. These circumstances include: wartime; peacekeeping operations; support to community activities of national or international significance and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.


Finally, the Bill also consolidates the statutory treatment of Defence Force Cadets, making provision for the Australian Navy, Army and Air Force Cadets in a new part of the Defence Act. The Bill also modernises the existing provisions to ensure the relationship between Defence Force Cadets and the Defence community is interlinked. The Bill also makes it clear that the Defence Force Cadets are a volunteer, community based youth development organisation. These provisions include the stipulation that cadets, and their instructors and officers, are volunteers and not members of the Australian Defence Force, not officials for the purpose of the Public Governance and Performance Act 2014 and are administered by the CDF.


Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.

  The government will not be opposing the motion put forward by Senator Wang. The government notes that it is already taking action to ensure the fairness and equity of the GST distribution to the states and territories. As part of this, the government continues to work with the state and territory governments around the distribution of GST revenue. The government continues to monitor the fairness of GST distribution and takes action to ameliorate inequitable outcomes when these arise. For example, the Commonwealth government provided Western Australia with funding of $499.1 million in the 2015-16 budget to assist with infrastructure projects given the fiscal difficulties faced by the state during the previous financial year. The government also notes the principle of horizontal fiscal equalisation is currently being considered as part of the Reform of Federation white paper process, which will see a thorough and detailed review of the existing framework for distribution of the GST.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2015-10-14,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (15:55):  Today we have seen an unbelievable short-sighted attack by crossbench senators on the future of the Murray-Darling water system. Apart from the blindingly obvious point that, without a healthy environment everywhere, no farm anywhere can be viable, the bipartisan progress already made on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan proves beyond doubt that all of its stakeholders can plan together and work together on multiple priorities to achieve multiple outcomes. 


But, in their press conference this morning, those six crossbench senators claimed that this parliament needs to choose—that it needs to choose between either farmers or the environment. Those of us on this side of the chamber do not believe that you have to choose. In fact, you can walk and chew gum at the same time. But these crossbench senators have unwittingly highlighted the abyss of disarray and division—which we all know is there—into which the coalition has now drowned. They call for full responsibility for water, including water being stored to save the Murray-Darling Basin, to be placed in the unsteady hands—very unsteady hands, if I might say so—of a maverick Nationals minister, which would constitute a major blow to the health of the Murray-Darling Basin when combined with their demands to amend the Water Act and for the Basin Plan to be paused. These are possibilities dangerous enough to catch the breath of every South Australian and all Australians that support a healthy river system and a viable farming community.


Minister Joyce's reckless approach is not one which properly guards agriculture's long-term interests, nor does it balance the environment and production interests. His approach unsettles the consensus and will make it hard to secure support for even the most modest yet necessary and acceptable reforms. So let us be crystal clear. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan has bipartisan support at the federal level and has the support of the basin states—South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and the ACT—and importantly also has the support of the farming, environmental and Indigenous groups. There is no doubt that not everyone got everything they wanted from the plan. We know that. But it does remain supported—why? Because it is an excellent example of the sort of negotiated compromise that defines effective governance in this country. The Basin Plan will set basin-wide sustainable diversion limits and return 2,750 gigalitres to the environment. The basin states are required to prepare water resource plans that will give effect to the sustainable diversion limits from July 2019. 


Around two million people live and work in the basin in communities ranging from fewer than 1,000 people to large urban centres such as Wagga Wagga, with over 45,000 people. A further 1.2 million people—




Senator Heffernan:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I just want to express my regret for not getting on the speakers list for this—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Back
):  What is your point of order, Senator Heffernan?




Senator Heffernan:
  because most of this is political bullshit, and all the speeches that follow will be. The person in charge of the weather is Mother Earth.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Heffernan, resume your seat. That is not a point of order. Senator Singh, please resume.




Senator SINGH:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. A further 1.2 million people depend on its waters to survive. This is so important to those communities. The health of the river channels themselves and the flora and fauna they support are not only vital in their own right but also vital for the economic and social wellbeing of basin communities. We have seen the devastating impact a lack of environmental flows has had on the basin over the past 100 years or more. And, with that knowledge, we must never return to the days where water allocations are based on politics rather than science. If the Prime Minister gives full responsibility for water to Minister Joyce, we will be witnessing the remarkable outcome of the previous Prime Minister having stronger and more principled environmental credentials than the current Prime Minister—a Prime Minister who should know better and care more, considering that he was in fact once the Minister for the Environment and Water.


Labor is committed to the delivery of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan is the only key we can turn that will return our most important river system to health. If we do not turn that key, there will not be a healthy river system. Without a healthy river system we will lose our sustainable communities and industries in the Murray-Darling Basin. The success of the Basin Plan is critically important for Australia. Its success is dependent on the continuing support of the two major parties and the basin states, who I recall all reconfirmed that support just weeks ago during the debate on the Water Amendment Bill. This was another example of the good policy outcomes in extremely complicated areas that can be secured through reasoned debate; when everyone with an interest in the issue can have confidence in the system and the decision-making process.


It should not be up to Labor alone to keep reinforcing the need for bipartisanship and a strong Murray-Darling Basin Plan. The crossbench senators should be aware that there has been significant and ongoing Commonwealth investment that ensures farms remain productive as the plan is delivered. Crossbench senators should understand that there has been significant commitment to the Basin Plan and to the health of our rivers and the ecosystems and communities they support. The government should confirm unambiguously that on its side of this chamber this significant commitment to the plan remains. Short-sighted attacks on the future of the Murray-Darling Basin water system must be dismissed.


Desperate attempts like those that have been made by Minister Joyce to claw at the Prime Minister's attention must be ignored—and that is all that is going on here with the crossbench senators. The government must share the load, overcome its self-induced confusion and division and stop considering options that undermine public perceptions of its commitment to the plan or reduce and confuse stakeholder confidence in the plan, its processes and outcomes—because that is what you will do.


Labor is calling on the Prime Minister to stand firm on his bipartisan position on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan for the sake of the farmers, for the sake of the environment and for the sake of the communities. Do not change the longstanding bipartisan commitment that we have for the Murray-Darling.

Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (16:03):  I rise with pleasure to speak on the subject of water policy. I am amazed that the Labor Party is game enough to talk about water. Senator Singh should realise that, when we were in opposition, the shadow minister for water, then Senator Joyce, actually worked with then Minister Burke to get bipartisan position—the reason being that then Minister Burke was having discussions with none other than Senator Hanson-Young from the Greens from South Australia, who wanted 6,000 gigs taken out of the water system in the Murray-Darling Basin.


Let's talk about what Senator Wong did when she was the water minister. We know what sort of a finance minister she was. Before the auction of Toorale Station in north-west New South Wales, Senator Wong bought Toorale Station for—how much?—a total of $23.7 million. That was to get water into the Murray-Darling system; to get water down the Murray. She paid $23.7 million for the property—way over its value, I might add—and the property had cattle on it. The department said, 'We want those cattle off the property,' and the owner said, 'Righto, $700,000 and I will move them.' So they threw in another $700,000 for them to take their cattle off the property. How ridiculous is this whole situation! There were ring tanks there that had a heritage order on them. So they could not remove the ring tanks—and that just stores the water back. So there were 93,000 hectares of National Park ready to burn that was full of wild pigs, feral goats and you name it, and no water was going into the Murray. That was Senator Wong's first great move on getting water into the Murray.


Then she went to the Twynam Pastoral Company, the Kahlbetzer family, and paid $303 million of taxpayers' money or borrowed money to run more water down the Murray. One of those properties is on the Gwydir River, up where I live. When the Gwydir River is in flood, guess where the water runs. It runs out of the Gwydir wetlands; it does not run into the Murray—but the Kahlbetzer family said, 'Thank you very much for the cheque.' Then there was Jemalong Station on the Lachlan River. I have harvested wheat there. It is a nice property. It is a good irrigation property. They buy the water back off that, when once in a hundred years—once in a lot longer than a blue moon—the Lachlan runs water into the Murray. They paid $303 million for water buybacks that never put water into the Murray. This is ridiculous! Why the Labor Party would raise this matter of public importance on the issue of water when the fact is that then shadow minister, Senator Barnaby Joyce, worked with then Minister Burke to bring about the bipartisan plan is beyond me.


What we need is a triple bottom line: social, economic and environment. That is why I am very pleased with the agreement that the National Party put in place with Prime Minister Turnbull when he was elected. My leader, Mr Truss, made it quite clear back in January at our meeting at Wodonga that, if there were to be a change of Prime Minister, there would have to be a new agreement with the National Party, because Mr Truss, as Deputy Prime Minister, had signed a letter to the Governor-General saying that he would support Mr Abbott as Prime Minister. This was part of the agreement: water back to agriculture—as it was when Mr Truss himself was agriculture minister and controlled water, and as it is in New South Wales with the Hon. Niall Blair, the agriculture minister and water minister—the two go together.


It was a bipartisan agreement to have the water savings in the Murray—as I said before, set up by then Minister Burke and opposition spokesman for water, former Senator Barnaby Joyce. We have a situation where Labor are talking about water in the Murray and the health of the Murray, which is quite amazing. Remember, the Murray is never going to be the river it used to be, and I will tell you why: man intervened with it. Mother Nature looked after the Murray for hundreds of thousands—perhaps millions—of years. We came along. We put in a barrage in South Australia at the Lower Lakes. We put in the locks. We put in the dams—and even the Greens are not talking about taking them out and giving the river back to Mother Nature. No matter what happens, the Murray will never be the river that Mother Nature made who knows how long ago. 


For Senator Wong and the Labor Party to be talking about water when they made such a monumental mess of the management—fancy paying $23.7 million for a property that was worth about $16 million at the time. When they bought it, they did not even look at the property. The department did not ever go and see the property. They bought it unseen: 'We've got to get those cattle off, so here's another $700,000 to move the cattle.' If someone was going to buy my property and said, 'Yes, I'll give you $200,000 to get the sheep off.' Good: I would sell the sheep, keep the money and get another $200,000. That is how outrageous this whole situation is.


We have the opposition, the Labor Party, in this debate leading with their chin. They must be suffering severe amnesia and have forgotten what they did when they were in government and the monumental mess they made of the whole scheme. Keep it going. We will look after the water, and I hope Minister Joyce has it very soon.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2015-10-14,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (16:08):  I rise to participate in this debate today as a senator from South Australia. Of course it is my home state that bears the brunt when politics gets in the way and upstream states decide that they would prefer to take more water out than allow water to run through the system as the environment requires. By the time you get down to South Australia, there is very little flow left. 


For years we have been overallocating the river system over and over again—so much so that we got to a point in the last decade where more water was being taken out of the river than was going in through rainfall and run-off. It is outrageous for anybody to suggest that, despite everything that has happened—the negotiations that have happened in this place and the consultations with communities elsewhere—that we put a hold on reforming the river system. 


We cannot keep going in this the way. We need to change business as usual. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan is in place now. Even at this stage it is not at what the science suggested as a bare minimum. The politics of this place and the play-offs between the different states meant that the environment lost out at the end of those negotiations. It is time that we started to understand it.


We heard from Senator Day during question time that the climate is drying and we are heading into a drought period. Of course climate change means we need more water conservation for everybody. The ridiculous idea of trying to play with the Murray-Darling Basin Plan now—rather than increasing the amount of allocations that are going to be to the environment to keep it healthy for the future to ensure that our mighty Murray keeps flowing—and that the plan delivers too much is that it did not even take into consideration the impact of climate change. That is how foolish the politicians in this and the other place were when they struck a deal that cut out and blinded the Murray-Darling Basin Plan from even building into it—and accepting and understanding—a response to climate change. 


We are already seeing the levels in the Lower Lakes in South Australia starting to drop. We are already hearing from communities along the lower stretches that salinity levels are rising again. We never got the full flush that we needed when the drought broke only three years ago anyway. Why? Because more water continues to be taken out, but we hear from the coalition, 'Let's just ensure that we prioritise everybody else but the environment.' It does not work like that. If you do not have a living river, nobody is able to use it. If you do not have a living river, you have got nothing left over—not just for now, not just for the medium term but for future generations. 


I cringed at the idea of Minister Joyce being given responsibility for the Murray-Darling Basin. I cringed as a South Australian, because I remember what he said when it was the driest river in South Australia in decades. Do you know what he did? He came to Adelaide and said, 'Oh well, if you want more water, you should move upstream to where it is.'


I tell you what: I like Adelaide, thank you very much, Minister Joyce. I like it so much I will be staying in South Australia. I am not packing up, and neither are my South Australian colleagues, my community or my electorate going to pack up and move to Queensland, because you want to dictate as the minister who should get access to the water and who should not. 


It is laughable that Minister Joyce is going to be responsible for dictating who gets access to water in the Murray-Darling Basin system and who does not, because we know he does not give a damn about those further downstream. We need to make sure we start protecting the river for the future.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2015-10-14,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (16:13):  I too rise to make a contribution on this matter of public importance. I think it is worthwhile just recapping in the short time we have available what is actually at stake. We know that, as far back as July 1997, the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council introduced a permanent cap on the volume of water which could be diverted from rivers for uses such as irrigation. In 2007, the Commonwealth intervened to address the overallocation and established the Murray-Darling Basin Authority That had the charters to develop and implement a Basin Plan to include sustainable diversion limits. CSIRO advised the MDBA about the future climate scenarios for use in modelling future water use and yield from the catchments in the Basin Plan. Under the Water Act 2007, the MDBA is responsible for planning the integrated management of water resources of the Murray-Darling Basin. Then we know that on 22 November 2012 the Murray-Darling Basin Plan was signed into law.


If it is true that Mark Twain said, 'Whiskey is for drinking; water is for fighting over,' then that was a culmination of a decade or more of pretty strong negotiations involving governments of all political persuasions, involving state and federal responsible entities to get something into place that we could sit down and put into practice. Of course, there is the rub. The challenge of whoever looks after water will be to put into practice—on the best advice possible—the agreed position and to manage the environment, return some water to the river and manage the social cohesion and economic fabric of those irrigators right along the river. South Australia is to be credited, and amongst the best advice I have had is that they initiated drip watering and took responsible water positions. Despite advice to move up the river, they decided to stay and just get more efficient. What we clearly have here is a political situation involving the termination of a first-term Liberal Prime Minister—the first time in the history of that party that they have taken such an action.




Senator Williams:
  You've got a bit of history on it!




Senator GALLACHER:
  Our history is on the record, Senator Williams. I was just merely making the observation that you have not got a lot of history on it.


Anyway, in the event that you did have to do a deal—some of you had to do a deal to save respective parts of your electorates—basically we want to know: have the Nationals been given control of water? Answers to repeated questions to the good Senator Colbeck indicate that it is work in progress. The best summation of the three or four questions that he has attempted to answer is that it is a work in progress and that we do not know who has got responsibility for water. But we do know that if it has been traded off in a factional deal—despite the fact that you do not have any factions!—to keep the largest faction, the Nationals, in the tent and they have got power over water, then we would like all of the agreed positions, from 1997 all the way up to 2012, not only to be honoured but also to be implemented.


I said the other day, in taking note of answers to questions without notice, that Dr Horne made the comment that we know very clearly that there is a lot at stake here. I just want to put on the record what is at stake. James Horne, the inaugural chair of the Murray-Darling Basin Officials Committee said:


… merging the two portfolios—


agriculture and water—


could have several important implications.


Dr Horne said the job of implementing the Murray-Darling Basin Plan would fall to Joyce as agriculture minister, and that would be 'anything but straightforward'.


It involves implementing water planning in a comprehensive way that has never been seen before in the Basin. This planning is a key element to ensuring an end to the environmental degradation seen in many areas of the Basin in recent decades.


There we have the issue: is one of the best conservative politicians in Australia, who, on occasion, has been known to say whatever in respect of his constituencies—in his time in the Senate he was not shy about actually voting against the position that his government held—to take a position on behalf of the whole Murray-Darling Basin and manage it in accordance with the agreed position, or will he take a short-term view to please his constituents?


We have seen very clearly in areas of rural Australia that there has been concern about coal seam gas mining, there has been concern about the mining of coal—the Shenhua mine comes to mind—and we know there have been very strong, deeply felt and widely held positions in rural communities about this. Any minister in this space is going to be unpopular somewhere. The challenge for him or her is whether they can put the best interests of the Murray-Darling Basin—the environment, the sustainability of the river, the social cohesion, the economic opportunities—together and take the best position for Australia, not in a short-term political way or a partisan political way. That is going to be the challenge for whoever takes up this position and responsibility for water. And, as I said, if it has been traded in a factional way for short-term advancement so that someone could become Prime Minister or someone could be ousted as Prime Minister, then I am not sure that is a good indicator of how this extremely important issue of Australia's national policy will be.


I was part of the debate where the party further to our left advocated for greater flows—when we did the analysis the people in the Riverland may have had to move to higher ground on occasion—and I know that these are really difficult issues. They need bipartisanship, if we can get that. They will need strong and clear leadership. It must be abundantly clear to the Prime Minister that someone needs to be given the responsibility of water. They need to uphold the agreed position of the states, uphold the agreed position of the federal government, work to improve environmental sustainability of the Murray-Darling Basin—our part of it and the whole of the Murray River—and, importantly, the agreed position also needs to deliver a fair and just outcome for South Australia. We will fully be up to the task of keeping whoever the water minister eventually gets to be up to those challenges.

"Edwards, Sen Sean",LP,2015-10-14,"



Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (16:21):  I rise to contribute to the debate on this matter of public importance, the government's water policy. It seems like a bit of a beat-up to me, quite opportunistic in some ways, because of the change of leadership. We are now the Turnbull government and we are settling the right people into the portfolios where they can engage their constituency. It is as if all of a sudden it is 'down tools' at the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, just because we are changing ministries and departments and reorganising it so it is better set for the future. Neil Andrew, who chairs the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, and the people who are on the authority are doing a very good job. I have been recently appointed to the Select Committee on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Senator Gallacher is quite right when he talks about the agreements that go back to 1997, where the caps were put in, and the formation of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority in 2007. The work of these good people is now just getting underway. I give credit where credit is due. Mr Craig Knowles, a former representative in the New South Wales Labor government, did good work on this across south-eastern Australia, so much so that we now have, by what looks to be 2019, a sustainable diversion limit emerging from what has been a very good Basin Plan.


When you have an El Nino, people get excited, and quite rightly, about the allocation of water, which is the very lifeblood of the inland regions. I have been there and I understand how important it is, on the Murray, the Darling and all of that river system down through there. When you get talk of another drought, you return yourself to the position we were in in 2007, when we had the Millennium Drought. I understand that because I am an irrigator and I did, like everybody, suffer restrictions on water. I also bought water for $1,200 a megalitre. You cannot make money when you are sustaining your permanent crops in that way. So I am very sensitive to the issue of water. But we have to get over what happened. In 1997, as Senator Gallacher rightly pointed out, there was a cap introduced, and that was because the states—and every state is guilty of this—overallocated the resources which were available to them. Different governments, of all different persuasions, over the decades post war overallocated their water resources. There is no question about that. And now the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, the grown-up authority, the one charged with fixing the basin system, is doing exactly that. 


There is no question that, when they come into this period of time where profitability is threatened, people get animated. We are seeing that playing out in the hearings that are going on in the Senate inquiry into the Murray-Darling Basin. We have to remember that two million tonnes of salt has to make its way to the ocean, so the Murray-Darling Basin Authority has to ensure that that goes through the Murray mouth, through Lake Alexandrina, through the Chowilla lakes. It starts with Dartmouth, it is stored in Hume and all the way along there are a series of lakes. We have to understand that the Murray-Darling Basin Authority have to be well administered. They will cope for a week without somebody coming and knocking on their door and answering to a minister. This is a beat-up, an absolute beat-up. The authority are doing the work that successive governments have put them there to do. Of course commercial pressure will come at times when El Ninos are being talked about on our television screens and on the radio and where profitability will be compromised—because you cannot replace rain. No bit of legislation, no law, no regulation, will ever replace rain. For the Turnbull government, in its infancy, to be accused of being in any way derelict in its duty—it is doing the thing it should do most and that is appoint the right people to the right jobs.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2015-10-14,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (16:26):  Today the opposition is suggesting that the government is in disarray over water policy. The disarray being experienced in basin communities, I can assure the Senate, is bipartisan in origin. The coalition and Labor own the Water Act and the Basin Plan, having supported both in this place. I chair the current Select Committee on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. We have heard stories from people who are suffering from over a decade of one-sided water reform. It is not just farmers. In fact, it is quite likely that farmers are not the main victims. It is agribusinesses of all kinds, people who sell rural supplies, seeds, pipes, fertilisers. It is people who sell and service machinery. It is people who work in shops. It is schoolteachers and nurses. It is people that most senators in this place will never meet and never plan on meeting.


Some of the people we spoke to were in tears. They are competent businesspeople who have put their life savings into businesses they started in good faith, in towns that depend on irrigation, only to have their lifeblood taken away through no fault of their own. Families, farms, businesses and whole communities are on the brink. We have heard stories of farmers who have ended their lives and we hear that the welfare of many people is hanging by a thread. Nobody is arguing there should not be change to the way we use and conserve water, but it is clear the changes to date are not fair, equitable or balanced. Too much water is being taken with scant consideration for the social and economic costs to people.


Everybody accepts that the environment needs more water than it was getting in the Millennium Drought. This is now happening. However, the environment benefits when it gets enough water. A cycle of drought and flood is entirely natural in the Murray-Darling Basin. The idea that our inland rivers should always be full is not natural; it is an aesthetic ideal espoused by dangerous imbeciles. There is no benefit in always keeping the rivers full and providing more water than the environment needs. We are seeing the result of a water plan developed in panic during the worst drought for a hundred years, rather than a measured and balanced approach to water use. Three months ago, when I attended a public meeting at Barham on the Murray River, there were a thousand people unhappy, frustrated and looking for answers. They told me that the price of temporary water was $120 a megalitre, up from $40 three years previously, and they were going broke. The price of temporary water this week hit an unprecedented $300 a megalitre. Like everyone we have spoken to, I accept that the environment of the Murray-Darling Basin should be looked after, but it is time for the government to take off the blinkers and realise that people are part of the environment. What we have is bipartisan disarray, bipartisan ignorance and bipartisan callous disregard for the welfare of people that we senators are supposed to safeguard. An environment in which people are suicidal is not a healthy environment. I urge the government to lift allowable water use or stop water buybacks while the select committee does its work and to transfer responsibility for water in full to the agriculture minister. Australia's agriculture should not be sacrificed on the altar of false environmental gods.

"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2015-10-14,"



Senator McEWEN
 (South Australia—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:31):  In 2012, after more than a century of interstate disagreement on how to manage Australia's Murray-Darling Basin, the Labor government finally won support for the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, which will restore balance to our river system as long as the plan is allowed to be implemented. 


The plan is in fact a very hard fought agreement and, if it is to be implemented, it will ensure that we maintain not just a healthy river but also strong regional communities and sustainable food production. In 2012, it looked like, after many years of interstate brawling about the future of the Murray-Darling Basin, we had finally resolved a plan that would take us forward and give certainty to river communities and indeed to my home state of South Australia about the future of the Murray. But now, as a direct result of factional promises and deals in the new Turnbull coalition government, in the space of just a few weeks since he became Prime Minister, Prime Minister Turnbull has thrown the future of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan into chaos. We know that Mr Turnbull gifting the National Party the water portfolio is not going to be beneficial to anyone except the National Party and Mr Turnbull. 


As a former minister for the environment and for water during the Howard years, Mr Turnbull knows exactly that, but he wanted to be Prime Minister more than he wanted to protect the river for the future. So he struck a deal that would give the Nats what they have always coveted and in return he got something that he has always coveted, which, of course, is the prime ministership. So the deal was not anything to do with the future of the river. It was not a deal about the sustainability of the river, it was not about securing the livelihoods of the many people who live in the regional towns along the river and it was not about the future livelihood or the security of the two million people that rely on the Murray-Darling. Instead it was a typical selfish, narcissistic political pact to make sure that Malcolm Turnbull could overthrow Mr Tony Abbott and become the Prime Minister of Australia. 


As a South Australian living at the bottom end of the Murray-Darling Basin, I am very worried about this pact and what it will mean for the future of South Australia. Mr Barnaby Joyce being placed in charge of water has sent shock waves through the South Australian community because we full well know what Mr Joyce's position on water is. We will never forget when he infamously told South Australians, 'If you do not like living along the river Murray in its southern reaches, up stumps, pack up and move to the northern states.' It was certainly characteristic of Mr Joyce that he would have such disregard for the people of South Australia and, importantly, for the Riverland communities in South Australia along the Murray. Of course, we know that Mr Joyce's concern in this fracas that is going on between the Nationals and the Liberal coalition partners is all about Mr Joyce shoring up his seat in northern New South Wales because he has a bit of a threat on his hands at the moment. He will do whatever he can to hold onto that at the expense of downstream basin states like my state of South Australia. Given Mr Joyce's policy legacy in this area and his oft stated views about water, particularly about the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, when it comes to balancing the economic, social and environmental interests of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, the health of the river will always end up last under his watch. 


We have the internal brawling in the coalition to worry about, but earlier today I was particularly worried to see six of the eight Senate crossbench senators come out and attack the future of the Murray-Darling. Through what I can only presume is the influence and manipulation of Mr Joyce as he desperately clutches at straws to maintain control of the water portfolio for his own self-interest, crossbenchers have apparently been used as bait to grab the Prime Minister's attention. They have been used as bait to persuade the Prime Minister to keep his promise and give water to the National Party. In the press conference this morning, the crossbench senators claimed that we need to choose between farmers and the environment. This is not an either/or situation. We do not have to choose between agriculture and the environment. The advancement in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan to date proves that we are making progress. Indeed, the whole context of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan was to ensure a balance in allocation of resources for the river, for agriculture and for sustainable communities. 


It concerns me most that, amongst those crossbenchers this morning, I saw Senator Bob Day, a South Australian senator. Surely, of all the crossbenchers, Senator Day, from South Australia, would know how catastrophic it will be for South Australia if Mr Barnaby Joyce gets control of water. But of course we know that Senator Day likes to play politics with the river. I was also disturbed to see this morning that, although there is a Senate select committee afoot to consider the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, the crossbench senators—who are both chair and deputy chair of that Senate select committee—seem to have predetermined what the outcome of that Senate committee process will be. They seem to have predetermined what the outcome of that Senate committee process will be, for political gain.


You have to ask: what is the dodgy deal that Senator Bob Day has done with the coalition or with Mr Barnaby Joyce that would make him go out there and attempt to undo more than a century of work that has arrived at the Murray-Darling Basin Plan? Why is he kowtowing to the representatives of upstream states in this issue? And why does he want to stop the plan in its tracks? To do so will bring back to South Australia the uncertainty and confusion about the future of the River Murray. We do not need any more uncertainty. The plan was hard fought. States and, I have to say, all of the parties in this Senate worked very hard to get that plan finalised and through the Senate. We saw again bipartisan support for the Water Act amendment just a little while ago.


The future of the Murray absolutely depends on bipartisanship. Once we have the situation where senators who have the balance of power, if you like, in this place start playing politics with the river yet again, the only people who will benefit from that will be those crossbench senators. We do not know what they got in return for the position that they articulated today, but what we do know is that the people of South Australia will get nothing in return for that. We will go back to the bad old days of interstate fighting over allocation of water from the Murray-Darling Basin system, and the state that will miss out as a result of that infighting will be South Australia. I urge the crossbench senators to think very carefully about what they are doing in using the river as a political bargaining chip.

 (South Australia) (16:40):  What an intro! To quote Oscar Wilde:


On an occasion of this kind it becomes more than a moral duty to speak one's mind. It becomes a pleasure.


Yes, the crossbench did address this matter this morning at a press conference. As Senator McEwen says, I am a senator for South Australia, and the River Murray is indeed our lifeblood. There is a simple formula, Senator McEwen. Family farms will thrive and communities will grow if they have enough water. But the opposite is also true. Family farms and communities will shrink and die if there is not adequate water.


Personally, Senator, I do not care who has the water portfolio. We have a Murray-Darling Basin Plan and an independent Senate inquiry, of which I am proud to say I am a member, reviewing that plan. What I care about, Senator— (Time expired)

  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi, and thank you, Senator Madigan. Personally I do not care who has the water portfolio. We have the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and an independent Senate inquiry reviewing that plan of which I and Senator Madigan are members. What I care about is that there is certainty that whoever is responsible for water can respond urgently to the circumstances in the Basin.


Water is being sold in the Murray-Darling Basin at prices as high as $300 a mega litre out of the Goulburn-Murray water area and $240 a mega litre in the South Australian Murray River at the moment. Price does matter. It may not matter to some senators in this place but, for farmers and people in the communities that depend on the river, price does matter. These prices are double what they were last year, treble what the average price has been over the last three years.


The number of drought affected areas in the Murray-Darling Basin is expanding. As has been said in this place earlier, this season's El Nino event is predicted to be worse than previous events and likely to persist until next year. Something urgent needs to be done.

Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (16:46):  Since his appointment, the Prime Minister has been telling Australians we are entering some new age of political Aquarius. He tells us we have a 21st-century government. Last month Mr Turnbull promised us—no, he guaranteed us—the best policy his government can formulate to meet the challenges of today. Mr Turnbull also said there has never been a more exciting time to be an Australian. This is an extraordinary boast.


Today we are calling on the Prime Minister to address urgently the crisis in the Murray-Darling Basin. The Murray-Darling Basin is one of the most productive food and fibre regions of Australia. It produces 45 per cent of Australia's irrigated agricultural product. The Murray-Darling Basin, which covers the states of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, as well as the ACT, is home to 2.1 million Australians. The Basin is an essential part of Australian agriculture. What happens in the Basin impacts the rest of Australia. And right now, because of two factors, this critically important region is a tinderbox. We are, without exaggeration, on the verge of a national crisis.


Firstly, the price of temporary water has sky rocketed to $300 per mega litre. In comparison, it was almost 30 per cent cheaper last month. Farmers tell me their businesses are unsustainable at these prices. There is a water market in Australia that is out of control and is being manipulated. You can buy and sell water like stocks on the share market. Water trading has become an insider's market of corruption and back-room deals, and farmers cannot compete.


I received this email from a constituent yesterday. She farms with her husband in northern Victoria. In part, her email reads: 


My local real estate agent through whom we buy water suggested the big water traders are continually competing for the limited amount of water on the market and can pretty much set the price as they like because large horticultural companies can afford whatever price is put on it.


Where does that leave the small family farmer such as us? To add insult to injury our 650 hectares of dryland crop is a complete failure, making the irrigated production even more critical.


Our youngest son Josh aged 21 is justifiably proud of himself that he bought his own irrigated farm last year but is now wondering why on earth he committed to such a debt when it is unviable to purchase water. His off-farm income and significant subsidies from us are the only things keeping him going.


We are not greedy people, Senator. We don't have a new house, or a new car and in the 27 years of our marriage have had three family holidays. We have educated our four children and put two of them through university. We are hard-working and committed to our enterprise. I just don't understand how the most precious natural resource we have in this country can be owned by people/corporations who do not engage in agriculture.


Mr Turnbull, her question demands an answer.


Second, Australian farmers are facing a scorching end to the year as the threat of drought from a very large El Nino intensifies. This, combined with the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, has created a perfect storm for our agricultural sector, ladies and gentleman. People are walking off farms. People are committing suicide. These is the early death throes of one of our most important farming regions. And our Prime Minister, the former Minister for Water, seems to us to be unaware.


What is it we want? First, we need immediate reform of the Water Act 2007. This is urgent. It must be amended to give equal consideration to the economic and social consequences as well as the environment. Second, that Prime Minister Turnbull must give agricultural minister Barnaby Joyce full responsibility for the water portfolio. The link between agriculture and water is indisputable. And third, as a matter of urgency, the Prime Minister must pause the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, including buy-backs, pending conclusion and reporting of the Senate inquiry into the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.


Simply, do not sit on your hands; do something about it. Communities, people and families are suffering.

"Lazarus, Sen Glenn",Ind.,2015-10-14,"



Senator LAZARUS
 (Queensland) (16:51):  Firstly, I would like to thank the government and the opposition for allowing me—and my crossbench colleagues—a little extra time today to speak on this matter of public importance. I would also like to add that, while some of my senate colleagues have chosen to speak about the Murray-Darling Basin water issue today, I have chosen to speak about the water issues most affecting Queensland: CSG mining and the drought.


The Murray-Darling Basin issue is also a concern for Queensland, and I agree the Water Act of 2007 needs to be suspended to enable reassessment of its impact. As the only Independent senator for Queensland, I am the only senator in this place able to talk about the real issues affecting Queensland in relation to water, because all the other senators are constrained by party policy. 




Senator Lindgren:
  That is not true. 




Senator LAZARUS:
  I am not. I am driven by people policy, not party policy. 




Senator Lindgren:
  Oh please!




Senator LAZARUS:
  I would encourage senators across the chamber to listen in. Let me tell you about the water situation in Queensland and why the state of water across the country is an absolute mess. 


In my home state of Queensland, more than 50 per cent of our people live outside the state capital. This means that the majority of Queenslanders live across rural, regional, northern and western Queensland. With so many Queenslanders living outside the state's capital, you would think that most people have access to town water. Unfortunately, you would be wrong. Many people across Queensland still do not have access to town water. As a result, many Queenslanders have to rely on bores, rainwater tanks, purchased water and dams to survive—to shower, to run their homes, to operate their businesses, to feed their stock and to irrigate their land. 


Eighty per cent of my state is in drought. In fact, we are experiencing one of the worst droughts on record. We have been in drought for four years and the drought is expected to worsen. Despite this, governments at all levels have let my state down by doing absolutely nothing to help with the drought or address the issue of water in Queensland. 


With so many people relying on water sources other than town water, you would think governments would understand the importance of people being able to access clean water via other sources, such as groundwater. Again, you would be wrong. The scourge of coal seam gas mining is devastating rural and regional Queensland. Queenslanders have no legal right to stop a mining company from entering their land to mine for CSG. Governments have been giving mining companies, including international mining companies, unfettered access to our water; any amount of water they want to extract from the ground, without regard for the impact on the people of Queensland. This means that CSG mining companies drill into the ground, depleting underground water tables and contaminating what water is left. 


Landholders who are not connected to town water, who rely on underground water, are being left with no water. Their bores are going dry because CSG mining companies operating on their land or near their land are extracting water from the underground water table with such ferocity that they are depleting underground water resources across huge—

(

Senator Heffernan interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Just a moment, Senator Heffernan. Did you have a point of order?




Senator Heffernan:

Senator Heffernan:
  I withdraw.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you. Senator Lazarus.




Senator LAZARUS:
  I am calling for a royal commission into the human impact of CSG mining, because CSG mining is affecting the health and welfare of our people, and it is affecting their ability to live in this country. This is why I am calling for the establishment of a resources ombudsman, so that people affected by CSG mining, who have lost access to water and are experiencing other issues, have somewhere to go to raise issues and concerns and to receive advice, support and assistance. 


What are the people of Queensland supposed to do when governments are allowing mining companies to deplete our land of water, leaving hardworking, decent people, without water. I will tell you what happens: the people of Queensland become stressed and sick with worry. They turn to suicide as a way to escape the horror of their situation. Today, I learned of yet another Queensland farmer, who lives in Chinchilla, who tried to take his own life, because he just could not cope anymore with the stress of dealing with mining companies wanting to enter his land to mine for CSG. He has fought hard for many years to resist the mining companies coming on to his land, because he did not want his family to deal with the toxic hell associated with CSG mining. The mining companies bullied him, harassed him and intimidated him to the point where, out of sheer despair, he tried to take his own life this morning. He could not see any other way to save his family. 


Landholders are being left to fend for themselves against the might and money of international mining companies because governments have been giving mining companies unrestricted access to landholders' properties in Queensland. I am ashamed at the way governments are treating the people of Queensland. I am ashamed that governments are turning a blind eye to the damage CSG is doing to our water and our people's lives, simply because mining companies are donating to political parties. 


As I have already mentioned, 80 per cent of my home state of Queensland is in drought and has been for four years. Farmers across Queensland are suffering. The land is so dry, farmers are having to put animals down and walk off their land. Towns and communities across rural and regional Queensland are on their knees. Mental health issues are on the increase. Social issues are on the increase. Banks are foreclosing on farms, and international companies and overseas countries are buying up our land. 


Australia should be the food bowl of the world. As a nation we have the capability to increase our food production capacity if we better manage our water resources. North Queensland desperately needs infrastructure investment. If the Romans could build aqueducts across Europe thousands of years ago to shift water from one place to another, why can't we build infrastructure to shift water across Queensland? 


Water infrastructure would enable the distribution of water to farmers across the state. It would enable towns and communities across Queensland to survive and prosper. It would enable people affected by the scourge of CSG mining to access clean, safe drinking water. It would enable our country to manage the consequences of drought by simply moving water around to where it is needed, like many other civilisations have done successfully before us. 


In summary, water management in this country is a mess. Australia needs to establish a national water management body to manage the use, distribution and cost of water across the country as a whole. We urgently need to undertake a water audit to fully understand the status of our water resources.

I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speeches read as follows—



CUSTOMS DEPOT LICENSING CHARGES AMENDMENT BILL 2015


The Customs Depot Licensing Charges Amendment Bill 2015 is one Bill in a package that deals with legislative change to implement measures announced as part of the 2015-16 Budget, following the completion of the Joint Review of Border Fees, Charges and Taxes (Fees Review). 


This Bill complements the Customs Amendment (Fees and Charges) Bill 2015, which establishes the liability to pay a number of new licensing charges. An application charge for a warehouse licence, a charge for an application for a customs broker licence and a charge for an application for a variation to a warehouse licence are new charges imposed through this Bill. 


In addition this Bill amends the Customs Depot Licensing Charges Act 1997 to consolidate existing custom broker, depot and warehouse licensing charges in the one act.


Finally, this Bill makes changes to the price of existing warehouse and customs broker licensing charges in line with cost recovery guidelines. 


 


CUSTOMS AMENDMENT (FEES AND CHARGES) BILL 2015


The Customs Amendment (Fees and Charges) Bill 2015 is one bill in a package that deals with legislative change to implement measures announced as part of the 2015-16 Budget, following the completion of the Joint Review of Border Fees, Charges and Taxes (Fees Review). This bill amends the Customs Act 1901 to restructure current customs broker, depot and warehouse charges and complements the Customs Depot Licensing Charges Amendment Bill 2015. The bill will also increase the warehoused goods declaration processing fee.


The other bill in the package is the Import Processing Charges Amendment Bill 2015.


This restructure of the licensing regime includes consolidating all customs licensing charges under a single act - the Customs Licensing Charges Act 1997 - introducing new licensing charges, and adjusting the price of licensing charges to ensure full cost recovery for depot and warehouse licensing activities, and partial cost recovery of customs broker licensing activities. 


The Department of Immigration and Border Protection processes and assesses applications, issues licences, and manages the renewal and compliance framework for warehouse and depot licence holders, and for customs brokers. Cost recovery charges are imposed on identifiable persons or businesses holding or applying for licences. These charges were forecast to recover $4.0 million in the 2014-15 financial year. Additionally $1.0 million was forecast to be recovered for warehouses administered under delegation by the Australian Taxation Office. 



Under current legislation, depot licence charges are in their own act, while warehouse and customs broker licence charges, which recover costs for similar border licensing activities, are contained in the Customs Act 1901 and Customs Regulation 2015. 


Charging mechanisms also currently differ across the different licence types. While depot licence applicants must pay a licence application charge, and depot licence holders must pay a depot licence variation charge, no such charges exist for warehouse or customs broker licences. Prospective warehouse and customs broker licence holders bear no cost if their application is unsuccessful, and warehouse licence holders do not bear the cost of processing licence variations. During 2013-14, 45 per cent of broker licence applications were unsuccessful, which led to a significant unrecoverable expense for the Department.


The current licensing charging arrangements were established to recover the full costs of customs licensing activities, in line with the Australian Government Cost Recovery Guidelines. During the Fees Review, it was identified that there is significant under-recovery of costs within the customs broker licensing program. The revenue from current broker licensing charges represents approximately 30 per cent of total costs, with current prices set more than 10 years ago. During consultation, industry groups voiced concerns that they believe the program to be inefficient, and that significant business process improvement and modernisation would be necessary to provide a more efficient service. In addition to this, they noted that a shift to full cost recovery would present significant affordability challenges to new and existing broker licence holders.


The amendments in this bill and the Customs Depot Licensing Charges bill 2015, will consolidate all licensing charges into a single act to simplify the legislation. It will introduce new licensing charges to better align the charges with the cost recovery guidelines. The new charges include a warehouse licence application charge, a warehouse licence variation charge, and customs broker application charges. This will encourage applicants to be better prepared prior to applying for a licence and will reduce the cost burden of the licensing program, which is currently borne by successful applicants only. 


The bill will also introduce a small increase in the fees applicable to an import declaration for warehoused goods. This amendment will complement amendments to import processing charges in the Import Processing Charges Amendment Bill 2015, charges that contribute to the recovery of the costs of managing the import related trade and cargo functions of the Department. 


 


IMPORT PROCESSING CHARGES AMENDMENT BILL 2015


The Import Processing Charges Amendment Bill 2015 is one Bill in a package that deals with legislative changes to the Import Processing Charges Act 2001 to implement measures announced as part of the 2014-15 Budget, following the completion of the Joint Review of Border Fees, Charges and Taxes.


The other two Bills are the Customs Amendment (Fees and Charges) Bill 2015 and the Customs Depot Licensing Charges Amendment Bill 2015.


There are three main changes covered in this Bill. The first will broaden the cost base for import declaration and warehouse declaration charges, by recovering the cost of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection's cargo and trade related reform initiatives. This will be in addition to the direct cargo and trade related costs that are recovered through existing import declaration and warehouse declaration charges. The charges will increase as a result of this wider cost base.


The second change is that this Bill will simplify charging arrangements, by removing the price differential between charges for sea cargo, air cargo and postal import declarations and warehouse declarations. The same charge will apply regardless of the way in which goods are imported. This change better reflects that border clearance and risk assessment activities are generally the same for all goods, regardless of the cargo stream by which they arrive.


The third change is that this Bill will introduce a standard higher charge for documentary import declarations and warehouse declarations, to that imposed on electronic declarations. A consistent price better reflects that the additional work required to process documentary declarations does not vary depending on the value of the goods, or the pathway by which they entered Australia.


The changes to import declaration and warehouse declaration charges contained in this Bill comply with the Commonwealth's Cost Recovery Guidelines. They are also consistent with the requirements of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, as the revised charges will not exceed the approximate cost of cargo and trade related processing activities.


The changes contained in this Bill will come into effect on 1 January 2016, and will generate additional net revenue of approximately $106.4 million across the forward estimates. 


These changes will provide a more equitable application of border import processing charges, ensuring that costs are evenly distributed across all imported goods, regardless of whether they come by sea, air or post.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:18):  Minister, I want to go back to an issue that we started talking about earlier in the day before going on to other evaluation issues: the issue of when you are looking at the evaluation process. For a start, you outlined how the collection of data sets is going to make up the baseline information. If I understood what you were saying correctly, the state government and the Commonwealth government are going to be looking at various data sets. Is that a correct understanding of the baseline evaluation process?

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:20):  I have a specific reason for asking this, and that is why I was talking about baseline data. During the committee inquiry process there seemed to be some doubt as to whether there would be adequate baseline information collected. That is why I am asking specifically about the data sets—so that we have a baseline from which to evaluate.


One of the problems with evaluating the Northern Territory intervention has always been that there was not that key data set—a baseline data set—available. I am particularly pursuing this line of questioning to find out whether we will in fact have an adequate baseline data set from which to evaluate and whether it will be available before the start of the trial and whether it will be publicly available so that we all can see what that baseline data is.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (17:21):  The government will be working with the South Australian government to establish the appropriate baseline data sets. Whether it can be released publicly or not, I do not know. I guess one of the considerations would be whether, in a small community, data sets could potentially identify people. I do not know—I am not familiar enough with it—but I know that there are some reasons why particular data sets in particular formats might not be able to be released. I am just surmising on that point. I think that it would be the intention to make available the baseline data sets in the interests of transparency, because I think everyone wants to see what the results of the trial are.

Senator SIEWERT

Our experience with the NT intervention is that anything less than 20 just has 'less than 20', and that has been generally acceptable. That is a way that we can get around that particular issue. If that is in fact the intention, that would be a good start. Is the government intending to provide extra funding to the state for this data collection and for the ongoing evaluation? How much funding has been set aside for this process?

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:28):  I want to go to the questions I was asking earlier about commitment of funding to like-size communities who have similar sorts of issues so that we have an adequate comparison between a community that is getting the sorts of wraparound services that you are providing—$1 million worth of services is quite a significant injection of services—and a community that does not get that. Many communities do not get that. How will you compare apples with apples if you are looking at the impact of the card versus the impact of the services? I go back to where I was heading before we went off on another issue. Will you be looking at a like community that does not have the card but that is receiving the services so that we can then look at the impact of card and the impact of the services? Many of us would argue that those services are key. I will say again that it is really good that services are going in. This is so we can look at what the impact of those services is and what the impact of the card is.

Senator FIFIELD

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (17:30):  Minister, before you answer that question, I have a supplementary question to that one. It is in terms of the fact that one of the core aspects of the trial was an audit of the current services and then community consultation to augment those current services. I am interested to see whether a similar process has occurred anywhere else with quite a specialised preparation. In the paperwork we received on the trial, it was very clear that there had been a specific audit of the current services in the region and discussions with the state government about the services they are providing and then, on top of that, with community consultation, Minister Tudge provided the augmentation of the million dollars. In terms of having a direct comparison, will there be any place that would have had that same degree of service focus to make that kind of comparison, or are you preparing to have a more general process about similar services rather than the same?

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (17:38):  This is on a different issue, Senator Siewert. Going back to the community panels that we talked about earlier, during the community affairs hearing there was a range of discussions about how they would operate. In your previous answers this afternoon, you were really clear that this was going to be determined by the community. We understood that was the process. I asked on the day at the community affairs inquiry: is it possible to have a range of options within the same community around this assessment process? We talked at the time and I raised the issue on the Hansardabout the fact that members of the community would feel more comfortable with different people. We talked in the discussion with the department that afternoon about whether it would be someone from Centrelink or a community determined panel, and whether the same people from an Indigenous community would be assessed by the same people as by the non-Indigenous community. This range of discussions occurred, and my understanding when I went away from that meeting was that it was still under consideration; however, there could be the possibility that there would be a range of options all determined by the community and all agreed by the minister to suit a number of the people in the community. I am just wondering whether that variation is still under consideration.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:40):  Just following up on that issue, because I want to double-check a couple of things too: who is the final decision maker in terms of what that process will look like? I understand what you are saying, which is that the community will be determining how to run it. I still hold concerns about what the minimum standards I was asking about earlier are, and who therefore makes the decision that there may be several bodies?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (17:41):  Ultimately, the minister would sign the legislative instrument that would recognise the body or bodies; however, obviously, it would be hoped that that would simply be reflecting the agreement that had been reached in the community.

I am just trying to clarify: is it an appellable decision so that, if you go to the body and ask to change from 80-20 to, say, fifty-fifty and the group or the authorisation says no, is this an appellable decision as I would understand an appellable decision under the act?

I will seek some advice on that. The initial advice, and I guess this is the ultimate advice as well, is that the minister could override a panel decision. Someone could raise it with the minister as to whether there is an avenue below the minister. The minister will review the operations of the panel in addition to that at least every six months. In terms of how the processes operate, how the particular body operates, to some extent that will still be the subject of consultation.

What are the processes that you have been discussing and that you have established to ensure those due processes when dealing with very personal information and the direct impacts on people's lives?

I should also mention that in terms of those who will be participating in the local body, the privacy requirements would be outlined in the formal agreement between the local community body and the Commonwealth and would comply with the Australian Privacy Principles.

I was not in any way trying to impugn anybody who may be on a community body by suggesting they may breach privacy. The point I was making is that this is a very important body. As you have just pointed out, there will be statutory obligations, which means that it needs to have an adequate level of funding to support it. That is why I was asking that, why I was putting it in that context. What funding has been made available?

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:54):  I want to make a short third-reading contribution following the discussion we just had. I promise I will not speak for long. I thank the minister for the diligent attempt to answer my questions. I say 'diligent' because he did try, but there are so many unanswered questions here. We are being asked to now vote. We are at the very last vote on a bill where there are so many unanswered questions in terms of the funding available, in terms of the evaluation process and particularly in terms of how it will actually work, in practicalities. What are the practicalities of this particular card? Where will it work? What will it cost to fund? We know there are merchant fees. There is a commitment from the government to talk to the local merchants to see if they can get the cost of merchant charges down. We do not know how the minimum cost on EFTPOS is going to work. Certainly that is not going to work outside Ceduna. There is a different process outside Ceduna and inside Ceduna. While we are debating this, we do not know what the third community is that may or may not be in. We do not know how the community bodies are going to work. We do not know whether there will be one or many. There is lots of funding. We do not know what the government have committed in terms of being able to deal with the issues around bank fees. While the government have said there will be no bank fees, we do not know if the amount is capped. We do not know what they have committed. We do not know who the financial provider institution will be. There are so many unanswered questions, despite the minister's diligent attempts to answer our questions.


I come back to the fundamental issue here, which is that income management does not work. This is what this card is. It is effectively income management. This chamber is being asked to vote on a piece of legislation which is ideologically driven, and we actually do not know how it is going to operate. On some of the most basic issues, we do not know how it is going to operate. The Greens will be voting no on this. None of what we heard during the answers to questions convinced us that this is something that should be supported. It did not address the issues of income management, and there are still massive question marks about how this process is going to work. There are so many unknowns.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2015-10-14,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:18):  Minister, I want to go back to an issue that we started talking about earlier in the day before going on to other evaluation issues: the issue of when you are looking at the evaluation process. For a start, you outlined how the collection of data sets is going to make up the baseline information. If I understood what you were saying correctly, the state government and the Commonwealth government are going to be looking at various data sets. Is that a correct understanding of the baseline evaluation process?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,21,2,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2015-10-14,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:19):  What is the time frame for the collection of that data? Will that be collected prior to the commencement of the trial? I will leave it at that, firstly.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,21,2,speech

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (17:19):  I think that things will be measured pre, during and after. There will be data sets before, data sets during and data sets after. I cannot give you detail as to exactly what data sets will be received and when particular data sets feed into which particular components of the evaluation. I just do not have that information, sorry.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,21,2,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2015-10-14,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:20):  I have a specific reason for asking this, and that is why I was talking about baseline data. During the committee inquiry process there seemed to be some doubt as to whether there would be adequate baseline information collected. That is why I am asking specifically about the data sets—so that we have a baseline from which to evaluate.


One of the problems with evaluating the Northern Territory intervention has always been that there was not that key data set—a baseline data set—available. I am particularly pursuing this line of questioning to find out whether we will in fact have an adequate baseline data set from which to evaluate and whether it will be available before the start of the trial and whether it will be publicly available so that we all can see what that baseline data is.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (17:21):  The government will be working with the South Australian government to establish the appropriate baseline data sets. Whether it can be released publicly or not, I do not know. I guess one of the considerations would be whether, in a small community, data sets could potentially identify people. I do not know—I am not familiar enough with it—but I know that there are some reasons why particular data sets in particular formats might not be able to be released. I am just surmising on that point. I think that it would be the intention to make available the baseline data sets in the interests of transparency, because I think everyone wants to see what the results of the trial are.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:22):  Thank you for that. Our experience with the NT intervention is that anything less than 20 just has 'less than 20', and that has been generally acceptable. That is a way that we can get around that particular issue. If that is in fact the intention, that would be a good start. Is the government intending to provide extra funding to the state for this data collection and for the ongoing evaluation? How much funding has been set aside for this process?

Senator SIEWERT

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (17:23):  The independent evaluation group will be collecting the data and South Australia will be providing the data at no charge.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:23):  Will the independent evaluation that will be carried out only be done on the qualitative data?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (17:24):  There will be qualitative as well as quantitative. The nature of the qualitative work will be interviews, feedback, focus groups—not in the sense of focus groups that we might be more familiar with, but there will be a range of different mechanisms to seek that qualitative input.

Is that the process that will be used?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (17:26):  I think that is still to be determined. I don't know whether it will be sampling, whether there will be an endeavour to connect with each individual participant. I think that is still to be determined on the basis of expert advice as to how best to conduct these evaluations.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2015-10-14,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:26):  The reason I am asking is that it is quite clear from the evidence we have heard, both in this chamber and in the inquiry, that not all income support recipients in the Ceduna area have been consulted. If that same process happens again, you will get a skewed evaluation. That is why I am asking whether there is a commitment that all participants will be involved. What is the commitment to having an independent process where there is not a selective analysis or consultation with people?

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:28):  I want to go to the questions I was asking earlier about commitment of funding to like-size communities who have similar sorts of issues so that we have an adequate comparison between a community that is getting the sorts of wraparound services that you are providing—$1 million worth of services is quite a significant injection of services—and a community that does not get that. Many communities do not get that. How will you compare apples with apples if you are looking at the impact of the card versus the impact of the services? I go back to where I was heading before we went off on another issue. Will you be looking at a like community that does not have the card but that is receiving the services so that we can then look at the impact of card and the impact of the services? Many of us would argue that those services are key. I will say again that it is really good that services are going in. This is so we can look at what the impact of those services is and what the impact of the card is.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (17:30):  Minister, before you answer that question, I have a supplementary question to that one. It is in terms of the fact that one of the core aspects of the trial was an audit of the current services and then community consultation to augment those current services. I am interested to see whether a similar process has occurred anywhere else with quite a specialised preparation. In the paperwork we received on the trial, it was very clear that there had been a specific audit of the current services in the region and discussions with the state government about the services they are providing and then, on top of that, with community consultation, Minister Tudge provided the augmentation of the million dollars. In terms of having a direct comparison, will there be any place that would have had that same degree of service focus to make that kind of comparison, or are you preparing to have a more general process about similar services rather than the same?

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (17:38):  This is on a different issue, Senator Siewert. Going back to the community panels that we talked about earlier, during the community affairs hearing there was a range of discussions about how they would operate. In your previous answers this afternoon, you were really clear that this was going to be determined by the community. We understood that was the process. I asked on the day at the community affairs inquiry: is it possible to have a range of options within the same community around this assessment process? We talked at the time and I raised the issue on the Hansardabout the fact that members of the community would feel more comfortable with different people. We talked in the discussion with the department that afternoon about whether it would be someone from Centrelink or a community determined panel, and whether the same people from an Indigenous community would be assessed by the same people as by the non-Indigenous community. This range of discussions occurred, and my understanding when I went away from that meeting was that it was still under consideration; however, there could be the possibility that there would be a range of options all determined by the community and all agreed by the minister to suit a number of the people in the community. I am just wondering whether that variation is still under consideration.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:40):  Just following up on that issue, because I want to double-check a couple of things too: who is the final decision maker in terms of what that process will look like? I understand what you are saying, which is that the community will be determining how to run it. I still hold concerns about what the minimum standards I was asking about earlier are, and who therefore makes the decision that there may be several bodies?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (17:41):  Ultimately, the minister would sign the legislative instrument that would recognise the body or bodies; however, obviously, it would be hoped that that would simply be reflecting the agreement that had been reached in the community.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:41):  Presumably, you would have the same manner of operating for whatever number of bodies you came up with. You do not envisage having a different set of criteria for different bodies—would that be a correct understanding? 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,21,2,speech

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (17:41):  It is probably not likely that there would be different criteria, but there would be discussions with the local communities in different trial sites. It would be theoretically possible that there could be some variation but that has not particularly been envisaged, if that makes sense.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:42):  Potentially, what is envisaged is that, instead of having one body, you could have them based on communities. When you were answering Senator Moore's question, is that what you were thinking about?

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (17:43):  On the same point, in terms of the decision—again, it is a clarifying point, and I know a lot of this is under consultation at the moment; I am trying to get an idea about the process. It is important that there is consistency and integrity in the decision making so people understand that. I am just trying to clarify: is it an appellable decision so that, if you go to the body and ask to change from 80-20 to, say, fifty-fifty and the group or the authorisation says no, is this an appellable decision as I would understand an appellable decision under the act?

 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (17:44):  If someone does not agree with a decision, then they do not have to be bound to it, and the status quo is what prevail Your question is: will there be a formal mechanism by which someone can seek to have that revisited? I will seek some advice on that. The initial advice, and I guess this is the ultimate advice as well, is that the minister could override a panel decision. Someone could raise it with the minister as to whether there is an avenue below the minister. The minister will review the operations of the panel in addition to that at least every six months. In terms of how the processes operate, how the particular body operates, to some extent that will still be the subject of consultation.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:45):  This is an area we started pursuing earlier and we did not quite conclude it. If you recall, we were talking about small communities with a small number of people who are going to have to front up to people who, in a lot of instances, they know quite well to air their personal views or opinions. Given that, I would have thought that there was even more reason for the fact that you would need an appeal process. There is a big gap between going to the local community body and to the minister.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (17:46):  There will be discussions, in the process of establishing the local body, as to what arrangements there are for another look to be taken at someone's situation after a decision has been made—that is, short of going to the minister.

I am conscious that you have got formal appeal processes that are available through the various legislative mechanisms, so you are not talking about a formal process. You are talking about putting in place another process where people can have a review outside the minister?

 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:48):  I want to go back to the issue that we were talking about with funding. There will be funding available? I suspect I could almost answer my question because I will get told 'the contingency fund', but what are the processes that you have agreed with the community will be funded in terms of sitting fees, operational fees, secretariat—this is obviously going to be a very sensitive issue, so there is going to have to be due process around this community body. What are the processes that you have been discussing and that you have established to ensure those due processes when dealing with very personal information and the direct impacts on people's lives? What funding has been made available, and what other things would be funded through this community body?

I should also mention that in terms of those who will be participating in the local body, the privacy requirements would be outlined in the formal agreement between the local community body and the Commonwealth and would comply with the Australian Privacy Principles. Each individual member of the local community body would be required to sign a declaration of confidentiality confirming that they will not disclose any protected information of trial participants. As I was saying before, there will be further consultations to ensure that it is an appropriate review process that will be set up to allow an independent review of decisions separate from the board.

I was not in any way trying to impugn anybody who may be on a community body by suggesting they may breach privacy. The point I was making is that this is a very important body. As you have just pointed out, there will be statutory obligations, which means that it needs to have an adequate level of funding to support it. That is why I was asking that, why I was putting it in that context. What funding has been made available?

Senator HEFFERNAN
 (New South Wales) (19:20):  Just briefly on the previous speech by Senator McAllister, on the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (Better Targeting the Income Tax Transparency Laws) Bill 2015. To put it into context: the law for the present tax system has been outsmarted by technology. Do not try and tell me—I know you did not mean me—that because I am in the Liberal Party I am against doing something about it. On 30 June last year, the World Bank said that $3 trillion was on the merry-go-round running away from tax; $700 trillion was on the derivative merry-go-round. The US estimated that they missed out on between $650 billion and $800 billion and no-one broke the law. Change the law!


I rise tonight because I have been bloody insulted today. I came through the doors this morning and saw a group of people playing politics with people's livelihoods. I came into the chamber today and saw the same thing in speeches here—and I refer to the Murray-Darling Basin proposition. It is easy to go out to the electorate or to go to Griffith and say, 'We're going to give you more water,' or to go down the street and say, 'We'll provide free beer.' You will be popular, but you have got to apply some science to it.


The question the other day from Senator Wong to Senator Colbeck was, 'Do you promise, by legislation, that you will keep the mouth of the Murray open for nine out of 10 years?' It is complete rubbish! Mother Nature and Mother Earth control what happens. We have to take some notice of what the science is saying is going to happen in the future. For Senator Glenn Lazarus to say today that he is the only one who can speak—although he did not talk about water, because he knows nothing about it—because he is not attached to a political party and tied to their policy, well try me on.


Let me tell you what the science says will happen—and all science has vagary, as all human endeavour has failure—in another 25 to 30 years in the southern Murray-Darling Basin. The Murray-Darling Basin, by the way—I have no notes; no-one wrote this for me—has 6.2 per cent of Australia's run-off, 23,400 gigs, of which 14½ thousand gigs is allocated. That is a small proportion of Australia's run-off. They say that there is going to be a decline of 15 per cent in the rainfall in the southern Murray-Darling catchment, which will relate to a 35 per cent decline in run-off. They say that we will go back to under a week of snow, from three weeks. There will be no snow melt. It will only evaporate. Not this year, not last year, not the year before but three years ago there was no snow melt; it evaporated. There was not enough snow. So bear that in mind.


Then people want to go round to Griffith or somewhere and say, 'We're going to give you more water,' The only way you could do that is if the fish grow legs, because the river has actually got to run and the fish have got to swim. Obviously there has got to be some balance in this. Senator Madigan and I had a yarn this afternoon about balancing the debate, but to come in here and say, 'We're going to politically promise something,' is complete garbage. It is not up to us. It is up to Mother Earth—and thank God we do not control the rainfall. 


But the science is warning us. If the prediction of the science is 40 per cent right—and the prediction goes right around Australia, and I would need an hour and a half to tell you about it and unfortunately I have only got 10 minutes. I could take you round every river and tell you the median flow and what has happened to every river in Australia. There is 70.4 per cent of Australia's run-off in three catchments in the North: 78,000 gigs in the Timor catchment; 98,000 gigs in the gulf catchment, of which we only divert 55; and 85,000 gigs in the north-east catchment, of which we divert 350. The science says that the weather is going to go anticlockwise and that south-west Western Australia is going to become unfarmable and that parts of the pastoral country of Western Australia will become farmable. If the science is 40 per cent right, the only water that will be reliably available in the Murray-Darling Basin will be the environmental flows for the fish—so they do not have to grow legs—and high-security water. What do we do about that? We do not go to Griffith or to Coleambally and say, 'We're going to give you more water.' I have places there and I know the people, but you cannot play politics with their livelihoods. 


Let us just go a little further down the science road. Does anyone know why the water is in a paddy rice field? It is not there because the rice needs it; it is there to average the temperature variation in the plant, because, if you get a cold snap at the wrong time with rice, it will sterilise the plant and, if it gets too hot, the  plant will lose its flower. Guess what. Five or six years ago when I got up and talked about this in this place and said, 'We've got to go to dryland rice,' the scientists rang me up and said, 'You're right, Bill; we've got the varieties.' What does that mean? It means about a 15 per cent decline in yield and a 50-odd per cent saving in water. The reason the paddies are there is to be a thermostat. We have now built that into the plant so it can protect itself from the variation in the temperature. We are better off to talk about this stuff than to say: 'The farmers are running out of water. We've got to give them more water.' Where is it going come from, for God's sake?


Have you have been to Carnarvon? It has 3½ thousand acres of irrigation. You look. It is a speck. In the year I was there as the chairman of the northern development task force—and we should be doing all that instead of talking about it—they made $69 million from 3½ thousand acres, using Spanish and Israeli licensed technology. It is very good technology. In the same year, the Ord made the same money with 40 times the amount of water. In the same year, they were 40 times less efficient. In the same year, the Murray-Darling average across the basin was 20 times less efficient than the most efficient. We have got to learn from this.


You can argue for as long as you like about the politics of it. Put the politics to bed, for God's sake. We are arguing about whether the National Party is going to have water or someone else is going to have it. Every minister for water in this place has just about cocked it up. As I said to Senator Wong yesterday, some of the buybacks that they made were ridiculous—Tandau and Toorale and Booligal Station. The biggest fraud on the public purse in my time in this place, with regard to water, was the Nimmie-Caira buyback. I have not got time to explain to you why. These are deadhead decisions. Cubbie Station—and Barnaby and I have had a few blues about this—was a great idea but it was built on the wrong scale. The mean annual flow of the Culgoa is 1,200 gigs. They allowed them to build 1,500 gigs of off-river storage. They did not issue licences based on the flow; they issued them based on the size of the bloody storages that were built, and that depended on the size of the bulldozer! Twenty-seven and a half per cent of the flow of the Culgoa used to get to the Darling. Now 4½ per cent does.



Senator Canavan interjecting—




Senator HEFFERNAN:
  Twenty-five per cent of the flow of the Culgoa. It has occurred in four years since 1921. It has an 835 per cent variability. You probably do not know any of that.


So we have got to apply science to this argument and not play politics with it. I am bloody angry that we are playing politics, because the global food task does not have a solution. The global energy task does. By 2050, the science is saying, we will go to nine billion people, and by 2070 we will go to 12 billion people. They predict that 30 per cent of the productive capacity of Asia will have disappeared. Thirty-five per cent of the world's population is going to live in that region. Fifty per cent of the world's population will be unable to feed themselves. Fifty per cent of the world's population will be poor for water. We have got a lot of work to do. Northern Australia needs to be developed. Most people say it is too hot and too far away, but the only reason is that they are looking back to bloody Sydney and not to Singapore. It is closer to Singapore, where the market is, where two-thirds of the world's population is going to live. And we are saying it is too hot. Where is the best place to be on a hot day? In the cab of the tractor. It is better than the damn house. Come on! Let's have a go.


I can remember back to John Anderson, God bless him, in cabinet—I was the cabinet secretary—saying that we must have a nationally traded water initiative. I said to John Howard, the Prime Minister, 'This poor bugger doesn't know what he's talking about.' You cannot trade water from the Fitzroy in Western Australia into the Murray. They tried it. They actually tried to trade water from the Darling to the Murrumbidgee. It does not work. They even tried to trade water from terminal rivers. Most people do not know what a terminal river is. At the Lachlan River, they rebuilt the wall on the dam to try and provide water to the bottom of the river. What happened? The politicians at the time thought they would be generous to their electorates and they issued a whole lot of new licences to the top of the river, and the bottom of the river still misses out. For God's sake, let's get the politics out of it. This today was a wedge by the so-called independents against the government about who is going to take over water. Senator Canavan is probably part of it. That is fair enough; that is politics. I do not want politics in water. I do not want some mug who knows nothing about water making decisions on it. The Nimmie-Caira buyback is a perfect example of ruining the public purse. (Time expired)
