That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended, as would prevent the Member for Cunningham moving forthwith:
(1)	This House notes that:
(a)	In an answer to a question on the Defence White Paper by the Minister for Defence on 8 March 2001 the Hansard Greens contained the following sentence:
“Are they going to undermine our capacity for the purchase of new combat aircraft carriers?”
(b)	In the final version of the House Hansard of 8 March 2001, the answer from the Minister for Defence is recorded as:
“Are they going to undermine our capacity for the purchase of new combat aircraft?”
(c)	The removal of the word “carriers” conveys a completely different meaning to the answer, which is contrary to House practice (see House of Representatives Practice, Third Edition, p. 573), where words can only be omitted if they do not change the substance or meaning of the answer.
(d)	By the Minister's action he again demonstrates his complete lack of knowledge regarding the contents of the Defence White Paper.
(2)	This House calls for the restoration of the word “carriers” to the Hansard record as a true and accurate report of the Minister for Defence's answer.
Mr Speaker, this man is doing a Billy McMahon. He is changing the Hansard report.

"SPEAKER, Mr",N/A,2001-04-05,"—Yesterday the honourable member for Wills asked me whether members raising points of order were required to make any declarations of interest in connection with the subject of their point of order. When the present arrangements for the declaration of members' interests were first introduced by resolution of October 1984, members were required to declare interests orally before they participated in debates or voted, but the requirement was abolished in 1988. This change was made on the recommendation of the Committee of Members' Interests which had expressed doubt that the requirement served any useful purpose in view of the obligation on members to lodge written declarations: House of Representatives Practice, page 161. Any member who wishes to propose a change in the arrangements is of course free to take up the matter with the Committee of Members' Interests or the Standing Committee on Procedure.

That the amendment be agreed to.
When the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001 was presented to the Senate on Tuesday, 3 April for the second reading debate, the Australian Democrats proposed an amendment which was supported by the Australian Labor Party. The amendment, as proposed by the Democrats and supported by the ALP, is to oppose schedule 1, item 45, page 16, lines 9 and 10 of the Electoral and Referendum Bill (No. 1) 2001. This amendment means that section 311A of the Commonwealth Electoral Act is not to be removed from the legislation.
The government will not be opposing this amendment. Section 311A requires that each government department must include in its annual report particulars of amounts paid by or on behalf of the Commonwealth department to advertising agencies, market research organisations, polling organisations, direct mail organisations and media advertising organisations.
You would be interested to know that the Special Minister of State is writing to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit on the matter. The minister will be asking the joint committee to give consideration to recommendation 48 of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters report on the conduct of the 1998 federal election with the intention to include this provision in the JCPAA reporting guidelines.  The government proposes to give effect to clause 45 of the Electoral and Referendum Bill (No. 1) 2001 and repeal section 311A in the upcoming electoral reform bill.
This is one of those matters in which the government has in fact bowed to the realities of the numbers in the Senate. We did prefer the pre-existing situation, but it is a fact of life that the legislation as submitted to the Senate by the government was not going to be carried and, as a result of that, we have accepted this amendment, albeit reluctantly. The amendment, however, does not destroy the principal intentions that the government had in the bill and our aim, of course, is to continue to improve the integrity of the electoral process.
—It is so important.
—It is important, particularly with an election coming up towards the end of the year, and it is absolutely vital that the people of Australia should have confidence that the result as declared following polling day in fact represents the collective will of the Australian people. That is the reason this government does not resile from or apologise for our continued efforts, at times frustrated by the Australian Labor Party, to improve the integrity of the electoral process. 
As one of the oldest democracies in the world, we in Australia are rightly proud of our electoral record. But that does not mean that we should not continue to seek to improve the process or to continue to ensure that we have integrity of the electoral system so that we are in fact able, on behalf of the Australian community, to maintain confidence by the community in the electoral process, our system of government and indeed the way we are governed. As the Minister for Community Services has now arrived in the House I will not—
—He is a great supporter of democracy. 
—He is a great supporter of democracy, as the Minister for Employment Services at the table points out. I will not continue further, except to say that I very strongly urge the House to support the motion which has been moved in the House this morning.

"Anthony, Larry, MP",NP,2001-04-05,"—The government proposes that amendment No. 5 be disagreed to and that amendments Nos 1 to 4 be disagreed to but that amendments be made in place thereof. I suggest, therefore, that it may suit the convenience of the House to first consider amendment No. 5 and, when that amendment has been disposed of, to consider Nos 1 to 4. I move:
That amendment No. 5 be disagreed to.
The government opposes the Senate amendment, which is to omit schedule 8 to the bill. The amendment fails to address concerns expressed to the Child Support Agency by both resident and non-resident parents. These concerns are that privacy can be breached unnecessarily by the current requirements and that the other party to child support assessment be given copies of supporting documents to an application for a change of child support assessment. These concerns were addressed in the original amendments in schedule 8. The proposal to restrict access by parents to documentation used during the change of assessment process was rejected by the non-government parliamentarians on the basis that this would be a denial of natural justice. 
I must stress that the application and response forms used in the change of assessment process request comprehensive information from both parties. The complete forms are provided to both parents and contain all the information that is relevant to the consideration of a change of assessment. This information will still be provided to both parents, satisfying the requirements of natural justice. However, in applying for a change of assessment, parents are also invited to provide information to corroborate their claims. In some cases they provide copies of everything from grocery receipts to telephone bills, utility bills and credit card statements.  
Parents may also provide very personal and sensitive information about third parties, including medical reports, about new partners or children or business records showing details of suppliers and purchasers. These documents are useful to the decision makers as a corroborative tool and assist the CSA in the verification process. The government considers that parents will be more likely to provide documents to support their claims when they know this personal and sensitive information will not be provided to the other parties.

"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,2001-04-05,"—Labor supported seven of the 10 measures in the original bill. Amendments have been made in the Senate, one of which we are discussing now. Unfortunately, I have had only about 20 minutes to look at the proposals that have come back to the House, so I am not going to respond in detail here today. That will occur in another place at a future time. I will not be seeking to divide the House over any of these measures. That may also occur, depending on whether agreement can be reached with the government on these matters, in the upper house at another time. 
I would like to put on the record that our side of the House supports reform of the Child Support Scheme, including seven out of the 10 measures. In particular, Labor has supported measures in the legislation that have assisted second families, and it has even put to the government that they should consider separating these important measures from the rest of the bill if we cannot reach agreement on other matters. I would certainly like to restate my support for the principle of shared care. Recent research, for instance, conducted by Henman and Mitchell has thrown a bit more light on this issue. That indicates that, as commonsense would tell us, non-custodial parents do incur additional costs as a result of having contact with their children. What is important about their work is that they show that the costs to both separated parents sharing care are higher than the costs of care for intact families. This means that reform of the Child Support Act, when it seeks only to shift the balance of resources between custodial and non-custodial families, does not really address the problem. 
This is one of the sticking points, as the minister is very well aware. We will continue in discussions with the government about all of the contentious measures, including the one before us at the moment. It would certainly be my hope that we could reach agreement in these matters, but that remains to be seen. We reserve our right to amend the bill in the Senate after we have considered in detail the government's latest proposals.

The effect of the four amendments is to omit schedules 1 and 2 to the bill and the contact measure and the lower cap. Where parents share the care of their child, both parents are incurring costs in caring for their child. The contact measure does not take money away from the children; it merely redistributes some of the available funds according to where children are living. In fact, this measure results in $11 million more going to children. These changes will make the Child Support Scheme fairer and will help non-resident parents to keep seeing their children. This is good for these children. These changes are aimed to enable and encourage non-resident parents to stay involved in parenting. Research shows that, following separation, ongoing involvement of both parents in the lives of their children is good for the children. And, as the shadow minister has mentioned, we hope that in the short period of time available there can be agreement reached between the government and the opposition parties.
Further, this measure extends rather than changes current child support policy. Under the current child support formula, the liabilities are calculated based on the amount of contact a non-resident parent has with his or her children. However, the current formula only recognises the costs of contact when non-resident parents exercise contact between 30 and 40 per cent of the nights in the year. The measure also distinguishes for the first time between the liabilities of those non-resident parents who have significant and ongoing contact and those who have little or no contact. For example, a current non-resident parent who has contact every second weekend and half the school holidays, which approximates 22 per cent care, receives no recognition of this under the current arrangements. Currently, the parent with that amount of contact is recognised exactly the same as a parent who has no contact at all.
The measure is also consistent with the findings of the 1994 Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues report that the 30 per cent threshold created a cliffhanger effect for parents. The JSC recommended that a stepped approach should be introduced. The government is also concerned to improve the fairness of the Child Support Scheme by reducing the cap on income used to calculate child support liabilities. Under the cap at its current level, most high income non-resident parents are paying more than the measured costs of children. For example, research conducted by NATSEM into the costs of children shows that most payers earning more than, say, $65,000 are paying more than the costs of children in an intact family. The fundamental principle of the scheme is that both parents share the costs of supporting their children according to their capacity to contribute. Child support payments are the non-resident parents' contribution towards the support of their children. However, where a non-resident parent is contributing more than 100 per cent of the costs of the children, this leads to the view that the excess payments are transfer of funds for the support of the resident parent. This is not the intended purpose of the Child Support Scheme. The Child Support Consultative Group, which designed the formula, and the JSC both recommend that the cap be set at a lower level. The measure to lower the cap effectively achieves these recommendations.
The government puts forward today amendments that are the result of thorough and genuine investigation of the concerns expressed by non-government parliamentarians during the consideration of this bill. The government amendments provide new measures that are of direct benefit to resident parents. They are offered on the basis of a genuine compensation to resident parents for any perceived disadvantage in the original measures that I have outlined today. These amendments provide for two new measures relating to family tax benefit and change the commencement provisions for some measures in the light of the delayed passage of the bill. 
The first new measure allows a non-resident parent with 10 per cent to 30 per cent contact with his or her child to waive eligibility for family tax benefit for a period so that the resident parent may receive the full amount of the family tax benefit of the child. This is clearly beneficial to the group potentially affected by the original proposals, especially in the case in which the resident parent cannot be paid family tax benefit because of high income. An amount of family tax benefit that could not previously be paid to either parent may now, under these amendments, be available to the resident parent. This measure would commence on 1 December 2001. (Extension of time granted) The second new measure allows an outstanding child support debt of a person who is entitled to be paid family tax benefit to be recovered from the person's family tax benefit entitlements. This directly responds to concerns expressed by resident parents whose family tax benefit is reduced because of contact by non-resident parents with the child even if the non-resident parent defaults on his or her child support. This measure would commence on 1 July 2002.
The measures in the bill for which the commencement dates will change, due to the delayed passage of the bill, are—assuming there is agreement: the lower formula percentage for payers exercising contact, schedule 1, will now commence on 1 July 2002, formerly 1 July 2001; the lower cap on payer income, schedule 2, will now commence on 1 January 2002, formerly 1 January 2001; and the assessment of income for child support payments for people undertaking overtime or second jobs, schedule 3, will now commence on royal assent, formerly 1 January 2001. The commencement dates for all other measures in the bill are not to change.

"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,2001-04-05,"—We will consider that measure the Minister for Community Services has just spoken about. For my part, I would like to reiterate that Labor are supportive of measures that encourage both parents to play a part in the upbringing of their children. There are certainly good arguments to provide additional financial assistance to encourage this. But we have a problem with the shared care measure in that it delivers benefits to the non-resident parent at the expense of the other parent. This has been the basis of our discussion. So we were prepared to support the lower formula percentages on the condition that the government passed a simple amendment to social security law. This amendment would have ensured that children were protected from any reduction in child support from the lower percentages by improving family payments. I would like to continue to discuss those matters with the government, and I hope that we can reach a satisfactory result in the interests of resident and non-resident parents.

"Bevis, Arch, MP",ALP,2001-04-05,"— When this matter was being discussed before the adjournment last night, I was making the point that the Commonwealth scheme is a very effective and efficient scheme with very low premiums—in fact, the lowest premium rate of any scheme in the country—and with a declining number of claims as a percentage of employee numbers. Given that background, we could not see the motivation or the need for the far more restrictive definition as proposed to be given to injury and illness in the amendments and therefore will not be supporting those changes. I have an additional comment in relation to that specific point from my contribution last night and it flows from the reference to Brian Howe's speech in 1988, which has been cited as an example of why the government amendments are in keeping with a long-held view. 
At the time Labor proposed those provisions, Commonwealth expenditure on workers compensation had increased by over 700 per cent in a 10-year period. However, the workers compensation scheme is now self-funded, but premiums, as I said, are the lowest in Australia and claims are falling. It is quite understandable why Brian Howe, in 1988, would hold the view he expressed in his second reading speech against a background of cost increases at a rate of 700 per cent over 10 years. Clearly, the 13 years since have demonstrated that the new system that was put in place has addressed those cost pressures. I think the government needs to advance a much stronger case in relation to the restrictions on injury and illness than it has today.
I turn now to the issue of non-economic loss. On its face, the present act does not permit employees to claim compensation for injuries occurring before 1 December 1988, if compensation was not payable under the 1971 act. On that basis, an employee who suffered non-economic loss prior to 1 December 1988 would never be able to claim compensation because that was not covered in the 1971 act. This bill seeks to limit statutory claims for non-economic loss to permanent impairments occurring on or after 1 December 1988. Claims for impairments arising before that date are only valid if an application for compensation is made before the introduction of the bill. The purpose is clearly to reverse what I think would be described as a liberal interpretation given to the provisions relating to non-economic loss which has allowed claims for impairments before 1 December 1988. However, we will not support those provisions in their current guise. We oppose these provisions as they are an attempt to restrict old act claims for non-economic loss whilst, at the same time, continue to use the old table of rates for compensation, which has not been indexed. It does seem to be a `heads we win, tails you lose' arrangement, and the government might like to revisit that issue. Certainly, until such time as that table has been indexed, we think the proposal is too one-sided and we will not support it.
I now move to the question of stress claims. Currently, under the act, an injury does not include an injury, disease or aggravation caused by `reasonable disciplinary action taken against the employee' or `failure by the employee to obtain a promotion, transfer or benefit in connection with his or her employment'. That definition is to be amended by this bill to include other activities which are regarded as `normal managerial activities'. The new subsection 5B(1) provides that a disease, injury or aggravation shall not be an injury for the purposes of the act if it is suffered as a result of, firstly, reasonable appraisal of the employee's performance or, secondly, any reasonable counselling actions taken in respect of employment or any reasonable suspension actions or, thirdly, any reasonable disciplinary action, whether formal or informal or, fourthly, a failure to obtain a promotion, reclassification, transfer or benefit.
The government did attempt to amend these provisions in 1996. Essentially, those amendments sought to preclude stress claims if they arose predominantly out of reasonable managerial or administrative actions that were undertaken. At the time, Labor's spokesperson, Bob McMullan, opposed the amendment and made these comments:
First, the changes to the circumstance in which compensation can be claimed are too severe. The changes will exclude many legitimate claims both for stress related injury and for other injury for which the Commonwealth, as the employer, should have an obligation to pay compensation. Second, the justification the minister has put forward for the changes—that the cost attached to stress claims has grave implications for the future sustainability of the scheme—does not seem to have any validity. 
Three years on from that contribution by my colleague Bob McMullan there is confirmation of his assessment at the time that there were no cost pressures that would justify this change. I might say at the outset that this proposal did have some initial attraction, and I can understand the superficial attraction of removing as a compensable injury or illness something arising from what is described as normal management activities. However, if you take the time to consider where that leads us, it provides a serious degradation of the operation of the compensation scheme. There are many quite reasonable, normal managerial activities that would be required of workers in a whole range of environments—that is, the management is not acting in an improper way or seeking to have the workers perform duties that would not be reasonably expected of them. Notwithstanding the fact that the management activity is reasonable and normal, it is not uncommon for an illness or an injury to occur in the actual conduct of those duties. If the parliament is going to make an exemption so that workers do not get compensation on the grounds that the activity they were undertaking was in pursuit of normal management activities, then frankly we open a door that would totally undermine the fabric of the compensation system. So we have some serious concerns about the road that this amendment would take us down and again would not support it. 
I congratulate the government on their initiative in the bill to bring up to speed, or at least closer to the mark, the provisions with respect to hearing loss. The bill provides greater access to compensation for employees who suffer hearing loss. Presently an employee requires a hearing loss of more than 20 per cent before that loss is compensable. This bill will reduce that to 10 per cent. That 10 per cent figure is comparable with Victoria, Tasmania and Western Australia. However, we note that South Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory operate a five per cent threshold, and that New South Wales operates a six per cent threshold. Therefore we believe, with a scheme that is clearly operating on a more cost-effective basis than any other in Australia, it is not unreasonable for the Commonwealth scheme to offer the same benefit as most of the states—South Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory—and certainly closer to New South Wales, and we will be moving an amendment to alter that to five per cent, although it has to be acknowledged that the reduction from 20 per cent to 10 per cent is clearly an improvement.
We will also be opposing the government's attempts to have a requirement that, after that initial hearing loss is made, claimants have to suffer hearing losses in increments of five per cent. We do not consider that, just because an initial claim is made, a worker who suffers a further four per cent loss should be precluded from getting any compensation for that additional loss. I do not think there is any sensible administrative reason behind that. I am not sure what the rationale for that particular adjustment is. But I make this observation about how I think it will operate in practice, if indeed it is introduced. I think you will find, remarkably, that doctors will certify people as having lost hearing in increments of five per cent. I say this genuinely to the government. I am not quire sure what the motivation is for picking a five per cent threshold for subsequent claims, but whatever that motivation is I think in practical terms it will not work. I cannot see the justification for it. As I said, if someone has a four per cent additional loss of hearing I do not see why they should not get compensation for that four per cent loss. I do not see why five per cent is a magical figure. But if indeed that is applied I would be willing to wager that most claimants will, quite miraculously, discover that their hearing loss has been in increments of five per cent anyway. I think it is an unenforceable provision and unjustified. So I strongly urge the government to rethink that.
Finally, I want to make a quick comment about the question of consultation. I did give my thanks at the outset for the consultation and the briefings that were made available to the opposition and I repeat those thanks again here. However, the explanatory memorandum does comment that there was wide consultation with bodies involved. I put on the record that that is not our understanding. Our advice is that there was very little, if any, consultation with the ACTU—the trade union movement—about this bill. I understand that some considerable time ago there had been some discussion, but in terms of the matters that have been brought before the parliament now it is not the case that consultation occurred. That may have been an oversight. It is in everybody's interests in matters of this kind that the departments, the people who administer these things and the people who are involved in representing the interests of the workers should all be consulted. My advice—contrary to the assertion in the explanatory memorandum—is that this did not occur. 
There are a number of other provisions in this bill which the Labor Party will support, and I imagine it will be a matter for some discussion in detail in the Senate—although I will during the consideration of the bill in detail in this House be moving a series of amendments to give effect to those matters that I have raised in the second reading debate. I would anticipate that there will be a careful scrutiny of these issues in the Senate. There may be further evidence, information and argument that the government want to advance in respect of those matters that we have flagged. I should say, however, that we are not minded to restrict access to compensation for workers without very strong and good cause. We are certainly not minded to do that against a background of a scheme which, by any measure, has not only operated very effectively in addressing the occupational health concerns of the Commonwealth but also done that efficiently in a very low-cost manner. I think the government will need to revisit those issues if it wishes to see those aspects of the bill looked on with any favour.",REPS,"<title>SAFETY, REHABILITATION AND COMPENSATION AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Thompson, Cameron, MP",LP,2001-04-05,"—Today we are discussing the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2000. This bill amends a couple of different pieces of legislation. I want to speak most directly about the amendments that this bill makes to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, which provides the legislative basis for the Commonwealth Public Service workers compensation scheme.
The SRC Act provides compensation and rehabilitation for injuries and diseases leading to death, incapacity or impairment. That is its basic function. It provides the capacity for such things as weekly incapacity payments, lump sum compensation for permanent impairment, lump sum compensation for non-economic loss, lump sum compensation and benefits for the dependents of the deceased, and the provision of household and attendant care services and rehabilitation.
Of course, the benefits that accrue to workers under this scheme are based on the degree and duration of the incapacity. It is appropriate then, when looking to make amendments to these bills, that the government seeks to balance a fair system of compensation together with a fair system of assessing that compensation. The government is to be congratulated for taking a responsible attitude to that and also for making a fair assessment of its own responsibility to provide a scheme that is funded adequately and that represents good value to the taxpayers of Australia who want to see injured workers properly compensated and want to see an effective system of compensation in place.
In looking at the background to this bill, I note that prior to the establishment of the act that is currently in place, the SRC Act, there was an earlier act in 1971. That particular act had a different style, a different modus operandi, when it came to assessing people's capacity to access compensation and those other benefits that are provided by the compensation scheme. It is interesting to note that, under that 1971 act, between 1976 and 1986 expenditure on compensation by the Commonwealth increased by 700 per cent, from $25.04 million to $203.29 million per annum. This was the period under that 1971 act, the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971. Under that act, a worker needed only to demonstrate that their employment was a contributing factor to the contraction of a disease. You can see that that particular wording is quite loose, and I think it is fair to say that having that fairly opaque and non-prescriptive description of the involvement of a worker's employment in their capacity to access compensation was very much a contributing factor to the subsequent blow-out in the expenditure on workers compensation. This illustrates very clearly the obligation that remains on the government to try and balance access to that area with the natural requirements of a government to be very frugal with taxpayers' dollars and to use those dollars responsibly; in other words, to have an effective compensation scheme but not to have it operating in some sort of profligate way. 
In some of the documentation that has been circulated among members looking at this particular bill, it is interesting to note that the number of claims being received by Comcare, which is the body that administers the SRC Act on behalf of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission, between 1995-96 and 1999-2000 has actually fallen by more than half. There were 15,657 in 1995-96 and 6,488 in 1999-2000. If we divide that up and look at some of the specific areas, stress claims fell from 1,846 to 620, which is about a third of that 1995-96 figure. That is a significant fall. Occupational overuse syndrome—I suppose RSI is what they are referring to there—fell from 1,550 to 795 and back injuries from 2,709 to 1,037. Obviously there has been a significant falling away of claims, and it is interesting to speculate as to what the reason might be. In trying to come to grips with this, I looked at the table and it struck me that there was one column, multiple injuries, where there was not that direct or general slide downwards in terms of the number of claims. Multiple injuries, for example, began in 1995-96 at the number of 49 and completed the term at 41. In the interim it had gone up and down to numbers like 20 and 60; it was all over the place.
It seems that some of these things are affected by not only the manifestation of the illness but also the culture of the workplace. I think that some of these issues—about whether people are aware of occupational overuse syndrome, for example, or whether they believe that stress is a big issue—can impact on the number of claims. I think it is very positive to note that overall decline in the number of claims. I do not think that you can make the same generalisation about multiple injuries, however, so it is interesting to compare the different rates of the number of claims being received.
One of the tables that was shown in the Bills Digest was very interesting with regard to cultures. The table provided in the Bills Digest on page 29 assesses the incident rate of injuries by jurisdiction and duration per thousand employees. It is interesting to note that the highest rates, by quite a margin, of injuries by jurisdiction and duration per thousand employees were in the ACT. That includes injuries that persisted for a period of five days or more, 30 days or more or 60 days or more. In all of those three categories, the rates are significantly higher in the ACT than in any other jurisdiction.
Interestingly, at the other end of the scale was the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth had the lowest numbers in all of those three categories. It is interesting to see the difference in culture that applies over that time. There is some reason why the ACT is more prone to having a higher number of injuries and a longer duration of their impact, and there is a reason why the Commonwealth's rate is lower; I would submit that it is largely cultural. It behoves the people administering the schemes—in other words, the governments in particular—to strive to maintain a culture in which the period of injury is reduced and the process back into rehabilitation and back into the workplace is expedited. That is something that clearly the Commonwealth is doing a very good job of, certainly in recent years.
I would like to go to a second table—the table on page 28, which covers in particular the Commonwealth scheme profile. Bear in mind what a wonderful record—according to the table on page 29—the Commonwealth has; it is obviously doing something very right. But, when we look at the performance of the Commonwealth over the period and, particularly, at the total workers compensation costs, as a gauge of what is going on, we see that the total workers compensation costs increased every year in the period from 1990 through to 1994-95 and then declined right through from 1995 to 1999. There is a little bit of a kicker at the end in 2000, where it is marginally up, but it is an interesting demonstration of the overall health of the system and the way in which it is operating. When costs are going up like that, there is a very real danger that the administration of the scheme can go beyond the pale and slip out of control, and it is necessary that governments watch it very carefully. So I am naturally very proud, as a  member of this government, to be able to say that the period at which it transferred from sliding upwards in terms of costs to coming back down occurred at the time when this government was elected. I believe that this government has been very effective in getting the culture right of how people deal with these issues. 
You do no want to deny someone the right to be able to access adequate compensation, particularly rehabilitation, to get back to work should they desire it, should they need it. Anyone injured in the workplace has a right to be able to get that. You do not want frivolous claims to come forward, and you want to be sure that people, when they are in the workplace, are keen to be there to work, to proceed, to provide for their families and to do all those sorts of things, and not to be worried about the consequences of an ill-administered scheme. You do not want some members to be tempted by some thought of malingering or to move off into a scheme because of the potential payouts they see that they might get. It is that culture of the workplace that this government has got right and that I think is overwhelmingly reflected in the figures I have just referred to.
The changes that are being made under this bill to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act basically clarify benefits for employees through amendments to that act. It enables earnings to be deducted from compensation that otherwise would be payable. It enables the normal weekly earnings of employees no longer employed to be indexed so as to standardise the calculation of the first 45 weeks entitlement to incapacity payments. It enables changes to the definition of the words `injury' and `disease', in particular to establish a requirement that it be demonstrated that employment made a material contribution to the condition. It also means that compensation is not payable for injury resulting from reasonable counselling in relation to performance. In other words, if there has been counselling to an employee about their performance, that should not result in compensation being payable.
It is unfortunate that, as things stand at the moment, it is possible for an employee who is underperforming and who receives counselling from their employer to make a claim. But what else would you expect if that were the case? It behoves the employer to tell their employee what problems they may have with their performance. If, as a result of that the employee claims it is stressing them out and a claim is issued, the way things stand at the moment, compensation can be paid. I do not think that is necessarily right. We cannot have a situation where underperforming employees are never told and are allowed to continue to underperform. There has to be a degree of rigour in the workplace and it is wrong that, in the process of giving counselling or, indeed, terminating employment at the end of it all, a claim can be made. As things stand at the moment, if a termination occurs it can result in a claim for compensation because of the stress, difficulty, high blood pressure or whatever else the employee may say has been brought about in their system. I do not think that is right at all.
It is right that this bill should set out to try to clarify that and to make it clearly understood on all sides. It means that there would be no access to lump sum payments for economic loss from impairment prior to December 1988. It also enables—and this is quite significant—those employees over 63 years of age to receive benefits. We are obviously recognising that age is not a barrier to employment and older employees should be entitled to benefits. That is something that this bill facilitates. It provides greater access to benefits for impairment caused by hearing loss. I heard the opposition spokesman applauding that move, and suggesting some additional changes that he would like to make. Whichever way you look at it, recognising hearing loss as an important area of impairment is a good outcome, and is something that should be dealt with adequately. 
It allows the dependants of a deceased worker to take common law action, and it ensures that people providing rehabilitative treatment and services meet necessary standards and that Comcare will oversee the establishment of the standards that those people would be required to meet. Standards across the system and accountability for those standards are becoming more clearly recognised, and it is appropriate that they should apply in this area. One other thing is that we do have changes in the licensing arrangements, with a generic licence replacing five specific licences. In itself, I do not think that is significance, but it is worthy of note. The bill does make changes to the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989 but, as I understand it, those changes are mostly technical and minor.
The bill sets about endeavouring to balance the cost of work related injury with access to fair compensation and rehabilitation for injured workers. I believe the change being introduced by the government will keep the system accountable and effective. If there is going to be an effective compensation scheme, it has to work hand in glove with the needs of the employees themselves, and I think this legislation recognises a lot of those difficulties that currently exist and targets them for change.
I note the comments in the Bills Digest from the Public Sector Union lament the fact that, because the system is currently operating in a financially stable manner, there is no need to make those changes. I do not think that is an appropriate way to look at the situation. It is important that we continue to look at our obligations and, regardless of the stability of the scheme, look at making the scheme better. I think that is the aim of this bill and that it is going about it in an effective and practical manner, and I certainly commend the bill to the House.",REPS,"<title>SAFETY, REHABILITATION AND COMPENSATION AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2001-04-05,"—I welcome this opportunity to participate in the debate on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2000. I would have to say, though, that I cannot agree with the contribution of the member who spoke before me, because I do not think that the bill, as presented to this House, is about making the compensation scheme governed by the bill `better', which was the word that he used.
When we deal in this place with issues in relation to workplace rights and the rights of employees, I think we often find a fairly substantial gap between the rhetoric of this government and the way in which it actually acts. There is always a division between what is said and what is done. I was interested to see the comments—I actually read the transcript; I did not hear the comments on air—of the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Tony Abbott, when he expounded on the philosophy of this government in relation to the treatment of employees. He did that fairly recently—on Sunday, 11 February—on the show Background Briefing, which is produced by Stan Corey and is heard on Radio National. As a premise, if you like, a foundation stone, to my contribution on this speech, I would like to go to the enunciated view of the minister about the way in which employers and employees should treat each other. On that radio show the minister said:
The basic view of human nature on which the industrial system was built is one that I don't think modern circumstances justify. See, we have moved on a long way over the last 100 years; people are better educated, there is much better regulation of health and safety and hours; the culture has changed so much in that time. We are not in the era of robber baron capitalism, we are not in the era of Karl Marx and the international workers of the world, and this view of human nature which says that basically workers are stupid, and basically employers are vicious, that is the view of human nature which underlies the industrial system, that is the view of human nature which says that workers and managers can't run their own operations together, can't work out their own arrangements, that's the view of human nature that says you've got to have courts and commissions to hold people's hands. Now I think we have gone well beyond that, I think that the average Australian worker is intelligent, creative, flexible, adaptable, dependable, and I think that the average Australian boss is sensible, reasonable and understands that everyone's got to get a fair go. 
The minister goes on:
The relationship between employers and employees should really be the kind of relationship which exists between partners in an enterprise, partners in an operation. It should really be something akin to the relationship which exists between the members of an extended family, the interest that they have in common has got to be the over-riding goal, the success of the entire enterprise has got to be the thing that is generally uppermost in people's minds.
So there we have the minister, on behalf of the government, announcing a philosophy in relation to the treatment of working people that working people and employers are all to be viewed as members of a great big happy family and that they are going to resolve any differences between them in the way in which families do over the dinner table. But when we test that rhetoric of family enjoyment, the Brady Bunch sort of approach to industrial relations, we find that a very different philosophy applies when this government actually comes to put those things into operation. I would have thought it was axiomatic that one of the things you would do for members of your family was look after them and extend to them the maximum possible care and concern when they were sick, injured or suffering from a disease. But, despite the rhetoric of happy families, this government has not been very good at that. When we come to look at the details of this bill, in many of its parts it indicates an intention to not treat people as family members but to treat them fairly badly.
I go to one example in the compensation area which I think shows that this government's family rhetoric, its happy family industrial relations rhetoric, and the reality are not the same. It is a related compensation question and it deals with the way in which the preclusions period is calculated for social security purposes. Madam Deputy Speaker, I am sure that, like me, you are frequently approached by working people who have been injured at work and, under state based compensation schemes, have got a lump sum and find themselves precluded from payment of social security for a period. That period has to be calculated according to a mathematical formula. The way in which that is calculated is that the lump sum is divided by a figure that is calculated to be $1 more than the maximum income allowable before the pension is cut off. So you divide the lump sum by that divisor and you come out with a number of weeks of preclusion.
The problem with the way in which this division works is that there was a change in the value of that divisor between the pre-GST period and the post-GST period. The system was changed so that, in recognition of the factoring in of the GST, the figure of $1 more than the maximum income allowable before the pension is cut off moved from a figure of $428 to a figure of $543.63. You do not have to have studied mathematics for too long to know that the larger the divisor sum the fewer the number of weeks that result. So it is of greater advantage for someone to have their lump sum divided by the post-GST divisor than by the pre-GST divisor.
I have been approached by members of the public caught up in the system who are being dealt with very unfairly because of this change. In this example, the constituent in question received a compensation lump sum in May—the GST came into effect on 1 July and in May he received a compensation lump sum. He is going to be expected to live off that compensation lump sum, predominantly in a GST affected environment—that is, by definition, as soon as he got to 1 July, he started paying for the GST. So the time in which he is expected to provide for his own sustenance and support out of this lump sum is almost wholly in a GST affected environment, but the divisor that was used was the pre-GST divisor.
So in those circumstances he has got an extra long preclusions period—a longer preclusions period than he would have got if his lump sum had been paid in July, August or September—even though as he goes and spends his lump sum on all of the ordinary goods and services that one needs he is encountering, day in, day out, GST on those products. I draw that anomaly to the House's attention, because it is an indication of the gap between the rhetoric—the rhetoric of happy families—and the reality. The reality is that if you can chisel a little bit out of someone's welfare then this government seems entirely predisposed to do that, and that is a local example of where that has happened. 
I turn to consideration of the compensation scheme that is dealt with in this bill. When we look at it we find that there is a reduction in entitlements being contemplated in this bill, and it is a reduction that will come about by dealing differently with the definitions of `injury' and `disease'. We need to note that in the compensation environment small changes of wording are not just technical matters; they actually affect substantive rights. We know that this bill will affect substantive rights, because when we look at the explanatory memorandum to the bill it tells us that the definitional changes relating to the words `injury' and `disease' are expected to save for the compensation scheme $17 million. So these are not technical changes of no real effect except some form of clarity for lawyers or what have you; these are substantive changes which mean that $17 million which would have flowed to employees who have got compensation now no longer will flow. So it is a change of substantive rights.
That change of substantive rights in the definition of disease and injury area is achieved through three different changes. Firstly, there is a change in the definition of `disease'. When this legislation was last amended, in 1988, the test regarding disease inserted into the act was that there needed to be a close connection between the employment and the disease. The meaning of these words has been considered in court cases, as one would expect with a compensation scheme, and the way the test is now working has led, as we know, in the scheme to financially acceptable results and acceptable claims rates. Notwithstanding that the current test appears to be working well and that there are no substantial problems with this compensation scheme, this bill heralds the government's intention to change the test to limit compensable circumstances to those where there is a material contribution by the employment to the employee's disease. Then `material contribution' is further defined as a `close connection'. So we go in this circle.
This is about defeating the intention of various court cases which have put a particular construction on the words in the current legislation, and that construction really has been to allow people to make application for and successfully receive compensation if there is a connection between the employment and the disease. Now this is a tightening of the test. So, as we know, $17 million to be saved. This is heralding the circumstance where, if this bill is passed, some workers who would have been compensated under the current legislation will no longer be compensated.
Secondly, there is a negative change for employees relating to the intersection of injury and disease. Currently, an injury is compensable if it occurred at work. That definition remains, and it would be pretty odd if that definition was not there in a workers compensation scheme. But—and it is an important `but'—if that injury occurs as a natural progression of a disease, the injury will be deemed not to be an injury. What does that all mean in plain English? That means that an employee who has had a heart attack or a stroke at work will no longer be able to receive compensation unless they can establish that the employment contributed in a material degree to that condition, the heart attack or the stroke.
When we look at that change we have got to ask ourselves how will courts, first of all, make the decision about whether or not there is a connection between the condition that manifested—maybe the heart attack, maybe the stroke—and work. The bill actually provides some guidance on that and says the factors that should be taken into account include the duration of employment and the medical predisposition of the employee. The wording there—`medical predisposition'—is very important. In considering how this will operate in practice, it is very important to note that it actually smashes two pretty important and, indeed, historic principles of workers compensation. The first principle that it smashes is the obvious principle that what happens at work is compensable. So it disregards that which has really been the foundation stone for our compensation arrangements. 
The second principle that it throws out is the principle that you basically take the employee as you find him or her, and you do not exclude people because of their medical predispositions. This principle has been important. Clearly we are aware that there are some categories of employees who, for good reason, face medical testing before they are given a job. But, as an ordinary rule for most ordinary occupations, people present at work and, if they are capable of doing the job, they are given the job and there is no forensic inquiry made of their family history, of lifestyle factors, of diet, of sexual practices, of substance abuse practices or of anything else which would result in a medical predisposition towards some particular conditions. I think the reasons for that are particularly clear: one, people would find such inquiries incredibly invasive in a privacy sense, and, two, they open up a huge potential for discrimination. It is of concern to me that, at a time when genetic technology is giving us a greater and greater capacity to forensically examine medical predisposition issues, the government in this bill is proposing to throw out the window that principle so that people can be excluded from work on the basis of a predisposition or their medical predisposition be taken into account in calculating their compensation rights. 
I ask members in this House: what is a rational manager in the Commonwealth Public Service supposed to do if this bill is passed into law? Prudent managers will want good information on what are the medical predispositions of the employees that they manage. If an employee that they manage has a heart attack at work, a stroke at work or what have you, the manager would want to be in a position to say, `Work did not cause that heart attack; work did not cause that stroke. That employee had a heart attack or stroke because they had a medical predisposition towards such a condition. I have the evidence of that; here is the medical predisposition evidence, so that means that that condition is not compensable.' So they would collect that medical predisposition evidence to have it in their kitbag against future compensation claims. I think we have to say, `Well, how will people ascertain whether or not people have a medical predisposition?' Are we contemplating huge surveys about what your father died of, what your father's father died of and what your father's father's father died of to determine these things that are used to calculate risk factors for various cancers and conditions? I think we are all aware of the genetic predispositions that one can have if one has a family history of certain conditions. Or do you go a step further as the genetic technology becomes more available in our community and say to the employee, `Go and get tested and I will look at that genetic material and see if you are genetically predisposed towards stroke conditions, heart attack conditions, breast cancer conditions or what have you'? I think there is a whole minefield here that arises because this bill does not accept the sort of foundation stone principle that, for ordinary occupations, you basically accept the worker as you find him or her and that, if they develop a condition, if they have an injury or a disease which manifests at work, it is compensable.
Third, this bill seeks to extend the exemption from compensation for injury or disease if that arises from managerial action, so it is an extension to an exemption taking out a pool of workers from circumstances which would otherwise be compensable. Currently the act seeks to prevent compensation claims being used to obstruct legitimate management action and contains an exclusionary provision. It provides that compensation is not payable in respect of an injury which arises from reasonable disciplinary action or a failure to obtain a promotion, transfer or benefit in connection with the employment. This bill seeks to extend that and to amend it so that what are exempted are actions which are to be regarded as normal management responsibilities—for example, an injury resulting from a reasonable appraisal of the employee's performance; a reasonable counselling action, whether formal or informal; a reasonable suspension action and the like. It is pretty easy when dealing with this issue to call to mind some very negative stereotypes of the public service and to sort of offhandedly say, `Well, why should someone be entitled to compensation if they become stressed arising from being chastised by their manager?' That was the sort of picture that was being drawn for us by the member who spoke before me.  
I think we need to free up our thinking a bit and say that, when you look at who this compensation scheme actually operates for, there are lots of circumstances which are far more serious and where the issues about managerial action and its reasonableness are far more vexed. I note in particular that this compensation scheme applies to the Australian defence forces. I think we are all aware in this House that there have been some problems faced by the defence forces in terms of the culture that applies within the defence forces, including the treatment by superiors of subordinates. I do not put that as being every section of the defence forces, but there certainly are sections that have been very publicly examined where there have been very substantial problems. I think we are all aware that very recently a $2,000 fine was applied to a major of the 3rd Battalion Royal Australian Regiment as a result of an incident involving a subordinate which occurred during exercises in Malaysia. 
We have got a problem with those sorts of culture questions and, given that the defence forces have recently been required to attend a two-hour discussion on bastardisation issues, I think it is on the public record that there are those problems. And, given that it is on the public record that there are these problems, it is not that hard to imagine that, in some sections of the defence forces where there remain issues with these kinds of cultural problems, in an informal disciplinary setting a superior could treat a subordinate in a way which not only causes stress, alarm and fear for that subordinate but might actually result in a manifest visible injury. I think that is not too far from where we have been in terms of the public debate. I think we can all imagine that happening, given some of the problems of culture that we have been well advised of in the defence forces. If these amendments are accepted, that subordinate, no matter how injured, would not be able to make a claim for compensation unless he or she could show that the action taken by the superior was unreasonable. We can obviously all envisage circumstances which every human being would say were unreasonable, but I think we have to recognise that in this area there is a big area of grey and some of that grey is of a very dark shade when we are dealing with workplaces which have got the sorts of cultural problems which appear to persist in sections of our defence forces. So I think we have got to be fairly careful about this amendment, and I would say that it is simply not justified.
Finally, I come to a comment that was made by the member who spoke before me, which was that there was a blow-out, I think was his word, in compensation costs. That is simply not true when we are looking at this compensation scheme. The number of claims lodged is going down, the number of claims accepted is going down, and this is a fully funded scheme. Consequently, there is no need for the government to act. The scheme is in satisfactory form at the moment in respect of these issues about which I have spoken.",REPS,"<title>SAFETY, REHABILITATION AND COMPENSATION AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"St Clair, Stuart, MP",NP,2001-04-05,"—I rise to support the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 and the importance of this bill to good government. The fact is that we really propose amendments to two acts: the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, the SRC act, which is the legislative basis for the Commonwealth public sector workers compensation scheme; and the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989, the ICNA act, which establishes a scheme to assess industrial chemicals imported to and manufactured in Australia for their health and environmental effects. 
The amendments to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act proposed in this bill will improve the operation of the Commonwealth workers compensation scheme while at the same time ensuring that the act reflects the government's commitment to balancing the costs of work related injury with access to fair compensation and effective rehabilitation for injured workers. Again, it is about good, strong government. The amendments are largely of a housekeeping nature. They include amendments based on advice from the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission and amendments which rectify unintended legislative anomalies. 
The bill proposes to streamline the act's currently complex and prescriptive licensing arrangements while closely paralleling existing arrangements. The five categories of licence now available will be replaced with a single generic licence, which will provide scope for both self-insurance and claims management. Applications for licences will still be determined by the commission but within a far less prescriptive framework.
Amendments are also proposed to streamline the funding arrangements for regulation of workers compensation and occupational health and safety in the Commonwealth jurisdiction by providing for one regulatory contribution. The Commonwealth scheme recognises the importance to both the employee and the employer of arranging a safe return to work as quickly as possible. I think that all of us who have employed people over a period of time are aware of how necessary and important it is to get people safely back to work as soon as possible. Particularly in small business—as you would know, Madam Deputy Speaker Gash, having come out of small business—if there is some sort of an accident where someone is away, they are always a valuable employee and, as a valuable employee, you do not want them away; you want them back at work, bringing their skills and their contribution back to the business to enable it to continue to grow. For those of us who may have only five, six, seven or eight employees, it is absolutely imperative that assistance is provided to get those people safely back to work as soon as is possible. 
The act currently gives Comcare the responsibility of ensuring that rehabilitation providers have the qualifications, proven effectiveness, availability and cost efficiencies to deliver quality services to both employers and employees. The approval provisions protect injured employees by ensuring that persons providing treatment and services meet acceptable standards. Again, that will make a very strong contribution in enabling the work force to come back safely to work, which is what is important. The bill proposes to improve the current processes for approving new rehabilitation providers, provide a statutory basis for existing guidelines, enable a fee to be charged to cover the costs of the application process and ensure that the approval can be revoked if a rehabilitation provider is no longer able to meet the standards required, thus providing a safety valve to make sure that the best possible service is provided for the people needing rehabilitation to get them back to work safely. Other amendments will standardise the basis by which compensation is calculated for the first 45 weeks of a claim and clarify that dependants of deceased employees have access to common law—and we know how important that is. 
This bill also includes minor or technical amendments to four other acts. The Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act 1999 is amended to correct a technical anomaly arising from the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Amendment Act 1999. The Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 is amended to enable taxation information to be provided to Comcare as well as to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission. The National Occupational Health and Safety Commission Act 1985 is amended to reflect the change of name of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991 is also amended, consequential upon the amendments relating to collection of premiums under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 which are proposed elsewhere in the bill. 
This bill is yet another example of this coalition government helping employees in a practical and non-threatening way to employers. I think this demonstrates to the Australian business community and to those who are employees of that business community that there has to be a fair and equitable system in operation and one that provides good government. This side of the House feels that that is enormously important and has demonstrated that successfully over the last 5½ years or so. This bill implements what was parliament's original intent at the time the legislation commenced operation, during the previous Labour administration. 
The original act requires a material contribution by employment to a disease before compensation is payable. However, case law indicates that the act has not achieved the parliament's original intent and this bill therefore includes an amendment to restore this intent by making it very clear that an employee's employment is not to be taken to have contributed in a material degree to his or her disease unless there is a close connection between the employee's employment and the disease. We all know how important it is to provide good government to make sure we provide adequate and proper assistance and rehabilitation to people who are injured at work, and to make sure they return to work as quickly and as safely as is possible. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,"<title>SAFETY, REHABILITATION AND COMPENSATION AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2001-04-05,"—It gives me great pleasure to be taking part in the debate on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2000. This is a very complex bill. What does it do and why? Leaving aside the industrial chemical section, which is generally fairly minor and very technical, I will concentrate on issues relating to safety, rehabilitation and compensation. The bill makes a number of changes to the compensation regime for Commonwealth employees. Some of these changes Labor is supporting and some we are opposing. I said in a speech in this House in June 1997 that—again, referring to employees who come under this legislation—of all the benefits the trade union movement has won for the working people of this country over a long period, there are certainly none more important than workers compensation. This bill gives me the opportunity of striking a blow for the trade union movement, particularly in view of the major attacks on trade unions and on the people involved with them that we hear every question time. In view of that, it is worth while recognising the valuable work that the trade union movement does in relation to workers compensation.
This bill covers, principally, 206,000 employees of the Australian government, Telstra, Australia Post, the Australian defence forces and the ACT government. I have some concerns that some of the changes being proposed in this legislation are designed to reduce the basic safety net entitlements of workers compensation. In the speech that I have referred to that I made in 1997, I spoke about the government's intention to change the safety, rehabilitation and compensation legislation to make it harder to claim compensation, and this legislation has proved me correct. We must remember that this bill is specifically aimed at Commonwealth employees and no-one else. I feel that government members often forget that they are the employers of more than just their own personal staff. They are employers of the entire Commonwealth Public Service, and the political decisions that they take affect those employees, and this bill certainly does.
This probably comes back to the stress related issues that are contained in this bill and to our reluctance on this side of the House to compromise in the area of stress, because stress, whether it is caused by a decision of an immediate employer or whether it is caused by a government decision, is stress. If stress happens in the workplace, irrespective of the reasons, we believe it should be fully compensatable—which I think is the current decision—and the government is trying to alter that.
Some of the other changes proposed in this bill clearly demonstrate that, as employers, the government and government members care little about the rights of their employees to fair compensation for work related disease and injury. However, I am willing to grant that there are some positives in this bill. Labor is supporting measures such as extending access to workers compensation to people aged 63 and over. It is an anomaly in the legislation that currently all workers compensation for Commonwealth employees ceases at 63. This arbitrary age is a puzzling one. I would question why the drafters of the legislation chose it but, seeing that we are now changing it in this bill, the question is moot. Labor is supporting the changes to the hearing loss rules. At present a person must suffer 20 per cent loss before they are compensated. This bill changes that to 10 per cent and brings it in line with Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania. The shadow minister has moved an amendment to this legislation to reduce that figure to five per cent. Five per cent of hearing loss is compensatable in South Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland, and six per cent in New South Wales. Whatever the final figure is—whether it is five per cent or 10 per cent—it will be better than the current 20 per cent hearing loss required at present. 
However, there are a number of other measures within this bill that the Labor Party will not be supporting. We will not support the erosion of workers' rights. It is as simple as that. Let me just say that, because of my background in the trade union movement, I feel very strongly about protecting what we have won over a long period of time. Once again, in defending the role of trade unions, and even the role of people who were previously trade union officials and are now in this place, I make the observation that there are more lawyers on the government side of the House than there are union officials on our side. Given the choice of union official or lawyer, I know which one I would choose. I know which profession cares more about people, about their working conditions and about their financial situation, their safety and their wellbeing—and, of course, union fees are a lot cheaper than legal fees.
Government members and ministers who spend much of their time bashing the trade union movement and the people who work in it should remember that there are a lot more lawyers here than there are union officials. As a representative of my constituents and as someone who has fought most of his life for the rights of workers, I will not stand idly by and watch the achievements gained over many years eroded by this heartless government. What this legislation does in a very technical way is reduce access to workers compensation for workers incapacitated as a result of their employment. This legislation makes changes to the definition of what a disease is and what an injury is. It gets very technical in defining each term. It also makes the onus of proof that any such disease or injury is indeed work related, and therefore compensatable, that much more difficult.
Currently, the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act sets out separate tests for establishing entitlements to compensation for disease and injury. A disease requires employment to be a material contribution before it is compensatable, whereas an injury is only required to occur at work. Court decisions have held that a natural progression of disease which causes a disease at work is compensatable. The easiest example of this is someone with a history of heart attacks who has a heart attack at work. That would be compensatable under the act.
This bill seeks to overcome these court decisions, and any injury caused as a natural progression of a disease not associated with work would not be considered an injury under the act and there would be no workers compensation payable. The government are claiming that the reason that they are doing this is that the original intent of the legislation introduced by Labor in 1988 has been subverted by the courts. The obvious question I would ask is: why is the government so interested in enforcing Labor's intent? When have they ever been interested in making sure Labor's policies have been introduced and enforced in full?
There must be another reason, and there is. It is the sheer bloodymindedness of an ideologically driven government that seeks to destroy the entitlements and rights that workers and their unions have achieved over a period of time. It must be, because there is no economic argument for making it harder to claim compensation. In the 10 years before the introduction of the act in 1988, Commonwealth expenditure on workers compensation had increased by over 700 per cent and there was a real problem. However, now the situation is very different. The scheme is self-funded and the premiums are the lowest in Australia, currently at one per cent. In Western Australia and the ACT they are over three per cent and in New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania they are all nudging the three per cent mark. Only in Queensland are they less than two per cent: currently they are around 1.8 or 1.9 per cent. 
We must also realise that the number of claims is already dropping, and has been since 1991. Recent figures bear this out. In 1996 there were 28,807 claims; in 2000 there were fewer than 20,000 claims. This was not achieved by making it harder to claim via legislation, such as this is attempting to do; it was achieved with the introduction of occupational health and safety legislation and the subsequent action on that issue. The focus shifted away from compensation and into prevention, which, as we all agree, is always better than cure. There is no need for these changes: the scheme is not under threat.
Another problem with going into such detail and complexity, as the government does with this legislation, is that the victim's costs of claiming compensation will go up. The more technical you are and the more demands you place on determining the connection between the injury or disease and the employment, the more you are reliant on medical assessment—expensive medical assessment. How is a `contributing factor', a `close connection' or a `material degree' different from each other? Who decides? There will be the employee's doctor and the employer's doctor and of course they will not agree, so there are other experts to be called in, all at great expense.
The amendments in this bill will result in a more restrictive regime than any of the states currently have. This legislation will result not only in a blow-out in medical expenses but also in a blow-out in legal expenses. When the rules are made very complex and technical, more disputes will arise as people disagree over whether or not they qualify for compensation: one doctor says one thing and another doctor says another thing. Where does it wind up? It winds up in the court of law as challenges to rulings are made. The more complex the definitions and legislation are, the more lawyers will charge to sort them out and the individual cases will last longer, which again adds to the expense.
Here we can use the current situation in New South Wales, where its government is attempting to redraft its WorkCover legislation. One of the major problems there, and I quote from an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 28 March, is that lawyers now earn almost as much as injured workers from WorkCover, taking $422 million a year—compared with $438 million in benefit payments—almost equal to the amount of money that the workers get out of being injured. That, I would suggest, is one of the difficulties that we may also find in this piece of legislation, that the legal costs will explode.
Lost productivity and costs are also associated with properly conducting a court case. Some years ago, as a union official, I witnessed an industrial accident and I volunteered to be a witness for the injured worker. I was invited to go down to the workers compensation tribunal. I went down there on three or four mornings, a couple of afternoons, a day here and a day there. It all added up to lost productivity as far as I was concerned, and also for my employer. In the end, I was not called to give evidence. So that shows you that there is some inefficiency in how workers compensation is carried out on the legal side. This legislation has the potential to exacerbate the situation that I have just referred to. We currently have a compensation regime that is more efficient and costs less than the state schemes, but this bill will make the compensation scheme harder and more costly to access. It does not make any sense without looking at it from a purely ideological point of view. 
There are many within the government, particularly cabinet members, that are far greater ideologues than anyone on our side of the House. They say, `Damn the torpedoes. Let's just get the worker.' I think that relates to the previous minister for industrial relations, the new Minister for Defence, who seems to forget that no business can function without somebody working there. Workers create the profits for the companies—it is as simple as that. Yet this government at every turn seeks to destroy the wages, conditions and entitlements and protection that workers have won over a number of years. Some of this legislation is good and some of it is very technical but, like much of the government's agenda, it is mostly anti-worker.
My contribution so far relates to my own experience and is based on the information that we have been provided through the shadow minister, the trade union movement and the Bills Digest. I once again recognise the role that the trade union movement plays in all aspects of the industrial legislation, particularly in compensation. I notice that in his contribution the shadow minister commented that the trade unions had not been greatly involved in drawing up this legislation. If that is the case, that is certainly a shame.
I would like to finalise a couple of points that relate generally to workers compensation, particularly for people who work for the government. One issue that has caused confusion amongst people who receive a settlement for a compensatable injury is the difference between compensation for non-economic loss, which is for pain and suffering and loss of quality of life, and compensation for economic loss. There are two clear distinctions here: non-economic loss and economic loss. Compensation for non-economic loss is made solely for the pain and suffering and expenses resulting from an injury. It also is paid for loss of limb or impairment and for loss of enjoyment of life. It does not contain any amount to compensate the person for lost earnings or lost capacity to earn as a result of an injury. Compensation for economic loss is for exactly that—the loss of income. 
Many compensation cases are based on a lump sum out-of-court settlement. In such cases, it is usually taken that 50 per cent of the lump sum is for economic loss and 50 per cent is seen as compensation for medical expenses, legal fees, pain and suffering. That 50 per cent economic loss component is then divided by a single person's cut-off figure under the pension income test—currently $543.63 per week—to set the number of weeks for which this sum provides replacement earnings. A number of my constituents who have received out-of-court settlements for injuries are not aware that 50 per cent of that settlement will be used as income replacement, which will affect their social service payments. 
It seems to be a weakness in the system that injured workers are not advised of this, and in many cases they go away from the court feeling as though they have got a lot more out of it than they actually have. On other occasions, they spend a lot of the money they receive for economic loss on maybe fixing up the house, on family related expenses or on other things only to find that they have not got sufficient money to actually see their way through. Many such people agree to a settlement under duress, in that they are advised that the figure offered is the maximum they can get and that if they proceed with a court settlement they may get less. This is something that would cause considerable stress also. The worker who has been involved in a case for a long period of time reaches the point where they have got to make that decision, and they act then on the advice of their advisers. Whether it is right or not, I do not know.
The period for which income replacement applies is referred to as the `preclusion period'. The member for Lalor, in her contribution, raised this point. It does appear that this problem is fairly widespread. Injured workers whose preclusion period spans the introduction of the GST also suffer a further economic loss in that their preclusion period is based on the pre-GST income test rate of $422.90 per week and no adjustment is made to take into account the post-GST income test rate of $543 per week, which would result in a reduction in the preclusion period and therefore an earlier entitlement to social security if they were unable to continue work. This seems to be a major concern amongst workers, and for those people whose precluded period spans the introduction of the GST there is certainly a disadvantage. This, once again, shows how the GST is affecting many aspects of the lives of working people. It is quite possible that this was unintended initially, but the government has been asked to fix it up. I have actually put a motion on notice regarding this issue. (Time expired)

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2001-04-05,"—I understand it is the wish of the House to consider the requested amendments together, and on that basis I move: 
That the requested amendments be made. 
These amendments incorporate the Excise Tariff and Customs Tariff proposals introduced into the House by me on Wednesday evening to the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001 and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001 respectively. The tariff proposals to be incorporated into these bills by these amendments reduce the rate of excise on certain draught beer, leading to lower prices for beer served over the bar. The Labor Party, having determined on a policy of obstruction in the Senate, stated that it would vote against the original proposals of the government on beer excise contained in these bills.
—The ones that broke your promise.
—The government wanted to keep its promise, as the member opposite knows, and the Labor Party has sought and has actually prevented, through its numbers in the other place, the government from keeping its promise to the Australian people. We want to keep our promises, whereas of course the Labor Party has a history of promising things to the Australian people prior to an election—it is prepared to do anything and say anything to crawl into office—and once it gets into office breaking those promises. Just remember its promises not to sell Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank and remember the l-a-w tax cuts that did not actually occur.
Madam Deputy Speaker, the Labor Party, in its fairly shoddy approach to this particular matter, has been acting as an agent of the breweries, seeking to minimise their tax liability and to obtain a windfall gain. The Australian Democrats have also indicated their opposition to the bills in their original form. Of course, one of the attributes of being successful in politics is being able to understand where the numbers are and it simply was mathematically impossible for the government to obtain the numbers in the Senate—
—The ones that broke your promise.
—No, we wanted to keep our promise. Because we were unable to secure our legislation in the other place, we have sat down and talked with the Australian Democrats in order to reduce the rates of excise and customs duty as they apply to draught beer to secure the support of the other place for these bills.
It is also instrumental to know that the Labor Party did want to return the $115 million to the breweries. But the government wants to allocate the extra excise collected on draught beer since 1 July 2000 to an independent foundation which will focus on preventing alcohol and other licit substance abuse. The Prime Minister has been able to sit down with Senator Meg Lees, the Leader of the Australian Democrats, and has been able to reach an agreement on allocating the additional excise to a new alcohol education and rehabilitation foundation. This charitable trust, which is independent, will have the resources to make a significant contribution towards the prevention of alcohol and other licit substance abuse, including petrol sniffing. The ALP wanted to give the money back to their friends in the breweries but the government and the Democrats have been prepared to sit down and come to an arrangement which will see cheaper prices for beer over the bar, and also we will have this $115 million for setting up a foundation for alcohol education and rehabilitation. 
There has been a memorandum of understanding between the government and the Democrats, and it is particularly important for this to be an independent foundation. There will be very substantial benefits to the entire Australian community as a result of the understanding entered into by the government and Senator Meg Lees, the Leader of the Australian Democrats—an understanding which is much better than the Labor Party could have achieved, because they simply wanted to return the money to the brewery companies.
The amendments will reduce the excise rates applying to draught beer, effective from midnight on 4 April 2001. The excise rates applying from 1 July 2000 until 3 April 2001 remain unchanged and are validated by this bill. This is an example of how the government is prepared to sit down and look at a situation to bring about real and meaningful outcomes. I commend the amendments to the chamber.",REPS,<title>EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2001</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,18,1
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2001-04-05,"— These are the beer backflip bills. There is no question about it. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration who has just spoken can obfuscate as much as he likes, but this is because the government has been forced by Labor to honour a promise. I think that the explanation we have just heard from the parliamentary secretary shows him up as a disgrace in this place. For him to come and argue that rubbish in this chamber just goes to show how pathetic a person he is. You would think he would have enough pride in his job to actually prepare a better defence. But no, he is the lazy one. He has been fobbed off with the task of having to sell the backflip because the Treasurer has not got the courage to come into this place and do it himself. Baldrick, with all his cunning plans, has not got the ticker to come into the House and announce his backflip so he sends the parliamentary secretary in his place with the most pathetic excuses that I have ever heard in my life.
Let us go through them one by one. He said that Labor obstructed the government delivering on its promise. I will tell you what the government's promise was. On 14 August 1998, just before the election, John Howard said:
Across the board there is virtually no change in relation to alcohol. A tiny CPI equivalent rise in relation to ordinary beer. Perhaps a small reduction for low alcohol beer.
Again on 14 August 1998, a South Australian business luncheon was told:
... I think there will be a slight reduction, very slight reduction in the price of low alcohol beer.
And then on the John Laws program on 23 September, he said:
There'll be no more than a 1.9 per cent rise in ordinary beer.
He went on to say:
... we have taken care to ensure that there is no significant increase in the price of alcohol and will be no greater ... in relation to beer for example, than the normal CPI increase.
So what was he telling John Laws? That there would be a 1.9 per cent increase in ordinary beer. If that is not enough in terms of public radio, he also told his party room meeting—and we have that in the words of Ian Cameron, a defeated Liberal member. When this shameful deceit of the government had been exposed, he went on radio on 25 February 2000 and said: 
But we were always told and I've got this from reliable information and I've checked it. It would be around 1 to 2 per cent. 
So for the parliamentary secretary to have the gall to come into this place and accuse Labor of stopping the government implementing what he has promised is an absolute deceit. It is just continuing the deceit. They should be ashamed for saying it.
—You are misleading the parliament.
 (Mrs Gash)—Order!
—The Prime Minister said that the price of ordinary beer would go up 1.9 per cent, yet he oversaw a program that put it up more than 10 per cent. That is a shameless explanation on your part, Parliamentary Secretary. Why don't you lift your game? You are a disgrace to the parliament—to come in and assert that the Prime Minister's promise was at 1.9 per cent. He goes into the election campaign, and you were with him, saying that it would be 1.9 per cent.
—Order! Who are you referring to as `he'?
—I am talking about the parliamentary secretary.
—Name him by name, thank you. It is the parliamentary secretary.
—Peter Slipper is his name.
—Order! Thank you. You may continue.
—It is a pleasure. Maybe you can ask him to refrain from making his interjections, if we are talking about the forms of the House, Madam Deputy Speaker.
—I will deal with the circumstances in the chamber.
—Good. I am just making the point, and reinforcing it, that the Prime Minister gave an absolute watertight guarantee that the price of ordinary beer would go up only 1.9 per cent, and it is Labor that has forced him to honour that promise. Make no mistake about it. Labor said, `You can't go to the last election promising one thing and come into the House and do another.' We have insisted that he honour that promise. So we claim victory, Madam Deputy Speaker, in terms of these bills that come back into the chamber. For the beer backflip bills, thank Labor. It is Labor that has driven this campaign. It is Labor that has secured the commitment. It is Labor that has forced the government, kicking and screaming, to honour what the Prime Minister said at the last election. (Extension of time granted)
There was another point made that Labor would have given back to the breweries the money which was given to the charities as a result of the wrongfully collected excise. Again, what a shameful deceit. 
—It's true. Admit it.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, do I have to put up with this rabble from this lazy person? We had always said that the money that had been unlawfully collected should go to charities. Indeed, there is actually a press release, if this lazy parliamentary secretary had bothered to get briefed on it, that sets out the sorts of programs that we believe this unlawfully collected money should go to.
At the time the government was not even contemplating this, because it was really saying through the Treasurer, `We can't do it. It's impossible to do.' We have forced the government to do the impossible, but what it really highlights is that you cannot believe a thing the Treasurer says. To say that something is impossible and then to have legislation brought in on his behalf that shows it is possible not only highlights the lack of ticker on the part of the Treasurer; it also highlights the fact that he cannot be believed on anything that is said about the GST. We were proposing that the funds go into a mechanism for distribution to the charities. We never argued that the money should go back to the breweries. For the parliamentary secretary to assert that is just arrant nonsense, it is a continuation of the deceit and it is part of the government's denial.
There is another dimension to this whole thing, and it is the way the government treats the parliament with contempt. This was a Prime Minister who argued that he was going to lift the standards in this place: he saw the parliament as a great institution, he wanted it to debate properly, he wanted it to have access to information. When this legislation was brought into this House on Tuesday night, we had no advance notice of it. We had not been told of any of the details that had been negotiated. We are expected to debate it sight unseen. We have been required to come into this place now, knowing that a message was coming across from the Senate, and again, sight unseen, are expected to deal with another explanatory memorandum, this time taking account of amendments made in the Senate.  
But the government has refused to produce the Treasury figures that were relied upon to arrive at the backflip. What has this government got to hide? Why won't it allow Treasury to produce the figures on which its calculations are made? We are entitled to know, having secured victory, whether all of the money unlawfully obtained through the excise is returned to them, because that is what the Democrats assert. They are asserting that all of the money that was collected—effectively unlawfully, because this did not have the authority of the parliament—should be returned. But has it all been returned? How can we tell unless we have got the actual figures from the Treasury? The government is hiding them yet again. It is not the first time, because we have also asked for the calculations from the government on how it arrived at its assessments on what the petrol excise would yield.
Madam Deputy Speaker Gash, you will remember that we were arguing that the return to Australian motorists could be funded because the government was collecting a windfall from moneys that it had never budgeted for in relation to petrol excise. The government still refuses to have Treasury release those figures, and it is at it again in relation to beer excise. How were the calculations arrived at? That is the question that we want to continue to pursue. We will claim victory for having forced the government to honour its promise; we want to know whether all the ill-gotten gains have been returned.
It was not just Treasury that was involved in this exercise; Econtech was brought in. Econtech happened to be the Prime Minister's preferred modeller. It is his modeller of choice. He is not using Treasury figures, or he is hiding them, but he is using Econtech as his preferred modeller to have work done for the Democrats in arriving at the basis for a negotiated outcome. (Extension of time granted) What we have really got is not Treasury setting the rate, by the look of things, but a private modeller setting the rate, yet the information is still not available to us. 
I am highlighting that for this simple reason: when the government was forced on the back foot and knew that it was facing defeat in the Senate over its broken promise on beer, it was arguing that the budget would take a hit. The figure that came out in terms of the hit to the budget was $185 million. Members would probably be aware of that figure because it was in the media in advance of this whole debate. Effectively, what has been given back, as far as we can ascertain, is $155 million. In other words, there is a missing $30 million on the face of it.
We want to get to the bottom of this. We want to know on what basis Treasury have relied for their calculations. Where are their calculations, what are their parameters and what are their assessments? We want to know on what basis Econtech was used to whittle away these figures, because we have a missing $30 million. If it is borne out that there is $30 million missing, that too should be returned to the beer drinkers of the country. Understand the symbolism of this: here we have the Democrats and the government, the co-authors of the dirty deal on the GST, being forced to capitulate together. Do we know whether they have capitulated in full or has there been some attempt to claw back more of it and not pay the full weight? Not only the Democrats did the deal in relation to this; the Australian Hoteliers Association were also involved in the negotiations. I think they have an obligation to explain to their membership whether or not there is $30 million missing. 
I cannot answer these questions here and now. This debate and the amount of time allowed for it is not going to allow us to go away and do the calculations. I think there is still a serious issue here. The government, together with its co-authors, have been forced to capitulate, but have they clawed back some of it? In the process of getting a deal have they denied beer drinkers full return? I made this point on the night the Democrats announced the outcome. They said that the price of an ordinary strength middy of beer would come down by 11c. Calculations that we saw in the lead-up to the announcement suggested that, if the Prime Minister's promise was delivered in full, there should have been a reduction of about 15c for a middy of beer—in other words, there is a missing 4c.
I think it is incumbent on the government to come clean on this issue. We want to know. We are claiming victory for having forced them to honour their promise but we want to know if they have delivered it in full. The amount of time allowed for the debate as well as the fact that the government have given us no access to the basis for calculations or the basis upon which the deal was cut leaves us suspicious, because the people who were involved in this were Econtech—the Prime Minister's preferred modeller—the Democrats, Australian hoteliers and the government. Labor, having forced the government's hand, was not even included in the discussions. We are entitled to know and to not be treated as shabbily as the government continue to treat us in relation to this issue.
I know they are sore losers and I know they do not like having to do the backflips, but we will continue to force them to do them. This is more GST roll-back. This is a win for the beer drinkers of Australia and it also attests to the commitment on the part of the Australian Labor Party to actually stand up for ordinary people and not have them deceived by the government or let them believe that the government can get away with it. We have stood up for them, we have delivered for them and we have forced the government to roll back the GST in relation to beer. We have delivered a huge win for the beer drinkers of the country, but the government hides the detail so that we still do not know whether they are being paid in full.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2001-04-05,"—What a bag of wind. The member opposite huffed and puffed and filled in 15 minutes of the time of parliament. The Labor Party claims on the one hand that it is interested in fiscal rectitude and the continuation of surpluses, but on the other hand it is prepared to plunder the budget on behalf of its friends in the brewing companies. It is obvious that packaged beer comprises some 75 per cent to 80 per cent of the total beer sales, and the new tax system package was absolutely explicit on the commitment with respect to packaged beer. What the Australian Labor Party has done by refusing to support government legislation in the Senate is to force the government to break a promise it made to the Australian people—a promise, incidentally, that was one of the bases on which the Australian people continued to trust the government with the keys of office post the last election.
The Member for Hotham also is contradictory. At some stage he talks about our collecting excise unlawfully. Then he claims it is wrongfully and then he returns to unlawfully. I want to reassure the parliament that the government has not acted unlawfully. As the member opposite knows, the Excise Act provides for excise rates on tariff proposals to be the basis for collection and provides for explicit protection. These mechanisms have been in place since 1901. The Excise Act requires formal validation of proposals within 12 months and that is what this legislation does. Summing up, the government has accepted the realities that we do not have the numbers in the Senate. The Labor Party has forced us to break our promise. The member opposite has misled the House. He ought to apologise. At the end of the day, I commend the motion I have moved to the chamber.

"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2001-04-05,"—In view of the debate I have just been witnessing, it is a great victory for the beer drinkers of Australia that they have been saved, with the efforts of the Labor Party. I am here this afternoon to speak generally in support of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2000. However, there are a few provisions contained in the bill which I am concerned about. I will go into those as I go through my speech. I understand that the provisions will be referred to a Senate committee for careful scrutiny and perusal before the bill is ultimately resolved in the parliament. The purpose of the bill is principally to amend the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1998. Five other acts have minor technical, non-controversial amendments which I support. They include the Industrial Chemicals (Notification of Assessment) Act 1989, the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act 1999, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission Act 1985 and the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991.
The SRC Act covers Commonwealth public sector employees and employees of licensed corporations under the age of 65 years and is the basis of the compensation scheme for these workers. The original SRC Act provides for weekly incapacity payments; lump sum compensation for permanent impairment; lump sum compensation for non-economic loss; compensation and benefits for dependents of deceased employees; and the provision for domestic and attendant care services and rehabilitation for injuries and diseases connected with or arising out of employment. Comcare administers the SRC Act under the auspices of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission. Under the bill, employers are able to self-insure against liabilities if they are licensed to do so. The SRC Act will be amended to replace five categories of licences with a single generic licence. As before, the licence applications will continue to be determined by the commission under a less regulatory framework. This bill also contains other amendments in relation to licensing arrangements.
The bill also works to streamline the funding arrangements for the regulation of workers compensation and occupational health and safety under the Commonwealth jurisdiction by providing for a single contribution. The bill includes amendments to ensure that Comcare's financial arrangements are consistent with the requirements of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997.
A number of improvements are made to benefits under the SRC compensation scheme, including augmented access to compensation for employees who have suffered hearing loss. The bill reduces the hearing loss requirement from more than 20 per cent hearing loss to more than 10 per cent hearing loss. I support Labor's amendment to reduce this to more than five per cent hearing loss to bring it in line with the laws of South Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory. All workers covered by the SRC act can receive compensation after 65 years of age if they are injured after the age of 63. Claimants may have the cost of treatment from a wider range of health practitioners than at present without having to seek referrals from a medical practitioner. 
Under the legislation the basis by which compensation is calculated for the first 45 weeks of a claim will be standardised. Compensation payments for former employees will be sustained at 70 per cent of indexed normal weekly earnings. The bill also ensures that normal weekly earnings are updated in line with the prescribed index, which is proposed to be the ABS wage cost index. These are good amendments. I acknowledge that the government has initiated them. Obviously, I support them.
I turn to the provisions that particularly concern me. I refer to amendments in relation to the definition of injury or disciplinary action. Comcare claimed in its most recent annual report that it has:
... reduced injury frequency rates per 100 employees a further 6 per cent, met the majority of the Commission's claims management performance indicators, and improved performance on others, introduced a new OHS self-assessment and audit tool for employers and exceeded the national average durable return to work rate by 10 per cent.
The Howard government's reasoning for amending this legislation is questionable. Given that the workers compensation scheme is self-funded, the premiums are the lowest in Australia—one per cent—and that claims are falling, these amendments are completely unnecessary. Firstly, the bill contains a proposal to amend the circumstances in which a claim for compensation may be payable under the SRC Act by amending the definition of `disease' and `injury'. In relation to the distinction between diseases and injury, the 1971 act defines an injury as `any physical or mental injury, including aggravation, acceleration or recurrence but not a disease'. A disease was defined to include any physical or mental ailment, disorder, defect or morbid condition. In theory, this meant that any injury was subject to compensation but disease would not be compensated. In contrast, the SRC Act defines disease as any `ailment' to which employment has contributed `in a material degree' and injury is defined to include a disease.
The High Court and the Federal Court have both established that employees should be compensated for injuries at work partly arising out of an underlying disease, provided that the injury is not an inevitable cause of the disease. Under the amendments, the definition of disease is expanded to reflect the original intention behind the act and clarify the relationship between injury and disease. At present, the definition under the SRC Act is that there needs to be a `material contribution by employment to a disease before compensation is payable'. However, if the bill is passed by the parliament in its present form, it will have a more restrictive definition. Compensation will only be payable on the basis that an employee's employment is not to be taken to have contributed in a material degree to his or her disease unless there is a close connection between the employee's employment and the disease. A close connection will need to be established through length of employment, type of work tasks completed, existence of medical predispositions, unrelated activities of the employee and any other matters affecting the employee's health. I am concerned that these changes will make it more difficult for workers to prove their claims.
The SRC Act seeks to prevent compensation claims being used to thwart management action and contains an exclusionary provision. It provides that compensation is not payable in respect of a mental injury which arises from reasonable disciplinary action taken against an employee or a failure by the employee to obtain a job promotion and so on. The bill will amend this provision to include other activities seen to be normal management practices. I am opposed to this amendment recycled by the government. They attempted to pass it in 1996. I believe that Commonwealth workers covered by the SRC Act should have access to stress claims if they are justifiable.
Madam Deputy Speaker, what is stress? I worked for a long time in the Commonwealth public sector before arriving in this chamber. In my possession this morning I have a document which was produced by the CSIRO on stress in the workplace. They posed the question: what is stress? They defined stress as a biochemical response to performance which is caused by work—workplace, career; knowledge; family; environment; health, both physical and emotional; values and beliefs; travel; finances; and social relationships. The paper goes on to say that stress consists of five components: stressors, for example organisational change—humans like things to be predictable; feelings—how do I feel about myself and am I in control; general adaptation syndrome—fear from presentations, manifested by sweaty palms and excessive use of the toilet, and reactions to floods, earthquake and famine; thoughts—denial, lack of control over change issues; and behaviour—negative thoughts trigger physiological effects, for example temper.  
The paper goes on to also pose the question: what are the symptoms of stress? It says that positive responses to stress include performing better, acting faster, running harder, thinking quicker. Some of the symptoms of negative stress can include low morale, aggression, bad decisions, disorganisation, hair loss, eye twitches, neck stiffness, sleeplessness, increased tiredness, increased palpitation, increased smoking, stomach upsets, eating disorders, physical sickness, headaches, increased blood pressure and so on. The long-term effects, according to the paper, can result in ulcers, heart attack, nervous breakdown, weight gain or loss and dependence on alcohol, pills, drugs and smoking. These are very serious consequences of the stressful life that we all lead, but particularly in the public sector. I will talk about some of my experiences when I was there, and the implications for employees with the stressful environment that is so apparent today. This paper also gives some very interesting statistics. It says:
Reported cases of stress-related illness have almost doubled in the Australian Public Service since 1989-90 and are growing at a rate of 20% a year. The average liability associated with a stress claim is more than double that involved with other forms of work-related injuries. The estimated cost to the Commonwealth is $50 million. Research by Comcare has revealed that people with stress related illnesses have longer periods of absence and that their rehabilitation costs about $25,000 compared with $9,000 for other illnesses. The research also indicates that the cost of stress-related absences is likely to increase, and the number of cases may double again before the year 2000. 
That is past, as we know, and this paper, having been prepared before the arrival of the year 2000, certainly covers that period before I left the public sector. The paper continues:
The most common cause of stress related absences are classified in this document as `workplace conflict situations'. The Comcare research breaks down the incidence of these situations as follows: interpersonal conflict (24 per cent), work pressures and deadline (24 per cent), anxiety caused by organisational change (22 per cent), and verbal or physical abuse (17 per cent).  Add to this the pressure of family life and the usual stress of day-to-day existence, and it's easy to see why the problem seems overwhelming. Recent discussion suggests that stress is a global phenomenon largely affecting post-industrialised societies, however, a certain amount of stress has always been a part of the human condition. 
This part of the paper concludes:
In CSIRO, work-based change is the main cause of stress. Staff are feeling less comfortable with their workplace because they have lost control over events involving them.
Staff are certainly not relaxed and comfortable. I am very heartened to see today that after question time we are having a matter of public importance debate and the Prime Minister in waiting, Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, will be talking about `the social and economic consequences of the government's failure to deliver on its promise to make Australians comfortable and relaxed'. That is a very important debate that will take place in this chamber, because there are certainly a lot of people who are not comfortable and who are not relaxed, as promised by the Prime Minister.
As I said earlier, I worked in the Commonwealth public sector for 28 years before arriving in this place. The last job I had was at the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission, running the grievance program in New South Wales. I had first-hand experience in almost all grievances lodged. I had to interview and deal with aggrieved applicants first-hand or manage their cases at the commission. Quite plainly, the decisions that have been made by the Howard government in terms of staff cuts and reductions in resources put enormous stress on employees in the public sector. It is my belief that most stress is genuine. Yes, I know that this bill, to be fair to the government, is trying to deal with what at times we thought, when I worked at the commission, was the medicalisation of a work related problem and someone then putting in a claim for something which was possibly unrelated to the work environment, but this in the overwhelming number of cases from my experience was very, very rare. 
When I was working in the public sector, very senior managers would come along and lecture us and lecture the people that I saw who were suffering stress and they would simply say, `Well, you've got to work smarter; you've got to do more with less.' Quite plainly, many of these senior managers right up to, unfortunately, some secretaries of government departments had no insight into their own condition. When you are running a large organisation like the public sector, which services the work that we do in this parliament, and you savagely reduce by tens of thousands the numbers employed in the public sector, of course you are going to have stress. There is no escaping stress. Stress is an ineluctable force. 
The other thing that many public servants have had to deal with in recent years is the incredible technological changes. We have all had to deal with those things in the public sector and in our working lives. About the only thing that is constant in all our lives, and certainly in the public sector where I came from, is change. Change is the only constant. 
I am very, very concerned, and I will be scrutinising what the Senate does with this legislation when it goes to the other chamber, to make sure that those hardworking public servants who are working more hours than normal, are taken away from their families and their friends and are suffering severe symptoms of stress are properly cared for. It is all too easy to label public servants as bludgers, because there is a perception out there in the community—and it is a wrong perception—that public servants do not work hard. I would put to you that the enormous number of claims of stress is a clear confirmation of the stressful environment that we now work in. Unfortunately, I do not see it getting any better and, quite plainly, if the government continues to shed staff as it has done since 1996 and to contract out a lot of the work that historically was done by public servants, we are just going to see even more stress.
I think it is very, very important that this legislation, when it is examined by the Senate, is not made so tough that the very, very many people who suffer stress will not get the adequate compensation from Comcare that they so richly deserve. I have experience of many people whose lives have been torn apart because of the stress of work and whilst, yes, there were other contributing factors, in the main it was work and pressure in the public sector that brought about the manifestation of stress.

"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,2001-04-05,"—In contributing to the debate on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 I will limit my comments to the amendments it proposes to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. The act provides a framework for a fully funded workers compensation and rehabilitation scheme for Commonwealth employees under the age of 65. That includes employees of government departments and agencies and of the ACT government and employees of licensed corporations, previously Commonwealth authorities.
The act is administered on behalf of the Commonwealth by Comcare. As I understand it, Comcare's motto is `Working with you to keep you working'. While the electorate of Calare probably does not have the same number of Commonwealth employees or employees of licensed corporations as do many other electorates, it still does have significant numbers working, for example, in the ABC, ADI, Australia Post, Telstra and Network Design and Construction, otherwise known as NDC. Compared to other areas of Commonwealth responsibility, I have to say that I have received fewer complaints about Comcare than about any other government agency. However, one local case brought to my attention recently has made me seriously question just how well Comcare is adhering to its seemingly admirable motto. This case, which I will go into in a little bit more detail in a moment, has caused me in the context of this bill to look closely at what has been happening within Comcare's handling of workers compensation claims. According to the minister's second reading speech, the amendments in the bill, which the explanatory memorandum says will save Comcare some $31 million, are apparently largely of a housekeeping nature. Some of the changes the bill proposes are beneficial to employees, but some I believe are not. 
The bill seeks to make amendments to 11 different parts of the act and a number of other miscellaneous ones. Notably, the bill seeks to clarify the circumstances in which compensation can be paid by amending the definitions of `injury' and `disease'. This is perhaps the most controversial amendment in the bill and appears designed to wind back the circumstances in which workers can receive compensation. I will be looking closely at the opposition amendments in this regard. I note in the Bills Digest the statement: 
... many injuries that are currently compensable will not be compensable under these amendments. It all depends upon what may be included within a `natural progression' of a disease. 
I want to see the government further justify these definitions. The bill also seeks to alter the way payments to workers no longer employed are indexed. Currently, compensation payable to an employee is determined as a percentage of the normal weekly earnings of the class of employees. The proposed amendment seeks to ensure that, where employees leave the Commonwealth sector, their payments are linked into the normal weekly earnings that apply to the position they had when they were working. I have no problem with that proposal but note the criticism by some that the provision is not specific enough regarding the index to be used to calculate a claimant's normal weekly earnings. I wonder whether, in the interests of simplicity and fairness, it may have been better to simply link payment increases to the AWOTE—that is the average weekly ordinary time earnings index now used for calculation of increases to parliamentarians' salaries.
The bill also seeks to clarify provisions used to calculate compensation, by standardising the calculation for the first 45 weeks of the entitlements, and removes an apparent loophole which has allowed claimants in receipt of payment but with work outside the Commonwealth to receive their compensation as well as wages. Currently, those who continue working with the Commonwealth whilst receiving a payment have any wages deducted from their entitlement. The bill also seeks to ensure there will be no entitlement to lump sum payments for non-economic loss compensation for permanent impairment occurring prior to December 1998, except if the claim has been lodged before the introduction of the bill, to enable all employees covered by the act to receive weekly compensation payments beyond age 65 for a maximum of 104 weeks if injured after age 63. It will streamline the act's licensing provisions by reducing five specific licences to one general licence and will lower the hurdle a claimant must reach to succeed in a claim for permanent impairment for hearing loss. They are all pretty unobjectionable amendments, I would suggest. I do not intend to discuss these amendments in detail but rather to draw the House's attention to some of the overall trends arising in Comcare's handling of workers compensation cases on behalf of the Commonwealth.
But first up I want to share with the House the ongoing experience of one constituent with a claim currently before Comcare. My constituent has agreed to my raising her case in parliament because she is absolutely frustrated by treatment she has received from the Commonwealth's alleged model provider of compensation and rehabilitation services. Margaret Grimley was a former employee of Australian Defence Industries, ADI, at its Lithgow small arms factory. In 1986 she sustained injuries to her right wrist in the course of her employment. She has been in receipt of compensation from Comcare since that time and has undergone surgery to her wrist, including insertion and removal of steel screws and an operation on the tendon to her thumb. She has significant scarring to her wrist and hands as a result of this. 
Ms Grimley claims she has kept Comcare involved at all relevant times about any employment she has had since her injury. She has done this by disclosing the information in the claim form submitted to Comcare. But it appears Comcare have sought to use this information against her. They have sent out investigators to film her performing the work she has already admitted she performs, such as wheeling a wheelbarrow, and have used this evidence to treat her claim as a fraudulent one. I want to read part of a letter from her solicitor, Higgins and Higgins, to me dated 26 February 2001:
Our client has disclosed to the Commonwealth at all material times that she earns money from lawn mowing, and she believes if she does not take some steps in her own rehabilitation she would go crazy.
I do not think anyone in the House would disagree with the need for people suffering from such disability to be able to get out there and do something worth while to rehabilitate themselves in the workplace. I will leave my further remarks until after question time, Mr Speaker.

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2001-04-05,"—For the masochists who watch question time in the public galleries and on the rebroadcasts late in the evenings, question time today has become a question time typical of the question times of this parliament. On the one hand the opposition is asking questions, trying to hold to account a minister who has in all probability breached the conduct standards that are required of him. There has been an adverse consequence on the public as a result and the minister is there, slipping and sliding around with minute hairsplitting definitions about what he is up to. Having been questioned persistently on his knowledge of a grant, he has been running away, saying he had not known anything about a particular consortium—irrelevant to the question and the line of questioning, as he well knows. That is on this side asking questions of them.
On their side, asking questions of themselves, there has been this sort of hollow bell that comes of self-congratulation rung day after day as more and more Australians feel the economic pressure of life today, as more and more small businesses struggle to cope with the consequence of having been declared government tax collectors and as more and more pensioners fear the consequences for their savings of having them effectively devalued by the impact of the GST. What we get from the government side is denial, arrogance, being out of touch, not listening, ignoring them—a government hell-bent on a road of self-congratulation, unwilling to make the changes necessary to give the Australian people that sense of wellbeing that was promised by them back in 1996 when they came to office.
The Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, who is at the table, and the Prime Minister have sought to attack the opposition, which has 64 policies on its web site and is announcing policy week after week in areas critical to the wellbeing of ordinary Australians, be it the services that they are provided by banks, be it the needs that they have for a decent education for their children, be it the hopes that they have that they will not have to take a credit card with them when they take those children to hospital—policy after policy. Yet the minister at the table and the Prime Minister have the hide to say that the opposition is a policy free zone, that it is not tipping its hand in any way to the Australian people, and that it did not matter that John Howard was like that in 1996, that—like their description of us as opposed to the reality—it did not matter that he was like that because the Australian people knew what he stood for—as though that actually matters in an election campaign, that they simply know your general outlook on life. 
This is the decisive proposition that they put forward—it did not matter that we rolled ourselves into a small ball: the Australian people knew what we stood for. I do remember the general propositions put forward by the opposition in 1996. They said these things. Because many Australians feared their industrial relations policy they said that no Australian would be worse off as a result of the introduction of their industrial relations policies. Because many Australians feared that Medicare, which they had come to rely on, would in some way be dismantled by a man who had previously contested a federal election saying his objective was to destroy Medicare—because they sought reassurances on that—he gave these reassurances: he would not Americanise the health care system of this country. And because many Australians were aware that he had run as a frontbencher in an election in which a goods and services tax was the policy of the opposition in that election campaign, he offered those people the assurance that they would never ever introduce a GST—never ever. While it cannot be said that this by any means represents a complete policy picture of the intentions of the government, it certainly represents a complete policy picture of things that they said they would not do. One of the reasons why this community is now reacting so vehemently to a government they believe has deceived them is that those promises and undertakings were simple enough to be remembered.
Let us take them each in turn. Firstly, there is the question of what happens to people in the industrial relations system. The Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business made a chump of himself the other day in this parliament when he got up and got himself fed a dorothy dixer on the comparison of people in the enterprise bargaining stream collectively and those on individual contracts under AWAs. He tried to demonstrate they are better off by—to use an old Western Australian goldmining term—`salting the mine' as far as the AWA performance was concerned. When it was like with like, apples with apples, operatives earnings against operatives earnings, the performance of those on AWAs, compared with those on collective bargaining, was $100 a week less.
Government members interjecting—
—Don't argue with me; go and argue with the Bureau of Statistics, because that was their figure. That was the Bureau of Statistics figure. What did that do? It made a complete lie of that first undertaking.
Then there is the health care system. What did Australians want of the health care system under Medicare? They love two things: firstly, the assurance they had that they could readily access public hospitals for their needs and did not have to get themselves into private health cover unless they really wanted to choose to do so and, secondly, that they would have access to bulk-billing. Those are the two core elements of Medicare that ordinary Australian families want. These are not the Australian families on $90,000 a year that the Prime Minister was parading here today in parliament—good luck to them—that make up two per cent of the population of this country, but Australian families whose principal breadwinner is on about $34,000 a year. Mind you, that is only one-third of Australian families; if you want to get the other two-thirds you go lower.
These are the ordinary Australians, some of whom were Howard's battlers back in 1996. They are the ones who, above all, need to be able to go to a doctor with their children and not have to pay $50 up-front for the privilege. As every parent knows, children always get serially ill, so if you have got three of them they will be parading through the doctor's surgery, one after another, in the course of a fortnight. If you are on $35,000 a year, try 150 bucks in a fortnight for keeping your kids in health. That is why it was necessary for the Prime Minister to say to the ordinary Australian, `I completely renege the position I adopted back then. I am not going to force you into private health cover, and I am not going to diminish the value of what you have. I am going to stick with bulk-billing. I am not going to Americanise the health care system.' 
I cannot find a place now in regional Australia where I am not questioned by someone during the meetings that I hold with them about why bulk-billing has disappeared—not just for average wage earners but even for pensioners in the communities in which they live. If you ask a question of the Minister for Health and Aged Care in this House he will stand up and deny that—barefaced denial of a fact that every Australian living in regional Australia knows to be the case.
Then we have the goods and services tax. My golly! The goods and services tax that would never, ever be introduced has become the principal torment of small business in this country. But the government will come into this chamber and claim black is white on that. I had the Minister for Small Business in here the other day getting up there and claiming that the thing that small business most feared was the Labor Party's proposition of roll-back. We have the lie given to that in the paper today with a number of small business peak bodies coming out and saying, `We want to talk with the Labor Party about what that means, but if it is going to make it simpler for us we don't fear it, we want it.' The government say that I have said—and they always quote this:
We have never pretended to be a small business Party, the Labor Party.
Let me go through the whole quote:
John Howard was supposed to be the Prime Minister against red-tape for small business and the Prime Minister for small business people.  We have never pretended to be a small business Party, the Labor Party ...  The Prime Minister has pretended that and yet you have got European studies that he is aware of which shows that the cost of compliance expressed as a percentage of turnover is 30 times greater for a small business than it is for a large business.  So the corner store shops experience with compliance is 30 times greater than Woollies.  That is why you don't make a judgement about what is happening with the GST, about the GST at Woollies.  You make it down at Bob and Mabel's corner store.
That is my quote, from which they extracted one sentence. It is not particularly surprising that they did not read the rest of it, because they would have seen the reality that they always want to deny—that it is an agony for people in small business. That is why, after a period of unprecedented growth—eight years of it: four years under us and four years under them—we have a 25 per cent increase in the rate of bankruptcy in this country. The deceit of this government has inflicted on them a burden that they cannot sustain. Government members come into this parliament full of self-congratulation and with a determination to evade our questions. They evade the questions now on whether a minister has breached his oath of office, effectively, and they evaded the questions we asked them about industrial relations, health and the goods and services tax just as much as when we pointed out that they were in breach of solemn undertakings that they gave to the Australian people. They have compounded the deceit of 1996 that has left the Australian people remarkably unrelaxed and uncomfortable, and they have compounded it with repeated deceit since.
Let us go to the GST deceits themselves. They said, `Okay, you are going to get the GST but it will not cause a rise in the price of petrol.' That was the first undertaking. They then said, `You are going to get a GST but it is going to simplify the tax act. You are going to get a GST but pensioners and families will be properly compensated for that goods and services tax. If you are a bit of a drinker, you will get the GST but it will be only 1.9 per cent.' I am proud to say, as Leader of the Australian Labor Party, that we are actually forcing compliance with a number of these promises. Unfortunately, for the pensioners and the families, we cannot quite get at them. 
—It's called roll-back.
—We have been able to roll them back on petrol, we have been able to roll them back on beer and we have been able to roll them back to some degree on compliance of small business. We have not got them yet for the pensioners and the families of this country, but we will. If we do not get them there in the next budget, we will get them there in the next campaign. That is what we will be doing, and we will have this advantage: nobody believes them any more.
The Prime Minister said that he would make the Australian people relaxed and comfortable. I will tell the Australian people this: if I am elected Prime Minister of this nation, I am going to be on their side. I am going to be on the side of those families whose principal breadwinner is earning $35,000 a year. I am going to be on the side of the pensioners who have had their savings devalued. I am going to be on the side of the small businesspeople who drive employment in this country but who are now experiencing a 25 per cent increase in the rate of bankruptcy. I am going to be on the side of those parents who send their kids to government schools and to poor private schools. I am going to be on their side. They are going to be the people who will see their children get a chance.
This country was the land of opportunity for people. Everybody thought they would have an equal go, but more and more families now feel pressure. They feel pressure at their most basic services, they feel concerns about whether their kids will get the best opportunity in education and they feel concerned about the living standards of their parents. We will deal with their problems. We have put out a policy that will deal with some of the concerns. There is a lot more to come, and we will do it in a way that we can implement. We will not break faith with the Australian people as this Prime Minister has so massively broken faith with them over the last five years—and he stands in this chamber and boasts about it.

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2001-04-05,"—The Leader of the Opposition began his speech today in effect complaining about the fact that he is constantly losing question time; I fear that he lost the MPI as well. I have quite a bit of respect for the office of Leader of the Opposition. The unfortunate thing is that this Leader of the Opposition has found that the gifts he showed as a follower have completely deserted him as a leader, because this Leader of the Opposition is incapable of making the decisions which are necessary for someone who would be a Prime Minister of this country. What the Leader of the Opposition has raised to an art form over the last few months is running around this country trying to make decent, honest Australians feel miserable about themselves and about their lives. Today he came into this House crying crocodile tears about a goods and services tax which he has pledged to keep. The fundamental fact that every Australian must know every time members opposite complain about the GST is that the GST will be their tax. They will keep a GST if they ever get into government. The basic difference between members opposite and members on this side of the House is that we have trust and faith in the Australian people. We believe that the Australian people are good enough to have a go at things and to come out on top. We are not constantly running down the Australian people. We are not constantly telling them that they are failures and that they cannot make it, which of course is the constant message from the Leader of the Opposition, who is Australia's `roonist' in chief, constantly running down what we all know to be the greatest country on earth.
I am very proud to be a member of a government which has an excellent record in all the things that count. This government has created nearly 800,000 jobs in the last five years. Half of those jobs have been full-time jobs, compared with the record of members opposite. In their last six years of government, they created less than half that number of jobs and nearly all of those jobs were part-time jobs. Under this government, wages have increased substantially for the first time in years. Average weekly earnings are up by 12 per cent under this government, after increasing by just four per cent in the previous 13 years. Basic award earnings are up by nine per cent under this government. Under the former government, they actually fell by five per cent. A government which said that they were of the workers, by the workers and for the workers actually boasted repeatedly in this House—I have heard them—about cutting workers' wages. Growth has been good, interest rates have come down and the average mortgage holder is about $300 a month better off, thanks to this government. This government has done all of this while maintaining Australians' traditional egalitarianism. The gap between the rich and poor has not grown. The numbers of the poor have not grown vis-a-vis the numbers of the rich, according to ABS statistics. 
What is more, the government have been able to do things that we never thought we could. We never thought that we could reform the waterfront, but we have. Members opposite kept saying, repeatedly, that 25 lifts an hour was impossible, that the workers of Australia could not achieve these heroic feats of performance, but they have. Not only are we achieving 25 lifts per hour but on occasions, at Patricks and elsewhere on the Australian waterfront, Australian waterside workers are breaking world records. This is what the workers of Australia have been able to achieve because of the policies of our government, because of the structures that our government have put in place. 
It was always supposed to be impossible to reform the gun laws of this country. That was supposed to be too hard, and yet this government, this Prime Minister, seized an opportunity and turned a tragedy into a triumph of the commonsense of the Australian people. 
For 25 years Australians sat on the sidelines, wringing their hands impotently over the ongoing tragedy in East Timor. But thanks to this government, thanks to this Prime Minister, East Timor is free. For the first time in our history, Australia led an international military expedition for the freedom of another country. We did not go in there as someone else's ally. We did not go in there as someone else's sidekick. We did it ourselves, and our near neighbour is free for the first time in hundreds of years. It is a great triumph. It is one of the proudest boasts of modern Australia that East Timor is free, and it only happened thanks to this government. This government and this Prime Minister have surprised the Australian people because they have shown the flexibility, the imagination and the determination that was not supposed to exist amongst so-called conservatives—so-called right-wingers. This Prime Minister has stamped himself—his personality and his character—on this country in a way that no Prime Minister has since Bob Menzies.
Let us take tax reform. Tax reform was something that everyone who studied policy making in Australia knew was absolutely necessary. Members opposite knew it was necessary, employers knew it was necessary, unions knew it was necessary—everyone knew it was necessary. But the one government which has had the guts to do what was necessary—not necessarily popular—in the long-term national interests was this government led by John Howard. Tax reform was the policy Rubicon before which Malcolm Fraser, Bob Hawke, Paul Keating and others had halted, hesitated and failed. This Prime Minister has given Australia what we needed, and the fact that Australia does need it, must have it and will have it is revealed by the fact that not a single member opposite is prepared to say anything other than, `We will keep tax reform.' Yes, tax reform has been hard. It is not easy to replace an archaic, out-of-date tax system with a tax system designed for the 21st century. Inevitably, there were going to be some problems in transition. But this government has listened; we have learned and, where necessary, we have acted. Tax reform has left the average family $50 a week better off, and the changes that this government has made over the last few months to try to make tax reform more user-friendly are going to ensure that the small businesses of this country can make the most of the opportunities that they have. 
On the subject of backflips, members opposite like to loudly demand something and, when it is done, say, `Oh, isn't that terrible; it is an evil backflip.' My former leader John Hewson once said that accepting the will of the people is not weakness, it is democracy, and refusing to respond to what people want is not leadership, it is dictatorship. Over the last few months the Prime Minister has given a fine example of a government which is in touch with people and which will do what people reasonably expect to ensure that policies work out for the best for all Australians.
The Leader of the Opposition said that he was on the side of the Australian people. He came in here today saying that he would not break faith with the Australia people. Let us consider not what the Leader of the Opposition says but what he has done. He was the worst ever Minister for Defence, the worst ever Minister for Transport and Communications, the worst ever Minister for Employment, Education and Training and the worst ever Minister for Finance—and now he wants to be Prime Minister.
This was the defence minister who presided over the Collins class submarines and the Jindalee over the horizon radar. This is the commuications minister who authored the $4 billion wasteful comparative roll-out of Telstra and Optus cables. This is the unemployment minister who started complaining about the poison chalice that he had been given while unemployment hit 11.2 per cent, and this is the finance minister who racked up $30 billion worth of debt in just two years. The Leader of the Opposition talked about the 64 policies that exist on his web site. The reason no-one knows about the Leader of the Opposition's policies is that frankly they are not worth knowing about. The Leader of the Opposition does not have words, he just has waffle. What is quite clear is that the Leader of the Opposition believes in four things. He believes in higher spending, a higher surplus, lower tax—simultaneously—and the fourth thing he must believe in is the tooth fairy, because it is impossible to square all of the various things that the Leader of the Opposition says he wants and says he believes in.
It is quite clear that if Labor wins government the one thing we can be absolutely certain about is that the unions will have more power, there will be more regulation in the system, there will be more strikes and there will be lower pay for all Australians. I was able to tell the House earlier in this sitting fortnight, based on information from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, that workers on Australian workplace agreements have an average pay of $895 a week. By contrast, workers on federally registered collective agreements have an average pay of $711 a week. The only direct comparison between Australian workplace agreements and certified agreements showed that workers on Australian workplace agreements are nearly 25 per cent better off—$184 a week better off. Australian workplace agreements are the Rolls Royce of deals for Australian workers.
It is true, if you include with Australian workplace agreements unregistered individual agreements, the average goes down. But Australian workplace agreements are registered, they are vetted by the Office of the Employment Advocate and they are the agreements we have put in place. The individual agreements that members opposite support are the very unregistered individual agreements under which workers do not get paid what they are paid under Australian workplace agreements. If workers want more pay, stick with this government and stick with Australian workplace agreements because more pay is precisely what workers on Australian workplace agreements are getting. 
Members opposite will try to say that the only people on Australian workplace agreements are executives. The member for Dickson's former colleague Senator Andrew Murray made a speech last week where he produced figures showing that 51 per cent of people earning more than $2,000 a week, or $100,000 a year, are on awards or collective agreements. This idea that only executives are on Australian workplace agreements is simply wrong. When the Prime Minister said some years ago that he wanted Australians to be relaxed and comfortable, he meant that he wanted Australians to believe in themselves. He wanted Australians to take pride in who they are, what they can achieve and what their future holds. That is what the Prime Minister wanted. That is what the Prime Minister meant.  
What the Prime Minister and this government have achieved is that we have got rid of the defeatism. We have got rid of the sense of despair proliferating in Australia under members opposite. The Prime Minister believes, above all, in the Australian people. He believes they can do it. He believes that we are capable of succeeding and achieving, and that is why members opposite are engaged in nothing but group defamation of the Australian people every time they pretend that there is nothing worth supporting in modern Australia. I am very confident that when the voters of Australia have their chance later in the year, they will not reject the best government since Menzies and the worst opposition since Calwell.

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2001-04-05,"—This is the last time the parliament sits for seven weeks to debate matters of serious issue. We have put a proposition on the agenda today for the Prime Minister to come in and defend his record five years after promising he would make the Australian public more `comfortable and relaxed'—and he squibs the debate. The best they can drag up is the minister whom we have just heard from—the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business—the person who has to rehearse his question time answers. I tell you what, brother, go back to rehearsal class because that was a pathetic performance. Where was the audience? The best you could scrape together was six people on your own backbench, and three of them whips. This is the person who admits that his own mother says he is not fit for high office. This is the person they send in to defend the government's record. 
It is said that history tends to repeat itself—the first time is tragedy and the second is farce. John Howard, who was Treasurer under Prime Minister Fraser, stands as the embodiment of this statement. After seven wasted years—that was the tragedy—the coalition government, when John Howard was Treasurer and had produced double digits in both unemployment and inflation, was turfed out of office. But the best that the then Treasurer, John Winston Howard, could do was whinge to everyone that Malcolm Fraser had stolen his surplus. Now we have the farce of the former Treasurer, now Prime Minister, doing backflip after backflip while the new Treasurer whinges to everyone that John Howard is stealing his surplus. John Howard has been forced to make so many backflips of late that when he leaves this place he can join the circus. Peter Costello has been rolled so often he is smoother than a ball bearing. 
But let us understand the sorts of things that they have been rolled on because all of them constitute deceit, denial and then backflip. They said that BAS could not be simplified and could not be reconciled on an annual basis—wrong, and we proved them wrong. The tax act is burdening small business in this country with complexity. The Prime Minister told the parliament in 1997:
The volume of tax legislation has become a tidal wave which threatens to overwhelm small business. 
He was then asked in 1998 by Alan Jones: `Will the number of pages in the tax act be reduced by the introduction of the GST?' The Prime Minister replied, `Yes, it will.' But the tax act is now almost three times the size that it was in 1966. If it was a tidal wave then, it is a tsunami now, and it has all been done under their watch. The Leader of the Opposition has referred to petrol. Labor forced the government to roll back on petrol. Labor forced the backflip. Let us hear none of this sanctimony from the minister who has departed the chamber saying, `Flexible mind, the Prime Minister—out there listening to people.' 
This Prime Minister is so out of touch he would not know how to listen. The only language that he understands is when we force the change, when he recognises that he hasn't got the numbers, when he is forced by backbench revolt because of the campaigns we have run in their constituencies saying, `There is no point complaining about the high price of petrol at home if you are not prepared to come and do something in Canberra; no point being heroes at home whilst you are cowards in Canberra, because your constituents will always remember it.' 
On beer, the latest backflip, the Prime Minister is still in denial. We heard the minister today saying he was listening and that they had flexible minds. They still do not want to do this. They still do not believe they have broken a promise. Yet it is there in absolute black and white terms: `The price of beer will not rise by more than 1.9 per cent'—and they stuck it up 10 per cent and do not think they broke a promise. You still have the Treasurer cowardly refusing to come into this House and introduce the legislation for the backflip, out at doorstop after doorstop saying, `We shouldn't have to have done it. This is the brewers writing their own tax rate.' This is the government forced to honour its promise and, as the Leader of the Opposition said, we will continue to do it.
The effect of this matter of public importance today is to say that the Prime Minister has failed after his five years in office to make Australians `comfortable and relaxed'. Ask the small businesses of the country, the pensioners, the self-funded retirees, the people who live in regional and rural Australia, the workers whose jobs are threatened, people who are in aged care facilities, people who are in hospitals, parents who are struggling to get their kids into decent education if they are comfortable and relaxed and they will tell you that they are not. Why is that? Because of this government's fundamental economic mismanagement, as well as its deceit.
We heard the Prime Minister in question time talk about the record of economic achievement of his government and try and again ridicule Labor's. Let us just understand what this government's economic watch has produced. Foreign debt has reached a record  $301 billion—56 per cent up under Peter Costello. Household debt is at record levels—$487½ billion, an increase of 75 per cent under Peter Costello. For the first time, Australian households now owe more than they earn. Credit card debt has risen from just $6.7 billion in February 1996 to $17½ billion in January 2001—a 161 per cent increase. And under Peter Costello the annual growth rate in credit card debt reached highs not seen since John Howard was last Treasurer. 
On investment, the last three years of the Howard government has seen an annual average growth rate for private new capital expenditure of minus 5.1 per cent. Compare that with Labor's last three years in office and you can see we had investment in the economy throughout it positive. This government, presiding over continued economic growth, has got investment in the negative. Is it little wonder that we are struggling as an economy? And it is not just the housing sector, as the government would have you believe. Look at business research and development—the drivers of economic growth. If we want to position ourselves as the new economy, as innovators with the skills to sell to the rest of the world, government has to play a role. This government has driven it down. Business investment in research and development rose every year for 13 years under Labor. Under John Howard, it has fallen every year. Is it little wonder that the rest of the world writes it down? If we are not prepared to invest in our future, why should they? That is the question they continue to ask. This government is not serious about investing in our future. 
The government have also produced a decade-high inflation rate, they have produced the first negative quarter of economic growth in 9½ years and they have king-hit the construction sector, so much so that interest rates have had to fall, together with an increase in the home savings grant to drag it off the floor. I presented that graph the other day in the parliament to demonstrate the slump that they have caused to the housing sector—the greatest slump ever recorded. And they pretend that they are good economic managers! Well, let me tell you this: if you cannot manage the economy, you cannot make people comfortable and relaxed. `Comfortable and relaxed' is hardly a vision splendid, but you will never get this from the Prime Minister. But that was his benchmark. If you cannot manage the economy, as they have consistently failed to do, it is no wonder that people are out there hurting. 
We heard the Prime Minister today rely on the Wright family. It represents, as the shadow spokesman for social services has said, 1.8 per cent of Australian families. John Howard is satisfied if that minuscule proportion can say, `We are doing well.' What about the rest of them? What about the 98 per cent of families who are struggling under the weight of his GST? And as for the argument that the dollar does not matter unless you are going overseas, what does he say to the people who have to pay more for imported products and more for petrol? What does he say to the businesses that have to pay more for their input costs and therefore strip their margins? This is a government whose GST has mugged the economy. They have not made Australians comfortable and relaxed and they do not deserve to retain office.

"Kelly, De-Anne, MP",NP,2001-04-05,"—When I read today's matter of public importance, frankly I had to read it twice to believe it; to believe that the opposition would come in here when their reputation out there in the electorate is so poor. But allow me to read from a letter—
—Tell us about Ryan.
—I am going to tell you about Ryan but you will not like it. I am just going to read a letter from my electorate which puts it into context. It is called `Lies or madness?' and says:
All the polls are telling us of a Labor landslide—
... are we just going mad?
Remember the high interest rates, large deficit, and high inflation and many other problems.
People, do not kid yourselves. Yes, we have some problems but Kim and Simon can't or will not fix this.
All we are told is full policy panic, five years again under Labor we will be doing all the pain again.
Do know who wrote this letter? A railway worker from Sarina—Mr D. Lyons. `All the pain again'. Let me say to the Labor Party that if you think you can come in because you are getting a bit nervous, because you have been out and about and you know what is happening out there, that is not going to save you come October. The fact is that the Australian people have long memories. Mr Lyons has. We do not want to do `all the pain again'. A railway worker remembers. He said, `Do not kid yourselves,' to the people in Dawson. `Remember the high interest rates, large deficit and high inflation and many other problems.' Don't do the pain again. That will be a great little slogan for the Labor Party: `Don't do the pain again under Labor.'
I will talk very briefly about the government's achievements. There is no doubt in rural and regional Australia that these are difficult times. Commodity prices are low and the American economy is slowing. It is a difficult time. So things in rural and regional Australia are certainly difficult for people. Let me tell you about the things the government has done that have made life so much better for rural and regional Australians. The low Australian dollar is a big boon to our exporters. It is amusing that the shadow Treasurer is shedding tears for the big importers. I actually thought we were interested in exports. I am surprised to see the shadow minister for agriculture supporting the shadow Treasurer in talking down the Australian economy and shedding crocodile tears over the Australian dollar. You know that every time the dollar falls we get an extra $300 million for Australia's exporters. You should start to represent Australian farmers.
Let me talk about interest rates—they fell again yesterday. The Westpac rate is 6.82 per cent and the National Australia Bank rate is 6.81 per cent. What that means for ordinary, decent, hardworking Australians on an average mortgage of $100,000 is a saving of $81. What it means for my farmers, Mr Shadow Treasurer for Agriculture, is that the debts on their farms are not going to gobble them up. Under the opposition they would have an increase in interest rates, and they know that.  
They also know that the fall in the Australian dollar is a big help to them. Every time the dollar falls, there is an extra couple of hundred million dollars in the pockets of Australian farmers. There is the first home owners grant. All I hear from the opposition is about gymnastics. It is about listening, acting and delivering. That is what a responsive and responsible government does: listen, act and deliver. The first home owners grant was increased a few weeks ago to $14,000. Let me say to the parliament that the builders in Dawson have had a lot more inquiries. The business activity statement has been simplified. On fuel, the thing the shadow Treasurer said we would never do anything about, we have not only kept our promise when the tax reform package was being brought in but we have cut out the indexation, the thing the Labor Party brought in.
Let us talk about life under Labor, because that is where Mr Lyons from Sarina has said we will be doing all the pain again. We are going to have an apology, we are going to have regional treaties, we are going to have roll-back, we are going to have unfettered family reunion for immigrants, we are going to have two more submarines—no doubt paid for out of the pocket of Australian taxpayers when their interest rates go up. We are going to have an alliance with the Greens to destroy farmers' rights on the land. I hope the shadow minister for agriculture reminds them of that when he goes north. We are going to have a republic, supposedly. I thought we just had a vote on the republic. But, no, we are going to exhume this old policy issue again under the Labor Party. It all adds up to more spending, another budget deficit, higher interest rates—more pain. As Mr Lyons said, we will be doing all the pain again. 
Opposition members interjecting—
—I thought the Labor Party might be interested in some of the issues brought forward in my electorate. No doubt that is why they have got this sort of frenzied attack at the moment, because they know what people out there are saying.
—Frenzied!
—Well, it is a frenzied attack from those that are going to bring more pain. You would be interested to know that in my electorate the number one issue is economic management and low interest rates. From all the canvassing in our electorate, even amongst Labor voters, they look for economic management. People do have long memories about how the Labor Party managed the economy.
—Tell us about John Howard in 1982 and 1983.
—I do not have to go back that far. I am going to remind them about your high interest rates, I am going to remind them about the apology, the tribunal—about what it would mean for rural and regional Australians if the Labor Party were in government. As Mr Lyons has said, are we just going mad and will we be doing all the pain again? I would like to share with the House a letter that came into the paper today from Paget in my electorate. This is a working area with the railway in Mackay. The letter is headed `Remember'.
Opposition members interjecting—
—I am sorry you find letters from ordinary Australians amusing, but then the Labor Party would. The letter reads:
Sir—This is to the people with very short to nil memories. 
1982—The great Labor party floats the dollar even though it was exactly the same value as the Yank dollar. 
1997—Paul Keating describes Australia as the a...hole of the world. Kim Beazley was minister for unemployment. 
Kim Beazley Minister for Defence orders the famous submarine project. 
Cheryl Kernot jumps ship then spits the dummy when she thinks she has lost the safe seat given to her on a platter. 
You could go on forever. How could you possibly vote this mob in to run Australia. 
R. Woodford, Paget.
How could you vote this mob in to run Australia? Mr Woodford, you got it in one. That is from a working area in Mackay, a letter in the paper today from somebody I do not know, I must say. How could you vote this mob in to run Australia? You will only be doing the pain again. 
The trouble with the Labor Party is that during the Ryan by-election, when Mr Beazley finally made it into Ryan, the coalition vote started to come back. The Prime Minister was working hard in Ryan and the coalition vote started to come back. Even better was the interview that Mr Beazley did on the 7.30 Report. I just hope you run him on television again and again, because people in my electorate said, `What did he say?' No-one can remember what the Leader of the Opposition says; he goes on and on and on. The trouble, you see, is that you are now under scrutiny and people are starting to write letters to the paper, they are starting to remember the Labor days. Remember all the pain for no gain under Labor? We do not want the pain again. As the Labor Party comes under scrutiny and the Leader of the Opposition does more interviews, people are starting to react. They remember those days. They do not want the pain again under the Labor Party. I hope you do go out there and start to talk more about rural and regional Australia and your so-called 64 policies. I hope you do that, because it is going to be a great memory of the pain again. (Time expired)

Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—Under the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951, the JCPAA is required to prepare a report on the performance of its duties during the past financial year. I will briefly discuss the committee's highlights for that year. 1999-2000 was the first full financial year following the consolidation of the JCPAA as the audit committee of the parliament with its responsibilities under the Auditor-General Act 1997. In August 1999, the committee considered the ANAO forward audit work program for 1999-2000 and conveyed to the Auditor-General the audit priorities of the parliament. The committee also considered the draft budget estimates of the Australian National Audit Office and tabled its report on the draft estimates before the budget was brought down on 9 May 2000.
The JCPAA undertook a number of inquiries as well as reviews of the Auditor-General's reports for 1999-2000. Major committee reports tabled during the past financial year included those on the Corporate governance and accountability arrangements for Commonwealth government business enterprises and A review of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. In addition, five review reports following public hearings on Auditor-General reports for the fourth quarter of 1997-98, all of 1998-99 and the first quarter of 1999-2000 were tabled.
Corporatisation and the devolution of responsibility for the management of Commonwealth agencies—including successful risk management—to CEOs have been the focus of the committee's work in 1999-2000. In its report, Corporate governance and accountability arrangements for Commonwealth government business enterprises, the committee concluded that the existing arrangements adopted since the 1997 Humphry report provide a flexible and effective arrangement for the operations of GBEs under the strategic directions of the shareholder ministers.
In its Review of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997, the committee focused on whether legislation met the needs of the new financial management framework and the needs of the public sector, whether it remained consistent with other legislation, both Commonwealth and state, and whether accountability to parliament has been maintained. The committee made two recommendations aimed at addressing possible inconsistencies regarding defamation and indemnity legislation. 
The committee also recommended that the Department of Finance and Administration and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet should review the terminology of the financial management legislation and the public and parliamentary service legislation with a view to removing inconsistency and increasing consistency with the terminology used by the private sector.
The committee has long supported the concept of the Auditor-General as an independent officer of the parliament. In 1996 the JCPAA tabled a report entitled Guarding the independence of the Auditor-General, which recommended legislative guarantees of audit independence for the Auditor-General and an extension of the Auditor's mandate to include performance audits of government business enterprises. The report also recommended an enhanced role for the committee in the appointment of the Auditor-General and independent auditor and in determining the level of appropriations for the Australian National Audit Office. The committee's recommendations were incorporated into the present legislation.
In June 1999, the committee tabled report 368, which recommended seeking legislative provision for the Auditor-General to have access to contractors' premises where such access is required to assist in the performance of an audit function. The committee reaffirmed this need as part of its inquiry into contract management. On 29 November 2000, the government agreed to implement this recommendation on ANAO access to third party premises by advising agencies to include appropriate access clauses in contracts with third parties. The Commonwealth procurement guidelines were also amended to emphasise the importance of agencies ensuring they are able to satisfy all relevant accountability obligations, including ANAO access to contractor records and premises.
Recent JCPAA Auditor-General report reviews have demonstrated significant shortcomings with respect to contract management in an environment where many government services have been subject to commercial contestability and contracting out. On 25 August 1999, the committee initiated an inquiry into contract management in the Australian Public Service in an attempt to identify systemic problems in contract administration and to encourage better practice standards which can be applied across agencies. The committee held public hearings and collected evidence on the Commonwealth Community Education and Information Program. It also advertised an inquiry into Coastwatch, following the Auditor-General report No. 38 on the agency. During the 1999-2000 financial year, the committee tabled seven reports. A total of 21 recommendations were made by the committee. To date, the government has accepted 14 of these.
In this period of change, the committee believes it is necessary for management in each Commonwealth agency to demonstrate its commitment to establishing effective control and accountability structures. It is also important for each agency to have a fully operational financial information management system which can provide relevant and accurate information in a timely manner.
Finally, I wish to inform the parliament that in 1999 the JCPAA was nominated as the host for the 6th biennial conference of the Australasian Council of Public Accounts Committees. In February 2000, the JCPAA convened a mid-term meeting of representatives of Australasian public accounts committees. At this meeting, a theme was decided for the 2001 conference and members gave an indication of the papers they wished to present. The JCPAA then organised and ran a very successful conference on 4 to 6 February 2001 with participants not only from the council members all over Australia and New Zealand but also from the United Kingdom, Canada, South Africa, Fiji and Hong Kong. This was truly an international conference. 
I am indebted to my colleagues on the committee who have dedicated their time and effort to various inquiries and to reviewing these Auditor-General reports throughout the 1999-2000 period. As well, I would like to thank the members of the secretariat who were involved in the inquiries. I commend the JCPAA annual report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Public Accounts and Audit Committee</title>,Committees,29,1
"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2001-04-05,"—by leave—As a Labor member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I would like to join with my colleague the member for La Trobe and chairman of the committee in making some remarks in relation to this report. I join with him in thanking my colleagues that have served on the committee during the period, and I would specifically like to thank some of my colleagues who have served but who are no longer on the committee. I thank Senator the Hon. John Faulkner, the member for Bruce and the member for Sydney for their efforts when they were on the committee.
I would certainly like to echo the chairman's remarks in thanking the secretariat. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit is a very busy one and the secretariat's workload is, I think, onerous. They at all times display a great deal of professionalism and a very even-tempered approach to life. The mission of our committee is of course to scrutinise the expenditure of Commonwealth funds, which may not sound scintillating to most but is a very important function for a parliamentary committee to undertake on a bipartisan basis. As this report shows, I think we have, over this reporting period, adequately weighed the long-term and the short-term issues that the committee needs to address.
In particular, in terms of the short-term issues, the committee has actively and on a quarterly basis reviewed Auditor-General's reports and made further recommendations in relation to them. I think that has been a very effective process. It was adopted at or near the commencement of the last parliament, and I think it has been very valuable. In that regard we have looked at issues such as aviation security, aged care and various matters in relation to defence. There are some reports in preparation at the moment, including one into the MRI issue.
The committee has not only looked at those short-term issues but, I think, adequately balanced the need to take the long-term view. As we all know in this House, the public sector has changed radically over the last 25 years—with the core public sector becoming smaller, with the amount of corporatisation which has occurred in the public sector, with the advent of accrual accounting and with the additional demands that there now are for transparency and management of issues such as risk.
In that regard the committee has gone out of its way to address some of the longer term issues that the public sector faces, including the need for reviewing corporate government structures—we undertook an inquiry and made a report into that—and the need to review the legislation which defines the accountability and transparency requirements of Commonwealth authorities and companies.

"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,2001-04-05,"—It is good to rehabilitate this speech after the question time break. Prior to question time, I was telling the House the story of Mrs Margaret Grimley, a former employee of ADI in Lithgow, who, through her solicitor, has claimed that Comcare have hassled her, despite her admission that she has performed tasks like wheeling a wheelbarrow. They have used evidence, she claims, to make her life pretty miserable. Her solicitors tell me in a letter that it has been made generally known around the town that she is under investigation by the national fraud squad. She claims to have been humiliated in the local community by the Comcare process as a result of the conduct of these investigations. 
She says she has fully cooperated with all investigations and interviews and she feels that for some reason she has been singled out for oppressive treatment that bears no relationship to her injury related incapacity. According to her legal representative, Comcare has refused to consider any attempts to resolve or settle the matter but rather has taken a persecutory approach to her case. They have also detailed for me what they consider to be gross failings in Comcare's administration and the level of customer service it has displayed in handling the case. 
In a letter dated 12 December 2000, received just prior to Christmas by Mrs Grimley's solicitors, Comcare rejected the claim but provided them with an opportunity to provide further medical evidence in support of her claim. The letter said that if such material was not received by 25 January 2001, the determination would be rejected on the evidence available. On 15 January, the solicitors wrote to Comcare seeking an extension to enable a medical report to be obtained during the holiday period that was current from a highly regarded specialist. The extension was needed because the earliest available appointment was 28 February 2001. 
By letter dated 25 January, Comcare wrote to Mrs Grimley's solicitors confirming its decision of 12 December and made no reference whatsoever to the earlier request for an extension. On 9 February, the solicitors again wrote to Comcare pointing out that it had failed to take into account their earlier correspondence and requested an extension of time. On 5 February 2001, apparently in response to the solicitor's original January 15 request, Comcare responded denying the extension claim on the basis that extension requests must themselves enclose medical evidence. Comcare has since claimed that the solicitor's 15 January letter was not received prior to the date of the determination, which was 10 days after that. 
While I understand Comcare have now agreed to an extension, the events caused Mrs Grimley and her solicitors a lot of heartache. Higgins and Higgins wrote to me in the following terms:
Irrespective of these matters and the breach of any professional courtesy in a response thereto ... Comcare expressed no interest or apology to ourselves or our client for their inappropriate, rude and indiscriminately oppressive handling of our client in relation to this matter. 
... Comcare is meant to represent the Australian government and people and act impartially and fairly in its dealings and not in the manner described such as would warrant serious censure were it a private insurer.
I am fully aware that this is an isolated example but, given the level of dissatisfaction, I think it is the type of case where at the very least Comcare's management needs to provide an explanation. I have not yet raised this with the minister, as the solicitor at this point has been happy to conduct inquiries on behalf of the client, but I sought his and the client's permission to mention it during this debate. 
If, as Comcare's 1996-97 annual report states, its mission `is to take a leading role in the reduction of human and financial costs of workplace injury in Commonwealth employment by working with customer agencies to prevent injuries and return injured employees to work', then I suggest cases like my constituent's are the ones that government needs to be looking at to see what has to be done to improve the agency's level of service. I trust those in Comcare listening to this debate have heard these criticisms and will provide an explanation in due course. I acknowledge the story detailed so far is from the client and her solicitor, but the allegations are worrying. 
In the context of this bill, that case caused me to have a look at what might have caused the problem. Since 1990, the number of employees insured by Comcare and the total number of employer customers have decreased substantially. According to the agency's annual reports, in 1990 there were some 269,000 employees insured by the scheme. By 2000, this number had dropped by 150,000 to 142,996 employees. Over the same period, the number of compensation claims made against Comcare has reduced significantly.
In 1990 some 20,000 claims were lodged. Since 1996, when the current government came to power, claims have reduced from some 15,000 per annum to just 6,000—a massive decrease. Over the same period, total premiums have reduced from some $215 million in 1990 to just $91.4 million in 2000. After rising through the 1990s to a high of $205 million in 1994, total workers compensation costs were $183 million in 2000.
Interestingly, the one area within the overall reduction where costs seem to have ballooned is the provision of legal services. In this regard I note that in 1994-95 Comcare decided to tender for a panel of legal service providers following the untying of legal services from the Attorney-General's Department. According to that year's annual report, it was thought that the formation of the panel and outsourcing would allow the application of nationally consistent policies and principles, establishment of measurable performance indicators and provision of value added legal services. The outsourcing arrangements were implemented in 1994-96 using the Australian Government Solicitor, Barker Gosling, Blake Dawson and Waldron, Deacons Graham and James, Hunt and Hunt, Norman Waterhouse, Phillips Fox and Sparke Helmore. Deacons and Hunt and Hunt were subsequently dropped from the list.
In 1998, Comcare commissioned a review into the cost effectiveness of those arrangements. It concluded that there was strong qualitative evidence that the legal panel arrangements were producing positive results in terms of advice to claims managers and outcomes in the AAT process and that the quality and applicability of legal advice had improved. That year's annual report also concluded that in 1998 fees paid to Comcare's legal panel for work in relation to the AAT reduced by approximately 18 per cent over the 1997-98 year. This represented a reduction in real terms of nine per cent per case handled. That puts a pretty positive glow on things, to say the least. However, according to Comcare's own annual reports, in 1994, prior to outsourcing of legal services, legal costs including AAT and third party recovery costs, but excluding costs associated with common law claims, stood at just $2.87 million, or 1.4 per cent of the total costs of the scheme. In 1995 these costs had risen to $4.27 million, or 2.08 per cent of costs. In 1996 they were $6.9 million, or 3.4 per cent of total costs. In 1997 they ballooned to $12.15 million, or 6.16 per cent of costs. So even with the small reduction in 1998, they represented 6.4 per cent of all costs. That points to a six-fold increase in legal costs, excluding common law claims, over a four-year period. When the agency's costs relating to common law claims are included, they show a ballooning from some $10.64 million in 1993 to $17.8 million in 1998. That is a jump from 5.6 per cent to close to 9½ per cent of total costs over that period. 
My point in raising these details is to seek from the minister an explanation of just why, since the outsourcing of legal services, legal costs have increased so substantially when the total number of claims has reduced so markedly. Surely, if claims have reduced to one-third of what they were in 1994, we should be seeing a decline in legal costs at some point in time. It seems strange that, while the overall cost of the scheme is reducing, legal costs appear to be going the other way.
My other point in raising the issue is to seek from the minister details about just what improvements outsourcing of Comcare's legal services have delivered. What reviews of the outsourcing arrangements have been conducted? On what criteria have those arrangements been assessed? How is the outsourcing of this work to corporate firms contributing to the achievement of Comcare's worthy motto and mission statement? From the admittedly anecdotal feedback I have had from my electorate, rather than working with people to get them working Comcare appears to be becoming more and more adversarial in its approach to some compensation claims at least. I wonder whether the shift to private legal firms has played a role in that trend.
The bill in most other areas appears well targeted, and reasonable in nearly all instances. It is logical and uncontentious. However, I will look with interest at those aspects relating to the tightening of the definition of injury and disease, and study the non-government amendments both here and in the Senate. I would appreciate that explanation of the apparent escalation in outsourcing costs—perhaps an indication, if it could be made available, of the pre and post outsourcing average costs per case would help. I thank you for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.",REPS,"<title>SAFETY, REHABILITATION AND COMPENSATION AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1
"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2001-04-05,"—I do not intend to delay the House for too long in summing up this debate on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2000. I want to thank all members who have contributed to the debate. I particularly thank the shadow minister for his contribution. I thank the member for Calare for his extremely thoughtful presentation, to which I have just listened. I acknowledge the support which has been expressed by most speakers for large swathes of the legislation, even if not all of it.
As various speakers have noted, the Commonwealth Comcare scheme is a good scheme. It works well, it has low premiums and it has a good record of getting people back to work. It is a good scheme—in many respects one of the very best schemes in the country. The government's objective is not to fiddle with things for fiddling's sake but to try to make a good scheme even better and to try to make a good scheme even better represent the proper objects of workers compensation schemes.
I would like to take up some of the points that were raised by the shadow minister in his contribution. The first point I wish to respond to is the point about the change to the definition of `disease'. The bill proposes that there should be a significant contribution by employment before compensation is payable. The shadow minister said that this would mean that the Commonwealth scheme would have the most stringent test in Australia. I am advised that this is not true. I am advised that in Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia a significant `contribution' from employment is also required. I am advised that in Tasmania the compensation scheme there requires a `substantial contribution'. In New South Wales, the requirement is that employment has to be a `substantial' contributing factor. The New South Wales legislation also sets out examples of matters to be taken into account. The examples that New South Wales uses are broadly similar to the proposed Commonwealth list. For example, consider the case where an employee had, for argument's sake, been assaulted at a counter. In a stress related claim, the Comcare decision maker would obviously not consider any other factor. I am advised that the amendment would not allow the decision maker to decide that, yes, the assault was closely connected to work but that the person had a history of depression so the claim should be denied. That is not what would be permitted under the legislation that the government is proposing. However, in a case where a claimant had argued that they had a depressive condition as a result of not being able to sit, for argument's sake, next to a window but there was evidence that the relevant employee's marriage had broken down, then the decision may be that there was no close connection to work and that it was more likely that the condition was caused by the marriage breakdown rather than by the employment. Of course, in all cases of this nature, medical evidence will be sought. 
The shadow minister also raised the managerial action provision. I am advised that the bill provides that actions such as reasonable appraisal of an employee's performance, reasonable counselling action, reasonable suspension action, reasonable disciplinary action and failure by an employee to obtain a promotion, reclassification, transfer or benefit would not give rise to a compensable injury but claims for stress from overwork, change management and other activities would still be covered. I am advised that reasonable management action taken in a reasonable way by the employer in connection with the employer's employment is exempted in Queensland. I am advised that it is also exempted in South Australia and in Tasmania. I want to stress that there is no intention whatsoever that stress related injuries would not be compensable in a general sense, as seemed to be the suggestion from the member for Greenway and the member for Lowe.
On the question of compensation for non-economic loss that was raised by the shadow minister, I accept that the old table has not been indexed, but it was not indexed by the former government between 1988 and 1996. If it is indexed, I am advised that it will provide people with an incentive for delaying claims, and obviously it is better to have these things considered and dealt with rather more quickly than that.
The shadow minister was rather sceptical of the consultation processes that have been engaged in. I am advised that the consultation process was conducted by the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission and consultation took place with Comcare, Australia Post, Telstra, the Reserve Bank, ADI and the Department of Defence. Under the ordinary provisions of the committee on industrial legislation, there was consultation, I understand, with the ACTU and with the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Like the shadow minister, I am looking forward to the Senate committee report and will look carefully at what it has to say.
I listened with concern and interest to the thoughtful and well-researched contribution of the member for Calare. I appreciate his decision, in consultation with his constituent, to raise a particular matter in the House. I can say that my advice is that there is another side to this particular story. Rather than put it all on the record here, I am happy to discuss it privately with the member for Calare. But let me just say that the decision is currently subject to an internal review by Comcare on the request of Ms Grimley's solicitors, and should Ms Grimley be dissatisfied with the outcome of this review she has a right to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. As I said, I am happy to talk further about this with the member for Calare.
I have not been advised as yet on the subject of the costs of legal services in the pre-outsourcing days compared to the current costs of legal services, but I will seek that information and come back to the member for Calare. If things are as the member for Calare suggests, he has made a good point and it needs to be addressed. In closing, I should indicate that the government will be moving some technical amendments. I understand that is going to be done in the Senate. 
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2001-04-05,"—I seek to raise this evening an issue that has been raised with me in my electorate by a representative of the local Chilean community—an issue that is being pursued by the Chilean Committee of Refugees and Relatives of Missing People. As I am sure all members of this House are aware, Chile suffered for a period under a fascist regime—that is, the Pinochet dictatorship. During that period, a large number of people fled Chile to escape the dictatorship. Many of them have made Australia their home, and a number of them are located in my electorate. 
As a result of the recognition in Chile of the atrocities committed under the Pinochet dictatorship, a compensation scheme has been determined and legislated by the Chilean government. That compensation scheme is designed to give ex gratia payments, payments of mercy, to those who suffered either as a result of torture or the loss of a loved one or family member, or who suffered economically because they were persecuted and driven away from their place of employment by the Pinochet regime.
An issue has been raised with me about the treatment of these small `pensions of mercy' under Australian law. I am advised that the former Minister for Family and Community Services was in dialogue about this very question with the Chilean ambassador. I have with me a copy of a letter that she wrote to His Excellency, dated 19 January, where she indicated her preparedness to look at the treatment of these moneys for social security purposes. As I understand it, the matter has not been further advanced, and my purpose in raising it tonight is to urge upon the government and upon members of this House the need for this matter to be expedited and to receive the most sympathetic treatment possible.
Just to make the issue clear, we are dealing with an ageing community, individuals of which might well be eligible for social security benefits and, particularly, for the age pension. In the ordinary course, moneys received from overseas are taken into account in the income test for the age pension, as indeed are moneys that an Australian local might receive from Australian sources or from performing some part-time work or what have you. However, under our Social Security Act some specific exemptions have been made so that some income is not treated as income for social security purposes. The Australian government has made a deliberate policy decision that some sources of income will not prejudice a person's entitlement to social security benefits and, most particularly, to the age pension. 
I refer in that regard to section 8 of the Social Security Act 1991. Section 8 is the definitional section. In the way of definitional sections in major pieces of legislation, it is long and complex. If you chase it through, it defines, in subsections 8(8)(n) and 8(8)(p), that the amounts paid from the following sources will not be treated as income for social security purposes. In relation to subsection 8(8)(n), that source is:
an amount paid:
(i)	by the Federal Republic of Germany under the laws of that Republic; or 
(ii)	by a State of the Federal Republic of Germany under the laws of that State; 
by way of compensation for a victim of National Socialist persecution
In relation to subsection 8(8)(p), that source is:
an amount paid by the Republic of Austria under the laws of that Republic by way of compensation to a victim of National Socialist persecution
So our law—and I draw the attention of the House to that section specifically—has already recognised that payments of mercy, compensatory payments to victims of fascism, ought not to be taken into account in the income test for social security purposes. It seems to me that the case raised by those in the Chilean community who have suffered under the Pinochet fascist dictatorship is on the same footing, with the exemption already in our social security legislation. Consequently, I am urging the government to give the most prompt and most sympathetic treatment possible to the request of the Chilean community that the very small pensions of mercy they receive not be treated as income for social security purposes.

—I recognise the member for Herbert but I require him, at the conclusion of his address, to remove that monstrosity from the chamber. He asked my permission to bring it into the chamber and he was less than fulsome in his explanation as to its dimensions or the fact that it would contain a burning wick. I will therefore feel that a precedent has been created which will require me to require more detail in future from members who are seeking my permission.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Lalor Electorate: Chilean Community</title>,Adjournment,33,1
"Hollis, Colin, MP",ALP,2001-04-05,"—Transport is vital to Australia. It has long concerned me that we do not have a national transport strategy in Australia and that our transport needs are approached very much on an ad hoc basis. This is not helped by the federal system in Australia. Each state seems to have its own priorities, and nothing emphasises this more than the different rail gauges that existed in the early days. It has taken years of effort and millions of dollars to get a somewhat uniform approach to rail, and the jealousies of the states in the early days have cost producers in this country millions of dollars. I am not one of those who argue for a road/rail approach—an either/or process. We need an integrated approach encompassing both road and rail, and implicit in this is that rail must receive proper funding and not be expected to compete against roads, as it were, with one hand tied behind its back.
Some years ago the federal government accepted responsibility for some funding under the national highway program, but unless you are on that highway you are disadvantaged in regard to road. The Princes Highway linking Sydney to Melbourne along the South Coast should be declared a road of national importance. Just yesterday, the Prime Minister put a stop to that by saying that such a road would not receive federal funding, so deaths will continue on that road. Local producers will be disadvantaged, while the South Coast and Illawarra again miss out. You will appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, because of your campaign regarding North Coast roads, that there are more deaths per kilometre on the Princes Highway than there are on the Hume Highway. So there is absolutely no doubt that good roads save lives.
Another part of my integrated plan is to have ports linked to the hinterland. Thus I have argued for many years for a replacement road to Macquarie Pass so that the port of Kembla can reach its full potential as an export development port to complement the work that the Port Kembla Corporation has achieved. I call on the Prime Minister and, indeed, the Deputy Prime Minister with his special responsibilities, to adequately fund the Princes Highway and to declare it a road of national importance. 
The whole Princes Highway network should be a road of national importance. It is good enough for the Sydney to Brisbane route to have two major roads and a railway. On the South Coast, the railway stops at Bomaderry. The only thing we have south of Bomaderry is a narrow deathtrap of a road. It should be adequately funded, because there is no other transport network there. The rail stops at Bomaderry and then you go onto the Princes Highway. I was on the Princes Highway last weekend. It is a narrow, dangerous deathtrap of a road. The statistics show that there are more deaths per kilometre on the Princes Highway than on the Hume Highway.

"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2001-04-05,"—Yesterday I spoke in parliament about the impact of the GST on small business. I want to talk today about the impact of the GST and the behaviour of major insurance companies on the smash repair industry and small businesses operating in that industry. This industry has been especially hard hit by the GST, because it performs some of the many services that are for the first time taxed by the GST. The smash repair industry has been not only affected by the GST but doubly hit by the falling Australian dollar, because quite a lot of this industry's costs are costs of imported items. With the dollar now below US50c, obviously the cost of imported material, such as paint, is now much greater as a result of the depreciation in the dollar. We were told before the GST was introduced that it would increase the value of the dollar. It has done nothing of the sort; the dollar, as we know, is now at an all-time low. 
In addition to that squeeze as a result of changes to the tax system, there is a squeeze on these small reputable operators within the smash repair industry by insurers themselves. They are forcing the small businesses to absorb the cost increases associated with the falling value of the dollar and also to absorb part of the GST. This is a very similar pattern of behaviour to that of the trucking companies which are squeezing drivers who are under pressure because of the GST and fuel cost increases. Insurers are also directing, in some cases, smash repairers to use non-genuine replacement parts, often without the knowledge of the owners of the vehicles. I call on the insurers to review their behaviour and their abuse of market power over these small and reputable smash repairers. We do not want the fly-by-night operators surviving and the reputable smash repairers going to the wall. The public needs to know what is going on—that is, a deteriorating quality of work, the use of non-genuine replacement parts and ethical operators being squeezed out by unethical behaviour. 
I link all of these realities to bankruptcy figures that were released just yesterday. In my home state of Queensland, bankruptcies are up to 21½ per cent in the three months to March compared with three months in the previous year. In addition, debt agreements are up by a massive almost 50 per cent. It was forecast by economic modellers that Queensland and Tasmania would be the states most adversely affected by the GST. Those forecasts are now becoming reality. It is not as if the government was not warned: even its own modellers predicted that Queensland and Tasmania would be the most adversely affected states. In Tasmania there was a massive 17.24 per cent increase in bankruptcies in the March quarter compared with the corresponding period for the previous year. Compare that with the Australia-wide figure of 13.64 per cent. These are unacceptable figures. They are very high and, unfortunately, they are just as were predicted by economic modellers in the Australian Labor Party.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Smash Repair Industry</title>,Adjournment,36,1
