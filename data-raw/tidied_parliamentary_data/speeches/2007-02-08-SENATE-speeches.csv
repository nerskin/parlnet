"Watson, Sen John",LP,2007-02-08,"—Pursuant to notice given at the last day of sitting on behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I now withdraw business of the Senate notices of motion numbers 1 and 8 standing in my name for seven sitting days after today.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Withdrawal</title>,Notices,1,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-02-08,"—There are two matters on which I seek amendment to that motion. I move:

At the end of the motion, add “and, in respect of the Income Tax Amendment Bill 2007, the Income Tax (Former Complying Superannuation Funds) Amendment Bill 2007, the Income Tax (Former Non-resident Superannuation Funds) Amendment Bill 2007, the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 2007 and the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Simplification) Bill 2007, the provisions of the bills be referred to the Economics Committee for inquiry and report by 1 March 2007”.

The Selection of Bills Committee has in the past—in the previous parliament and up to now—been an effective way of ensuring that the business of the senate gets looked at in an appropriate way. It determined whether or not an inquiry was required—whether a matter should be referred to a committee or not, because it could be dealt with in here. That system seems to have broken down with the government holding the numbers in this place. It wants to take the opportunity to ram legislation through this Senate.
What we now find is that the government is seeking to bring forward legislation into the house, but through the Selection of Bills Committee, before it is actually introduced here. Where the opposition and, I suspect, the minor parties may otherwise consider the decision to request an inquiry and provide for a certain time to allow that inquiry to proceed, the Selection of Bills Committee is the appropriate place for that debate to occur, and it has always worked on consensus. What happens, though, is that bills which are yet unseen are referred by the Selection of Bills Committee to inquiry and report or they are deferred. So people are making decisions in the Selection of Bills Committee without the ability or knowledge to see what is in the legislation itself—without having read it and without it having been introduced into the parliament. Where bills have then been introduced and examined and it is considered that they in fact should be inquired into, the opportunity for that has passed, because at the time the committee held its meeting there was no ability for the relevant shadows—the opposition and the minor parties—to have a look at the bill. This system is breaking down.
What should happen—the logical process—is that bills should be introduced into this house, there should be sufficient time for a bill to be examined, and the Selection of Bills Committee should then meet. They can then decide by consensus, as they always have, as to whether that bill is required to be referred to the committee system for examination or whether it is of a type that does not require examination, is not referred and is therefore dealt with in the usual way and is available for debate in this house. That is the logical system that has been used in the past. What the government has done is seek to break from that process and seek to refer bills sight unseen—that is, they have not been introduced into this house or the House of Representatives, nor has an advance copy been provided. What happens is you get a name like ‘Income Tax Amendment Bill 2007’ and you have to make a decision as to whether that bill should or should not be referred to a committee for inquiry and report. Until you see the detail of that particular bill, it is impossible to make any fair determination of that. On that basis, we have sought these bills to be recommitted to the Selection of Bills Committee. They would not do it. So what we have now had to do is come into this house and say, ‘These bills should go back to a committee for examination and report,’ because having seen the bills there is a concern that there are matters that should be examined and reviewed by the relevant committee.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2007-02-08,"—Senator Ludwig has moved an amendment and I have a further amendment. Mr Acting Deputy President, do you want to deal with Senator Ludwig’s amendment or shall I move mine now as well?
 (Senator Ferguson)—You can foreshadow an amendment and move it later, Senator Lundy.
—I will foreshadow moving it in speaking to Senator Ludwig’s amendment. In foreshadowing this amendment I make the same points as Senator Ludwig. We are dealing here with a process that is completely absurd if the opposition and cross-benches are to have any hope of making a considered determination about the reference of a bill to a committee. What appears to be happening is that the government are exploiting the fact that they know very well they have the numbers in this place and are trying to limit the extent to which their legislation is scrutinised by referring it, before it has even been seen, to a very limited inquiry. That really sits at the heart of Labor’s complaint on this matter and why we are raising it in the chamber today.
We are not in a position to be able to assess the type of committee hearing or the type of inquiry that is warranted without having seen the bill and having had the opportunity to absorb what is in the bill. To try to force this chamber to refer a bill to a very limited inquiry—as has been done before—completely ignores any concerns that the opposition or cross benches may have.
Senator Ludwig’s amendment refers to dates. My amendment relates to the terms of reference. Our concerns extend to the analysis of the viability of the registration process, in particular whether there are adequate proof of identity checks. We would like to see that as part of the terms of reference, as well as adequate time to allow this bill to be considered in committee.
This is not the first time this has been done by the coalition government. It seems to be some sort of exercise in ensuring that the committee system is being used, albeit, I and the Labor Party say, not used effectively. In fact it is being abused. That is not in the spirit of the processes that the Senate committee system affords. It does not allow us as an opposition to be able to investigate the bill and address all of the concerns that we are aware of and any additional concerns that may be and should be drawn out through the committee process. The committee inquiry is so truncated that we are not even able to garner the witnesses before the committee to draw out those issues, so inevitably we are going to end up with untested or unscrutinised legislation. That is not good enough in a modern democracy like Australia and I think that it does constitute a form of abuse.
The concept of an access card has been around for quite some time. Because of the amount of community debate that has already been had on this issue, one would have expected that quite a lengthy inquiry was indeed warranted. If this issue is as profound and as important and as groundbreaking an issue as the minister claims—and I heard him yesterday say that it is a substantial renewal of this type of identity mechanism—then why would the government be hiding it? Why wouldn’t they want the utmost scrutiny of this bill? Why wouldn’t they want to test it with all of the constituencies and stakeholders that have an opinion about it? Why wouldn’t they want it tested in this forum both with the cross bench and, particularly, the Labor opposition that has been exploring these issues and participating in the public debate about the access card for some time?
It runs against the rhetoric that we have heard from the minister in this place and, again, just points to a form of abuse by the Howard government of the Senate committee system. Like my colleagues, I certainly urge the government to support our amendments and not to be pigheaded about this, to understand that it is about appropriate processes and scrutiny of these bills. I urge them not only to support these amendments but to allow a suitable date for reporting that will permit the committee to organise a series of decent and reasonable hearings so that all witnesses and stakeholders who want to appear have the opportunity.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,2,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-02-08,"—by leave—I foreshadow a further amendment to the motion relating to the Selection of Bills Committee report:
At the end of the motion, add “but, in respect of the Human Services (Enhanced Service Delivery) Bill 2007, the Finance and Public Administration Committee report by 12 June 2007”.
We are seeking to move a number of amendments and I intend to speak to this amendment for a couple of minutes. What needs to be made clear here today is that in terms of the access card—if I can use that short phrase—the government’s intention is to ram that through before Easter. That will not allow privacy interests, civil interests, the Australian Federal Police, who might have an interest, and all of those other relevant bodies and the community to be involved in the debate about the access card. It is imperative that this government allows sufficient time for this committee to be able to examine the access card.
I have already heard murmurings from the government backbench about this. It is necessary and desirable for this committee to have sufficient time to call for submissions, deal with those submissions and properly hold hearings through the committee process—it is not desirable that this government shorten the time frame to such an extent and use its numbers to ram this through. It is inappropriate and wrong of the government to take this tack on such an important card. It is clear that this is the type of bill that requires scrutiny, and this government should be ashamed that it is taking this course. The minister has allowed me a short time only to put this point; I would otherwise take a lot longer. On that basis, I will reserve my comments for another opportunity.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,2,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2007-02-08,"—In the short time available I want to canvass a number of issues. Firstly, there is the ludicrous proposition of the opposition that this government has restricted time for scrutiny of bills. When the opposition was in government we used to have a Friday committee. A bill would be introduced one week, you would have the Friday to sit to consider that bill and then you would report the following week. I remember that as a matter of practice when I sat on the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. That was what we experienced as an opposition when this opposition was in government—a Friday committee system applied.
I want to foreshadow an amendment to the motion which has been moved by Senator Ferris, and that is:
At the end of the motion, add “and, in respect of the Human Services (Enhanced Service Delivery) Bill 2007, the Finance and Public Administration Committee report by 15 March 2007.”.
That will allow a five-week period of consideration for the bills that are considered in the Senate. That is not an unreasonable time. The government has previously released this bill in the form of an exposure draft for public comment—four weeks of exposure in December. When you add that to the five-week period which we are seeking, that is nine weeks of public scrutiny. Of course, the early passage of this bill is required to ensure that a legal framework is available to support the implementation of the proposed smartcard system, to enable registration for the card to commence in early 2008 and to provide sufficient time to provide meaningful information to the public about the proposed changes. Of course, the June date which has been suggested by the opposition is farcical. It would totally dismantle the time frame regime I have mentioned that is so essential. This legislation will provide certainty to achieve cost-effective procurement of technological services which will be required to support the smartcard. If any amendments are proposed to the bill by the committee, the 15 March reporting date will allow time for them to be considered by the government. That relates to the Human Services (Enhanced Service Delivery) Bill 2007.
The opposition is also seeking the referral of a number of tax bills and superannuation bills to a committee for reporting during the week of 1 March. These bills are technical; they relate to matters which have previously been scrutinised in detail. They have been examined by the Senate Standing Committee on Economics and there would be little benefit referring these bills to a Senate committee. That would simply delay matters. We know that we have a heavy legislation schedule for this sitting period and referring the bills to a committee will delay them. The amendments in these bills are minor and technical in nature; they raise no significant policy issues. All the policy issues have been dealt with previously and have been scrutinised by the Senate Economics Committee, as I said earlier. It is essential that we get these bills passed as soon as possible so that these changes can be put in place for the benefit of the Australian public.
When you get these comments about how little scrutiny of legislation we have had, it is interesting to take a look. Just last year we had a record number of bills referred to committees—100 bills were referred to committees last year. That is hardly an indication of a lack of scrutiny. In this case, we are saying that there are a number of bills which should be referred to committees, with realistic time limits. We have to get these bills in place so that these policy initiatives can be implemented.
The issue of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee is one which we have to address because the committee is not sitting regularly enough to consider bills which are introduced. As soon as a bill is introduced we want to consider whether it needs to go to a committee so that we can give it as much time as possible. What we have been experiencing is that we have to wait for the committee to sit. This is not a criticism of that committee; it is just that it meets at a certain time and we have to wait until that committee sits so that we can refer a bill and consider its reference.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-02-08,"—This is a very important issue and the Senate needs to recognise that this is not just some minor spat to start the day. I have been involved with, or one step removed from, the Selection of Bills Committee process for a long time now. It worked perfectly well throughout all the period of this government—very cooperatively, very smoothly. There were occasional disagreements which were sorted out here in the chamber, but basically it worked quite well until this government got control of the Senate. It took them about six months after that before they started really mucking around with this process. The simple fact is that now we have the absurd situation where the government is referring its own bills, sight unseen, en masse and with the shortest possible time frames, to committees without any reason for their referral, without adequate time for the community to have input or for the committee to consider bills, and then railroading them back through here.
We had the ridiculous circumstance in the final sitting week in December last year where we had, through two reports of the Selection of Bills Committee, a total of 25 bills referred through 13 different packages to a whole range of different committees, almost all of them to report back either this week or the next sitting week in February, with all of that Christmas period in between. If people think it is possible for the community and different interest groups to keep track over the Christmas period of 25 different bills in a whole range of different areas and for the committees to do that work during that break, then they are kidding themselves. That is the sort of ridiculous circumstance we are in. The way it always used to work and the way it has to work is for there to be enough time after the bills are introduced to at least see what is in them before we can figure out what issues are being raised and whether or not they merit an inquiry and what sort of inquiry they merit.
This myth that is now being regularly put about that somehow or other, once upon a time, bills used to be introduced one week, we would have a Friday hearing, and then they would be debated the next week is just not true. I do not know why it continues to be said, but it is simply not true. I would like to get Senator Robert Ray in here; he has an elephantine memory and could detail in fine points the reality of what happens—I have heard him do it once or twice. He has probably given up bothering to come in and actually talk about the reality of what happens. But it just did not happen that way.
It does not matter how often you keep repeating it, it is not true. I have been around in various guises before I came into this chamber back to 1990 and I saw the changes that were made to the committee system in 1994—a number of which have now been reversed with the government taking all of them over again—and this notion that there was a one-week turnaround with a Friday hearing is not the way it worked. The simple fact is that for significant pieces of legislation that do require proper examination and do require community input, we are doing our job. It is not politics; it is not looking for advantage—it is doing our job. We are not looking for where the votes are; we are passing laws that are in place for decades that affect the entire Australian community and the government do not think we should take the time to look at them.
We have this proposal from the ALP that a raft of tax bills be examined for quite a brief inquiry and the government’s response is just: ‘No, not negotiable. We’re not even going to think about it, you just can’t do it.’ Who is the Treasurer to dictate to the Senate and say, ‘You can’t look at these tax bills’? What a disgrace that those are the depths to which we have sunk. The Treasurer can sit in his office over there, dictate to the Senate and say, ‘You’re not allowed to look at these tax bills.’
There are a bunch of five tax bills, and the people who have looked at them say, ‘These need some further examination only for a month or six weeks.’ What is the problem? I bet you anything you like those bills will not be debated here by the time that they would have been reported back on, as is being proposed in this amendment. It is complete contempt and complete arrogance and that is what we have sunk to. Do not let anybody kid you that this is business as usual. This is a serious undermining of the core business of the Senate. It is an absolute travesty and it is the key reason that the role of the Senate and the composition of the Senate after the next election has to be of major focus and major interest to the people of Australia because, if the coalition gets away with this this time around, you ain’t seen nothing yet.

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2007-02-08,"—One of the bills that we are currently debating, relating to the access card, raises issues which have engendered considerable debate within the community. The government has not provided the opportunity for the public to look at the detail of the legislation. The legislation was introduced into the parliament yesterday. The idea of a national ID card, firstly in the form of the Australian Card in the eighties, has been around for a long time, but the public cannot understand the consequences if they do not have the details in front of them. That bill was only introduced into parliament yesterday. Sure, it has been in discussion—it has engendered debate because 80 per cent of the Australian population do not want a national ID card. People need the opportunity to look at the legislation to be able to see whether this so-called access card is, as the Greens and many others have said, actually a de facto national ID card.
There are members of the government’s back bench who have also pointed this out. We need the opportunity to properly look at the legislation provided yesterday so that this issue of public debate can be resolved. While little pieces of information about this access card dribble out, more and more Australians have become concerned about the consequences of setting up a database where everyone’s information is in there and a card which has a biometric photo and a microchip that is going to hold far more information than was ever proposed with the Australia Card. As these details start to come out people have become more and more concerned about the fact that this so-called access card is a national ID card. The minister said yesterday in question time that the concerns people had on these issues were legitimate and that the majority of Australians did not want a national ID card. Come on, Minister, come on, government, give us the opportunity to look properly at the legislation you introduced yesterday so that Australians and parliamentarians in particular can decide for themselves whether what is being proposed by the government is in fact a national ID card that Australians do not want.
We need to have a substantial Senate inquiry. The government said that there would be a public inquiry into this issue yet they released an exposure draft at the end of December just before Christmas, with the January break to follow. That is the opportunity that the government proposed for people to be able to have a public debate about whether we want a national ID card. That is ridiculous. It is a complete failure by the government to be genuine in any way whatsoever about consulting with the public on this issue when they introduce a piece of legislation into the parliament and limit the capacity for the public again to discuss a vitally important issue.
We all know in here how concerned Australians are about the idea of a national ID card. We all know in here how concerned Australians are about privacy and we know the community groups who have been speaking out on this issue and have raised concerns about this issue. That is why we have in this Selection of Bills Committee report massive lists of all the groups who should be invited to appear before the Senate inquiry. You cannot hear their evidence if you limit the opportunities for the Senate inquiry to exist, particularly after the government have said, ‘We’ll have a public inquiry; we’ll allow people to talk about this.’
The minister was in here yesterday in question time saying that people had legitimate concerns and did not want a national ID card. He is right: people do have legitimate concerns and do not want a national ID card. Not just the public but parliamentarians as well need a proper opportunity through an open and public Senate inquiry look into this legislation and determine for themselves if this so-called access card that is being proposed is in fact a national ID card. The Greens believe that the public need to have the opportunity to look at this information to determine for themselves what is being proposed by the government and for parliamentarians in particular to be able to determine how they should vote on this issue.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,2,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2007-02-08,"—This is a very important issue today because it is a clear example of how this government intends to abuse its majority in the Senate. This is as clear an example as you will find of the arrogance and contempt with which the government now treats the Senate and the Australian people. This is an absolute abuse of power. The government is using its majority in the Senate to deny Australians the right to understand and debate the introduction of an access card—or national ID card.
This is an issue that is fundamentally important in Australia; it is fundamentally important that Australians have the right to understand and debate the issue. But the government comes in here today having abused the selection of bills process, which is generally operated on the basis of cooperation, and says: ‘No, you can have an inquiry. We can pretend the Senate still works, we will keep up the farce, we will pretend that we respect the institution of the Senate, but we’re going to slip through one of the most contentious bills in the history of the nation by having a quick and dirty inquiry that we will control. In a matter of weeks we will have had the inquiry, we will have had the facade of a democratic process, but the Australian people won’t have seen the bill and they won’t have had a chance to debate the issues. We will have had a couple of days of public hearings, chaired by a government senator with instructions to keep a lid on the proper debate, and then we’ll ram the legislation through the chamber, as has happened with all the previous legislation of significance.’
The government has attempted to put the Senate to sleep by pretending to follow due process and pretending to allow the Senate to continue its function, but, in effect, it has been abusing its majority time and time again. The arrogance of this is breathtaking. The government would have us slip through a process which allows a very cursory examination of a major piece of legislation that no-one has seen yet, that no-one has any understanding of and which the government’s own Liberal backbenchers are deeply concerned about. Their own party room talked about how this was equivalent to giving the Nazis more of an opportunity to exterminate Jews. The Attorney-General himself talked about the dangers of this legislation down the track. This is an issue that is of deep concern to a whole range of people in our community, but the government is saying to us: ‘We’ve got the numbers; we’re going to roll the legislation through and we’re going to give you this facade of the Senate continuing its function in order to be able to defend ourselves against the accusation of abuse of our majority.’
The reality is that the government will have a quick and dirty inquiry. There will be limited hearings and a limited opportunity to debate the legislation and the government will bring the legislation in and ram it through the Senate very quickly. No major bill in the past was treated like this before the change of power that happened when the government got its majority. It is outrageous. I know it concerns a lot of government senators; it certainly concerns all senators on the non-government side. This is an abuse of the Senate. The government goes too far when it prevents senators from doing the job we were elected to do. That government has to be held up to examination for its abuse of the Senate. This proves to people why the government should never have been allowed a majority in the Senate. It proves why this is a dangerous thing for democracy.
Yesterday the government denied us the capacity to inquire into the Qantas sale. The Australian people were denied the ability to examine the issues involving the sale of Qantas, the future of the national icon airline and the future of jobs in the airline industry in Australia because the government did not want the debate. Now they are saying to us that we have no right to have a proper debate about the introduction of an access card. It is a disgrace—

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2007-02-08,"—I seek leave to make a short statement in this debate. I do not believe there are any other speakers left.
Leave granted.
—I rise to talk not about the specifics of the bill but about the process, to support the comments of non-government colleagues and also to offer a compromise in this debate. Honourable senators would be aware of the Selection of Bills Committee proposals that were volunteered by the Australian Democrats and I understand that, as of today, the Labor Party has put forward a reference proposal for selection of bills and has now foreshadowed that with a change to a 12 June reporting date. I think that is preferable for all of us on the non-government side. But, having said that, given how desperate we on this side of the chamber are to debate in some detail these complex technical, technological, political and legal bills—65 pages on the access card were tabled yesterday—would the government even consider the dates that were put forward by the Australian Democrats in the selection of bills process? That proposal was for hearings to begin in the weeks beginning 5 March or 12 March, with a reporting date of 26 March or indeed 20 March, which was the date we were prepared to put forward directly to the minister and today in the chamber.
I am aware that these access card bills, in the form of an exploratory draft, have been around for some time. I do not know about you, but I cuddled up with mine over the summer holidays and read it, along with Andrew McGahan’s Underground and Anna Funder’s Stasiland just to get me in the mood. I think that there is a strong argument for an inquiry into these bills, even given that there has been an exposure draft, and especially given that there is a changed piece of legislation, which was tabled in the House of Reps—not the Senate; the House of Reps—yesterday. So will the government even consider a compromise, given the desperation on the non-government side about not just the complex nature of this legislation but the fact that it is a large volume of legislation which in the case of the access card potentially represents the greatest single privacy intrusion into the lives of the Australian people ever?
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Ludwig’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,2,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-02-08,"—There are two matters on which I seek amendment to that motion. I move:

At the end of the motion, add “and, in respect of the Income Tax Amendment Bill 2007, the Income Tax (Former Complying Superannuation Funds) Amendment Bill 2007, the Income Tax (Former Non-resident Superannuation Funds) Amendment Bill 2007, the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 2007 and the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Simplification) Bill 2007, the provisions of the bills be referred to the Economics Committee for inquiry and report by 1 March 2007”.

The Selection of Bills Committee has in the past—in the previous parliament and up to now—been an effective way of ensuring that the business of the senate gets looked at in an appropriate way. It determined whether or not an inquiry was required—whether a matter should be referred to a committee or not, because it could be dealt with in here.

 (Senator Ferguson)—You can foreshadow an amendment and move it later, Senator Lundy.
—I will foreshadow moving it in speaking to Senator Ludwig’s amendment. In foreshadowing this amendment I make the same points as Senator Ludwig. We are dealing here with a process that is completely absurd if the opposition and cross-benches are to have any hope of making a considered determination about the reference of a bill to a committee.

Our concerns extend to the analysis of the viability of the registration process, in particular whether there are adequate proof of identity checks. We would like to see that as part of the terms of reference, as well as adequate time to allow this bill to be considered in committee.
This is not the first time this has been done by the coalition government. It seems to be some sort of exercise in ensuring that the committee system is being used, albeit, I and the Labor Party say, not used effectively. In fact it is being abused. That is not in the spirit of the processes that the Senate committee system affords. It does not allow us as an opposition to be able to investigate the bill and address all of the concerns that we are aware of and any additional concerns that may be and should be drawn out through the committee process. The committee inquiry is so truncated that we are not even able to garner the witnesses before the committee to draw out those issues, so inevitably we are going to end up with untested or unscrutinised legislation. That is not good enough in a modern democracy like Australia and I think that it does constitute a form of abuse.
The concept of an access card has been around for quite some time. Because of the amount of community debate that has already been had on this issue, one would have expected that quite a lengthy inquiry was indeed warranted. If this issue is as profound and as important and as groundbreaking an issue as the minister claims—and I heard him yesterday say that it is a substantial renewal of this type of identity mechanism—then why would the government be hiding it? Why wouldn’t they want the utmost scrutiny of this bill? Why wouldn’t they want to test it with all of the constituencies and stakeholders that have an opinion about it? Why wouldn’t they want it tested in this forum both with the cross bench and, particularly, the Labor opposition that has been exploring these issues and participating in the public debate about the access card for some time?
It runs against the rhetoric that we have heard from the minister in this place and, again, just points to a form of abuse by the Howard government of the Senate committee system. Like my colleagues, I certainly urge the government to support our amendments and not to be pigheaded about this, to understand that it is about appropriate processes and scrutiny of these bills. I urge them not only to support these amendments but to allow a suitable date for reporting that will permit the committee to organise a series of decent and reasonable hearings so that all witnesses and stakeholders who want to appear have the opportunity.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,2,2
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-02-08,"—by leave—I foreshadow a further amendment to the motion relating to the Selection of Bills Committee report:
At the end of the motion, add “but, in respect of the Human Services (Enhanced Service Delivery) Bill 2007, the Finance and Public Administration Committee report by 12 June 2007”.
We are seeking to move a number of amendments and I intend to speak to this amendment for a couple of minutes. What needs to be made clear here today is that in terms of the access card—if I can use that short phrase—the government’s intention is to ram that through before Easter. That will not allow privacy interests, civil interests, the Australian Federal Police, who might have an interest, and all of those other relevant bodies and the community to be involved in the debate about the access card. It is imperative that this government allows sufficient time for this committee to be able to examine the access card.
I have already heard murmurings from the government backbench about this. It is necessary and desirable for this committee to have sufficient time to call for submissions, deal with those submissions and properly hold hearings through the committee process—it is not desirable that this government shorten the time frame to such an extent and use its numbers to ram this through. It is inappropriate and wrong of the government to take this tack on such an important card. It is clear that this is the type of bill that requires scrutiny, and this government should be ashamed that it is taking this course. The minister has allowed me a short time only to put this point; I would otherwise take a lot longer. On that basis, I will reserve my comments for another opportunity.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,2,2
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2007-02-08,"—In the short time available I want to canvass a number of issues. Firstly, there is the ludicrous proposition of the opposition that this government has restricted time for scrutiny of bills. When the opposition was in government we used to have a Friday committee. A bill would be introduced one week, you would have the Friday to sit to consider that bill and then you would report the following week. I remember that as a matter of practice when I sat on the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. That was what we experienced as an opposition when this opposition was in government—a Friday committee system applied.
I want to foreshadow an amendment to the motion which has been moved by Senator Ferris, and that is:
At the end of the motion, add “and, in respect of the Human Services (Enhanced Service Delivery) Bill 2007, the Finance and Public Administration Committee report by 15 March 2007.”.
That will allow a five-week period of consideration for the bills that are considered in the Senate. That is not an unreasonable time. The government has previously released this bill in the form of an exposure draft for public comment—four weeks of exposure in December. When you add that to the five-week period which we are seeking, that is nine weeks of public scrutiny. Of course, the early passage of this bill is required to ensure that a legal framework is available to support the implementation of the proposed smartcard system, to enable registration for the card to commence in early 2008 and to provide sufficient time to provide meaningful information to the public about the proposed changes. Of course, the June date which has been suggested by the opposition is farcical. It would totally dismantle the time frame regime I have mentioned that is so essential. This legislation will provide certainty to achieve cost-effective procurement of technological services which will be required to support the smartcard. If any amendments are proposed to the bill by the committee, the 15 March reporting date will allow time for them to be considered by the government. That relates to the Human Services (Enhanced Service Delivery) Bill 2007.
The opposition is also seeking the referral of a number of tax bills and superannuation bills to a committee for reporting during the week of 1 March. These bills are technical; they relate to matters which have previously been scrutinised in detail. They have been examined by the Senate Standing Committee on Economics and there would be little benefit referring these bills to a Senate committee. That would simply delay matters. We know that we have a heavy legislation schedule for this sitting period and referring the bills to a committee will delay them. The amendments in these bills are minor and technical in nature; they raise no significant policy issues. All the policy issues have been dealt with previously and have been scrutinised by the Senate Economics Committee, as I said earlier. It is essential that we get these bills passed as soon as possible so that these changes can be put in place for the benefit of the Australian public.
When you get these comments about how little scrutiny of legislation we have had, it is interesting to take a look. Just last year we had a record number of bills referred to committees—100 bills were referred to committees last year. That is hardly an indication of a lack of scrutiny. In this case, we are saying that there are a number of bills which should be referred to committees, with realistic time limits. We have to get these bills in place so that these policy initiatives can be implemented.
The issue of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee is one which we have to address because the committee is not sitting regularly enough to consider bills which are introduced. As soon as a bill is introduced we want to consider whether it needs to go to a committee so that we can give it as much time as possible. What we have been experiencing is that we have to wait for the committee to sit. This is not a criticism of that committee; it is just that it meets at a certain time and we have to wait until that committee sits so that we can refer a bill and consider its reference.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-02-08,"—This is a very important issue and the Senate needs to recognise that this is not just some minor spat to start the day. I have been involved with, or one step removed from, the Selection of Bills Committee process for a long time now. It worked perfectly well throughout all the period of this government—very cooperatively, very smoothly. There were occasional disagreements which were sorted out here in the chamber, but basically it worked quite well until this government got control of the Senate. It took them about six months after that before they started really mucking around with this process. The simple fact is that now we have the absurd situation where the government is referring its own bills, sight unseen, en masse and with the shortest possible time frames, to committees without any reason for their referral, without adequate time for the community to have input or for the committee to consider bills, and then railroading them back through here.
We had the ridiculous circumstance in the final sitting week in December last year where we had, through two reports of the Selection of Bills Committee, a total of 25 bills referred through 13 different packages to a whole range of different committees, almost all of them to report back either this week or the next sitting week in February, with all of that Christmas period in between. If people think it is possible for the community and different interest groups to keep track over the Christmas period of 25 different bills in a whole range of different areas and for the committees to do that work during that break, then they are kidding themselves. That is the sort of ridiculous circumstance we are in. The way it always used to work and the way it has to work is for there to be enough time after the bills are introduced to at least see what is in them before we can figure out what issues are being raised and whether or not they merit an inquiry and what sort of inquiry they merit.
This myth that is now being regularly put about that somehow or other, once upon a time, bills used to be introduced one week, we would have a Friday hearing, and then they would be debated the next week is just not true. I do not know why it continues to be said, but it is simply not true. I would like to get Senator Robert Ray in here; he has an elephantine memory and could detail in fine points the reality of what happens—I have heard him do it once or twice. He has probably given up bothering to come in and actually talk about the reality of what happens. But it just did not happen that way.
It does not matter how often you keep repeating it, it is not true. I have been around in various guises before I came into this chamber back to 1990 and I saw the changes that were made to the committee system in 1994—a number of which have now been reversed with the government taking all of them over again—and this notion that there was a one-week turnaround with a Friday hearing is not the way it worked. The simple fact is that for significant pieces of legislation that do require proper examination and do require community input, we are doing our job. It is not politics; it is not looking for advantage—it is doing our job. We are not looking for where the votes are; we are passing laws that are in place for decades that affect the entire Australian community and the government do not think we should take the time to look at them.
We have this proposal from the ALP that a raft of tax bills be examined for quite a brief inquiry and the government’s response is just: ‘No, not negotiable. We’re not even going to think about it, you just can’t do it.’ Who is the Treasurer to dictate to the Senate and say, ‘You can’t look at these tax bills’? What a disgrace that those are the depths to which we have sunk. The Treasurer can sit in his office over there, dictate to the Senate and say, ‘You’re not allowed to look at these tax bills.’
There are a bunch of five tax bills, and the people who have looked at them say, ‘These need some further examination only for a month or six weeks.’ What is the problem? I bet you anything you like those bills will not be debated here by the time that they would have been reported back on, as is being proposed in this amendment. It is complete contempt and complete arrogance and that is what we have sunk to. Do not let anybody kid you that this is business as usual. This is a serious undermining of the core business of the Senate. It is an absolute travesty and it is the key reason that the role of the Senate and the composition of the Senate after the next election has to be of major focus and major interest to the people of Australia because, if the coalition gets away with this this time around, you ain’t seen nothing yet.

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2007-02-08,"—One of the bills that we are currently debating, relating to the access card, raises issues which have engendered considerable debate within the community. The government has not provided the opportunity for the public to look at the detail of the legislation. The legislation was introduced into the parliament yesterday. The idea of a national ID card, firstly in the form of the Australian Card in the eighties, has been around for a long time, but the public cannot understand the consequences if they do not have the details in front of them. That bill was only introduced into parliament yesterday. Sure, it has been in discussion—it has engendered debate because 80 per cent of the Australian population do not want a national ID card. People need the opportunity to look at the legislation to be able to see whether this so-called access card is, as the Greens and many others have said, actually a de facto national ID card.
There are members of the government’s back bench who have also pointed this out. We need the opportunity to properly look at the legislation provided yesterday so that this issue of public debate can be resolved. While little pieces of information about this access card dribble out, more and more Australians have become concerned about the consequences of setting up a database where everyone’s information is in there and a card which has a biometric photo and a microchip that is going to hold far more information than was ever proposed with the Australia Card. As these details start to come out people have become more and more concerned about the fact that this so-called access card is a national ID card. The minister said yesterday in question time that the concerns people had on these issues were legitimate and that the majority of Australians did not want a national ID card. Come on, Minister, come on, government, give us the opportunity to look properly at the legislation you introduced yesterday so that Australians and parliamentarians in particular can decide for themselves whether what is being proposed by the government is in fact a national ID card that Australians do not want.
We need to have a substantial Senate inquiry. The government said that there would be a public inquiry into this issue yet they released an exposure draft at the end of December just before Christmas, with the January break to follow. That is the opportunity that the government proposed for people to be able to have a public debate about whether we want a national ID card. That is ridiculous. It is a complete failure by the government to be genuine in any way whatsoever about consulting with the public on this issue when they introduce a piece of legislation into the parliament and limit the capacity for the public again to discuss a vitally important issue.
We all know in here how concerned Australians are about the idea of a national ID card. We all know in here how concerned Australians are about privacy and we know the community groups who have been speaking out on this issue and have raised concerns about this issue. That is why we have in this Selection of Bills Committee report massive lists of all the groups who should be invited to appear before the Senate inquiry. You cannot hear their evidence if you limit the opportunities for the Senate inquiry to exist, particularly after the government have said, ‘We’ll have a public inquiry; we’ll allow people to talk about this.’
The minister was in here yesterday in question time saying that people had legitimate concerns and did not want a national ID card. He is right: people do have legitimate concerns and do not want a national ID card. Not just the public but parliamentarians as well need a proper opportunity through an open and public Senate inquiry look into this legislation and determine for themselves if this so-called access card that is being proposed is in fact a national ID card. The Greens believe that the public need to have the opportunity to look at this information to determine for themselves what is being proposed by the government and for parliamentarians in particular to be able to determine how they should vote on this issue.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,2,2
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2007-02-08,"—This is a very important issue today because it is a clear example of how this government intends to abuse its majority in the Senate. This is as clear an example as you will find of the arrogance and contempt with which the government now treats the Senate and the Australian people. This is an absolute abuse of power. The government is using its majority in the Senate to deny Australians the right to understand and debate the introduction of an access card—or national ID card.
This is an issue that is fundamentally important in Australia; it is fundamentally important that Australians have the right to understand and debate the issue. But the government comes in here today having abused the selection of bills process, which is generally operated on the basis of cooperation, and says: ‘No, you can have an inquiry. We can pretend the Senate still works, we will keep up the farce, we will pretend that we respect the institution of the Senate, but we’re going to slip through one of the most contentious bills in the history of the nation by having a quick and dirty inquiry that we will control. In a matter of weeks we will have had the inquiry, we will have had the facade of a democratic process, but the Australian people won’t have seen the bill and they won’t have had a chance to debate the issues. We will have had a couple of days of public hearings, chaired by a government senator with instructions to keep a lid on the proper debate, and then we’ll ram the legislation through the chamber, as has happened with all the previous legislation of significance.’
The government has attempted to put the Senate to sleep by pretending to follow due process and pretending to allow the Senate to continue its function, but, in effect, it has been abusing its majority time and time again. The arrogance of this is breathtaking. The government would have us slip through a process which allows a very cursory examination of a major piece of legislation that no-one has seen yet, that no-one has any understanding of and which the government’s own Liberal backbenchers are deeply concerned about. Their own party room talked about how this was equivalent to giving the Nazis more of an opportunity to exterminate Jews. The Attorney-General himself talked about the dangers of this legislation down the track. This is an issue that is of deep concern to a whole range of people in our community, but the government is saying to us: ‘We’ve got the numbers; we’re going to roll the legislation through and we’re going to give you this facade of the Senate continuing its function in order to be able to defend ourselves against the accusation of abuse of our majority.’
The reality is that the government will have a quick and dirty inquiry. There will be limited hearings and a limited opportunity to debate the legislation and the government will bring the legislation in and ram it through the Senate very quickly. No major bill in the past was treated like this before the change of power that happened when the government got its majority. It is outrageous. I know it concerns a lot of government senators; it certainly concerns all senators on the non-government side. This is an abuse of the Senate. The government goes too far when it prevents senators from doing the job we were elected to do. That government has to be held up to examination for its abuse of the Senate. This proves to people why the government should never have been allowed a majority in the Senate. It proves why this is a dangerous thing for democracy.
Yesterday the government denied us the capacity to inquire into the Qantas sale. The Australian people were denied the ability to examine the issues involving the sale of Qantas, the future of the national icon airline and the future of jobs in the airline industry in Australia because the government did not want the debate. Now they are saying to us that we have no right to have a proper debate about the introduction of an access card. It is a disgrace—

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2007-02-08,"—I seek leave to make a short statement in this debate. I do not believe there are any other speakers left.
Leave granted.
—I rise to talk not about the specifics of the bill but about the process, to support the comments of non-government colleagues and also to offer a compromise in this debate. Honourable senators would be aware of the Selection of Bills Committee proposals that were volunteered by the Australian Democrats and I understand that, as of today, the Labor Party has put forward a reference proposal for selection of bills and has now foreshadowed that with a change to a 12 June reporting date. I think that is preferable for all of us on the non-government side. But, having said that, given how desperate we on this side of the chamber are to debate in some detail these complex technical, technological, political and legal bills—65 pages on the access card were tabled yesterday—would the government even consider the dates that were put forward by the Australian Democrats in the selection of bills process? That proposal was for hearings to begin in the weeks beginning 5 March or 12 March, with a reporting date of 26 March or indeed 20 March, which was the date we were prepared to put forward directly to the minister and today in the chamber.
I am aware that these access card bills, in the form of an exploratory draft, have been around for some time. I do not know about you, but I cuddled up with mine over the summer holidays and read it, along with Andrew McGahan’s Underground and Anna Funder’s Stasiland just to get me in the mood. I think that there is a strong argument for an inquiry into these bills, even given that there has been an exposure draft, and especially given that there is a changed piece of legislation, which was tabled in the House of Reps—not the Senate; the House of Reps—yesterday. So will the government even consider a compromise, given the desperation on the non-government side about not just the complex nature of this legislation but the fact that it is a large volume of legislation which in the case of the access card potentially represents the greatest single privacy intrusion into the lives of the Australian people ever?

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-02-08,"—I move:

That:

the Senate notes the likely impacts on agriculture, the community and the environment of the proposed dam on the Mary River at Traveston Crossing in Queensland; and
the following matters be referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee for inquiry and report by 27 March 2007:
the impact on the Mary River, its dependent species and environs of the proposed dam,
the implications for communities living along the Mary River of the proposed dam to their livelihood and lifestyle, and
the balance of other options available to meet the regions water resource needs.
I think the issue of the proposed dam on the Mary River is of national importance and relates very intimately to the water debate that is currently going on around Australia. I am deeply concerned about the impacts this dam is going to have on the environment and on the people of Queensland and I do not believe that it is the best option for the water future for the south-east region of Queensland. It is 20th-century thinking in the 21st century. It will displace people and destroy ecosystems.
The Mary River is the home of the endemic Murray River cod, which I think most people know is endangered, and the endemic and vulnerable Murray River tortoise. It is also home to several other endangered, threatened and vulnerable species, including the Australian lungfish—which many people often refer to as the ‘missing link’ between humans and fish—the Richmond birdwing butterfly, three species of frogs and the Coxen’s fig parrot, to name but a few.
The dam is designed to create a mega storage to take water from the Mary to the Greater Brisbane and Gold Coast region. A 1994 report by the Department of Primary Industries titled An appraisal study of water supply sources for the Sunshine Coast and Mary River Valley advised that the Traveston dam was unsuitable because of the high capital cost, inundation of prime agricultural land and displacement of rural population. The Noosa Shire Council engineer says that the dam’s capital cost per megalitre is $24,300. I would suggest that is a very expensive option, five times greater than was claimed when the announcement was originally made.
The proposal would see a 600,000 megalitre dam covering 7,600 hectares at Traveston Crossing. In terms of storage capacity, the dam would be, if it ever went ahead, the fifth largest in Queensland and the second largest serving the state’s south-east. The first stage is to be completed at the end of 2011. It would cost up to $1.7 billion and involve the construction of a 180,000-megalitre dam delivering up to 700 megalitres per annum. As you can see, this is a very big project. Then there are the second and third stages. All of these will cost a large amount of money and will have, I believe, an unacceptable impact on the environment and on the community.
Only stage 1 at this stage is proposed for environmental assessment. That is only the first part of the proposal and really you need to be considering the whole proposal as one. The incremental approach to environmental degradation also hides the overall environmental and community impacts of what is a mega proposal. As I said, it is 20th-century thinking in the 21st century. Rarely mentioned, the proposed water grid has enormous energy costs as well in moving water around the state, and it is all powered at this stage by solar fuel.
The dam is proposed to displace 900 landowners, inundating prime agricultural land, flooding the Bruce Highway and forcing the proposed upgrade to go through. This will displace other residents and, of course, impact on other prime agricultural land. Negative environmental and economic impacts on the Mary River catchment and downstream receiving waters include those impacts on the Great Sandy World Heritage area.
Permanent reduction in fisheries production, I believe, will result from this as well and will have serious implications for the fishing industry and on the tourism industry in the Great Sandy region, which as I think everybody in Australia knows is a large tourism area. Tourism related industries are a very important part of the regional economy there, with over 200,000 visitors to Fraser Island, and a vast amount of money is also pumped into the local economy by those tourists.
As you can see, this proposal will have unacceptable environmental, community and economic impacts. There has not been, I believe, an open and thorough analysis of the water in that region. We have not been able to analyse Queensland’s water figures to see just what alternatives there are. There are alternatives, we believe, that are much more appropriate, such as recycling. Water efficiency and conservation are also issues that should be fully considered. This is a stop-gap mega-engineering approach to the water crisis. I was hoping that we had got over this approach, but obviously we have not in this country yet. We need to look at a much more sustainable water future because this proposal is in no way sustainable, given its unacceptable environmental, community, economic and social impacts.
We believe this proposal needs to be referred immediately to the committee to look at because there will be decisions to be made in the very near future. If we are truly committed to a sustainable water future we should be looking at alternatives. The Queensland government is obviously trying to rush this decision through without adequate consideration of the social, environmental and economic impacts. Just by limiting the environmental assessment process to stage 1, the full extent of this proposal will never be considered, and that is of course a flawed environmental process.
This issue is pressing. It is very clear that there is strong community opposition to this proposal. The local community certainly do not support it, judging by the number of emails, phone calls and letters I have received on this issue. I am sure every other senator in this place has also received letters and knows those issues of concern.
I presented the notice of motion yesterday with the aim of bringing the matter on today and sending it off to a committee immediately because, as I said, we think this is urgent. I know that there are meetings coming up that will be discussing the future of this dam. We tried to keep this reference very simple, clear and focused on the impacts on the environment and the community and to ensure it looked at alternatives with the full knowledge of the water estimates for that region. I believe that they need thorough investigation. This is a very important issue. Given the focus of the whole country at the moment on the water crisis, those estimates go to the very heart of that issue and what we in this country believe is sustainable water management and its impacts on the community. We can no longer make decisions on water that have unacceptable impacts on the community, the economy and, very importantly, the environment. This will lead to the loss of a number of endemic and endangered species and in the 21st century we should no longer be making those sorts of decisions.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2007-02-08,"—I happen to agree with much of what Senator Siewert says but we will not be supporting her motion because yesterday Senators Trood, Joyce and I gave notice of a motion to refer the issue of the south-east Queensland water supply, including the Traveston Crossing dam, to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee. We gave notice yesterday of our intention to move that motion on the next day of sitting when we came back. What we have done, Senator Siewert, is give notice of a motion that your leader, Senator Brown, in a press release yesterday said that he agreed with and supported. You came in here yesterday and after we had given notice of a motion you gave notice of one. The notice of motion that we made had been through our party room and had the support of the coalition. So, one would think, the motion will get up on the 26th.
That notice of motion was welcomed by everyone in the Mary Valley—from the locals to the Greens. People have rung me and faxed me and said they are very pleased that that motion will be coming up. Today we see the Greens coming in and bringing on a debate to change the terms of reference. I deliberately made the terms of reference so wide that any of those issues that you have brought up can be covered by the terms of reference that the National and Liberal parties have put down. I have looked at the matters that they wish to refer under their notice of motion and there is nothing in them that is not already covered by the terms of reference in the motion of coalition Senators Joyce and Trood and me.
I reiterate the original proposed terms of reference:
The examination of all reasonable options, including increased dam capacity, for additional water supplies for South East Queensland, including:
the merits of all options, including the Queensland Government’s proposed Traveston Crossing Dam as well as raising the Borumba Dam; and
the social, environmental, economic and engineering impacts of the various proposals.
These are very broad terms of reference that certainly encompass the matters that the Greens are concerned about. The Greens point (i) is basically about the environmental impact, and that is covered in my referral at point (b). The Greens point (ii) about the implications for communities is also covered in my notice of motion at (b). The Greens point (iii) concerning other options for water supply is ably covered in the very first words of my proposed motion, the ‘examination of all ... options’. The Greens are trying to get in on something that has already been proposed we investigate under a committee.
Senator Brown supported my notice of motion yesterday, and I do not believe there is any need to change any terms that are in our notice of motion. We have made it so deliberately wide that the people of the Mary Valley and adjoining shires will be able to get their day in court, will be able to put their arguments forward and will be able to request information that they have never been able to obtain.
I see that the Deputy Premier in Queensland has said that she has nothing to fear from this inquiry. If she has nothing to fear from the inquiry then I suspect the Greens and the Democrats will be on board and I presume the Labor Party will support this inquiry. She has put an overrider on it: she hopes the commencement of the dam operation will not be held up. I would think that this inquiry would be well and truly over before any start on the dam.
I say to the Greens: come on board with us, the Democrats and the Liberals and Nationals. You do not have to change any terms of reference because our terms of reference are a catch-all, or at least as much of a catch-all as we can make them. Let us go unanimously with one notice of motion, one resolution, and get behind it. I cannot speak on behalf of Senator Ian Campbell, but no doubt he will say that the government will not be supporting the Greens resolution because we have one of our own over here that has the support of the coalition.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-02-08,"—The Democrats, as people here would know, and I in particular as a Queensland senator, have been calling for a long time for a full public inquiry into the environmental impacts of the Traveston dam and I will also mention later on the Wyaralong dam. As Senator Ian Campbell, who is in the chamber, would know from his previous incarnation as Minister for the Environment and Heritage, we pushed quite hard and tabled many petitions in this place, containing thousands of names of people wanting a full public inquiry under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. That did not happen, but I do not want to revisit that debate at the moment.
There is a bilateral agreement with the Queensland government. The position of the federal government is that the Queensland government has to conduct the assessment. I note that Deputy Premier Anna Bligh, probably at a time when she was Acting Premier, said the federal government could have done that if they wanted to and chose not to. I suspect that is just all part of the argy-bargy you get along the way. It does not really matter. The decision has been made. There is an environmental impact assessment conducted under the Queensland government’s control. As I am sure Senator Campbell would point out if he stood up to speak, the federal environment minister under the EPBC Act has the ability to require more information to be provided if he or she—he at the moment, obviously—is not satisfied with the adequacy of the assessment that has been done.
That process is underway and it is very important but it still does not enable adequate public examination of all the issues surrounding the dam. Indeed, the EPBC Act, strong as it is, only gives the federal minister the power to examine issues relating to matters of national environmental significance, particularly threatened species in the case of the Traveston dam. World heritage values, wetlands and, I think, migratory birds have all been triggered. But those are the only things you cannot look at. Of course, as Queenslanders would know, there is an enormous amount of concern about some of the yield figures being put forward by the state government and the economics of the whole issue.
The social impact is horrendous. Occasionally I feel guilty about emphasising the environmental impact, the only area where the federal government has direct control, because it sounds like I am ignoring the social impact. I certainly do not aim to do that because the social impact is horrendous. It really should be emphasised now whilst we are having this debate and considering the inquiry that the community in and around Traveston Crossing and all of the towns around there—Kandanga, Federal and the towns surrounding Gympie—are suffering enormously. The trauma is enormous. Communities are being divided; people are being traumatised and the damage has already been done.
Deputy Premier Anna Bligh has said she does not mind a Senate inquiry as long as it does not delay the project. It is a simple fact, it is on the record in this chamber, that the assessment process and the final decision by the federal environment minister as to whether or not the dam could go ahead will not occur until next year. So any suggestion that a Senate inquiry, whenever its reporting date—March, June or August—is going to delay the dam is simply a furphy. The Deputy Premier should be called on that whenever she says it. There is no way that this could delay the dam a day.
What we should be delaying is the continuing pressure from the state government on people locally to allow their land to be resumed. If people want to sell up and get out, that is fine. I understand that is an individual decision for them to make, but this continual pressure on them to get out and for the government to buy the land up is causing immense stress. It is going to mean that if the dam is stopped—I would argue that there are compelling environmental grounds for the dam to be stopped under the federal EPBC Act—then the community will have already suffered enormous, irreparable damage. The state government will own huge swags of land through the area whilst not being able to go ahead with the dam. It is no secret that I hope the dam does not go ahead. Before it is even clear whether the dam will be allowed there is social damage already being done and some of it is irreversible.
I would repeat my call now for the state government to halt their continuing pressure on people potentially affected by this to have their land resumed now. There will be plenty of time afterwards—if whoever the federal environment minister will be gives it the go-ahead—for land to be resumed. From the day the first sod is turned, or whatever it is that you do when you start making a dam, to when it is actually built will be a very long time. There will be plenty of time to resume people’s land after the dam is finally approved if that is what happens. They do not need to cause that social destruction now.
To turn specifically to the reference here, what we have heard from Senator Boswell is basically that the government members have decided they want an inquiry. They want to move it in the next sitting week in three weeks time. They are saying that everything in the motion that Senator Stewart has put forward is covered in the government members’ motion, so we do not need this one. In that case why not just vote on this today? It is all clear, it is all votable, so why not bring forward the coalition members’ referral today and get on with it? The concern is there; I see no reason to delay it. I do not really mind. I have to say I prefer the terms of reference put forward by Senator Boswell and his Queensland colleagues.
I cannot help but note that it is a bit rich for the coalition members to all decide amongst themselves in their party room that they want an inquiry into something where there is obviously a political opportunity for them to beat up on the Queensland Labor government. You have been busily knocking off every proposal we have put on this side of chamber on a whole range of different issues, many of which do not have that partisan political focus. I think it is a bit rich to say, ‘We’ve all decided amongst ourselves, we’ve come up with the terms of reference,’ which you did not consult us about. Even though I have made it clear that I am supportive of the general intent, we had no consultation about the details of what is in them.
I personally believe the terms of reference should specifically mention the Wyaralong dam. I will move an amendment to the terms of reference when that comes up. I think Wyaralong is covered in your terms of reference but I think it is appropriate to specifically name it alongside Traveston so that it does not get forgotten. There is no doubt Wyaralong is less destructive environmentally and socially but it certainly still has some environmental and social impact.
On top of that, let us not forget that we are talking about water policy, as the terms of reference of the coalition senators indicate. To me, even with the social and environmental damage, if it stacked up as a genuinely clever, necessary piece of infrastructure on water policy grounds and on economic grounds then at least there would some competing principles to wrestle over. But from everything I have seen—and this is why I think a Senate inquiry is important, because an environmental impact assessment does not look at these things—the economic case is ludicrous. In the case of the Traveston dam, it will cost $2 billion to build something where the water yield figures continually change, for starters. It will not only cost $2 billion to build it and for all the resumptions and the rebuilding of roads and powerlines, but added to that is the economic cost of taking out a lot of valuable agricultural land in that region. That land is also a key part of the character of that region, which is important if you want balance in a region so that it is not all just urban development and sprawl continuing to spread out from the development on the Sunshine Coast and the Gympie and Caloola areas. To take out that big part of the economy of the region and the very high-quality agricultural land also has a very significant economic cost that is not factored into that $2 billion either.
To produce a water storage piece of infrastructure that is not even guaranteed to fill is certainly a significant risk that relies on it raining sufficiently in the right area. Let us face it, south-east Queensland is full of dams, unfortunately the dams are not full. There are plenty of dams all around the place, it is just that a lot of them are not terribly full. The Wyaralong dam, which, as I said, comes under the terms of reference, should be emphasised because it is also being assessed under the EPBC Act. I have spoken in this chamber before about a very detailed analysis that has been done by a very qualified person in Dr Brad Witt from the University of Queensland that draws serious doubts over the water yield figures put forward by the Queensland government and points out that there is a dam basically just over the hill in the adjoining catchment that has been empty for years. Somehow if you build this other dam in the adjoining catchment it is supposed to fill up. The waste of money purely on the basis of trying to look like we are doing something—which is where this all generated from in the Queensland context—is a serious issue. Unfortunately, it is not being examined anywhere else.
I think a Senate committee is not absolutely ideal and I wish there were other processes that allowed these things to be examined in an open way. Obviously there are politics involved in a Senate committee and partisan motives which are going to colour the debate, and that is not ideal, but the fact is that there are no other mechanisms by which these issues can be examined. Without those mechanisms, the Senate committee plays a valuable role in allowing these issues into the public arena for the public to have a say, for the evidence to be tested and for much more openness and scrutiny. I am pleased that in doing so the committee would be required to look at the wider issues and alternatives. It would not just say, ‘We don’t like this dam, so there,’ but would be forced to accept that there is a need to ensure there is an adequate water supply for the region and to consider alternatives and weigh them up against those that are being put forward.
I also want to emphasise that the one aspect of a Senate committee—whether via the motion put forward by Senator Siewert’s or by Senator Boswell’s colleagues—that does concern me is the potential for it to raise false hope. I want to emphasise this for all sides but particularly for coalition senators. It is one thing to give people a Senate committee inquiry, and that is important, but that process should not give them a sense that the Senate committee has the power the stop the dam, as it obviously does not. I also remind coalition senators that if they win the next election it will be a coalition minister who will have the power to stop this dam through the EPBC Act. If you go on and on about how bad it is—as you should, because it is bad—and then are in a position to stop it and do not deliver, that will be raising a lot of hopes and then dashing them. I really warn against doing that.
I think the evidence with regard to the lungfish in particular as a threatened species is compelling. Any endangered species is a concern but the lungfish is an incredibly significant species. It has been suggested to me by lungfish experts that it is unfortunate that we discovered the lungfish ages ago and it has always been around. If we had just discovered it now it would be seen as a greater scientific miracle than when the Wollemi pine was discovered because it is such a significant species in its place in the evolutionary chain. To use a fish example, the coelacanth, the fish that was long believed to be extinct that was discovered in what then qualified as deep-sea fishing in the 1920s, is still known today because of the amazement at its ancient make-up and its place in the evolutionary chain. The lungfish is more significant than that fish. The Traveston dam will potentially—which is the key thing the investigation will need to determine—lead to the extinction in the wild of an incredibly significant species. That, to me, is more than sufficient reason to stop the dam. That power will be in the hands of the environment minister, whether it is Mr Turnbull, Mr Garrett from the Labor Party or someone else the Prime Minister after the election decides to appoint. That decision will sit in their lap.
We need to make sure that people’s hopes are not unduly raised, but we also need to make very clear that the power is there. It can be done and, in my view, it should be done. It should be stopped if the evidence stacks up. I am always open to being convinced to change my view if I am given more evidence that suggests that I am mistaken, but everything I have seen to date suggests that the impact on a range of threatened species, including the lungfish, will be absolutely critical and, in some cases, terminal. That is why we need to not forget that the power resides with the federal environment minister.
I will take the opportunity of emphasising to this chamber that the only reason the federal environment minister has that power is the actions of me and the Democrats back in 1999, passing the EPBC Act in the face of quite strident opposition—one of those ironies in life, I suppose. But we are dealing with the here and now, and the here and now is a proposal for a Senate committee inquiry. I think it is very valuable. Starting it off by having a spat about whose terms of reference to adopt is probably not terribly good.
I will finish by emphasising again that I am pleased that coalition senators are putting forward terms of reference. I am broadly happy with their terms of reference, apart from the comment I have already made. I do think that that needs to be contrasted with the attitude of government senators towards any number of Senate committee inquiries—I would say it is well into the twenties now—that have been blocked by the government. Just yesterday we voted on whether there should be an inquiry into the Qantas sale, obviously an issue of public significance and importance that would not otherwise be given public attention. That will now be dealt with in secret.
Contrast what is happening here, where coalition senators have basically decided amongst themselves that we are going to have a Senate inquiry, with their continual blocking of every other proposal for Senate inquiries into wide-ranging policy issues. We have had inquiries into the progress of mental health, which is clearly a cross-party issue of concern, blocked. The contrast is very stark. So whilst I am happy to support an inquiry it does frustrate me that it has only come about because of the political opportunity that has presented itself here. I do not think that is the best reason to be using for a Senate inquiry, but in the absence of alternatives I think it will be a valuable one. Frankly, I cannot see why we cannot get it started today, but it does not seem like we will be. We will get it started when we come back in late February.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2007-02-08,"—I think we are all in screaming agreement that the proposed Traveston dam is the wrong dam for a whole range of reasons. From our side, that is not a statement that we are against dams; it is a statement that if you are going to build a dam you are best to build one in the right area. I will give you a couple of examples. This dam would cost about $1.7 billion of the Australian taxpayers’ money for about 150,000 megalitres of water. Its average depth would be about five metres, just the right depth for Cabomba weed to infest it. It is in a siltation area and it will be a siltation trap. There is about 90 feet of silt where they are building it at the moment, so it is a predominant alluvial floodplain.
It is not the case that these people are just saying, ‘We don’t want this dam.’ They have even suggested an alternative dam in their backyard, an alternative dam that is proximate to where the state government is talking about putting it, and that is Borumba. Let us look at the difference. For Borumba you have a 200-metre wall. You will get one million megalitres of water stored. And this is in the same area, with the same people. It would have an average depth of 90 metres, and the land is already owned by the state government. It seems so obvious. People say, ‘It would never fill.’ That is not correct. In fact, the last time it would have filled would have been in the 1990s. It would have been 90 per cent full. There are times on the Borumba Dam at the moment where three Sydney harbours spill over it in a day. That would suggest that there is potential for an increased capacity.
It is also believed that the costing of this dam could spill out to around $3 billion for construction and $1 billion for reticulation and piping: a $4 billion investment. That is why we have to start asking questions, because, ultimately, it is the taxpayers’ money that is doing it—especially when you could build a desalination plant for about $450 million to $500 million which would provide the same amount of water as Traveston dam, and you could then put the change into the Ipswich Motorway, hospitals or other water projects. These are the questions that have to be asked.
There are two major issues pushing this project: one is the ego of Mr Beattie and the other is the ego of Ms Bligh. That is what is driving this. If there is a political opportunity there, there is the political opportunity there, but that is not the reason this inquiry is going forward. The reason is that the people of the Sunshine Coast want it. The people of the Sunshine Coast have been amassing in groups. The last time there were about 500 or 600 people at a meeting on a Sunday afternoon to say: ‘We want our day in court. We want someone to hear us. We want someone to listen to us.’ Anytime there is a meeting, they turn up. These people want to be heard. The primary driver of any political issue should be that you listen to the people. When they start amassing at meeting after meeting, asking for someone to hear the truth, for someone to hear the other side of the argument, then we have to try as best we can to give them that opportunity.
I agree entirely with Senator Bartlett: no-one has said that this Senate inquiry will stop the dam. No-one has suggested that. And the people understand that completely. We have said that to them over and again. We said it to them on the radio this morning. It is not about that; it is about getting the truth on the table and raising the political pressure on Mr Beattie and Ms Bligh to do the decent thing, the logical thing, to find a better expenditure of the taxpayers’ money at an alternative site. And some of those that have been suggested are in the backyard of where the current dam is, so it is not just parochialism.
I welcome what Ms Bligh said. She said she has nothing to fear. A person who has nothing to fear should have no worries about turning up to the Senate inquiry. The only reason you would not turn up to the Senate inquiry is that you have something to fear or something to hide—some reason why you do not want to tell the truth, under oath, on the public record. That is why you would not turn up. It is going to be interesting to see whether this person who tells us they have nothing to fear shows us later that they have something very great to fear.
I think the fear would start with the assessment process and why we ended up with the Traveston dam site. Let us methodically go through the list of all the proposed dam sites to determine which would be the best deliverer of water for south-east Queensland. People want to have that debate. We have heard that the fishing industry and the tourism industry will be threatened, but, when this dam goes through, Queensland will fail to be self-sufficient in dairy products. It is a small issue! People in Brisbane like to drink milk. When the dam goes forward, one of the major dairy areas of south-east Queensland will be taken out of production. That issue obviously needs to be discussed further.
There are so many issues that have to see the light of day and be put on the table. The people of the Mary River and the Sunshine Coast are sick and tired of the manipulation and obfuscation—the nefarious imbroglio of Mr Beattie’s and Ms Bligh’s process for assessing this dam—and they want to get to the facts. I take on board what Senator Siewert says, but, with all due respect, there is nothing in her terms of reference that is not already offered and I do not think we should start this process with our own little jousting match about the terms of reference. We have acknowledged everybody. We have not isolated anybody and said that this is just a National Party idea, a Liberal Party idea, a Democrats idea or a Greens idea. We are just saying in this chamber that it is a good idea—and it is a good idea for people to know that they have a chance to have their day in court.
I acknowledge the hard work that Senator Trood has done in this process. There has been a bit of rough and tumble in trying to get this process going. Senator Trood has been a great advocate for the people of the Sunshine Coast and the Mary River. I also acknowledge the work that senators from other parties have done. But let us not cloud or stymie the issue now with an internecine fight over terms of reference. Yes, we have the potential to turn it into a political issue. But that is not just for the sake of politics; it is to get something that is just and right and to have oversight of how our nation’s money is spent. Investment in this ridiculous process will yield nothing more than a stinking swamp—and, very importantly, it will not be completed until 2011.
Ms Bligh argues that we are threatening Queensland’s water supply. Let us get this straight. Even with the most perfect time frame this thing will not be completed until 2011. The fact is that Brisbane will run out of water in the middle of next year. A dam that will only supply water by 2011 and will work only if it fills up with water—I imagine that means rain—is going to be no good for fixing a problem that will arise next year. So let us talk about the solutions for next year and how we go about doing something that will actually deliver water for the people of Brisbane. Good suggestions about desalination have been put on the table. There have been investigations by the local member, Dave Gibson, who has gone over to Western Australia to look at the costings of their desalination plants. Why would there be a wish to focus on that? Because that is all the time we have left if we want to provide water for Brisbane.
Surely, the issue that ought to be on the table is the fact that we have one of the major cities in Western civilisation and it is about to run out of water. Even Constantinople managed to deal with the siege of the Turks for three years without running out of water. But Brisbane is going to run out of water because of the complete and utter lack of planning by, and the complete and utter negligence of, the administration that currently holds the reins of power in Queensland, the Beattie-Bligh Labor government. They are going to run out of water. Ms Bligh has been saying lately, ‘We’ve got a water grid going.’ I read in the paper the other day that—if my recollection is correct—they have laid only about 500 metres of the 200 kilometres of pipeline that have to be put in. That is not a sign of a government that is taking seriously the threat of a major Western city running out of water.
We have to come up with serious solutions. Desalination has to be put on the table because, no matter what people think about it, we do not have the time to consider other alternatives. We have to come up with something that is going to deliver water for the area. We have to look at recycling, for industrial use at least, to try and take the pressure off. Certainly, new dams will have to go in—and I would be the first proponent for relevant dams—but we have to look at the facts. Why would you go for a dam that is five metres deep and on an alluvial swamp? There are even suggestions that it traverses a fault line. It will have huge social and economic impacts on the area—not just the immediate area but the whole of south-east Queensland. It will be a prime site for weed infestation. It will have huge environmental consequences for the Australian lungfish, the Mary River tortoise, the Mary River turtle, the Ramsar wetland and the Great Sandy Straits. Why would you do that when there is another site, proximate to the area, where the infrastructure is already in place and you can store seven or eight times the amount of water at far less cost? It is an argument of logic.
As Mr Beattie and Ms Bligh dig their heels in more and more, the biggest threat facing the people of the Sunshine Coast and the Mary River valley is the egos of those two individuals, who, in a dictatorial manner like a Caesar or a benevolent dictator—they have half of it right—have decided they can go into an area and inflict their wishes, illogical as they might be, on the people to prove a point. They are trying to prove the point that they are strong. This Senate inquiry will prove that they are not, that they are foolish, that they are unfair, that they are unjust, that they are wasteful and that they are completely negligent about looking for a real solution right now that is proximate to Brisbane.
Why hold an inquiry? People are going to say: ‘This is overstepping the mark. You’re infringing on that state’s rights.’ The one thing that Queensland is missing is an upper house. Queensland does not have a bicameral system. It only has a lower house and that is why there are times when this chamber must step in to give some other, greater review of the aspects of law to the unicameral system in Queensland. When it is the suggestion of the people of Queensland that there must be a review, when there are not just one or two but a whole raft of opinions—there is an overwhelming sentiment—that there has to be a review of a decision made by the single house in Queensland, then I think we have the moral premise to go in and have an inquiry.
I look forward to this inquiry taking place. I hope that it has a hearing in the Mary River area. I hope we can give the people of that area the time for their day in court without undue cost to their wallets—and gosh knows that they have had to fork out enough so far. I acknowledge that Ms Bligh has said she has nothing to fear and I look forward hopefully to her appearing at the inquiry. If she has nothing to fear and nothing to hide, it stands to reason that she should be willing to turn up. I acknowledge that the people of the Mary River and the Sunshine Coast know, and everybody in this chamber knows, that the Senate inquiry itself cannot stop the dam, but it certainly can raise the political temperature on it, and so it should. It will be a just outcome and that is what this chamber should be espousing: a just and fair outcome for those people who have not been heard.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1
"Trood, Sen Russell",LP,2007-02-08,"—I want to take the opportunity to make a few remarks on this particular issue because it is one of great interest to my constituents. It is a matter about which I have addressed the Senate at some length in the past. It is a matter which is very close to my heart, as it is of course, more so, to the people of the Mary River valley. I will not canvass in full detail the shortcomings of this particular proposal with regard to the Traveston Crossing dam; Senator Joyce and Senator Bartlett have rightly articulated those with some force. This is a fundamentally ill-conceived proposal. It is bad on environmental grounds most particularly. It is bad economically. It is bad socially for the region. In fact, what is mystifying about it is that there seems to be almost nothing that can be said in support of this proposal.
I am not one of those people who think we should not be building dams. Indeed, I think there is a place for dams in the context of addressing the wide range of issues which confront the Australian community right across the country in relation to the provision of water. Desalination, dams, recycling, conservation and other methods should all be considered. I am certainly of the view that dams ought to be part of that mix in trying to address this very serious problem.
What is surprising is that this particular proposal has only one proponent. There is only one advocate for this proposal—that is, the Queensland government. It strikes me as peculiar in the context of infrastructure developments around the country, where often there is a need for a community or an individual to yield to wider community and public interest. There are those who recognise that their own particular interests might be affected and those in a community who are prepared to say, ‘I know you’re going to be affected, I know your particular concerns are at risk, but there is a wider community interest.’
What is interesting about this proposal is that there is only one advocate for it. I have waited, breathlessly almost, to find someone else who would support the proposition of the Beattie government that this dam ought to be built in this particular place, and no-one has come forward. Indeed, all the professional studies that have been prepared by those who are anxious about this proposition make the point that there are better ways to address the needs of south-east Queensland’s water requirements than building this dam.
So it is absolutely mystifying to me that the Beattie government presses this matter with a kind of ideological position when, as Senator Joyce has rightly pointed out, there is an alternative not far away. What is particularly peculiar about this as a matter of public policy is that the Beattie government seems entirely reluctant to consider alternatives, if not determined not to consider alternatives—for example, the Borumba proposal that Senator Joyce has rightly mentioned to the chamber this morning. Why is that? Why is it that there is such an obsession? Frankly, I cannot provide an answer. It is one of the things about this issue that I find most vexing indeed.
This motion seeks to refer the matter to a Senate committee. Standing in my name and in the names of Senators Boswell and Joyce is a proposal that was put on the Notice Paper yesterday in relation to a similar topic. The people of the Mary River need an opportunity to ventilate their concerns. They have largely been shut out of any sensible, rational opportunity to communicate their concerns about this proposal to the Queensland government. They have been frustrated that the process so far has been so fundamentally dishonest—it has so fundamentally misrepresented its intentions to the point where we have yet to find a likely location for the dam wall. I think we are up to proposal 3 or 4 so far. We still do not have a place where this dam wall might be constructed.
This is creating an enormous amount of uncertainty and anxiety in the community. I, like Senator Joyce, have addressed public meetings in the area. It has been in some respects a very traumatic process, with people weeping about the consequences and the way in which this has been handled. This is no way to run a public policy railway. The Beattie government ought to do better. I have made it clear, as Senators Bartlett and Joyce have mentioned, that this inquiry will not take the place of the procedures that have been put in place under the Environmental Protection Act; what it will do is give them an opportunity, which they have hitherto been denied, to put their views and express their opinions to the Senate in relation to this proposal.
I would particularly encourage the Senate to look at the proposal in the notice of motion yesterday as in fact a wider proposal than the one that Senator Siewert moved this morning. Ours seeks to look more generally at the water requirements of south-east Queensland and it seeks to explore why it is that these needs have not been met—why it is that the water needs of south-east Queensland have been so fundamentally mismanaged by the Beattie government.
We ought to in that context pay some attention to the complicity of the new opposition leader of the federal Labor Party, Mr Rudd. As a bureaucrat in the former Goss Labor government in Queensland, it would seem he was directly responsible for ensuring that a particular dam proposal, which might well have addressed some of the water needs of Queensland and might well have provided precisely the kind of infrastructure that was needed and perhaps might not have placed us in this crisis, was terminated. We might find out why it was that he apparently terminated that proposal and did not proceed with it. That is something that ought to be of interest to the committee. Indeed, Mr Rudd needs to explain his party’s view on this particular proposal. I think I am right in saying that he has yet to declare his position on this matter
—He doesn’t know where it is.
—That may be right, Senator Joyce. He is still struggling to identify the possible location of the Traveston Crossing dam. The virtue of the motion we put on the Notice Paper yesterday is that the proposal would look more broadly at the requirements of water in North Queensland and south-east Queensland. It would be to the benefit of Queenslanders more generally, certainly to those who live in the south-east. It would give the people of the Mary River, who have been so disadvantaged by this process and who have been so profoundly affected by the way in which it has been conducted, an opportunity to ventilate and articulate their concerns. We would get some facts about this which have hitherto been precluded from public view.
In closing my remarks, may I acknowledge, as Senator Joyce has generously acknowledged others, his particular contribution to dealing with this matter amongst the community, and indeed Senator Bartlett’s, but also the contributions of my Liberal colleagues in Queensland—Senators Brandis, Mason and Ian Macdonald—who have all been concerned about the direction of this proposal. We all believe it needs close scrutiny. None of us is convinced that it has merit. The Senate inquiry will expose the limitations of this proposal for what it is—basically, a public policy sham and an attempt by the Beattie government to cobble together a solution to a matter prior to an election in relation to which they had given absolutely no policy thought. It was an attempt prior to the last state election in Queensland to put something on the table. It did not receive the detailed assessment and examination that it deserved. We will perhaps be able to provide that in the course of the Senate inquiry.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2007-02-08,"—I rise to briefly outline Labor’s view, but I cannot help but first respond to some of the remarks that have been made by Senators Joyce and Trood. On a light-hearted note I must say that when you come from Perth, Brisbane is an eastern city and not a western city! I struggle with that. But it is heartening to hear of your interest and the interest of your conservative colleagues in the desalination plant that we have operating in Western Australia. You might like to re-educate some of your colleagues in my home state whilst you are visiting there.
It is interesting that people invoke ideas such as these: if the proposal is such a good one then you have nothing to hide; and the degree of concern and anxiety in the community is justification for having an inquiry. I agree with both of those propositions, and they were equally valid when people voted against the proposal to have an inquiry into the sale of Qantas yesterday. There is significant community anxiety about that too, Senator Joyce, but apparently that is not good enough for you in that case. I would have thought that Airline Partners Australia and Qantas should have nothing to hide and therefore should be willing to appear before a Senate inquiry, but you did not seem to deem that as something that should take place.
It is a pity that Senator Trood has left us, because he was talking about the views of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Rudd, about a previous dam proposal in Queensland. He neglected to inform the Senate of the views of the then parliamentary leader of the state Liberal Party, who moved a motion in the state parliament on 3 October 1989 that began:
That this House demands the government not proceed with the construction or planning of the Wolffdene dam in any way.
It is very easy to come in here and say that Mr Rudd may or may not have had some involvement with that dam and to call on him to have a view about this. It is very easy to score cheap, personal, political points about an issue and neglect to talk about your own history. It is not just about Mr Rudd’s role in the Queensland bureaucracy at the time; you might like to start looking at your own first—at that of the then parliamentary leader of the state Liberal Party—before you come in here and start talking about things like that.
Having said that, though, Labor is not opposed to having an inquiry, but we are opposed to this particular motion. We are concerned about the reporting date. We agree that there is a water crisis in south-east Queensland and we do not see that the Senate should in any way choose to interfere with any arrangements that the state government may have in trying to address that crisis. That would be inappropriate for this place and for anyone in this parliament, or anywhere else for that matter.
We do agree with the proposal to have an inquiry; we are just concerned about this particular motion and the short time. Labor are in a position to support the inquiry foreshadowed by Senators Boswell, Joyce and Trood. The water crisis in south-east Queensland is obviously at the point where even those of us who live in Perth realise it exists. Those who live along the Mary River obviously have very good internet access, because they have been in touch with each and every one of us in this chamber to let us know their views.
—Thanks to Telstra and the Australian government networking the nation!
—Unlike regional Western Australia, Senator Abetz, or the black hole that is Greenwood, which is in inner northern suburban Perth, where you cannot get decent internet access. Perhaps if you live in those electorates in Queensland it is a bit easier. Labor will support a Senate inquiry into this issue, but we are not in a position to support this particular motion. A Senate inquiry should not be used in any way to delay the Queensland government’s bid to address the water crisis that is facing those in south-east Queensland, so we will support the foreshadowed motions of Senators Boswell, Joyce and Trood. But they need to think very carefully when they come in here, they need to look at the history and views of their own party, before they talk about what others may or may not have done.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2007-02-08,"—I support this motion only reluctantly; I think the politics of the motion are quite crazy. Why the federal parliament would be embarking upon an inquiry that can only achieve allowing Mr Beattie to escape from his own stupidity is beyond me. This whole issue arises from Mr Beattie’s incompetence and also the incompetence of former Labor governments and their senior adviser, Mr Rudd.
—What about your party’s role?
—I do not know. I would never accept what any Labor person might say when quoting a so-called Hansard—
—It was the 3 October 1989 state Hansard.
—but, even if it is true, you are quoting someone who is no longer in the parliament. I want to talk about people who are currently in this parliament and who aspire to lead this country—people who claim they have the foresight to properly run this country, as our Prime Minister has done now for 10 years and will continue to do for many years. The Prime Minister is a man of vision and foresight; Mr Rudd quite clearly failed that test when he was, in effect, the Queensland government. I am not sure what his official title was, but he was obviously the string puller for Mr Goss and the Queensland government at the time. Mr Rudd has a lot to answer for in relation to the water crisis in south-east Queensland at the present time. The Wolffdene dam, as I recall the issue a long time ago, had all of the land purchased and was ready to go, and the government of the day—never mind what an opposition of about five people said—

Senator Webber interjecting—

 (Senator Lightfoot)—Senator Webber, yelling across the chamber is unruly.
—with a huge majority, was titularly run by Premier Goss but directed by none other than the current Leader of the Opposition and would-be Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd. It was Kevin Rudd who had the influence at the time to look forward to the problems of water in Queensland 10 years hence. Mr Rudd did not have that vision. He succumbed to political pressure at the time. Mr Rudd crumbled with the first iota of pressure. He crumbled like a badly made cake. With no substance at all and with a bit of pressure put on him, he crumbled and pulled the Queensland government out of a proposal which, if it had been built, would have been looking after Queensland at this present time.
What has Mr Beattie done? And Beattie was part of that team at the same time. He has come up with this ridiculous proposal for a dam at Traveston Crossing, and a few other proposals besides that. Unfortunately, I have been at other meetings and have not heard what my colleagues have said, but I feel fairly certain that they have clearly enunciated the stupidity of this dam. Very importantly, not only is it going to affect the lives of many ordinary Australians but it is going to achieve nothing. It is a huge cost; the dam is not big enough; it is not deep enough; and we will lose more water in evaporation than will be usefully applied to south-east Queensland if the dam is ever built. Quite frankly, I do not think that Mr Beattie ever really intended for this to go ahead. He came up to an election a few months ago and had a number of crises to deal with—one of them was the health crisis. I must say, a democracy is a democracy and you accept the result, but I cannot understand my fellow Queenslanders rewarding Mr Beattie’s maladministration of the hospital system by re-electing him by almost the same massive majority he had before. Similarly, I cannot understand how they overlooked this water position.
Mr Beattie, clever though he is—and I like Peter Beattie; I admire him for his political nous and his political foresight; he is a great politician; he is not a great administrator, not a great Premier, but a great politician—needed something to defuse the issue of lack of water in south-east Queensland. So, what did he do? He picked some area where he knew the vote would not worry him, because it is an area where his party would never get much support in any case—
—You’re making it up. Keep rewriting history.
—Senator Macdonald, you should ignore those interjections and direct your comments through the chair.
—I thought it might have been an intelligent interjection, but I was badly mistaken; I should not have bothered to think that. Mr Beattie needed to do something, so he declared this dam in an area where he knows he will not get any votes. He did not really bother to look into it and did not really bother to think what a stupid proposition it was anyhow. I think Mr Beattie will be desperately hoping that something will happen from this inquiry or elsewhere that will allow him off the hook. That is why I have some hesitation and wonder about the wisdom of actually putting this motion before the parliament, but it is here. I will partake in the committee inquiry. I understand it has been referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport, of which I am a participating member, so I will relish the opportunity to learn a bit more about all aspects of it and actually getting some of the facts. I feel fairly confident at this time—
—You’d be well advised if you did that.
—Well advised to what?
—Get the facts.
—I assume from that, Senator Lundy, you are guaranteeing that the Queensland government and all their public servants will come along and give evidence. As I was just about to say, I have not been involved in putting this motion together, but it is a fairly good bet that Mr Beattie will prohibit any of his public servants—any of the people with the real knowledge; any of the people with the facts and information—appearing before this committee. I understand that Senator Lundy is guaranteeing that the Queensland government will instruct their public servants to come along and give evidence. If that is what you are doing, Senator Lundy, thank you very much, because it would be fascinating to get some of the public servants involved. I have spoken to a few of the public servants and they have told me that they have never been involved in a more ridiculous infrastructure program. I asked them, ‘Why don’t you say something about this?’ and they said, ‘In Queensland at the moment, if any public servant even indicates by the blink of an eye that they do not happen to agree with Mr Beattie and his 60-seat majority in Queensland, their futures as public servants are very, very limited.’
—Are you making that up as well?
—Let us see, Senator Lundy.

Senator Lundy interjecting—

—Senator Lundy, you are out of order and you should remain silent.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I must say, I am enjoying Senator Lundy’s interventions because I am getting from her that she has information from the Queensland government that they will make their public servants available to give evidence.
—I didn’t say anything of the sort. You’re verballing me and you’re making it up.
—Are you saying that they will give evidence?
—Senator Macdonald, I am sure that if you ignored Senator Lundy she would eventually remain quiet, which would be the great wish of this chamber.
—I do not particularly want her to remain quiet, because her interventions are showing the shallowness of the Labor Party’s approach to all this. What I do really want to get on the record is that Senator Lundy—a senior frontbench member of the opposition and obviously one who is very closely attuned to the Labor Party organisation and all the apparatchiks in Queensland—is guaranteeing that public servants will be able to give evidence to this inquiry without fear or favour. I look forward to that. I am very doubtful that it will happen. But, Senator Lundy, please prove me wrong and make sure that any public servant who is called or who has a contribution to make is able to give evidence to this Senate inquiry. If that happens, Senator Lundy, I will publicly apologise to you and Mr Beattie, but my suspicion is that they will not be allowed to come along.
—You’re just lying. You’re standing there and lying.
—Senator Macdonald, do not be enticed by Senator Lundy to respond.

Senator Lundy interjecting—

—Senator Lundy, you are out of order!
—Heaven forbid! We have a prospective Prime Minister who could not even look after the water crisis in Queensland 10 years ago and we have prospective frontbench people here with that sort of immature and childish approach to their duties.
—What? Calling you a liar?
—She keeps calling me a liar and hoping someone will take the point of order. I ask no-one to take the point of order. I would like it on the record to show what immature people we are dealing with when we deal with this so-called alternative government. You have an alternative government led by a person who had absolutely no vision for—
—That’s another lie.
—Senator Lundy! You know the rules of this place very well; you have been here long enough. You should not use that term to any senator here, and I ask you to stand and withdraw it.
—I withdraw.
—You have a prospective alternative Prime Minister to this country with a frontbench of the calibre you have just seen demonstrated in the last couple of minutes. This prospective leader did not have the vision 10 years ago to understand the crisis Queensland would be in at this time. As the man who pulled the strings of the Queensland government back in those days, he had no vision whatsoever, no understanding of the future and no understanding of the huge infrastructure gaps.
Consider the amount of money that the Queensland government rakes in from the Commonwealth’s GST—a GST, I might say, that was opposed by the Labor Party; but, talk to any of their premiers now and see how they embrace the GST in all of its glory. People still do not quite understand that every single cent of the GST collected in Australia goes to the state governments, all of which at the moment are, regrettably, managed—or mismanaged—by the Labor Party.
I have to say my home state of Queensland has done better out of the GST than most other states, at least in the initial period. Queensland should be rolling in money—sufficient money to look after the health system that is grinding to a halt. It should have sufficient money to set up the infrastructure that is needed to assist what is Australia’s fastest-growing region. The south-east corner of Queensland is growing faster than any other region of Australia. People—and I can understand why this happens—leave Victoria and New South Wales in droves and come to the good state. Mr Beattie is getting all the additional revenue from conveyance duty and all of the GST money, and I think it has all been spent on spin doctors for Mr Beattie and his team.
Certainly, I do not think this proposal for the Traveston dam is serious. I am a bit disappointed that we are going to take the pressure off Mr Beattie by allowing this inquiry to go ahead, but the decision has been made. I will certainly be involved in the inquiry and will try to get these public servants that Senator Lundy appears to have guaranteed will appear—
—I never said anything of the sort.
—You are not guaranteeing they will appear? Will they appear?
—It has nothing to do with me.
—Oh, it has nothing to do with you!
—Senator Macdonald, you should address your comments through the chair and disregard those unruly interjections by Senator Lundy.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Now I understand Senator Lundy is saying that she is not guaranteeing the public servants will appear. I go back to my original proposition: I hope they do, I would be very surprised if they do and, if they do, I will publicly apologise to both Mr Beattie and Senator Lundy.
As I was saying before I was interrupted again by Senator Lundy, it is an inquiry that I will participate in. If we can get the public servants and get them to have the courage to put the facts of the matter before the Australian people, I think that would be very useful. I think most Queenslanders who have followed the issue, particularly those in the Traveston dam area who are involved, know the facts of this matter at the moment. They do not need a public inquiry to know what a ridiculous proposition this is—a proposition that will impact seriously on people’s lives and futures. It is the sort of decision that a Labor government takes without any regard for the rights, wellbeing and lifestyle of the people involved. With those reservations, I support the motion.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-02-08,"—So everybody agrees that there should be an inquiry into this proposal but they do not want to support this committee reference. That is fascinating. I would have thought that if people were really keen to get this inquiry underway they would want to see it done straightaway and would in fact be prepared to look at these terms of reference and maybe negotiate over them.
To set the record straight, I submitted my motion to the table office yesterday prior to notices of motion being given here. So, in fact, I was not trying to gazump Senator Boswell; I did not know he was moving a similar motion. As I said, I had already submitted my motion before presentation of notices yesterday. After I found out that Senator Boswell had presented his notice of motion yesterday, I tried to see if we could come up with a compromise where everybody’s needs were met.
If you look at the proposal that Senators Boswell, Joyce and Trood have submitted, you find for a start there is no date for when the committee should report. So we could have an ongoing inquiry just taking submissions endlessly. Where is the time frame? There is a very strong sense of urgency about the need for this inquiry. Where is their date? It seems to me the terms of reference for this inquiry were cobbled together fairly quickly. There is no date.
I would also like to point out an inherent contradiction in Senator Boswell’s terms of reference. His motion proposes to refer the matter to the committee for inquiry and report after ‘examination of all reasonable options’. Our very argument here is that this is an unreasonable option. The terms of reference say that we should be looking at ‘all reasonable options’ and then go on to look at the merits of all options, including the Traveston Crossing dam. Our very thesis is that this is an unreasonable option. That is why I think our terms of reference are much clearer. Senator Trood probably missed the fact that the terms of reference the Greens are proposing actually do require examination of other options. Our term of reference (iii) is ‘the balance of other options available to meet the region’s water resource needs’, which I think covers the question of other options very clearly.
I do think there are some flaws in the coalition senators’ terms of reference. I do think ours are better: they have a clear date for when the committee should report. They also make sure that we get on with the job right now and we do not waste any time. I am disappointed that the coalition and, for that matter, the Labor Party do not feel that they can support this motion. It was put up so that we can get on with the job of looking at this proposal and looking at alternative needs. I do agree with Senator Ian Macdonald that it is letting the Queensland government off the hook, but I think there is no alternative process for the community—the Queensland community in particular, of course—to actually get access to information and to be able to have their say. So, while I think that Senator Ian Macdonald does have a very significant point there, I do not think that that can take away from the need for the Senate to actually hold this inquiry, to at least have one method of shining some light on this proposal. As I said, I am disappointed that the committee of which I am deputy chair cannot get on with this job right now so we can start calling for public submissions and start getting access to this data. I am disappointed that we are going to have to wait weeks more before we can get on with this job. I put the motion to the Senate that the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee gets on with this inquiry and has an inquiry into the Traveston dam and the alternative options for water supply for south-east Queensland.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Siewert’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-02-08,"—I move:

That:

the Senate notes the likely impacts on agriculture, the community and the environment of the proposed dam on the Mary River at Traveston Crossing in Queensland; and
the following matters be referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee for inquiry and report by 27 March 2007:
the impact on the Mary River, its dependent species and environs of the proposed dam,
the implications for communities living along the Mary River of the proposed dam to their livelihood and lifestyle, and
the balance of other options available to meet the regions water resource needs.
I think the issue of the proposed dam on the Mary River is of national importance and relates very intimately to the water debate that is currently going on around Australia. I am deeply concerned about the impacts this dam is going to have on the environment and on the people of Queensland and I do not believe that it is the best option for the water future for the south-east region of Queensland. It is 20th-century thinking in the 21st century. It will displace people and destroy ecosystems.
The Mary River is the home of the endemic Murray River cod, which I think most people know is endangered, and the endemic and vulnerable Murray River tortoise. It is also home to several other endangered, threatened and vulnerable species, including the Australian lungfish—which many people often refer to as the ‘missing link’ between humans and fish—the Richmond birdwing butterfly, three species of frogs and the Coxen’s fig parrot, to name but a few.
The dam is designed to create a mega storage to take water from the Mary to the Greater Brisbane and Gold Coast region. A 1994 report by the Department of Primary Industries titled An appraisal study of water supply sources for the Sunshine Coast and Mary River Valley advised that the Traveston dam was unsuitable because of the high capital cost, inundation of prime agricultural land and displacement of rural population. The Noosa Shire Council engineer says that the dam’s capital cost per megalitre is $24,300. I would suggest that is a very expensive option, five times greater than was claimed when the announcement was originally made.
The proposal would see a 600,000 megalitre dam covering 7,600 hectares at Traveston Crossing. In terms of storage capacity, the dam would be, if it ever went ahead, the fifth largest in Queensland and the second largest serving the state’s south-east. The first stage is to be completed at the end of 2011. It would cost up to $1.7 billion and involve the construction of a 180,000-megalitre dam delivering up to 700 megalitres per annum. As you can see, this is a very big project. Then there are the second and third stages. All of these will cost a large amount of money and will have, I believe, an unacceptable impact on the environment and on the community.
Only stage 1 at this stage is proposed for environmental assessment. That is only the first part of the proposal and really you need to be considering the whole proposal as one. The incremental approach to environmental degradation also hides the overall environmental and community impacts of what is a mega proposal. As I said, it is 20th-century thinking in the 21st century. Rarely mentioned, the proposed water grid has enormous energy costs as well in moving water around the state, and it is all powered at this stage by solar fuel.
The dam is proposed to displace 900 landowners, inundating prime agricultural land, flooding the Bruce Highway and forcing the proposed upgrade to go through. This will displace other residents and, of course, impact on other prime agricultural land. Negative environmental and economic impacts on the Mary River catchment and downstream receiving waters include those impacts on the Great Sandy World Heritage area.
Permanent reduction in fisheries production, I believe, will result from this as well and will have serious implications for the fishing industry and on the tourism industry in the Great Sandy region, which as I think everybody in Australia knows is a large tourism area. Tourism related industries are a very important part of the regional economy there, with over 200,000 visitors to Fraser Island, and a vast amount of money is also pumped into the local economy by those tourists.
As you can see, this proposal will have unacceptable environmental, community and economic impacts. There has not been, I believe, an open and thorough analysis of the water in that region. We have not been able to analyse Queensland’s water figures to see just what alternatives there are. There are alternatives, we believe, that are much more appropriate, such as recycling. Water efficiency and conservation are also issues that should be fully considered. This is a stop-gap mega-engineering approach to the water crisis. I was hoping that we had got over this approach, but obviously we have not in this country yet. We need to look at a much more sustainable water future because this proposal is in no way sustainable, given its unacceptable environmental, community, economic and social impacts.
We believe this proposal needs to be referred immediately to the committee to look at because there will be decisions to be made in the very near future. If we are truly committed to a sustainable water future we should be looking at alternatives. The Queensland government is obviously trying to rush this decision through without adequate consideration of the social, environmental and economic impacts. Just by limiting the environmental assessment process to stage 1, the full extent of this proposal will never be considered, and that is of course a flawed environmental process.
This issue is pressing. It is very clear that there is strong community opposition to this proposal. The local community certainly do not support it, judging by the number of emails, phone calls and letters I have received on this issue. I am sure every other senator in this place has also received letters and knows those issues of concern.
I presented the notice of motion yesterday with the aim of bringing the matter on today and sending it off to a committee immediately because, as I said, we think this is urgent. I know that there are meetings coming up that will be discussing the future of this dam. We tried to keep this reference very simple, clear and focused on the impacts on the environment and the community and to ensure it looked at alternatives with the full knowledge of the water estimates for that region. I believe that they need thorough investigation. This is a very important issue. Given the focus of the whole country at the moment on the water crisis, those estimates go to the very heart of that issue and what we in this country believe is sustainable water management and its impacts on the community. We can no longer make decisions on water that have unacceptable impacts on the community, the economy and, very importantly, the environment. This will lead to the loss of a number of endemic and endangered species and in the 21st century we should no longer be making those sorts of decisions.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Miscellaneous,23,2
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2007-02-08,"—I happen to agree with much of what Senator Siewert says but we will not be supporting her motion because yesterday Senators Trood, Joyce and I gave notice of a motion to refer the issue of the south-east Queensland water supply, including the Traveston Crossing dam, to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee. We gave notice yesterday of our intention to move that motion on the next day of sitting when we came back. What we have done, Senator Siewert, is give notice of a motion that your leader, Senator Brown, in a press release yesterday said that he agreed with and supported. You came in here yesterday and after we had given notice of a motion you gave notice of one. The notice of motion that we made had been through our party room and had the support of the coalition. So, one would think, the motion will get up on the 26th.
That notice of motion was welcomed by everyone in the Mary Valley—from the locals to the Greens. People have rung me and faxed me and said they are very pleased that that motion will be coming up. Today we see the Greens coming in and bringing on a debate to change the terms of reference. I deliberately made the terms of reference so wide that any of those issues that you have brought up can be covered by the terms of reference that the National and Liberal parties have put down. I have looked at the matters that they wish to refer under their notice of motion and there is nothing in them that is not already covered by the terms of reference in the motion of coalition Senators Joyce and Trood and me.
I reiterate the original proposed terms of reference:
The examination of all reasonable options, including increased dam capacity, for additional water supplies for South East Queensland, including:
the merits of all options, including the Queensland Government’s proposed Traveston Crossing Dam as well as raising the Borumba Dam; and
the social, environmental, economic and engineering impacts of the various proposals.
These are very broad terms of reference that certainly encompass the matters that the Greens are concerned about. The Greens point (i) is basically about the environmental impact, and that is covered in my referral at point (b). The Greens point (ii) about the implications for communities is also covered in my notice of motion at (b). The Greens point (iii) concerning other options for water supply is ably covered in the very first words of my proposed motion, the ‘examination of all ... options’. The Greens are trying to get in on something that has already been proposed we investigate under a committee.
Senator Brown supported my notice of motion yesterday, and I do not believe there is any need to change any terms that are in our notice of motion. We have made it so deliberately wide that the people of the Mary Valley and adjoining shires will be able to get their day in court, will be able to put their arguments forward and will be able to request information that they have never been able to obtain.
I see that the Deputy Premier in Queensland has said that she has nothing to fear from this inquiry. If she has nothing to fear from the inquiry then I suspect the Greens and the Democrats will be on board and I presume the Labor Party will support this inquiry. She has put an overrider on it: she hopes the commencement of the dam operation will not be held up. I would think that this inquiry would be well and truly over before any start on the dam.
I say to the Greens: come on board with us, the Democrats and the Liberals and Nationals. You do not have to change any terms of reference because our terms of reference are a catch-all, or at least as much of a catch-all as we can make them. Let us go unanimously with one notice of motion, one resolution, and get behind it. I cannot speak on behalf of Senator Ian Campbell, but no doubt he will say that the government will not be supporting the Greens resolution because we have one of our own over here that has the support of the coalition.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Miscellaneous,23,2
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-02-08,"—The Democrats, as people here would know, and I in particular as a Queensland senator, have been calling for a long time for a full public inquiry into the environmental impacts of the Traveston dam and I will also mention later on the Wyaralong dam. As Senator Ian Campbell, who is in the chamber, would know from his previous incarnation as Minister for the Environment and Heritage, we pushed quite hard and tabled many petitions in this place, containing thousands of names of people wanting a full public inquiry under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. That did not happen, but I do not want to revisit that debate at the moment.
There is a bilateral agreement with the Queensland government. The position of the federal government is that the Queensland government has to conduct the assessment. I note that Deputy Premier Anna Bligh, probably at a time when she was Acting Premier, said the federal government could have done that if they wanted to and chose not to. I suspect that is just all part of the argy-bargy you get along the way. It does not really matter. The decision has been made. There is an environmental impact assessment conducted under the Queensland government’s control. As I am sure Senator Campbell would point out if he stood up to speak, the federal environment minister under the EPBC Act has the ability to require more information to be provided if he or she—he at the moment, obviously—is not satisfied with the adequacy of the assessment that has been done.
That process is underway and it is very important but it still does not enable adequate public examination of all the issues surrounding the dam. Indeed, the EPBC Act, strong as it is, only gives the federal minister the power to examine issues relating to matters of national environmental significance, particularly threatened species in the case of the Traveston dam. World heritage values, wetlands and, I think, migratory birds have all been triggered. But those are the only things you cannot look at. Of course, as Queenslanders would know, there is an enormous amount of concern about some of the yield figures being put forward by the state government and the economics of the whole issue.
The social impact is horrendous. Occasionally I feel guilty about emphasising the environmental impact, the only area where the federal government has direct control, because it sounds like I am ignoring the social impact. I certainly do not aim to do that because the social impact is horrendous. It really should be emphasised now whilst we are having this debate and considering the inquiry that the community in and around Traveston Crossing and all of the towns around there—Kandanga, Federal and the towns surrounding Gympie—are suffering enormously. The trauma is enormous. Communities are being divided; people are being traumatised and the damage has already been done.
Deputy Premier Anna Bligh has said she does not mind a Senate inquiry as long as it does not delay the project. It is a simple fact, it is on the record in this chamber, that the assessment process and the final decision by the federal environment minister as to whether or not the dam could go ahead will not occur until next year. So any suggestion that a Senate inquiry, whenever its reporting date—March, June or August—is going to delay the dam is simply a furphy. The Deputy Premier should be called on that whenever she says it. There is no way that this could delay the dam a day.
What we should be delaying is the continuing pressure from the state government on people locally to allow their land to be resumed. If people want to sell up and get out, that is fine. I understand that is an individual decision for them to make, but this continual pressure on them to get out and for the government to buy the land up is causing immense stress. It is going to mean that if the dam is stopped—I would argue that there are compelling environmental grounds for the dam to be stopped under the federal EPBC Act—then the community will have already suffered enormous, irreparable damage. The state government will own huge swags of land through the area whilst not being able to go ahead with the dam. It is no secret that I hope the dam does not go ahead. Before it is even clear whether the dam will be allowed there is social damage already being done and some of it is irreversible.
I would repeat my call now for the state government to halt their continuing pressure on people potentially affected by this to have their land resumed now. There will be plenty of time afterwards—if whoever the federal environment minister will be gives it the go-ahead—for land to be resumed. From the day the first sod is turned, or whatever it is that you do when you start making a dam, to when it is actually built will be a very long time. There will be plenty of time to resume people’s land after the dam is finally approved if that is what happens. They do not need to cause that social destruction now.
To turn specifically to the reference here, what we have heard from Senator Boswell is basically that the government members have decided they want an inquiry. They want to move it in the next sitting week in three weeks time. They are saying that everything in the motion that Senator Stewart has put forward is covered in the government members’ motion, so we do not need this one. In that case why not just vote on this today? It is all clear, it is all votable, so why not bring forward the coalition members’ referral today and get on with it? The concern is there; I see no reason to delay it. I do not really mind. I have to say I prefer the terms of reference put forward by Senator Boswell and his Queensland colleagues.
I cannot help but note that it is a bit rich for the coalition members to all decide amongst themselves in their party room that they want an inquiry into something where there is obviously a political opportunity for them to beat up on the Queensland Labor government. You have been busily knocking off every proposal we have put on this side of chamber on a whole range of different issues, many of which do not have that partisan political focus. I think it is a bit rich to say, ‘We’ve all decided amongst ourselves, we’ve come up with the terms of reference,’ which you did not consult us about. Even though I have made it clear that I am supportive of the general intent, we had no consultation about the details of what is in them.
I personally believe the terms of reference should specifically mention the Wyaralong dam. I will move an amendment to the terms of reference when that comes up. I think Wyaralong is covered in your terms of reference but I think it is appropriate to specifically name it alongside Traveston so that it does not get forgotten. There is no doubt Wyaralong is less destructive environmentally and socially but it certainly still has some environmental and social impact.
On top of that, let us not forget that we are talking about water policy, as the terms of reference of the coalition senators indicate. To me, even with the social and environmental damage, if it stacked up as a genuinely clever, necessary piece of infrastructure on water policy grounds and on economic grounds then at least there would some competing principles to wrestle over. But from everything I have seen—and this is why I think a Senate inquiry is important, because an environmental impact assessment does not look at these things—the economic case is ludicrous. In the case of the Traveston dam, it will cost $2 billion to build something where the water yield figures continually change, for starters. It will not only cost $2 billion to build it and for all the resumptions and the rebuilding of roads and powerlines, but added to that is the economic cost of taking out a lot of valuable agricultural land in that region. That land is also a key part of the character of that region, which is important if you want balance in a region so that it is not all just urban development and sprawl continuing to spread out from the development on the Sunshine Coast and the Gympie and Caloola areas. To take out that big part of the economy of the region and the very high-quality agricultural land also has a very significant economic cost that is not factored into that $2 billion either.
To produce a water storage piece of infrastructure that is not even guaranteed to fill is certainly a significant risk that relies on it raining sufficiently in the right area. Let us face it, south-east Queensland is full of dams, unfortunately the dams are not full. There are plenty of dams all around the place, it is just that a lot of them are not terribly full. The Wyaralong dam, which, as I said, comes under the terms of reference, should be emphasised because it is also being assessed under the EPBC Act. I have spoken in this chamber before about a very detailed analysis that has been done by a very qualified person in Dr Brad Witt from the University of Queensland that draws serious doubts over the water yield figures put forward by the Queensland government and points out that there is a dam basically just over the hill in the adjoining catchment that has been empty for years. Somehow if you build this other dam in the adjoining catchment it is supposed to fill up. The waste of money purely on the basis of trying to look like we are doing something—which is where this all generated from in the Queensland context—is a serious issue. Unfortunately, it is not being examined anywhere else.
I think a Senate committee is not absolutely ideal and I wish there were other processes that allowed these things to be examined in an open way. Obviously there are politics involved in a Senate committee and partisan motives which are going to colour the debate, and that is not ideal, but the fact is that there are no other mechanisms by which these issues can be examined. Without those mechanisms, the Senate committee plays a valuable role in allowing these issues into the public arena for the public to have a say, for the evidence to be tested and for much more openness and scrutiny. I am pleased that in doing so the committee would be required to look at the wider issues and alternatives. It would not just say, ‘We don’t like this dam, so there,’ but would be forced to accept that there is a need to ensure there is an adequate water supply for the region and to consider alternatives and weigh them up against those that are being put forward.
I also want to emphasise that the one aspect of a Senate committee—whether via the motion put forward by Senator Siewert’s or by Senator Boswell’s colleagues—that does concern me is the potential for it to raise false hope. I want to emphasise this for all sides but particularly for coalition senators. It is one thing to give people a Senate committee inquiry, and that is important, but that process should not give them a sense that the Senate committee has the power the stop the dam, as it obviously does not. I also remind coalition senators that if they win the next election it will be a coalition minister who will have the power to stop this dam through the EPBC Act. If you go on and on about how bad it is—as you should, because it is bad—and then are in a position to stop it and do not deliver, that will be raising a lot of hopes and then dashing them. I really warn against doing that.
I think the evidence with regard to the lungfish in particular as a threatened species is compelling. Any endangered species is a concern but the lungfish is an incredibly significant species. It has been suggested to me by lungfish experts that it is unfortunate that we discovered the lungfish ages ago and it has always been around. If we had just discovered it now it would be seen as a greater scientific miracle than when the Wollemi pine was discovered because it is such a significant species in its place in the evolutionary chain. To use a fish example, the coelacanth, the fish that was long believed to be extinct that was discovered in what then qualified as deep-sea fishing in the 1920s, is still known today because of the amazement at its ancient make-up and its place in the evolutionary chain. The lungfish is more significant than that fish. The Traveston dam will potentially—which is the key thing the investigation will need to determine—lead to the extinction in the wild of an incredibly significant species. That, to me, is more than sufficient reason to stop the dam. That power will be in the hands of the environment minister, whether it is Mr Turnbull, Mr Garrett from the Labor Party or someone else the Prime Minister after the election decides to appoint. That decision will sit in their lap.
We need to make sure that people’s hopes are not unduly raised, but we also need to make very clear that the power is there. It can be done and, in my view, it should be done. It should be stopped if the evidence stacks up. I am always open to being convinced to change my view if I am given more evidence that suggests that I am mistaken, but everything I have seen to date suggests that the impact on a range of threatened species, including the lungfish, will be absolutely critical and, in some cases, terminal. That is why we need to not forget that the power resides with the federal environment minister.
I will take the opportunity of emphasising to this chamber that the only reason the federal environment minister has that power is the actions of me and the Democrats back in 1999, passing the EPBC Act in the face of quite strident opposition—one of those ironies in life, I suppose. But we are dealing with the here and now, and the here and now is a proposal for a Senate committee inquiry. I think it is very valuable. Starting it off by having a spat about whose terms of reference to adopt is probably not terribly good.
I will finish by emphasising again that I am pleased that coalition senators are putting forward terms of reference. I am broadly happy with their terms of reference, apart from the comment I have already made. I do think that that needs to be contrasted with the attitude of government senators towards any number of Senate committee inquiries—I would say it is well into the twenties now—that have been blocked by the government. Just yesterday we voted on whether there should be an inquiry into the Qantas sale, obviously an issue of public significance and importance that would not otherwise be given public attention. That will now be dealt with in secret.
Contrast what is happening here, where coalition senators have basically decided amongst themselves that we are going to have a Senate inquiry, with their continual blocking of every other proposal for Senate inquiries into wide-ranging policy issues. We have had inquiries into the progress of mental health, which is clearly a cross-party issue of concern, blocked. The contrast is very stark. So whilst I am happy to support an inquiry it does frustrate me that it has only come about because of the political opportunity that has presented itself here. I do not think that is the best reason to be using for a Senate inquiry, but in the absence of alternatives I think it will be a valuable one. Frankly, I cannot see why we cannot get it started today, but it does not seem like we will be. We will get it started when we come back in late February.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Miscellaneous,23,2
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2007-02-08,"—I think we are all in screaming agreement that the proposed Traveston dam is the wrong dam for a whole range of reasons. From our side, that is not a statement that we are against dams; it is a statement that if you are going to build a dam you are best to build one in the right area. I will give you a couple of examples. This dam would cost about $1.7 billion of the Australian taxpayers’ money for about 150,000 megalitres of water. Its average depth would be about five metres, just the right depth for Cabomba weed to infest it. It is in a siltation area and it will be a siltation trap. There is about 90 feet of silt where they are building it at the moment, so it is a predominant alluvial floodplain.
It is not the case that these people are just saying, ‘We don’t want this dam.’ They have even suggested an alternative dam in their backyard, an alternative dam that is proximate to where the state government is talking about putting it, and that is Borumba. Let us look at the difference. For Borumba you have a 200-metre wall. You will get one million megalitres of water stored. And this is in the same area, with the same people. It would have an average depth of 90 metres, and the land is already owned by the state government. It seems so obvious. People say, ‘It would never fill.’ That is not correct. In fact, the last time it would have filled would have been in the 1990s. It would have been 90 per cent full. There are times on the Borumba Dam at the moment where three Sydney harbours spill over it in a day. That would suggest that there is potential for an increased capacity.
It is also believed that the costing of this dam could spill out to around $3 billion for construction and $1 billion for reticulation and piping: a $4 billion investment. That is why we have to start asking questions, because, ultimately, it is the taxpayers’ money that is doing it—especially when you could build a desalination plant for about $450 million to $500 million which would provide the same amount of water as Traveston dam, and you could then put the change into the Ipswich Motorway, hospitals or other water projects. These are the questions that have to be asked.
There are two major issues pushing this project: one is the ego of Mr Beattie and the other is the ego of Ms Bligh. That is what is driving this. If there is a political opportunity there, there is the political opportunity there, but that is not the reason this inquiry is going forward. The reason is that the people of the Sunshine Coast want it. The people of the Sunshine Coast have been amassing in groups. The last time there were about 500 or 600 people at a meeting on a Sunday afternoon to say: ‘We want our day in court. We want someone to hear us. We want someone to listen to us.’ Anytime there is a meeting, they turn up. These people want to be heard. The primary driver of any political issue should be that you listen to the people. When they start amassing at meeting after meeting, asking for someone to hear the truth, for someone to hear the other side of the argument, then we have to try as best we can to give them that opportunity.
I agree entirely with Senator Bartlett: no-one has said that this Senate inquiry will stop the dam. No-one has suggested that. And the people understand that completely. We have said that to them over and again. We said it to them on the radio this morning. It is not about that; it is about getting the truth on the table and raising the political pressure on Mr Beattie and Ms Bligh to do the decent thing, the logical thing, to find a better expenditure of the taxpayers’ money at an alternative site. And some of those that have been suggested are in the backyard of where the current dam is, so it is not just parochialism.
I welcome what Ms Bligh said. She said she has nothing to fear. A person who has nothing to fear should have no worries about turning up to the Senate inquiry. The only reason you would not turn up to the Senate inquiry is that you have something to fear or something to hide—some reason why you do not want to tell the truth, under oath, on the public record. That is why you would not turn up. It is going to be interesting to see whether this person who tells us they have nothing to fear shows us later that they have something very great to fear.
I think the fear would start with the assessment process and why we ended up with the Traveston dam site. Let us methodically go through the list of all the proposed dam sites to determine which would be the best deliverer of water for south-east Queensland. People want to have that debate. We have heard that the fishing industry and the tourism industry will be threatened, but, when this dam goes through, Queensland will fail to be self-sufficient in dairy products. It is a small issue! People in Brisbane like to drink milk. When the dam goes forward, one of the major dairy areas of south-east Queensland will be taken out of production. That issue obviously needs to be discussed further.
There are so many issues that have to see the light of day and be put on the table. The people of the Mary River and the Sunshine Coast are sick and tired of the manipulation and obfuscation—the nefarious imbroglio of Mr Beattie’s and Ms Bligh’s process for assessing this dam—and they want to get to the facts. I take on board what Senator Siewert says, but, with all due respect, there is nothing in her terms of reference that is not already offered and I do not think we should start this process with our own little jousting match about the terms of reference. We have acknowledged everybody. We have not isolated anybody and said that this is just a National Party idea, a Liberal Party idea, a Democrats idea or a Greens idea. We are just saying in this chamber that it is a good idea—and it is a good idea for people to know that they have a chance to have their day in court.
I acknowledge the hard work that Senator Trood has done in this process. There has been a bit of rough and tumble in trying to get this process going. Senator Trood has been a great advocate for the people of the Sunshine Coast and the Mary River. I also acknowledge the work that senators from other parties have done. But let us not cloud or stymie the issue now with an internecine fight over terms of reference. Yes, we have the potential to turn it into a political issue. But that is not just for the sake of politics; it is to get something that is just and right and to have oversight of how our nation’s money is spent. Investment in this ridiculous process will yield nothing more than a stinking swamp—and, very importantly, it will not be completed until 2011.
Ms Bligh argues that we are threatening Queensland’s water supply. Let us get this straight. Even with the most perfect time frame this thing will not be completed until 2011. The fact is that Brisbane will run out of water in the middle of next year. A dam that will only supply water by 2011 and will work only if it fills up with water—I imagine that means rain—is going to be no good for fixing a problem that will arise next year. So let us talk about the solutions for next year and how we go about doing something that will actually deliver water for the people of Brisbane. Good suggestions about desalination have been put on the table. There have been investigations by the local member, Dave Gibson, who has gone over to Western Australia to look at the costings of their desalination plants. Why would there be a wish to focus on that? Because that is all the time we have left if we want to provide water for Brisbane.
Surely, the issue that ought to be on the table is the fact that we have one of the major cities in Western civilisation and it is about to run out of water. Even Constantinople managed to deal with the siege of the Turks for three years without running out of water. But Brisbane is going to run out of water because of the complete and utter lack of planning by, and the complete and utter negligence of, the administration that currently holds the reins of power in Queensland, the Beattie-Bligh Labor government. They are going to run out of water. Ms Bligh has been saying lately, ‘We’ve got a water grid going.’ I read in the paper the other day that—if my recollection is correct—they have laid only about 500 metres of the 200 kilometres of pipeline that have to be put in. That is not a sign of a government that is taking seriously the threat of a major Western city running out of water.
We have to come up with serious solutions. Desalination has to be put on the table because, no matter what people think about it, we do not have the time to consider other alternatives. We have to come up with something that is going to deliver water for the area. We have to look at recycling, for industrial use at least, to try and take the pressure off. Certainly, new dams will have to go in—and I would be the first proponent for relevant dams—but we have to look at the facts. Why would you go for a dam that is five metres deep and on an alluvial swamp? There are even suggestions that it traverses a fault line. It will have huge social and economic impacts on the area—not just the immediate area but the whole of south-east Queensland. It will be a prime site for weed infestation. It will have huge environmental consequences for the Australian lungfish, the Mary River tortoise, the Mary River turtle, the Ramsar wetland and the Great Sandy Straits. Why would you do that when there is another site, proximate to the area, where the infrastructure is already in place and you can store seven or eight times the amount of water at far less cost? It is an argument of logic.
As Mr Beattie and Ms Bligh dig their heels in more and more, the biggest threat facing the people of the Sunshine Coast and the Mary River valley is the egos of those two individuals, who, in a dictatorial manner like a Caesar or a benevolent dictator—they have half of it right—have decided they can go into an area and inflict their wishes, illogical as they might be, on the people to prove a point. They are trying to prove the point that they are strong. This Senate inquiry will prove that they are not, that they are foolish, that they are unfair, that they are unjust, that they are wasteful and that they are completely negligent about looking for a real solution right now that is proximate to Brisbane.
Why hold an inquiry? People are going to say: ‘This is overstepping the mark. You’re infringing on that state’s rights.’ The one thing that Queensland is missing is an upper house. Queensland does not have a bicameral system. It only has a lower house and that is why there are times when this chamber must step in to give some other, greater review of the aspects of law to the unicameral system in Queensland. When it is the suggestion of the people of Queensland that there must be a review, when there are not just one or two but a whole raft of opinions—there is an overwhelming sentiment—that there has to be a review of a decision made by the single house in Queensland, then I think we have the moral premise to go in and have an inquiry.
I look forward to this inquiry taking place. I hope that it has a hearing in the Mary River area. I hope we can give the people of that area the time for their day in court without undue cost to their wallets—and gosh knows that they have had to fork out enough so far. I acknowledge that Ms Bligh has said she has nothing to fear and I look forward hopefully to her appearing at the inquiry. If she has nothing to fear and nothing to hide, it stands to reason that she should be willing to turn up. I acknowledge that the people of the Mary River and the Sunshine Coast know, and everybody in this chamber knows, that the Senate inquiry itself cannot stop the dam, but it certainly can raise the political temperature on it, and so it should. It will be a just outcome and that is what this chamber should be espousing: a just and fair outcome for those people who have not been heard.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Miscellaneous,23,2
"Trood, Sen Russell",LP,2007-02-08,"—I want to take the opportunity to make a few remarks on this particular issue because it is one of great interest to my constituents. It is a matter about which I have addressed the Senate at some length in the past. It is a matter which is very close to my heart, as it is of course, more so, to the people of the Mary River valley. I will not canvass in full detail the shortcomings of this particular proposal with regard to the Traveston Crossing dam; Senator Joyce and Senator Bartlett have rightly articulated those with some force. This is a fundamentally ill-conceived proposal. It is bad on environmental grounds most particularly. It is bad economically. It is bad socially for the region. In fact, what is mystifying about it is that there seems to be almost nothing that can be said in support of this proposal.
I am not one of those people who think we should not be building dams. Indeed, I think there is a place for dams in the context of addressing the wide range of issues which confront the Australian community right across the country in relation to the provision of water. Desalination, dams, recycling, conservation and other methods should all be considered. I am certainly of the view that dams ought to be part of that mix in trying to address this very serious problem.
What is surprising is that this particular proposal has only one proponent. There is only one advocate for this proposal—that is, the Queensland government. It strikes me as peculiar in the context of infrastructure developments around the country, where often there is a need for a community or an individual to yield to wider community and public interest. There are those who recognise that their own particular interests might be affected and those in a community who are prepared to say, ‘I know you’re going to be affected, I know your particular concerns are at risk, but there is a wider community interest.’
What is interesting about this proposal is that there is only one advocate for it. I have waited, breathlessly almost, to find someone else who would support the proposition of the Beattie government that this dam ought to be built in this particular place, and no-one has come forward. Indeed, all the professional studies that have been prepared by those who are anxious about this proposition make the point that there are better ways to address the needs of south-east Queensland’s water requirements than building this dam.
So it is absolutely mystifying to me that the Beattie government presses this matter with a kind of ideological position when, as Senator Joyce has rightly pointed out, there is an alternative not far away. What is particularly peculiar about this as a matter of public policy is that the Beattie government seems entirely reluctant to consider alternatives, if not determined not to consider alternatives—for example, the Borumba proposal that Senator Joyce has rightly mentioned to the chamber this morning. Why is that? Why is it that there is such an obsession? Frankly, I cannot provide an answer. It is one of the things about this issue that I find most vexing indeed.
This motion seeks to refer the matter to a Senate committee. Standing in my name and in the names of Senators Boswell and Joyce is a proposal that was put on the Notice Paper yesterday in relation to a similar topic. The people of the Mary River need an opportunity to ventilate their concerns. They have largely been shut out of any sensible, rational opportunity to communicate their concerns about this proposal to the Queensland government. They have been frustrated that the process so far has been so fundamentally dishonest—it has so fundamentally misrepresented its intentions to the point where we have yet to find a likely location for the dam wall. I think we are up to proposal 3 or 4 so far. We still do not have a place where this dam wall might be constructed.
This is creating an enormous amount of uncertainty and anxiety in the community. I, like Senator Joyce, have addressed public meetings in the area. It has been in some respects a very traumatic process, with people weeping about the consequences and the way in which this has been handled. This is no way to run a public policy railway. The Beattie government ought to do better. I have made it clear, as Senators Bartlett and Joyce have mentioned, that this inquiry will not take the place of the procedures that have been put in place under the Environmental Protection Act; what it will do is give them an opportunity, which they have hitherto been denied, to put their views and express their opinions to the Senate in relation to this proposal.
I would particularly encourage the Senate to look at the proposal in the notice of motion yesterday as in fact a wider proposal than the one that Senator Siewert moved this morning. Ours seeks to look more generally at the water requirements of south-east Queensland and it seeks to explore why it is that these needs have not been met—why it is that the water needs of south-east Queensland have been so fundamentally mismanaged by the Beattie government.
We ought to in that context pay some attention to the complicity of the new opposition leader of the federal Labor Party, Mr Rudd. As a bureaucrat in the former Goss Labor government in Queensland, it would seem he was directly responsible for ensuring that a particular dam proposal, which might well have addressed some of the water needs of Queensland and might well have provided precisely the kind of infrastructure that was needed and perhaps might not have placed us in this crisis, was terminated. We might find out why it was that he apparently terminated that proposal and did not proceed with it. That is something that ought to be of interest to the committee. Indeed, Mr Rudd needs to explain his party’s view on this particular proposal. I think I am right in saying that he has yet to declare his position on this matter
—He doesn’t know where it is.
—That may be right, Senator Joyce. He is still struggling to identify the possible location of the Traveston Crossing dam. The virtue of the motion we put on the Notice Paper yesterday is that the proposal would look more broadly at the requirements of water in North Queensland and south-east Queensland. It would be to the benefit of Queenslanders more generally, certainly to those who live in the south-east. It would give the people of the Mary River, who have been so disadvantaged by this process and who have been so profoundly affected by the way in which it has been conducted, an opportunity to ventilate and articulate their concerns. We would get some facts about this which have hitherto been precluded from public view.
In closing my remarks, may I acknowledge, as Senator Joyce has generously acknowledged others, his particular contribution to dealing with this matter amongst the community, and indeed Senator Bartlett’s, but also the contributions of my Liberal colleagues in Queensland—Senators Brandis, Mason and Ian Macdonald—who have all been concerned about the direction of this proposal. We all believe it needs close scrutiny. None of us is convinced that it has merit. The Senate inquiry will expose the limitations of this proposal for what it is—basically, a public policy sham and an attempt by the Beattie government to cobble together a solution to a matter prior to an election in relation to which they had given absolutely no policy thought. It was an attempt prior to the last state election in Queensland to put something on the table. It did not receive the detailed assessment and examination that it deserved. We will perhaps be able to provide that in the course of the Senate inquiry.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Miscellaneous,23,2
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2007-02-08,"—I rise to briefly outline Labor’s view, but I cannot help but first respond to some of the remarks that have been made by Senators Joyce and Trood. On a light-hearted note I must say that when you come from Perth, Brisbane is an eastern city and not a western city! I struggle with that. But it is heartening to hear of your interest and the interest of your conservative colleagues in the desalination plant that we have operating in Western Australia. You might like to re-educate some of your colleagues in my home state whilst you are visiting there.
It is interesting that people invoke ideas such as these: if the proposal is such a good one then you have nothing to hide; and the degree of concern and anxiety in the community is justification for having an inquiry. I agree with both of those propositions, and they were equally valid when people voted against the proposal to have an inquiry into the sale of Qantas yesterday. There is significant community anxiety about that too, Senator Joyce, but apparently that is not good enough for you in that case. I would have thought that Airline Partners Australia and Qantas should have nothing to hide and therefore should be willing to appear before a Senate inquiry, but you did not seem to deem that as something that should take place.
It is a pity that Senator Trood has left us, because he was talking about the views of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Rudd, about a previous dam proposal in Queensland. He neglected to inform the Senate of the views of the then parliamentary leader of the state Liberal Party, who moved a motion in the state parliament on 3 October 1989 that began:
That this House demands the government not proceed with the construction or planning of the Wolffdene dam in any way.
It is very easy to come in here and say that Mr Rudd may or may not have had some involvement with that dam and to call on him to have a view about this. It is very easy to score cheap, personal, political points about an issue and neglect to talk about your own history. It is not just about Mr Rudd’s role in the Queensland bureaucracy at the time; you might like to start looking at your own first—at that of the then parliamentary leader of the state Liberal Party—before you come in here and start talking about things like that.
Having said that, though, Labor is not opposed to having an inquiry, but we are opposed to this particular motion. We are concerned about the reporting date. We agree that there is a water crisis in south-east Queensland and we do not see that the Senate should in any way choose to interfere with any arrangements that the state government may have in trying to address that crisis. That would be inappropriate for this place and for anyone in this parliament, or anywhere else for that matter.
We do agree with the proposal to have an inquiry; we are just concerned about this particular motion and the short time. Labor are in a position to support the inquiry foreshadowed by Senators Boswell, Joyce and Trood. The water crisis in south-east Queensland is obviously at the point where even those of us who live in Perth realise it exists. Those who live along the Mary River obviously have very good internet access, because they have been in touch with each and every one of us in this chamber to let us know their views.
—Thanks to Telstra and the Australian government networking the nation!
—Unlike regional Western Australia, Senator Abetz, or the black hole that is Greenwood, which is in inner northern suburban Perth, where you cannot get decent internet access. Perhaps if you live in those electorates in Queensland it is a bit easier. Labor will support a Senate inquiry into this issue, but we are not in a position to support this particular motion. A Senate inquiry should not be used in any way to delay the Queensland government’s bid to address the water crisis that is facing those in south-east Queensland, so we will support the foreshadowed motions of Senators Boswell, Joyce and Trood. But they need to think very carefully when they come in here, they need to look at the history and views of their own party, before they talk about what others may or may not have done.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Miscellaneous,23,2
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2007-02-08,"—I support this motion only reluctantly; I think the politics of the motion are quite crazy. Why the federal parliament would be embarking upon an inquiry that can only achieve allowing Mr Beattie to escape from his own stupidity is beyond me. This whole issue arises from Mr Beattie’s incompetence and also the incompetence of former Labor governments and their senior adviser, Mr Rudd.
—What about your party’s role?
—I do not know. I would never accept what any Labor person might say when quoting a so-called Hansard—
—It was the 3 October 1989 state Hansard.
—but, even if it is true, you are quoting someone who is no longer in the parliament. I want to talk about people who are currently in this parliament and who aspire to lead this country—people who claim they have the foresight to properly run this country, as our Prime Minister has done now for 10 years and will continue to do for many years. The Prime Minister is a man of vision and foresight; Mr Rudd quite clearly failed that test when he was, in effect, the Queensland government. I am not sure what his official title was, but he was obviously the string puller for Mr Goss and the Queensland government at the time. Mr Rudd has a lot to answer for in relation to the water crisis in south-east Queensland at the present time. The Wolffdene dam, as I recall the issue a long time ago, had all of the land purchased and was ready to go, and the government of the day—never mind what an opposition of about five people said—

Senator Webber interjecting—

 (Senator Lightfoot)—Senator Webber, yelling across the chamber is unruly.
—with a huge majority, was titularly run by Premier Goss but directed by none other than the current Leader of the Opposition and would-be Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd. It was Kevin Rudd who had the influence at the time to look forward to the problems of water in Queensland 10 years hence. Mr Rudd did not have that vision. He succumbed to political pressure at the time. Mr Rudd crumbled with the first iota of pressure. He crumbled like a badly made cake. With no substance at all and with a bit of pressure put on him, he crumbled and pulled the Queensland government out of a proposal which, if it had been built, would have been looking after Queensland at this present time.
What has Mr Beattie done? And Beattie was part of that team at the same time. He has come up with this ridiculous proposal for a dam at Traveston Crossing, and a few other proposals besides that. Unfortunately, I have been at other meetings and have not heard what my colleagues have said, but I feel fairly certain that they have clearly enunciated the stupidity of this dam. Very importantly, not only is it going to affect the lives of many ordinary Australians but it is going to achieve nothing. It is a huge cost; the dam is not big enough; it is not deep enough; and we will lose more water in evaporation than will be usefully applied to south-east Queensland if the dam is ever built. Quite frankly, I do not think that Mr Beattie ever really intended for this to go ahead. He came up to an election a few months ago and had a number of crises to deal with—one of them was the health crisis. I must say, a democracy is a democracy and you accept the result, but I cannot understand my fellow Queenslanders rewarding Mr Beattie’s maladministration of the hospital system by re-electing him by almost the same massive majority he had before. Similarly, I cannot understand how they overlooked this water position.
Mr Beattie, clever though he is—and I like Peter Beattie; I admire him for his political nous and his political foresight; he is a great politician; he is not a great administrator, not a great Premier, but a great politician—needed something to defuse the issue of lack of water in south-east Queensland. So, what did he do? He picked some area where he knew the vote would not worry him, because it is an area where his party would never get much support in any case—
—You’re making it up. Keep rewriting history.
—Senator Macdonald, you should ignore those interjections and direct your comments through the chair.
—I thought it might have been an intelligent interjection, but I was badly mistaken; I should not have bothered to think that. Mr Beattie needed to do something, so he declared this dam in an area where he knows he will not get any votes. He did not really bother to look into it and did not really bother to think what a stupid proposition it was anyhow. I think Mr Beattie will be desperately hoping that something will happen from this inquiry or elsewhere that will allow him off the hook. That is why I have some hesitation and wonder about the wisdom of actually putting this motion before the parliament, but it is here. I will partake in the committee inquiry. I understand it has been referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport, of which I am a participating member, so I will relish the opportunity to learn a bit more about all aspects of it and actually getting some of the facts. I feel fairly confident at this time—
—You’d be well advised if you did that.
—Well advised to what?
—Get the facts.
—I assume from that, Senator Lundy, you are guaranteeing that the Queensland government and all their public servants will come along and give evidence. As I was just about to say, I have not been involved in putting this motion together, but it is a fairly good bet that Mr Beattie will prohibit any of his public servants—any of the people with the real knowledge; any of the people with the facts and information—appearing before this committee. I understand that Senator Lundy is guaranteeing that the Queensland government will instruct their public servants to come along and give evidence. If that is what you are doing, Senator Lundy, thank you very much, because it would be fascinating to get some of the public servants involved. I have spoken to a few of the public servants and they have told me that they have never been involved in a more ridiculous infrastructure program. I asked them, ‘Why don’t you say something about this?’ and they said, ‘In Queensland at the moment, if any public servant even indicates by the blink of an eye that they do not happen to agree with Mr Beattie and his 60-seat majority in Queensland, their futures as public servants are very, very limited.’
—Are you making that up as well?
—Let us see, Senator Lundy.

Senator Lundy interjecting—

—Senator Lundy, you are out of order and you should remain silent.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I must say, I am enjoying Senator Lundy’s interventions because I am getting from her that she has information from the Queensland government that they will make their public servants available to give evidence.
—I didn’t say anything of the sort. You’re verballing me and you’re making it up.
—Are you saying that they will give evidence?
—Senator Macdonald, I am sure that if you ignored Senator Lundy she would eventually remain quiet, which would be the great wish of this chamber.
—I do not particularly want her to remain quiet, because her interventions are showing the shallowness of the Labor Party’s approach to all this. What I do really want to get on the record is that Senator Lundy—a senior frontbench member of the opposition and obviously one who is very closely attuned to the Labor Party organisation and all the apparatchiks in Queensland—is guaranteeing that public servants will be able to give evidence to this inquiry without fear or favour. I look forward to that. I am very doubtful that it will happen. But, Senator Lundy, please prove me wrong and make sure that any public servant who is called or who has a contribution to make is able to give evidence to this Senate inquiry. If that happens, Senator Lundy, I will publicly apologise to you and Mr Beattie, but my suspicion is that they will not be allowed to come along.
—You’re just lying. You’re standing there and lying.
—Senator Macdonald, do not be enticed by Senator Lundy to respond.

Senator Lundy interjecting—

—Senator Lundy, you are out of order!
—Heaven forbid! We have a prospective Prime Minister who could not even look after the water crisis in Queensland 10 years ago and we have prospective frontbench people here with that sort of immature and childish approach to their duties.
—What? Calling you a liar?
—She keeps calling me a liar and hoping someone will take the point of order. I ask no-one to take the point of order. I would like it on the record to show what immature people we are dealing with when we deal with this so-called alternative government. You have an alternative government led by a person who had absolutely no vision for—
—That’s another lie.
—Senator Lundy! You know the rules of this place very well; you have been here long enough. You should not use that term to any senator here, and I ask you to stand and withdraw it.
—I withdraw.
—You have a prospective alternative Prime Minister to this country with a frontbench of the calibre you have just seen demonstrated in the last couple of minutes. This prospective leader did not have the vision 10 years ago to understand the crisis Queensland would be in at this time. As the man who pulled the strings of the Queensland government back in those days, he had no vision whatsoever, no understanding of the future and no understanding of the huge infrastructure gaps.
Consider the amount of money that the Queensland government rakes in from the Commonwealth’s GST—a GST, I might say, that was opposed by the Labor Party; but, talk to any of their premiers now and see how they embrace the GST in all of its glory. People still do not quite understand that every single cent of the GST collected in Australia goes to the state governments, all of which at the moment are, regrettably, managed—or mismanaged—by the Labor Party.
I have to say my home state of Queensland has done better out of the GST than most other states, at least in the initial period. Queensland should be rolling in money—sufficient money to look after the health system that is grinding to a halt. It should have sufficient money to set up the infrastructure that is needed to assist what is Australia’s fastest-growing region. The south-east corner of Queensland is growing faster than any other region of Australia. People—and I can understand why this happens—leave Victoria and New South Wales in droves and come to the good state. Mr Beattie is getting all the additional revenue from conveyance duty and all of the GST money, and I think it has all been spent on spin doctors for Mr Beattie and his team.
Certainly, I do not think this proposal for the Traveston dam is serious. I am a bit disappointed that we are going to take the pressure off Mr Beattie by allowing this inquiry to go ahead, but the decision has been made. I will certainly be involved in the inquiry and will try to get these public servants that Senator Lundy appears to have guaranteed will appear—
—I never said anything of the sort.
—You are not guaranteeing they will appear? Will they appear?
—It has nothing to do with me.
—Oh, it has nothing to do with you!
—Senator Macdonald, you should address your comments through the chair and disregard those unruly interjections by Senator Lundy.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Now I understand Senator Lundy is saying that she is not guaranteeing the public servants will appear. I go back to my original proposition: I hope they do, I would be very surprised if they do and, if they do, I will publicly apologise to both Mr Beattie and Senator Lundy.
As I was saying before I was interrupted again by Senator Lundy, it is an inquiry that I will participate in. If we can get the public servants and get them to have the courage to put the facts of the matter before the Australian people, I think that would be very useful. I think most Queenslanders who have followed the issue, particularly those in the Traveston dam area who are involved, know the facts of this matter at the moment. They do not need a public inquiry to know what a ridiculous proposition this is—a proposition that will impact seriously on people’s lives and futures. It is the sort of decision that a Labor government takes without any regard for the rights, wellbeing and lifestyle of the people involved. With those reservations, I support the motion.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Miscellaneous,23,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-02-08,"—So everybody agrees that there should be an inquiry into this proposal but they do not want to support this committee reference. That is fascinating. I would have thought that if people were really keen to get this inquiry underway they would want to see it done straightaway and would in fact be prepared to look at these terms of reference and maybe negotiate over them.
To set the record straight, I submitted my motion to the table office yesterday prior to notices of motion being given here. So, in fact, I was not trying to gazump Senator Boswell; I did not know he was moving a similar motion. As I said, I had already submitted my motion before presentation of notices yesterday. After I found out that Senator Boswell had presented his notice of motion yesterday, I tried to see if we could come up with a compromise where everybody’s needs were met.
If you look at the proposal that Senators Boswell, Joyce and Trood have submitted, you find for a start there is no date for when the committee should report. So we could have an ongoing inquiry just taking submissions endlessly. Where is the time frame? There is a very strong sense of urgency about the need for this inquiry. Where is their date? It seems to me the terms of reference for this inquiry were cobbled together fairly quickly. There is no date.
I would also like to point out an inherent contradiction in Senator Boswell’s terms of reference. His motion proposes to refer the matter to the committee for inquiry and report after ‘examination of all reasonable options’. Our very argument here is that this is an unreasonable option. The terms of reference say that we should be looking at ‘all reasonable options’ and then go on to look at the merits of all options, including the Traveston Crossing dam. Our very thesis is that this is an unreasonable option. That is why I think our terms of reference are much clearer. Senator Trood probably missed the fact that the terms of reference the Greens are proposing actually do require examination of other options. Our term of reference (iii) is ‘the balance of other options available to meet the region’s water resource needs’, which I think covers the question of other options very clearly.
I do think there are some flaws in the coalition senators’ terms of reference. I do think ours are better: they have a clear date for when the committee should report. They also make sure that we get on with the job right now and we do not waste any time. I am disappointed that the coalition and, for that matter, the Labor Party do not feel that they can support this motion. It was put up so that we can get on with the job of looking at this proposal and looking at alternative needs. I do agree with Senator Ian Macdonald that it is letting the Queensland government off the hook, but I think there is no alternative process for the community—the Queensland community in particular, of course—to actually get access to information and to be able to have their say. So, while I think that Senator Ian Macdonald does have a very significant point there, I do not think that that can take away from the need for the Senate to actually hold this inquiry, to at least have one method of shining some light on this proposal. As I said, I am disappointed that the committee of which I am deputy chair cannot get on with this job right now so we can start calling for public submissions and start getting access to this data. I am disappointed that we are going to have to wait weeks more before we can get on with this job. I put the motion to the Senate that the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee gets on with this inquiry and has an inquiry into the Traveston dam and the alternative options for water supply for south-east Queensland.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Siewert’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Miscellaneous,23,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-02-08,"—I left off my speech on Tuesday quoting the Humane Society International’s submission to list the southern bluefin tuna as conservation dependent. In their application, they noted:
In 2003 it was found that an entire generation appeared to be missing from SBT stocks off Western Australia, that acoustic surveys of one- and two-year-old SBT found that between 1997 and 2000 the aged one cohort declined by over 200 per cent and since then it has been close to zero. Results from 2003 found zero southern bluefin tuna aged one. The survey did not operate in 2004, but in 2005 and 2006 the results were also close to zero. The near total absence of southern bluefin tuna in the survey area for six consecutive surveys, following four years of consistent detections, is of concern.
As the chamber might recall me saying, that is also the first action that I think the minister could be taking to start addressing the issue of decline in southern bluefin tuna stock. The second option that the minister could take would be to revoke the wildlife trade operation status of the fishery under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. There is no case to be made for this as a sustainable fishery and its recognition as such under the EPBC Act is now quite perverse.
Thirdly, the minister can nominate the listing of the species at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, commonly known as CITES. This convention is now the last resort for this species which has been so badly let down by the regional fisheries management organisations which have failed to protect it for the last 13 years. And, yes, senators will probably recall that I have mentioned some of these issues in the past when talking about the need to protect southern bluefin tuna. It is unfortunate that I have to keep repeating these statements and the fact that the quota has been set so high for southern bluefin tuna that it seriously endangers it. These actions both at home and in international fora to protect these species must reflect the much broader approach that we need to take to marine sustainability. The government has to acknowledge that the current approach has failed and that extinction of this species is now a very real possibility.
Southern bluefin tuna is unfortunately not the only species threatened in this manner but it is an indication of the crisis facing some of our fisheries worldwide. The Bureau of Rural Sciences confirmed that the number of Australian marine species considered overfished has increased from 17 to 24 and that the most severely overfished species still have no prospect of recovery. To safeguard the marine environment we must move to the kind of ecosystem and precautionary approach to fisheries management which is detailed in articles 5 and 6 of the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement. We have to move to a science based approach where regional fisheries management organisations are made more transparent and less prone to vested interests and the short-term demands of the market. We should immediately establish well-enforced large-scale no-take marine protected areas. We need independent observer schemes, real-time vessel monitoring and fish tagging. All of these must play a role in how we manage our fish stocks.
We believe that the government must take urgent action to start managing these fisheries better. They need to reduce the quota. These fisheries have an intrinsic value; they are not there just for fishing and they should not be mined as a commodity like dirt from a quarry. We really need to start managing these fisheries properly. Therefore, I have moved to disallow the quota on southern bluefin tuna. The quota is too high and is not supported by the science. We are in danger of sending a species to extinction.",SENATE,<title>2006/07 SBT AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL CATCH ALLOCATION DETERMINATION</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,24,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-02-08,"—This extreme Greens motion we are debating today is to disallow regulations allowing the sustainable harvesting of southern bluefin tuna. The consequence of this Greens motion would be to throw thousands of people out of work and destroy the city of Port Lincoln, as my colleague Senator Bernardi knows so well. I note Senator Bernardi’s presence in the chamber. He is a very strong champion of the Eyre Peninsula, Port Lincoln and the southern bluefin tuna industry. The Greens motion demonstrates as much as anything why the Australian Greens should never be trusted in any capacity with the Australian economy or, for that matter, with the Australian environment or with issues of sustainability.
The regulation we are debating today is the result achieved by Australia at the most recent Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, or CCSBT, and that was then translated into the Australian Fisheries Management Authority’s national catch allocation determination for southern bluefin tuna, which the Greens now seek to disallow. That determination is a landmark win for not only the Australian southern bluefin tuna industry but also southern bluefin tuna and international fisheries regimes. It is the culmination of many years hard work by the Australian government in documenting and exposing overcatch by the Japanese longline fleet and in working constructively through the CCSBT with other like-minded and responsible fishing nations to ensure the global sustainability of SBT stocks. It cements Australia’s reputation as a leading voice for the conservation and sustainable use of SBT and shows that when responsible fishing nations such as Australia are prepared to stand up and be counted great things can be achieved.
Rather than accept the kooky, nut bag, deep green, ideologically driven rhetoric of the Greens, let us instead look, as we on this side of the chamber like to do—and I know Senator Bernardi will join me in this—at the facts. And they are these: at the 13th meeting of the CCSBT the commission members agreed to reduce the total global catch from 14,925 tonnes to 11,810 tonnes, of which Australia would harvest up to 5,265 tonnes. In making its decision the commission took advice from its scientific committee comprised of independent international scientists respected in their fields. The catch level agreed upon by members is within the levels recommended by this independent scientific committee. Let me repeat that for the benefit of the Greens: it is within the level recommended by independent internationally renowned scientists. It is not a pie-in-the-sky figure, it is not a figure plucked out of thin air; it is a figure within the levels recommended by international experts.
Why should we as a parliament override their advice? Is there any better advice that has been put on the table for us to consider—other than extreme Greens rhetoric? There is no advice other than the gloom and doom that the Greens preach no matter what the topic is. There is no scientific evidence to back up the assertion that we should be disallowing these regulations. The simple fact is, as is so often the case, the Greens simply will not accept the verdict of the international scientists who are experts in this field. Why? The answer is simple: because it does not support their ideology. That is the simple reason. But make no mistake: the result that we were able to obtain at the commission is not only a win for the fish in that it puts them on a sound, sustainable footing; it is also a win for our Australian SBT industry.
Two other key agreements were also reached by the commission. Firstly, the reduction in the global catch would be largely borne by Japan, whose national catch allocation has been reduced from 6,065 tonnes to 3,000 tonnes—that is, a 50 per cent reduction—over the next five years. Why is that? This is in recognition of the gross overcatch of tuna, possibly up to 178,000 tonnes, by the Japanese over the past 20 years. At this point I record my appreciation of the Australian industry and the government officials who worked tirelessly to uncover the overcatch and also of the Japanese government for the very responsible way in which they approached the discussions on this critical but very sensitive point at the commission.
The second decision I want to refer to is that Australia would retain its existing national catch allocation of 5,265 tonnes for the next three years in recognition that its operations have been compliant with the rules of the commission. In short, this is a great win for the industry. It is an important recognition that their operations have been world’s best practice. It allows them to face the future with increased confidence and I am sure it is a great comfort to the 3,500 employees in Port Lincoln who are employed either directly or indirectly by the industry.
The good news does not end there. Additional proposed reductions agreed by the commission members will take the actual catch below 11,530 tonnes for the next three years. Remember, when you take into account Japanese overcatch the global total allowable catch is being reduced not from 14,925 tonnes to 11,530 tonnes but from somewhere in the order of 20,000 tonnes to no more than 11,530 tonnes.
The commission also agreed to implement measures to improve monitoring, control and surveillance in the fishery, including regulation of transhipping, 100 per cent observer coverage, a catch documentation scheme and a compulsory national vessel monitoring system. The commission also made a commitment to work on further measures including an independent observer program for fishing vessels, port state measures, boarding and inspection and a vessel register. Make no mistake, these outcomes were not easy to achieve. They were the result of tireless efforts by the Australian government and they are undoubtedly good for the industry and good for the fish.
Given that great record, what on earth are the Greens doing coming into this chamber seeking to move a disallowance motion? It is very disappointing and it does highlight a very important difference: the difference between the approach of the Howard government and the approach of the Greens to balancing jobs and the environment. I cannot put it more simply than to say: with the Greens it is either jobs or the environment, but with the Howard government it is jobs and the environment. We do not have to exclude ourselves from the environment, as the Greens would continually have us do. We believe that we are in fact part of nature and, just as much as other animals have the right to eat tuna, so do humans. It stands to reason that we harvest them sensibly and in a sustainable way and that is exactly what we were able to achieve in Japan just a few short months ago. On the back of that fantastic outcome for Australia that has got us credit all around the world, the Greens come in with their mantra of doom and gloom. They are not willing to recognise any of the expert scientific evidence or any of the advances that we were able to make and they just continue with the same old mantra of doom and gloom and say that this fish stock is going to become extinct. A lot more could be said about this motion but it is a matter of great regret that the Australian Greens are not willing to ever recognise the achievements that are made by any government anywhere in this country when it comes to matters of the environment.
It is a good occasion for us to also ask who would be running Labor’s fishing policy if they were to ever be elected to government, because that is a very important question that the Australian Labor Party needs to answer. For 10 years, the Australian Conservation Foundation had a policy of saying that wild fisheries were unsustainable, they should not be allowed and that exports of anything caught in the wild, in fisheries in particular, was not sustainable. Indeed, that same body said:
Tuna stocks have been devastated by Australian and international fishing fleets because of their high value in the Japanese ... markets. Tuna cages off Port Lincoln in South Australia, where wild caught tuna are fattened for later sale, are also controversial.
They said the groups—and that included the Australian Conservation Foundation—‘do not support the ongoing commercial targeting of southern bluefin tuna’. Who was the president of the Australian Conservation Foundation for that 10-year period? None other than the man who would be the environment minister in a Kevin Rudd led government. I say to the southern bluefin tuna industry of South Australia: beware, this is the man that may well be using an export licence or some other mechanism to put in train that which he actually believes and has put on the public record through his organisation, the ACF, for over a decade. The ACF actually said:
No existing commercial use of a wild stock, in particular those harvested for export, can be demonstrated to be ecologically sustainable.
The Labor Party have to come clean. Is this still Mr Garrett’s view or is it not? He has to tell the people of Australia, if it is not his view, why he misled the people for a decade. Was it simply to raise funds for his organisation that made him willing to mislead them or is he now willing to mislead the Australian people in the hope of getting elected, so he can then implement policies that he actually has believed in for the last decade? That is a very scary thought for every single fisherman and community reliant on our sustainably managed wild fisheries. It is hard to believe, but I think the Australian Greens might even take a slightly more extreme position than Mr Garrett.
—Is it possible?
—One wonders, Senator Bernardi. It is a wonder that there would be room left to be more extreme than Mr Garrett’s and the ACF’s position in that regard, but what I would say is that for the Australian Greens to have come into this chamber with this motion just goes to show how out of touch they are. They would be willing with this motion to throw 3½ thousand people out of work in Port Lincoln. Earlier today they would have closed down coalmines and, of course, reimbursed the workers. We are not going to be able to reimburse the sacked workers out of the taxes raised from the southern bluefin tuna industry anymore because we would be closing the industry down as well. The Australian Greens have to come clean and tell the Australian people exactly how they are going to fund all these kooky policies, or perhaps they are willing to ensure that every single Australian lives in poverty whilst we have a burgeoning environment around us.
All around the world the lesson is that, when you have poverty, you have the worst environmental management. Having a good, sound, rich economy, as we have at the moment, allows us to fund environmental issues, including remediation. That is why Australia is able to have the marine protected areas that she now boasts and the forest reserves that she now boasts whilst maintaining sensible wild sea harvesting and sensible native forest harvesting. We are getting the balance right and, rather than continuing the anger of that which may have been relevant 20 or 30 years ago, I invite those Green activists to take away their views of the world as it was in the 1970s, come into the 21st century and ask themselves, ‘Have things changed; are things balanced?’ and what they will find is a much, much better world, a much friendlier world and a much nicer world than they would seek to portray to the rest of the community. Just in case Senator Siewert is in any doubt, the government will be opposing her motion.",SENATE,<title>2006/07 SBT AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL CATCH ALLOCATION DETERMINATION</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,24,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2007-02-08,"—It was an interesting contribution in part from Senator Abetz to Senator Siewert’s disallowance motion on the southern bluefin tuna quota. He never misses an opportunity to develop his conspiracy theories, which we have just heard. He is a bit like the Greens in that regard. They have always got their conspiracy theories and Senator Abetz equally has his conspiracy theories, and it is a very interesting theory that he puts forward. As Labor spokesman on agriculture, fisheries and forestry, I am very happy to put on the record our position in relation to current policies, and I will help Senator Abetz by doing that now.
The Labor Party is of the view that seafood is becoming an increasingly important part of a healthy, balanced diet. Recent surveys show that consumer awareness of the health benefits of seafood is on the rise and consumers are responding by purchasing more seafood meals. Demand for seafood, especially locally produced Australian seafood, is growing in the domestic market. In a broad strategic context, it is therefore critically important that the Australian government secures the supply of seafood for future generations. This requires a comprehensive long-term strategy for sustainable aquaculture development and fisheries management. The Howard government, frankly, has failed in its duty to provide the framework for sustainable management of our valuable fisheries resources. The government has failed to provide adequate investment in programs to underpin the sustainable growth of the Australian aquaculture industry. The government has failed to provide a fair trading environment for local seafood producers.
Let me provide some explicit examples of where the Howard government has failed the seafood industry and seafood consumers. Firstly, the government has not provided an adequate level of protection from imported diseases—diseases which could potentially have a devastating financial impact on the Australian seafood industry and an unquantifiable impact on our marine ecosystems. Right now the Howard government is allowing diseased imported prawns to enter Australia, which represents a direct threat to the disease-free status of the $450 million Australian prawn industry.
Secondly, the Howard government has an appalling record on seafood labelling. Only recently has it decided to move to introduce ‘country of origin’ labelling on imported seafood products. It took nearly 10 years of concerted efforts on the part of seafood producers and their representatives to get the government to sit up and pay attention to the importance of the role that labelling plays in ensuring there is a level playing field between local and imported seafood produce. What has the Howard government done about the enforcement of labelling laws? Nothing. It established a 1800 number for the public to report false labelling, yet there have been continuing reports of inaction in response to complaints made to that very hotline. False labelling still remains a critical problem in some retail outlets and it remains a legitimate concern of the fishing and aquaculture industries.
Thirdly, the Howard government has failed to take seriously the longstanding concerns of local seafood producers about the lack of a level playing field with imported products. The Australian seafood industry is required to meet standards that are amongst the highest in the world for food safety, quarantine and environmental protection. These requirements impose significant costs on the local industry, and most local producers are happy to meet those requirements. However, there is no such requirement for imported seafood products. Seafood imports are not required to meet the same benchmarks as those imposed on our local industries. This creates a very unfair trading environment, where Australian law imposes significant costs on local producers and yet allows a vast amount of imported product that does not meet the same standard as domestic produce must meet. This has been a concern of local seafood businesses and families for much of the past decade. It is a large part of the reason why the balance of trade in seafood products has been steadily growing in favour of imports. It is also why Asian seafood imports can arrive in Australia at such a low cost. The Howard government has had 10 years to address this concern and yet it has done nothing about it. The Howard government, frankly, has run out of ideas to assist the local seafood industry and is not interested in addressing the unfair playing field for local seafood producers.
Let us look more closely at the Howard government’s management of our existing fish stocks. Successive ministers have failed in their duty to provide for sustainable management of fish stocks. Let me substantiate this observation. The Howard government recognised its own inadequate management of Commonwealth fisheries back on 14 December 2005—more than 14 months ago—when the then Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation, Senator Ian Macdonald, announced a $220 million package called ‘Securing Our Fishing Future’. At that time, the minister said:
... the Australian government has made it very clear that it wishes AFMA to accelerate its current programmes to prevent overfishing, rebuild overfished stocks, and to take a more strategic approach to setting catch limits in future.
The message from the Australian government is clear: overfishing in Commonwealth fisheries is unacceptable and, if you think you cannot operate in that environment, you should consider applying for the buyout. Last week the Bureau of Rural Sciences released its Fisheries Status Reports for 2005. This important paper highlights the Howard government’s legacy of failure in fisheries management. Twenty-four of 83 species assessed are classified as overfished and/or subject to overfishing. This is up from 17 out of 83 in the previous year. Of the remaining species, 40 are classified as uncertain. This means that almost half of the surveyed stocks might be overfished but the government does not know because it has not gathered enough information.
The Howard government has had 10 years to address this critical lack of information and to improve its fisheries decision making. It has clearly failed. Of the remaining species identified in the BRS report, only 19 are classified as not overfished. But perhaps the most worrying aspect of the BRS report is the finding that the number of species classified as overfished and/or subject to overfishing has increased from five in the first survey in 1992 to 24 in 2005. The $220 million buyout package is the government’s attempt to fix the mess that it has created by its own poor management.
Given the status of our fish stocks, and the uncertainty created in the Australian fishing industry as a result of the announcement, it is not unreasonable to expect that the government would act quickly in its delivery of the buyout package. But, as the industry knows only too well, the government’s delivery of a package has been plagued by delays, inaction and, of course, a change of minister soon after the initial announcement. Industry had to wait nearly 12 months before any licences were actually removed from any fishery. In the case of the Northern Prawn Fishery and the Bass Strait Central Zone Scallop Fishery, business had to endure nearly 18 months of uncertainty before any licences were removed. Fishing families and onshore businesses which have been impacted by the government’s decision are still waiting for funding to flow from the onshore business assistance package. One wonders whether they have been delayed until this year for reasons that are obvious to everyone looking at the electoral cycle.
Labor will be taking a very close look at this aspect of the package to ensure it does not unfairly impact on working families in coastal regions and towns. This is yet another example of the Howard government’s unfair and uncaring attitude towards seafood producers and their families. To add to the litany of blunders, the government has added a whole new layer of uncertainty by proposing a radical restructure of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority. Labor is concerned about the impact that these changes may have on staff morale within AFMA and on communication and consultation with industry and non-government sectors. It is clear from this summary that the Howard government does not have a well-thought-out plan for the Australian seafood industry. Its approach to fisheries management has been piecemeal and ad hoc, lurching from crisis to crisis. It has lacked a comprehensive strategic approach to the seafood industry.
So what of the southern bluefin tuna and the motion from Senator Siewert? Everyone should be concerned about the state of the southern bluefin tuna resource. By even optimistic estimates, the spawning stock is at very low levels. All this was confirmed by the BRS status report, which I have already referred to. The critical issue which we all need to focus on is how to fix the problem. Senator Siewert’s solution is to disallow the AFMA decision to set the Australian quota at 5,265 tonnes, the same level it has been at since 1989. We think this is the wrong solution.
Firstly, the Australian quota issued by AFMA is the same as that decided by the international Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna in October last year. At that time, the CCSBT showed some strength by cutting Japan’s quota by more than half, from 6,065 tonnes to 3,000 tonnes for at least the next five years. This was a penalty for an independent panel finding that Japan had overcaught about 178,000 tonnes of southern bluefin tuna in the last 20 years. Senator Siewert’s solution would punish Australian industry for Japan’s overcatch, and we think that that is unfair.
Secondly, the CCSBT decisions show that the CCSBT can be an effective international body. What Senator Siewert’s motion does is reject the CCSBT decision. Again, this would only devalue that organisation just when it is showing some strength. It is important that responsible nation members, such as Australia, remain supportive of the CCSBT. Sound governance of our international waters is the key to long-term sustainability of migratory fish stocks such as the southern bluefin tuna.
Thirdly, the CCSBT decision was to fix Australia’s quota at the same level for the following three years; however, AFMA’s legislation allows it to be set for one year. This more conservative approach to managing the Australian component of the catch quota is supported by Labor. We think that allows scope for revision, if it is needed, by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, even though we would be entitled under the ruling by CCSBT to fix the quota at that level for three years.
Finally, Senator Siewert must know that the vast majority of the Australian quota is normally caught by mid-March. Therefore, the practical effect of the motion is largely to provide comfort to the countries which overcaught and created problems for the stock. Southern bluefin tuna is a very important resource for Australia. It earns around $200 million of high value added exports and it generates about 2,000 jobs. However, this export income and these jobs will not continue if the resource is not sustainably managed. The challenge is to find the best strategy to rebuild the southern bluefin tuna stock. We think that stopping Australian fishing this year will only be counterproductive. Taking a decision to stop Australia from fishing southern bluefin tuna would not influence any other country and would considerably weaken Australia’s position in the CCSBT. What the government has to ensure is that overcatch never occurs again. This can only be achieved by being in the CCSBT and developing and enforcing the strictest regulations.
Some might suggest that all of this is dependent on Japan and that Japan could enforce a most rigorous regime because it is the main importer, in terms of commercial marketing, of the tuna. But that is another issue which needs to be taken up with the CCSBT by Australia. Of course, that is something Labor will be looking closely at in terms of the position we take to the election. We do not believe that it would be appropriate to disallow this regulation. We do not believe that we should be saying to the Australian tuna industry, ‘You will be shut down for a year.’ We do not believe that the people who are employed in the industry this year should be told that their jobs are finished for the year. We believe that the arrangements, having been based on a scientific assessment and on Australia’s responsible performance in this fishery for some time, ought to be as proposed in the regulations. We will be voting against the motion.",SENATE,<title>2006/07 SBT AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL CATCH ALLOCATION DETERMINATION</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,24,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-02-08,"—I cannot say I am surprised at the government’s response. I am surprised at the ALP’s response because they quoted figures from the latest BRS report about the state of our fisheries which must send shivers up the spine of any Australian, but particularly up the spine of anyone interested in the marine environment. The science shows that this species is endangered, that it is under threat and that Australia should be taking action. If this action is not taken, if Australia does not reduce its quota and if fishing continues at these high levels, there will be no fish into the future, so fishers will be put out of work. They will not be able to rely on this fishery for their income. We seek to disallow this quota because we believe it is too high. As I understand it, it is a fallacy to claim that if we do not take our quota we will not be able to participate in the commission. That is not true. I am sure Australia is creative and can find a way to work with other fishing nations in any case.
I am not sure of the date of the quote that Senator Abetz took from the Australian Conservation Foundation, because Senator Abetz did not give it, but those of us that have been involved in marine conservation for quite some time will know that, until fairly recently, there was no ecologically sustainable assessment of Australia’s fisheries. So, when that statement was made, it was true. There was no assessment. It is only relatively recently that Australia’s fisheries have undergone a sustainable fisheries assessment process, and it has been quite an extensive process.
As for saying that we do not compliment or take note of successful or positive initiatives that are put in place, I think Senator Abetz has a very short memory. He will remember that we were actually very supportive of the $220 million fisheries package that was put forward. We were very supportive of that and I have been very supportive in the media about the tuna fisheries industry and fishers’ efforts to reduce the impact of their long-line fisheries—I am talking about Australia’s fishers, not other fishers—and to reduce Australia’s impact on albatross and other marine species. Senator Abetz, as I said, has quite a short memory on those issues. I think that he is misquoting the science. The science is very clear. The science on this species and other fish species is very clear, and it shows that humans are endangering tuna and other species and it is time that we took action to reduce our quota.
I outlined a range of measures that this government could be taking additionally to the measures that they are taking, because I do not think the measures that are being taken at the moment are effective, and neither do international organisations such as Humane Society International and World Wildlife Fund. World Wildlife Fund was extremely disappointed about the outcomes of the regional fishing organisations’ meeting held just last month in Kobe. It was extremely disappointed that they did not go far enough and they did not introduce the measures that are needed to start addressing tuna management around the world. To claim that there is now some sort of international framework in place that will ensure sustainable management of tuna requires a very far stretch of the imagination. There were very, very small steps taken, and no significant steps were taken that will ensure tuna management into the future.
I am extremely disappointed that the coalition and the ALP will not be supporting this disallowance motion. I believe that we need to very seriously rethink how we manage tuna stocks in this country and we have to start now before it is too late. It is very late in the piece that the coalition has acknowledged the impact of climate change and the fact that we have to be managing our water better. We are now in a major water crisis that is resulting in a major environmental crisis for the wetlands throughout the Murray-Darling Basin, and it looks as though we are going to have a ‘minute to midnight’ response when it comes to managing our fish species as well, unfortunately. As I said, I am very disappointed that there is no support for this disallowance motion.

That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.
In rising to take note of answers given today I am going to concentrate on the answers given by Senator Scullion on child care. I say at the outset that we are very mindful of the fact that this was Senator Scullion’s first lot of questions from the opposition, but I am aware that ministers do come into this chamber with a brief for a very important reason. There is a very serious issue that has arisen today in terms of Senator Scullion’s answers. Perhaps after taking note he might want to come back into the chamber and correct the record because the ABS childcare consumer price index figure is actually based on out-of-pocket expenses. According to the ABS:
In summary, benefits available under the CCB—
that is the Commonwealth childcare benefits—
are deducted from the actual child care prices (the gross prices) in measuring the cost recorded in the CPI ...
I think I heard Minister Scullion at least twice today suggest that their difference in childcare costing was much lower because of all the benefits that are provided by this government. He went on to rattle them off. In fact, that is not the case. Those costs are based on all of those benefits being deducted. So it is most unfortunate that in the minister’s first line of questioning from the opposition he sought to mislead the Senate—I notice that question time was broadcast today—and mislead the country. Perhaps there is the need for this minister to be better briefed and to read his briefs.
Essentially, I asked Minister Scullion today if he could just simply answer one question for this chamber—that is, what was the $83.20 a week that the Treasury figures used based on? That is really quite a simple question that I thought he could have given us quite a comprehensive answer on. But the minister has failed to answer that because in fact the Treasury figures are rubbery and incorrect. This government sought to blame parents for the lack of choice, availability and affordability; it is a line that this government has run. They cannot defend their policies and they cannot defend the basis on which their costings are used and they simply blame other people. In this case they blame hardworking parents who simply want to get access to child care that they can pay for.
The truth of the matter is that the out-of-pocket childcare expenses for families have doubled under the Howard government. The ABS consumer price index figure shows that if you took March 1996 as the base, so let us say that is 100, the childcare cost index in our cities has now risen to 201.78. It has more than doubled under the Howard government. Let me reiterate that these figures are calculated on the basis of removing benefits from any government policies, so they actually do not look at the gross prices, they look at the net prices. So Senator Scullion was wrong when he gave us an answer that rolled up all of the benefits. The childcare costs do eat up more and more of a family budget. Even after the Commonwealth childcare benefits are deducted, their out-of-pocket expenses are actually skyrocketing.
This government will say, ‘But we also give a 30 per cent rebate.’ It is actually a tax offset; it is not a rebate. It is not cash that parents ever see in their hands; it is a tax offset at tax time. We know that on last year’s taxation returns parents were claiming for 2003 and 2004, so you have to wait two years to realise any benefit under the childcare tax rebate that this government gives out.
The reality in this country at the moment is that child care is in crisis. I know that in Darwin five-day-a-week long day care is averaging $220 a week. We know that childcare costs eat up about 22 per cent of the average weekly earnings. Not only is it extremely expensive and unaffordable; it is not there. Parents cannot get the childcare places that they want. They are not available. There are not enough of them in this country. Child care is not accessible and not affordable, and the fact that parents simply cannot access child care on days they want it and at a price that is not eating into their family budget does not simply make them too choosy, as this government would want to label them; it actually makes them quite desperate. We often hear that both parents have to work, and they wonder why when most of the salary of one parent is being eaten up in childcare costs. (Time expired)

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2007-02-08,"—I sit behind the new Minister for Community Services and from this angle he has looked pretty good in answering questions during question time today and throughout this week. I think the minister has very adequately placed on the record the tremendous record that this government has with respect to provision of child care in Australia. It is a proud record that I think is not well attacked by a party which neglected child care disgracefully during its 13 years in office. We have doubled the number of places available to Australians in subsidised child care and we have increased the benefits available to Australians to afford child care. Our record demonstrates a growing capacity within the Australian childcare system and a greater capacity by Australians to meet what are of course rising costs in that system.
Let me take first of all the point that Senator Crossin was making about the rising costs. Of course the costs of child care are rising, and there are a number of reasons for that. One is that there has been an acknowledgement that we have not paid childcare workers enough in Australia, and a number of private and public organisations have been taking steps to redress that problem. Another is that there is more pressure on those places because today more Australians are working than ever before and unemployment is lower than ever before and, as a result, more people with young families wanting to go into the workplace also need to access child care. That is why the Australian government has boosted spending on child care so dramatically.
The points that were made by Senator Crossin and others today in question time about the unavailability of child care in particular places are such cheap politics they do not bear thinking about. Of course there will always be mismatches to some degree in any system between where particular places are and where particular need is. Nobody can create a system where those mismatches do not occur from time to time. Child care is not a mobile resource that can be loaded on the back of a truck and shipped to another city or another state at will; it has to be planned for. People need to be certified or accredited to provide those services. We need to ensure that in other respects there are the kinds of services our communities need. Sometimes the places where those services are available are not the places where the actual need occurs.
However, I think the government has done an incredibly good job at lifting the availability of child care in the places where it actually matters. The report from Treasury which was tabled recently demonstrates that average utilisation rates between 2002 and 2004 fell from 88 per cent to 85 per cent, for example, in long day care. What does that suggest? It suggests that in fact there is adequate long day care across the country by virtue of the provision made by the Australian government.
In 2005 only six per cent of parents reported having trouble accessing additional formal child care, and the share of low-income families experiencing difficulties with the cost of care has dropped from 30 per cent to 15 per cent in the years since 2000. That does not tell the story of a system in crisis; it does not tell the story of a system where affordability and accessibility are receding from Australian families. On the contrary, it suggests that the situation, although not perfect, is certainly improving.
I am particularly proud, as I said before—and the minister drew attention to this today in question time—that the Australian government has continued to increase investment in the number of childcare places. The Australian population has not doubled since 1996, but the number of childcare places available to Australians has. That says a great deal about the priorities of this government to ensure that child care is affordable to Australians.
Families earning between $30,000 and $80,000 a year with one child in full-time child care now pay less of their take-home disposable income in child care than they would have done 11 years ago under the Labor Party. That is a fact and is demonstrated very adequately. The fact is that the other figures cited in this place and elsewhere about the affordability of child care omit important information like the value of the childcare benefit and the childcare tax rebate. When those things are taken into account properly—and they are very important in making child care accessible and affordable—it paints a very different picture to that which those in this place have painted today. I am very proud of the government’s record on this matter. (Time expired)

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2007-02-08,"—In rising to take note of answers to questions today I want to go to the issue of rising interest rates and their impact in the Australian community. In the last few days, new figures have been released concerning mortgage repossession figures in New South Wales. These are important figures because they are an indication of the stress that many families are under as a consequence of the higher interest rates that we have seen over the last five years under this Liberal government. In New South Wales, the repossession figures from 2004 through to 2006 have increased by some 75 per cent. I have here the figures since 1990. What is interesting to note is that they were at their lowest over this period in 1994, when there were approximately 1,300. They were stable through until 1998, when they increased to around 2,000, and held steady until the year 2004, when they started to increase significantly.
Why is that the case? Obviously, there is a link between increasing interest rates under the Howard Liberal government and repossession rates. There has been a long-established nexus between the two figures. The reality on the ground in New South Wales—and I am sure that my colleague Senator Hutchins, who lives in Western Sydney, will be able to talk in more detail about this—is that this has a devastating impact on families when rising interest rates force families to sell. They do not just lose their home but have enormous general financial stress placed upon them.
I asked Senator Minchin today for an explanation of this in light of the promise made by the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, at the last election that he would keep interest rates low and that interest rates would not increase under a Liberal government. That was the promise. We heard it time and time again from the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, at the last election. I have asked Senator Minchin about rising interest rates on a number of occasions in the Senate chamber since the last election. What is his defence for the breach of this fundamental promise made by Mr Howard at the last election that the Howard Liberal government would keep interest rates lows? What is his excuse? It is generally a historical comparison with the years of the Labor government. Comparisons can be valid from time to time but, if we are going to reflect on history, we have never yet had an explanation from Senator Minchin about why interest rates reached 22 per cent when the current Prime Minister was last Treasurer. If we want to talk about history, let us not just compare today with the period when Labor was in power but also with the period when Mr Howard was last Treasurer of this country, when interest rates reached a devastating 22 per cent.
But my argument would be this: we are now 10 years on from the Labor government. We know that the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, is a clever politician—he is very sharp and clever. We know that the Prime Minister is very good at pulling out simple themes in order to provide an excuse for things that go wrong on this government’s watch. But 10 years? The government have to take some responsibility for things that go wrong on their watch. It is now 10 years since they were elected, and the government simply will not take responsibility. When things are good, they take all the credit; when something goes wrong, the states are to blame or the old Labor government of 10 years ago is to blame. This is a Prime Minister and a government that are running out of puff and running out of ideas and they will not take responsibility. This is an important area that impacts on families. We have seen four increases in interest rates since the last election and eight in the last five years. That represents a fundamental breach of the promise and commitment Mr Howard gave quite solemnly at the last election that interest rates would remain low under a Liberal government. We have another example of the stress and hurt rising interest rates under this government are causing Australian families in our community. (Time expired)

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2007-02-08,"—I will take the opportunity to start off where Senator Sherry left off—talking about rising interest rates. Under Labor, we had unemployment at record levels and we had interest rates at record levels. As Senator Humphries said, the reason that we have increased demand for child care is because we have so many more people in the workforce because we have created jobs by running the economy efficiently and by reducing the future burden of the children who are now in child care. We paid back $96 billion of Labor’s debt. We are putting money into a Future Fund now to pay for unfunded Commonwealth superannuation to make sure that those children’s futures are secure. What we have done is to increase childcare places. When Labor were in government, they did not have sufficient childcare places and they were appallingly distributed, and there was a large demand for it.
There are still some states that need to lift their games in terms of regulation of the childcare industry. In particular, my home state of Victoria needs to do a lot more than it has done. It has been talking about it for a long while. Let me say that it is not just the Commonwealth government which is responsible for child care. The states can also play a part. Some states have started to look at the possibility, for example, of using state facilities—for example, areas within a state school—to co-locate child care. When I was minister, I constantly called upon the state ministers for planning and the state ministers for education to see where they could assist in child care.
One of the other things that we have heard is Labor crowing from the rooftops about their new education policy for children. Mr Rudd is out there. We saw Mr Latham down in the sandpit with the children; we have seen Mr Rudd. Being in the kindergarten or in the childcare centre always makes a very good photo. But what we find is that some of the states are doing appallingly on kindergarten and the provision of early childhood education, which is the responsibility of the states. For every child who cannot get a kindergarten place, what do we see? We see an increased demand for child care. The Labor states are falling down on the provision of kindergarten for every child of four, with a large percentage of children failing to even get one day of kindergarten. Parents who are working then seek childcare places. Do not put all the blame on the Commonwealth. A large amount of money has gone into child care. We have increased the places. You can talk about money going in, but there are increases in CPI; but when you talk about the actual places you get the real picture.
There were 306,000 early childhood places under Labor. We now have 600,000 places. That is almost double the number. As Senator Humphries said, the number of children being born and needing child care has not doubled. There has not been a doubling in the number of children. We have seen a significant increase—almost a doubling—of the number of childcare places available under Labor. We have seen an escalation in the number of after school hours places. Parents concerned about their older children at school needing before- and after-school care say they want those places uncapped. But Labor has failed to commit to keeping those uncapped places for long day care. Labor has a long way to go in developing a policy. Rabbiting on about early childhood education without putting the pressure on the states to actually do something about it is no sort of policy.
To encourage women to go back into the workforce we have seen increased funding through the JET scheme for mothers undertaking training at, for example, TAFE. There are additional childcare places for them. Again, Labor has failed to talk about that. The Labor Party fails to acknowledge that we have a new childcare management scheme that will ensure up-to-date and accurate information is available on supply and demand and use of child care. As Senator Humphries has already said, there is spare capacity within existing childcare centres at a national level. There are some people who do not want their children to go to particular childcare centres. That is their choice, but they will not always get the sort of child care—for example, community child care—they want where they want it. But there are places.
Only six per cent of parents have reported trouble accessing additional formal child care. I can tell you where they will be: they will be in Lilyfield and Glebe in Sydney and they will be in Port Melbourne in Victoria—areas where you have regentrification of suburbs with high land values. There is a difficulty for childcare providers to find places to build childcare centres. That is why I have said that it would assist if the states could look at places where they could provide centres too. We have seen them in Victoria: there is a kindergarten located at the base of a high-rise development block. There are spaces if states want to put their minds to it as well.
For the Labor Party to come in here and to be critical of child care is just appalling. If you look at their record, Labor failed parents. They failed them on jobs, they failed them on interest rates, they failed them on benefits for families and they failed them on child care. (Time expired)

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2007-02-08,"—I wish to take note in particular of the answer given by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Minchin, to a question put to him by Senator Sherry. Last Friday I had the opportunity to address a seminar put on by retirees concerned about what the future holds for their grandchildren. I was among a number of speakers who addressed the seminar, which had about 40 or 50 people at it. One of the other people who addressed the seminar was Michael Crews, who is an officer of the Exodus Foundation in Sydney. I know Michael and his father quite well. Michael made the point that, from his experience and from facts that he is well aware of, any one of us is only one illness or two pay packets away from poverty. As I said, he gave that address on the basis of his experience with that marvellous foundation. It was with distress that I became aware, as we all did, of the figures released yesterday containing the rise of mortgage repossessions in my state, New South Wales. I want to particularly refer to the area where I live, out in Western Sydney.
One of the real estate agents in Western Sydney, who is on the Reserve Bank board’s liaison network, said that they had reported a 400 per cent increase from the previous year in mortgagee sales. That sounds an astounding figure. I will bring it down and make it clearer. That represents 25 homes in Penrith that were repossessed. That is a 400 per cent increase on the previous year, when six homes were repossessed. In that 12-month period, 18 families had effectively been kicked out. I am sure you and I, Mr Deputy President, are well aware of the distress, the suffering and the pain that is caused by these actions which have occurred. The dislocation of families that inevitably results from what has come about is something that we should all be ashamed of and attempt to do something about.
I was disturbed at the fashion in which the minister answered Senator Sherry’s question. I have always felt that whenever Senator Minchin replies to a question from us he actually attempts to answer it, unlike other ministers. However, today we were beaten up by facts and figures that I felt had no connection to what we were trying to highlight—and that was the fact that families are in distress.
Why are they in distress? Because since 2004 there have been four interest rate rises, I think it is. That is what is happening out in the western suburbs of Sydney. People are being kicked out of their homes. That figure of 25 may not represent many people, but that is a significant increase from the previous year. I am well aware, like many of my other colleagues who live in those areas, that the home prices have been reduced significantly in that 12-month period. I am also aware of other stresses occurring in families as a result of the actions, or inactions, of this federal government. I am disturbed, as I said earlier, at the cold and heartless manner in which Senator Minchin answered Senator Sherry’s question. (Time expired)

STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE IN THE 2007 AUTUMN SITTINGS


AGED CARE AMENDMENT (SECURITY AND PROTECTION) BILL


Purpose of the Bill


The bill amends the Aged Care Act 1997 (the Act) to:

implement new aged care complaints investigation arrangements, including a new Aged Care Commissioner;
introduce the requirement for approved providers of residential aged care to report to the Department of Health and Ageing and the police allegations and incidents of sexual and serious physical assault; and
introduce protection for approved providers and staff in residential aged care that report allegations and incidents of sexual and serious physical assault.

Reasons for Urgency


The amendments to the Act will give effect to the decision made by the government in July 2006 to implement new complaints investigation arrangements for Australian Government-subsidised aged care services, including the establishment of a new Aged Care Commissioner, as well as the introduction of compulsory reporting of alleged incidents of sexual and serious physical assault in residential aged care, and protection for approved providers and staff who report such incidents.


In the Minister for Ageing’s announcement of 27 July 2006, he foreshadowed an implementation date of 1 April 2007 for the aged care complaints investigation arrangements, compulsory reporting and protection measures. In order to meet this implementation date, the bill needs to be introduced and passed in the 2007 Autumn sittings.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2007-02-08,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This is an Auditor-General’s report entitled Audits of the financial statements of Australian government entities for the period ended 30 June 2006. I want to make some brief comments regarding this report. In it the Auditor-General goes through a number of issues, but the one I want to focus on is the qualification of the consolidated financial statements. Yet again we have a qualified audit report in relation to the consolidated financial statements of the government. If this was a company serially offending and continuing to have qualified audits there would certainly be real concern in the marketplace over the fact that a company’s financial statements continue to be the subject of a qualified audit, but the government proceeds without worrying about that.
What is interesting to note is that one of the bases of the qualification of the audit is the misinformation that the government continues to peddle regarding the status of the GST. In fact, one of the bases on which the Auditor-General has qualified his report regarding the consolidated financial statements is the continued inappropriate treatment of GST revenue by the government, misinformation which continues to be repeated by the Treasurer and by members on the other side that the GST is somehow not a Commonwealth tax. They can keep saying it, but it is here in black and white in this report, as it has been for many years now, that that is incorrect and is one of the bases on which the audit report is qualified.

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2007-02-08,"—Australians can be fairly indifferent to politics at times. Indeed, we have a fairly healthy culture of scepticism about authority and our political leaders. But Australians certainly do appreciate having good local members to represent them—someone who is one of them, someone who understands their needs, someone who knows about their area, someone who listens and, above all, someone who is an active participant in their community. Fortunately in each chamber, and on both sides, there are good and engaged local members and senators.
One example in the other place is the current Labor member for Isaacs, Ann Corcoran. She is widely respected as someone who is in touch with local concerns. She lives in the electorate. She is available to listen to her constituents. She is engaged and accessible. Sadly, though, Ann Corcoran was defeated in her preselection last year. Despite this, I can attest that Ann is continuing to work hard for her constituents. My office is not all that far from hers and, at practically every community event I attend in the south-east of Melbourne, Ann is also there. Ann, as many in this chamber would know, was defeated by Mr Mark Dreyfus QC. Despite being heavily defeated in the ballot of local party members, he was installed by the central panel.
Mr Dreyfus’s preselection is interesting in the context of his 1998 report for the Victorian branch of the Labor Party, largely dealing with issues of branch stacking and internal party structures. In that report, Mr Dreyfus stated: ‘Membership makes a party, not the other way around. Labor is, or should be, people—not vehicle, not structure, not hierarchy.’ Yet it was structure and factional hierarchy, not people, that secured Mr Dreyfus’s preselection. He could only gain 44 per cent of the local vote. The only reason Mr Mark Dreyfus QC is the endorsed Labor candidate for Isaacs is because he and his factional friends put their own interests ahead of the wishes of ordinary rank and file local Labor Party members. You cannot have it both ways, although he certainly tries. He went on to say in the same report:
A measure of the party’s self-confidence should be an easing of the discipline, the ‘closed backroom-ness’ that formal factionalism inevitably brings.
I guess Mr Dreyfus was banking on this ‘easing’ of factionalism occurring only after he had managed to secure his preselection.
And that is the truth about Mark Dreyfus QC’s candidacy for Isaacs. I suspect he actually does not have a tremendous interest in representing the constituents of Isaacs or championing local issues. I suspect for Mark Dreyfus the seat of Isaacs is merely a vehicle for him to become Labor’s next Attorney-General. That is really not a reason to seek a seat. A seat in parliament, as all of us in this chamber know, is a profound responsibility. It is not to be taken lightly. It is not something that should be sought without due care and respect. It is not a factional plaything.
Mr Dreyfus QC’s name will be unfamiliar to most Isaacs residents. That is not surprising, given that he lives over 20 kilometres away in Malvern. You may well think that that is okay. He has been preselected now so he will probably move into the electorate or, at the very least, if he wins he will move into the electorate. But Mr Dreyfus has already stated that he has no plans to move to Isaacs, not even if he is elected. I suppose on one level you cannot blame him. He does receive very good representation from the member for Higgins.
Mr Dreyfus told the Age on 7 February last year that ‘the measure of a good MP is not where they live but how hard they work for local people’. I have been very happy to convey that message on behalf of Mr Dreyfus to many of the constituents in Isaacs. I actually think that Mr Dreyfus has a touch of what might be called ‘the Maxines’. Before the last election, senators will remember that Labor attempted to woo Maxine McKew for a federal seat in Sydney’s west. Mark Latham wrote in his diaries that past attempts to install Ms McKew had failed because she ‘couldn’t stand living in Cabramatta or Liverpool’. Mr Latham wrote:
So Maxine wants to be a Labor MP, but can’t stand the sight or smell of Labor voters, hey?
It remains to be seen with the coming election if Ms McKew will be successful beforehand in ousting Julia Irwin in Fowler and if she will deign to move into the electorate.
We have seen this sort of attitude towards representation in Melbourne’s south-east before. It has traditionally been a strong Labor area, but over time it has been somewhat taken for granted. Those votes do seem to be very much taken for granted. Take the state seat of Lyndhurst, which sits within the electorate of Isaacs. It is held by state minister Tim Holding. I like Tim—I like him a lot; he is a nice guy—but Lyndhurst as an electorate is not to his liking for a residence. He prefers to live some 25 kilometres away in East Melbourne. The newly elected member for Narre Warren South, another state electorate close to Isaacs, is Judith Graley—again, someone I like. But I understand that she lived in Mount Martha, over 40 kilometres away. I am not sure if she has since moved into her electorate, but I certainly hope that she has.
If you ever needed convincing that Labor has no regard for constituents and the role of the local member, you need only look at comments made recently about another of Labor’s potential so-called star recruits, Victorian Treasurer John Brumby. Commenting on a purported push by Mr Brumby for a federal seat, Labor member for Bendigo, Steve Gibbons, let slip that some Labor members wished they did not have to bother with actually serving constituents. He said:
“But if he were to become federal Treasurer or Finance Minister or hold another senior position, he does deserve to be welcomed into a seat where he is not having to constantly worry about constituents’ problems.”
Mr Mark Dreyfus QC does seem to be evidencing something of that attitude. Mr Dreyfus owes quite a deal to his friends in the Labor Party. Not only did they help him conspire to dump Ann Corcoran but they have also thrown tens of thousands of taxpayers’ dollars his way. Mr Dreyfus pocketed over $50,000 from the Bracks government for representing them at the hearings into the proposed Mildura toxic waste dump. In the process, Mr Dreyfus betrayed the people of Isaacs. Labor’s plan to put a toxic waste dump in the middle of Victoria’s food bowl was always flawed and was never going to fly. The Bracks government has since abandoned that proposal, but this is extremely bad news for Mr Dreyfus. The Labor plan was to put a toxic waste dump in Victoria’s food bowl, Mildura, and then close the Lyndhurst dump, which is in the federal seat of Isaacs. By pushing the option of a toxic waste dump in Mildura, which was never going to fly, and by failing to look at alternatives, Mr Dreyfus has ensured that toxic waste will continue to be delivered to Lyndhurst, which is in the electorate he seeks to represent.
A recent headline in the Australian newspaper read ‘Toxic dump backflip will hurt star recruit’. I think that could well be the case. The panel report into the Mildura dump identified the need for a nine-kilometre buffer zone between a toxic dump and residences. But over 200,000 people live within nine kilometres of the Lyndhurst dump, many of whom are in Isaacs. Mr Mark Dreyfus QC has failed to respond to this and many other local issues. The local papers have practically given up calling him. No doubt they have the phrase ‘Mr Mark Dreyfus QC could not be contacted for comment’ as a template in their computers, such has been the regularity of their use of that phrase in newspaper articles.
The people of Isaacs deserve better than this. They deserve a local advocate who will stand up and fight for them. I commend to them the candidature of Ross Fox. He is energetic and experienced and he lives in the electorate. He knows the issues and is championing them. He is fighting for closed-circuit TV to tackle crime in Chelsea. He is fighting to have Wells Road fixed. He is seeking a meeting with Premier Bracks to convey residents’ outrage at the broken promise not to close the toxic waste dump at Lyndhurst.
The first test for Mr Dreyfus QC was to move into the electorate. He failed. It is not good enough to say to residents: ‘If you elect me then I’ll start to work for you. If you elect me then I’ll start to champion your causes.’ You have to do it when you are seeking election. You have to earn their trust and earn the privilege of representing them in the parliament. I have met Mr Dreyfus. He seems a thoroughly decent fellow. But he and the Labor Party need to be honest: he is not interested in representation. (Time expired)
