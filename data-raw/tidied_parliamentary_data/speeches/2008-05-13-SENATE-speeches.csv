"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2008-05-13,"—My question is to Senator Faulkner, representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Given the devastating events in Burma which have left over 1.5 million Burmese homeless and resulted in a death toll likely to exceed 100,000, can the minister inform the Senate as to how Australia’s initial commitment of $3 million of funding support was assessed and then the subsequent commitment of $25 million in total was arrived at to assist the victims of Cyclone Nargis? Can the minister also advise whether it is expected that that funding figure will increase?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Burma</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2008-05-13,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for his assurance of the Australian government and community standing by the people of Burma in this tragic situation. Given the significant reports of barriers to the delivery of assistance and aid, can the minister please advise the Senate in the context of his response how AusAID is actually going about ensuring that aid is delivered? What guarantees and assurances do we have that the significant funding that the minister has referred to there is actually meeting its target?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Burma</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2008-05-13,"—I thank Senator Payne for her question about this very tragic circumstance of Cyclone Nargis. Of course, all senators are very deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life and the great deal of suffering and enormous devastation caused by Cyclone Nargis. Of course, Australia and the international community stand by the Burmese people at this time. Reports of casualties are still coming in but it is clear that the toll there will be very high. Burmese official figures put the death toll at over 23,000, with over 37,000 missing, and the number of homeless at around 1½ million, but these figures are almost certainly understated. The cyclone has also caused massive damage to property and vital infrastructure and has disrupted communications.
I can say specifically in response to the questions that Senator Payne asks me that Australia is providing $25 million in humanitarian assistance to the people of Burma following Cyclone Nargis. This consists of the initial $3 million the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced on 7 May plus a further $22 million that was announced on 11 May. Of that $22 million, a total of $12.5 million will be made to the United Nations’ flash appeal. That appeal will help address the most urgent of the life saving needs in Burma. The remaining $12.5 million is being provided directly to international agencies and non-government organisations with the ability to deliver assistance quickly and effectively on the ground in the worst affected areas. Australia’s already extensive involvement on the ground in Burma has made us well placed to deliver this assistance quickly to those in need.
AusAID is ensuring that Australian assistance is reaching affected populations through UN disaster response mechanisms. This assistance is in the form of food, water, water purification, sanitation, health kits and tarpaulins. I can also say to the Senate that, separate from the flash appeal, Australia is one of the largest donors to the UN’s Central Emergency Response Fund. Ten million dollars has been provided in this financial year, and the UN has announced that part of that particular fund will also be used to respond to the needs that have arisen as a result of Cyclone Nargis.
In answer to the other element of Senator Payne’s question—she asked me about further consideration by the government—options for further assistance over the medium to long term do remain under close consideration as UN assessments of the situation in Burma are made.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Burma</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,answer
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2008-05-13,"—There is no doubt, in response to Senator Payne’s supplementary question, that access into Burma for aid workers really remains the greatest challenge in relation to relief efforts for Cyclone Nargis. While the international community is, I think, responding generously to what the immense needs are there, if the Burmese government were prepared to fully open its doors there would be a massive increase in delivery of humanitarian assistance. That would certainly be possible. I think senators would be aware that the Australian government, led by the Prime Minister, have expressed very deep concern and dismay at the attitude of the Burmese regime, and I can assure the Senate that we are using every diplomatic channel available to urge the Burmese regime to allow access for humanitarian assistance to the affected areas.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Burma</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,answer
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2008-05-13,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I note for the record that the minister did not give a commitment that no-one would have to wait longer for public hospital treatment, which is probably just as well given that the Tasmanian health minister said yesterday that she would be expecting even more money, an increase in federal funding, to deal with the likely increase in demand.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2008-05-13,"—When the opposition were in government, they cut a billion from public hospitals and failed to tackle GP shortages. What we will do, and what we said we would do, is keep the Medicare levy surcharge. And we have. We said we would keep the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate, and we will. The Australian Health Insurance Association should show more faith—and perhaps the opposition should show more faith—in the ability of private health policies to meet the needs of consumers. If people are getting value for money, they will stick with the system. In six months in government we have announced $1 billion in extra funding for public hospitals over the next year, beginning to reverse the 11 years of neglect of our public hospital system by the opposition—by the Liberals—and we are providing $600 million to slash elective surgery and waiting lists.

"PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2008-05-13,"—I have further information in response to Senator Allison’s question but I must firstly say that I did say during my answer that it was the Procedure Committee when it was the Appropriations and Staffing Committee, which was my mistake. In March 2008 the Senate Appropriations and Staffing Committee—not the Procedure Committee, as I stated previously—considered the matter of the parliamentary computer network and internet filtering. The committee noted that the parliamentary network computers of departmental staff—that is, for the Department of the Senate, the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of Parliamentary Services, but not for the Parliamentary Library—are filtered for inappropriate internet content, including pornography, illegal drug references, gambling, games, racist or hate sites, violence, illegal weapons of manufacture or procurement, but the computers of senators and members and their staff are not. The committee also noted that the current filtering mechanism is a black list supplied by the vendor but the Department of Parliamentary Services is currently engaged in identifying a replacement filtering system.
Members of the committee expressed the view that senators should not be treated differently from others who use the parliamentary computing network and therefore their computers should be filtered. I note that the Australian Democrats were represented on that committee.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order! I am on my feet. I suggest you look at the standing orders. Having sought further advice from the Department of Parliamentary Services on the filtering system and consulted with the Speaker on the matter, I made the decision that, in accordance with the view of the committee, the same filtering should be applied to senators and their offices. I remind senators that this filtering provides a message to users that the site they are seeking to access has been blocked because it falls within one of the areas on the black list of subject matters used by the software. It is open for any senator or staffer who needs to pursue access to a particular site for work related matters to have that access provided by contacting 2020.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Internet Filtering</title>,Questions Without Notice: Additional Answers,7,1,speech
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2008-05-13,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Human Services (Senator Ludwig) to questions without notice asked today.
Today we have seen what I think could only be described as a reversion to the past by Labor where the decisions that they have been making with respect to health are more about ideology than they are about addressing the real health issues that we have here in this country. They are nothing to do with good policy. In fact, if they had been to do with good policy Labor would have actually used some of the processes that they have put in place to actually implement and study good policy. As Senator Ludwig said, the government has set up the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission, which at this point in time has only had the opportunity to make one interim statement, just one communique. The major report in respect of state and Commonwealth health funding will be in November this year, with a full report in July next year.
What we are seeing now are decisions that will have a significant impact on the delivery of health services in this country being made completely outside that context, with no consultation with industry and no consultation with its own health and hospitals reform commission. You can only wonder whether this particular body is being relegated by this government to being just another voice, as we have seen so many times before.
With respect to consultation with industry, Dr Michael Armitage has said that the Prime Minister used ‘weasel words’ before the election to give the health insurance industry the clear impression that the surcharge would not be changed. The AMA President, Dr Capolingua, has said that this decision by the government will tell Australians that they should drop their health insurance or not take out policies in the first place.
In the late nineties we saw a significant fall in the number of Australians who had private health insurance and at that point in time we were legitimately concerned about the issues that surrounded that, the sustainability of the health system. There was universal concern, so the then government brought in first the 30 per cent rebate and then lifetime cover. That increased the rate of private health insurance from where it was, at close to 30 per cent, to 44 to 45 per cent—a significant change—and it has remained there ever since. It made a real difference.
This tells younger people that they no longer need to stay within the private health system and it potentially provides the scope for a collapse of the system. What we risk with this decision is a return to the downward spiral that we saw in private health insurance during the 1990s, when Labor were, again, part of the decision-making process and had this philosophical opposition to providing private health insurance. The industry itself projects that 400,000 policies will drop out of the system.
We know that families are under stress. We have seen that all around the country. I have spent the last few weeks on the Senate Select Committee on Housing Affordability in Australia. We know that families are under stress and we know that they are looking for ways to support their budgets, but this is not a way to do that because it is going to have detrimental effects at the end of the road. Also, as I have said before, it is not in concert with the overall health strategy that the government has put in place. Why would you be making these decisions completely outside the Health and Hospitals Reform Commission, when its task is to address the overall delivery of health services across the country? It is just ludicrous. The government has even put back its state and Commonwealth healthcare agreements for the funding of hospitals because it wants to wait to get a report from the Health and Hospitals Reform Commission. That is a sensible decision and it is a decision that the opposition supports. Yet here we have two ad hoc decisions that have been made, supposedly in the interests of health policy, that are completely remote from the process.
The government committed to ending the blame game and has put in place a process to deal with it. Yet what it has done is completely ignore that process. It would be legitimate to expect that, having put that process in place, the government would actually go through the process and take note of its work. We note that the government today refused to say that there was any modelling in respect of either of the two decisions it has made— (Time expired)

"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2008-05-13,"—It is a great privilege to be able to participate in this debate on the day that the Rudd Labor government and Treasurer Wayne Swan will deliver the first budget of the Rudd government. It is a budget that will go a long way to address the reckless spending of the former government, reckless spending that has meant that working Australians and their families are in a situation where they are facing interest rate rises—12 interest rate rises in a row—and an inflation rate of 4.2 per cent, and where the cost of living is outpacing their wage increases. Every senator in this place, I am sure, would have heard from their constituents about how difficult it is, if you are on an average wage, to make ends meet. We are looking forward to the budget tonight. For once, after more than a decade of the now opposition being in government, working Australian families will have a budget that addresses their issues.
It was very interesting to hear today the opposition finally taking some interest in healthcare issues. Of course, healthcare issues are always of interest on budget day. The neglect of health care by the opposition when they were in government has meant that the Rudd government now has an opportunity to deal with healthcare issues. The increase in the income levels for the Medicare surcharge will be a very welcome initiative for working Australian families. As we have heard, from 1 July 2008 the thresholds for the Medicare levy surcharge will increase from $50,000 to $100,000 per annum income for singles and from $100,000 to $150,000 for families.
During question time I heard government senators ask opposition senators many times which one of them was going to stand up and say that somebody who earns $51,000 is a high-income earner. Of course they are not. People on those sorts of incomes are desperate for some kind of income relief, particularly when they are attempting to pay interest rate rises. A constituent who is a single-income earner and is about to come off a three-year fixed term interest rate on her mortgage said to me just yesterday that she expects that the increase for her will be in the order of $100 to $150 a week because of the interest rate rises that have occurred in that period. She is desperate as to how she is going to find that money. I can tell you that working Australians like that woman, my constituent, will welcome this initiative to ensure they have more money in their pockets.
The Rudd government have already made numerous commitments to improving the healthcare situations of Australians. The former government failed to address GP shortages and struck more than $1 billion from the hospital system, so the Rudd government are coming from a long way back to try and address those situations, but address them we will. We have already committed some $600 million to reducing waiting lists and elective surgery lists. We have a range of initiatives to try and improve healthcare services for Australians who desperately need them. We made announcements about GP super clinics that have been very well received in areas that are going to get them. We are going to improve funding to our healthcare workforce to provide training to around 24,000 mental health professionals, and we are going to encourage more mental health nurses to stay in the workforce. We have committed to bowel cancer screening for all over 50 years of age as we know that bowel cancer is one of the biggest killers in Australia. The initiatives that we are taking in the healthcare industry are going to be very welcome. I was also surprised to hear the criticism from opposition senators about the Rudd government’s initiative to try and stop binge drinking amongst young people. What a disgraceful response it was from them to criticise an initiative which is intended to ensure that our young people do not become hospital statistics because they have too ready access— (Time expired)

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2008-05-13,"—Today is the moment of truth. It is the moment of truth for Labor and sadly it is a moment of truth for the Australian people, because today is the day when the Australian people will find out that Peter Garrett was right when he said, ‘Once we get in, we’ll just change it all.’ Before the election Labor was desperate to make sure that private health insurance would not become a political issue. It was the time of the ‘me too’ policy approach. We support all of the positive initiatives of the Howard government. We support the 30 per cent health insurance rebate. We support Lifetime Health Cover. The minister today confirmed that Labor did not tell the Australian people before the election that they would be making those changes which are about to be announced in the budget to increase the threshold of the Medicare levy surcharge.
Earlier this year in Senate additional estimates, I was somewhat suspicious in the light of Peter Garrett’s comments as to what the new government’s approach would be to private health insurance because when we last came into government after an extended period of Labor government the Australian health system was totally out of balance. Private health insurance membership levels were down at 33 per cent of the population and they went down to 30 per cent before we were able to turn the ship around. So I thought I would ask some questions. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing was representing the minister for health during Senate estimates. I asked her specifically, ‘Would you be concerned if membership levels started to drop as a proportion of the population?’ She said, ‘Of course we would be.’
I followed on and I went through the series of positive policy initiatives of the Howard government which led to bringing the Australian health system back into balance, and I asked her to confirm the government’s ongoing commitment to those measures specifically in relation to the Medicare levy surcharge. I asked:

Senator CORMANN—The Medicare levy surcharge policy will remain in its current form?

Senator McLucas—Correct.

Senator CORMANN—There is no suggestion to increase the thresholds that you are aware of?

Senator McLucas—Not that I am aware of.
That was not a totally clear answer so I went back to it later. I said:

Senator CORMANN—I would like on the record, though, to get specific information whether there are no plans to change the Medicare levy surcharge from the current levels.

Senator McLucas—We have answered that question.

Senator CORMANN—So no change?

Senator McLucas—That is correct.
So Senator McLucas, representing the Minister for Health and Ageing in Senate estimates earlier this year was very clear when it came to this point. She gave an indication to the Australian people that there would be no change.
But what have we heard today? What have we heard widely canvassed in the media? The Medicare levy surcharge threshold is going to double. That is bad public policy, because that is exactly the sort of policy that will lead us to the disastrous circumstance that we found ourselves in in 1996 when the Australian health system was out of balance. Membership levels will go down, and the minister in one of his answers today actually said, ‘Yes, some people will leave’. He did not tell us how many people. What is the definition of ‘some’? How many people will leave? Minister, you have not answered that question today at all. The minister says: ‘Some people will leave. The membership levels will go down and we all agree.’ This will have a further impact in accelerating future increases to health insurance premiums. People will leave private health insurance. This will put pressure on public hospitals, which are already under pressure—public hospitals that are being mismanaged by Labor state governments across Australia, with people not being able to access the services they need.
If you look at what has happened over the last 10 years with significant increases in the membership levels in the private health insurance system, private hospitals around Australia have taken responsibility for a dramatically increased share of healthcare services necessary to service the Australian people. What is going to happen now? Australians will leave private health insurance because Labor went back on its commitment prior to the last election. This is back to the future stuff. As I have said, the Howard government had to restore the balance in the Australian health system when it got into government. Peter Garrett was right, as I said in my introduction: ‘Once we get in, we’ll change it all.’ Tonight, when the Treasurer puts out the budget, we will all be able to see that that is exactly what will be happening from hereon in.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2008-05-13,"—I have to say that I am not surprised about the opposition opposing the Medicare levy surcharge initiative because the opposition has shown over a long period of time that they are completely out of touch with the community. The Medicare levy surcharge initiative is a welcome relief to working families. They have been unfairly hit by the surcharge. The surcharge has not been adjusted since it was introduced in 1997, so the announcement by the Treasurer tonight will be a welcome one which will see the Medicare levy surcharge threshold rise from $50,000 to $100,000 for a single person and from $100,000 to $150,000 for families.
Mr Deputy President, there has been no increase in the Medicare levy surcharge threshold since 1 July 1997, resulting in an unfair targeting of many families earning average incomes. The revised thresholds will now ensure that the surcharge is applied to those who are high-income earners. If the Liberal opposition think that a wage of $50,000 for a single person is the wage of a wealthy person then it is no wonder the Australian people have lost faith in them. The whole point of the Medicare levy surcharge was to encourage people who could most afford it to take out private health insurance. However, the previous government, as usual, failed to plan for the long term and it did not provide for indexing the threshold. Now we are seeing hardworking Australians being slugged a surcharge that was meant to target high-income earners.
The Labor government initiative will be a welcome relief for many families. I have to concur with my colleague Senator McEwen’s amazement at the Liberal opposition raising the issue of health, because they have a record they should be ashamed of. We have seen a drastic cutting of the health budget over the 11 years the previous government was in power and a failure to tackle the GP shortage. That is in stark contrast to what the Labor government is doing. Since Kevin Rudd and Labor have come to power, two health ministers conferences have been held in the spirit of cooperation that now exists between Canberra and the state and territory governments. Much has been achieved.
The first conference in February concluded with an agreement on the need for immediate reform of the national health and hospital system and the need for public performance reporting. These sentiments reflect what Kevin Rudd has been saying since prior to the election—that the health and hospital system in this country is not working as it should and that there is a pressing need for reform. This is why the Rudd Labor government has made reforming and improving our nation’s health system a national priority. Our government is committed to building a modern health and hospital system, equipped to meet the health challenges of the future, including an ageing population, the rising burden of chronic disease and the ever-increasing costs associated with medical technologies. That is why, prior to the election, the government announced a comprehensive, long-term plan for health reform in this country, including a $2.5 billion commitment to improving health and hospital systems for all Australians. As is the case with many other public resources, hospitals were constantly underfunded and ignored by the Howard government. Now, as a result of 11 years of neglect, the health and hospital system is in desperate need of a complete overhaul.
Before I finish, I would like to take up the point about tax on alcopops. The Labor government makes no apology for this tax, and the federal opposition should be ashamed of its attacks on this initiative. Binge drinking is a community-wide problem that demands a community-wide response. This government is determined to take a strong, comprehensive approach to tackling binge drinking in our community. We know that young people are particularly at risk and we know that alcopops are used to hook them on drinking when they are young. (Time expired)

"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2008-05-13,"—I rise to take note of the motion moved by Senator Colbeck. What is on the agenda? Tonight’s budget will double the income threshold for the Medicare surcharge from $50,000 to $100,000 for singles and from $100,000 to $150,000 for couples. This again proves that Labor is still ideologically uncomfortable with the private sector and has a heavy preference for the public system. What are the consequences for the taxpayers? The Rudd government is trumpeting that it has saved 2.4 million people from paying a Medicare surcharge. In fact, only 465,000 people have paid the surcharge and each one of them could have avoided it by taking out private health insurance.
A large number of sick people are already waiting unacceptable hours in public hospital emergency departments. People, especially our elderly, are waiting months for elective surgery. With the Rudd government changes to Medicare, they will now have to wait even longer. With the ludicrous threshold increases for singles, younger people will avoid taking out private health insurance. After all the work that has been done to encourage them to take out private health insurance, once again, they will abandon it and more pressure will be placed on public hospitals. This will force up premiums for those people who stay in private funds. Older Australians will also be affected due to these changes and possibly will not be able to continue to choose their level of private health cover which, at their age, is very important. For the two million uninsured people, there will be a tax break of up to $20 a week, straight into their pockets, but no further encouragement for them to get private health insurance.
The Australian Health Insurance Association expects that 400,000 young Australians will drop out of private health insurance. In today’s press, doctors and insurers warned that, as a consequence of this government’s changes, public hospital waiting lists will blow out as hundreds and thousands of young Australians ditch their private health insurance. Dr Michael Armitage, Chief Executive of the Australian Health Insurance Association, is convinced:
If people choose not to remain privately insured—and our modelling—
at least the Health Insurance Association could do some modelling but, unfortunately, the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing today could not answer my question concerning the modelling of the Rudd Labor government—
shows that up to 400,000 people will not do so—
that is, continue in private health—
they will rely on the public system, which means the states will need to badger the Federal Government for more revenue.
The consequences for the states are quite amazing. Health ministers from WA, Queensland and Tasmania have already called for compensation from the Commonwealth if these changes are to be introduced. In the West Australian this morning, Dr Rosanna Capolingua, who is the national President of the Australian Medical Association, said:
You’d have to wonder if you’re setting up the states to fail as far as them being able to deliver across the public health care sector.
Professor Geoffrey Dobb, WA President of the Australian Medical Association, said the changes would cause elective surgery waiting lists to blow out and private health cover premiums to skyrocket. Unless the federal government is ready to provide extra funding to support Western Australia’s hospitals, they will be under siege if thousands of patients opt out of the private health system to be treated under the public system. I am a former member of the metropolitan hospital board, and we put into the system the Central Wait List Bureau. It was quite amazing, in the four years that that board existed, just how well we did with trying to get through the waiting lists. But, unfortunately, because of the hidden costs, there is a need for an interim long-term health reform plan to be put in place by the end of this year.
I just do not think this has helped the health system. In my home state of Western Australia it is going to be very difficult, and I am speaking about those rural Western Australians who have taken out private health insurance and are hoping that somehow they will be able to use it. It looks as if most of them will be forced to go back to the public system. (Time expired)

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2008-05-13,"—I seek leave to make a statement relating to the Lobbying Code of Conduct and Register of Lobbyists.
Leave granted.
—On 6 December 2007, when the Prime Minister released the ‘Standards of Ministerial Ethics’, he confirmed that the government would establish a Register of Lobbyists. The government is now delivering on that commitment.
Today, I am tabling the Lobbying Code of Conduct and announcing the establishment of the Register of Lobbyists.
The government recognises that lobbying is a legitimate activity and part of the democratic process. Lobbyists can help individuals and organisations communicate their views on matters of public interest to the government and, in doing so, improve outcomes for the individual and community as a whole.
However, there is a legitimate concern that ministers, their staff and officials who are the target of lobbying activities are not always fully informed as to the identity of the people who have engaged a lobbyist to speak on their behalf. The government believes that this information can be fundamental to the integrity of its decisions and should be freely available to those who are lobbied and to the wider public.
The public is also right to be concerned about politicians and others who leave office and immediately begin a career lobbying their former colleagues using contacts they developed and information they obtained while in office.
Respect for the institutions of government depends to a large extent on public confidence in the integrity of ministers, their staff and senior officials.
The Lobbying Code of Conduct is intended to promote trust in the integrity of government processes and ensure that contacts between lobbyists and government representatives are conducted in accordance with public expectations of transparency, integrity and honesty.
The Standards of Ministerial Ethics prohibit, for a period of 18 months, former ministers having business dealings with government representatives on matters with which they had official dealings as minister. The combination of these standards and the lobbying code, means the public can be confident that ministers will not be able to use the experience and contacts they have gained in office to enhance their value to the private sector, either as lobbyists or as senior executives in business with the government.
The code requires a 12-month cooling off period for ministerial staff, senior public servants or defence personnel who have resigned or retired, who may want to work as lobbyists. They are prohibited from engaging in lobbying activities with government for a year in relation to any matter that they had official dealings with in the last year of their employment.
Honourable senators may be aware that I released an exposure draft of the Lobbying Code of Conduct for public comment on 2 April 2008. Twenty-eight submissions were received from companies involved in lobbying as well as from members of the public, and I thank all who put thought and effort into ways of enhancing the code. Suggestions have been taken into account and a number of changes have been made to the exposure draft of the code as a result.
As I have said, lobbying is a legitimate part of the democratic process.  The revised code represents an appropriate balance, I believe, between the right of ministers, officials and the public to know who stands to benefit from the efforts of lobbyists, and the ability of business to be able to make views known to government. It will not impose unreasonable demands on the lobbying industry, business or ministers and officials.
Although there was a lobbyists register in place from 1984 to 1996, it was not a public register, and did not include a code of conduct to regulate lobbying practice. The new Lobbying Code of Conduct and Register brings our integrity checks on third-party lobbyists up to international standards. The European Parliament is moving to establish a mandatory public register of lobbyists and a code of conduct. Canada and the United States also have registers.
The Lobbying Code of Conduct will apply to third-party or consultant lobbyists—that is, those lobbyists who represent third parties including lawyers, accountants and business advisers who are employed in government relations roles in professional services firms, and professionals such as lawyers who may lobby on a regular basis.
It does not apply to government relations staff employed in major companies or peak industry organisations as the very nature of their employment means that it will be clear to ministers and others whose interests they will be representing.
The objective of the code is not to make every company whose staff or executives visit a minister sign a register; rather, it is to ensure ministers and other government representatives know whose interests are being represented by lobbyists before them and to enshrine a code of principles and conduct for the professional lobbying industry.
There are a number of other exemptions to the code. For example, it will not apply to individuals who make representations to the government on behalf of family members or friends. It will not include statements made in a public forum or to foreign trade delegations visiting Australia or to registered tax agents, customs brokers and other persons who are registered under an Australian government scheme regulating members of that profession, provided that their dealings with government are part of the normal day-to-day work of people in that profession.
These are sensible exclusions that will ensure that the register does not impede day-to-day communications with government.
The code makes clear this government’s determination that, from 1 July 2008, ministers, parliamentary secretaries, ministerial staff and other government representatives do not grant access to lobbyists who are not on the register. Transparency will be further enhanced by requiring registered lobbyists who wish to make representations to ministers or their staff to declare who they are acting for and the nature of the matter that they wish to discuss before access is granted. This is the key strength of both the register and the code.
Through these requirements, the Register of Lobbyists will allow ministers and their staff to know who is engaged in lobbying and whose interests are being promoted. It is aimed at ensuring openness, transparency and accountability in government, rather than control.
And let us be clear—registration will not give automatic access to ministers, their staff and officials but, for those who are properly registered, the register will not impede free and open access to government.
The Register of Lobbyists will, for the first time, be available for public inspection. It will be administered by the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Lobbyists will be required to update their details as soon as practicable in the event of any changes and confirm that they are up to date on a quarterly basis, failing which their registration will lapse. The department has undertaken to update the information on the register on a same-day basis in the event that a lobbyist needs to make urgent representations to government on behalf of a new client.
Lobbyists will also need to comply with the principles of engagement with government representatives set out in the Lobbying Code of Conduct. These principles describe a standard of conduct for lobbyists that will encourage a culture of ethical behaviour and integrity in their activities. Lobbyists who do not comply with the principles will be removed from the register.
To reinforce the importance that the government attaches to the need for lobbyists to be persons in whose integrity ministers and other government representatives can have confidence, any person who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of longer than 30 months or who has been convicted as an adult of an offence involving dishonesty in the last 10 years will be refused registration. Lobbyists will need to provide statutory declarations to the secretary of the Prime Minister’s department confirming these matters before they are registered.
In addition, the Cabinet Secretary will be able to direct the secretary of the Prime Minister’s department to refuse to register an individual as a lobbyist, or remove an individual from the register. I expect that this power will only be used in exceptional circumstances.
A number of the submissions that were received in response to the exposure draft suggested that the power to remove lobbyists from the register, or refuse them registration, should be exercised only after the individual concerned had been given an opportunity to be heard. While that was always intended, the government has now included a clear statement to that effect in the revised code.
A further change as a result of the consultation process relates to the problem of lobbyists publicly disclosing a relationship with a client on the register which might result in market speculation about a pending transaction involving the client, when that transaction had not previously been disclosed by the client, or body corporate, in accordance with its continuous disclosure obligations under chapter 6CA of the Corporations Act 2001.
While the code will require the lobbyist to advise the minister of their client on a confidential basis in advance of any lobbying activity, the lobbyist will be required to include the client on the register as soon as the sensitivity has passed—otherwise the code of conduct will have been breached.
The registration requirements will apply from 1 July 2008. From that date, lobbyists must be on the register if they wish to make representations to government on behalf of their clients. In the meantime lobbyists can apply to the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to be included on the register. Further information about the process for applying for registration should be available later today on the department’s website.
The registration of lobbyists should be seen as part of the government’s determination to restore respect for the institutions of government and improved governance across the public sector.
To that end, the Public Service Commissioner and the Chief of the Defence Force have decided that the Lobbying Code of Conduct should also apply to the Australian Public Service and the Australian Defence Force. I understand that they will shortly be issuing guidance to the Australian Public Service and the Australian Defence Force on lobbying activities as they relate to members of the APS and the ADF.
The Prime Minister promised from day one of this government that a code of conduct for lobbyists would be part of the transparency and integrity provisions being established by the Rudd government. It was flagged in the ‘Standards of Ministerial Ethics’, along with the provisions which prevent ministers from working in their field of cabinet knowledge for 18 months after leaving office.
I am pleased to say that today we have another integrity provision in place to help restore public confidence in government and governance.
I table a copy of the statement I have just made, together with a copy of the Lobbying Code of Conduct, and seek leave to move a motion in relation to the documents.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the documents.
—Before I call any senators, I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that, under standing order 169(2), the time limit on this debate is 30 minutes.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Lobbying Code of Conduct and Register of Lobbyists</title>,Ministerial Statements,10,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-05-13,"—While the Greens welcome the Register of Lobbyists and the Lobbying Code of Conduct, this is way short of what is required to protect the interests of the public and the interests of democracy in our country in an age when vested interests put enormous pressure onto the elected representatives of office and, in particular, onto parliaments.
I give the example of the Sydney Morning Herald article on Saturday which mooted the line-up of coal industry executives who are currently lobbying the minister for matters related to climate change, Senator Penny Wong. The fact is that there is an open door to the coal industry but there is not an open door to community interests who may be affected by government policy when it comes to the huge range of climate change issues. I think there should be much greater openness about that, and maybe this will open the door.
I point to a question that I put to Senator Wong in estimates. I asked: ‘Since the election, on which occasions has the minister met representatives of the coal industry and what was discussed?’ I got the answer: ‘The minister is determined to meet as many individuals as possible, both formally and informally, in her portfolio. Generally meetings have been either held with the expectation of confidentiality or on the public record.’ In other words, ‘I am not going to tell you.’ I will be interested to see what a non-legislated Register of Lobbyists and a non-legislated Lobbying Code of Conduct will do about that.
The problem with Senator Faulkner’s proposals, firstly, is that they are not legislated; they ought to be. Secondly, they apply to ministers and perhaps, in some other circumstances, backbenchers of the government, though that is not clear, rather than to all members of parliament. Thirdly, they apply to some lobbyists but not all lobbyists. The minister has just given the example of public relations groups. The coal industry, the logging industry and the mining industry come to the fore with their big edifices here in Canberra, working as public relations officers—a prodigious lobby, unseen by the public in this place—with presumably a loophole a mile wide to escape the requirements that otherwise might ensure that everybody knows when they see ministers and when they do not and whether they are complying with the code of conduct.
This code should be legislated. This code should apply to all members of parliament. This code should apply to all lobbyists who see members of parliament. Let me give another big loophole. We are moving into a new balance of power situation in the Senate. All parties will be able to contribute to the balance of power. Not just the crossbench but all members of the opposition will hold the balance of power in given circumstances. I know from previously being in the position that, when it comes down to one or two people making a decision, the big end of town will be queuing up immediately to lobby them. Are Senator Fielding or Senator elect Xenophon, when he enters the Senate after 1 July, or indeed any of the five Greens, going to be under the purview of the register and the Lobbying Code of Conduct? No, they are not. We ought to be, and so should the lobbyists who come to see us. I would want to know that this Lobbying Code of Conduct applies not just in this parliament and in our electoral offices but at business lunches, fundraising dinners and everywhere where politicians are approached by lobbyists because of a sectional interest that they want to pursue.
We are here for all the people all of the time and the least we can do is let all the people all of the time know who is seeing us, what their case is and whether they have been successful. Let us be straight about it. There are thousands of lobbyists in all the great democracies. I understand there are 80,000 in Washington. They pervert and corrupt the democratic system because they get opportunities that the rest of the citizens do not. If we believe in a democracy of one person, one vote, one value, we have to go much further than this code of conduct and this register in correcting that imbalance. Senator Faulkner is quite right in that we have to hear from industries, from non-government organisations, from unions and from individuals. We are here in a representative democracy. All of us know that there are powerful interests at work which have huge sway on the body politic which the average citizen suspects but does not know about. And they change outcomes in parliaments. We ought to know about that. All of us who are involved in making decisions ought to be prepared to be totally transparent about those lobbyists who come to see us. This register and this code of conduct go nowhere near satisfying complete transparency of the forceful powers that come to sway not just on government but on all members of parliament and, indeed, as Senator Faulkner said, on the bureaucracy. There is a long way to go here.
I call on the government to legislate this code and this register; otherwise you leave it to the good people to do the right thing and to the crooks, the villains and those who want to get an advantage in the night to slide around the side. If you have not had an approach from somebody wanting an advantage and offering one in return, you have not been in this place very long. We have a long way to go beyond this. It is a very meek, tremulous and unsatisfactory start to really throwing open the power of lobbyists and the perversion that can occur in the political system—and did occur under the last government—being manifest. It is something we should go a lot further towards correcting. I congratulate Senator Faulkner for raising the issue onto the public agenda. I know it has been brought before the Senate on budget day. We have a long, long way to go before we satisfactorily ensure that the public is given total transparency when it comes to lobbyists, who are there either to represent them or to gain an advantage against their interests in the parliamentary system.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Lobbying Code of Conduct and Register of Lobbyists</title>,Ministerial Statements,10,1,speech
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2008-05-13,"—While the opposition broadly support the thrust of both the Lobbying Code of Conduct and the register of interests, we are deeply cynical about both the stated reasons for the code and the timing of its release today. I would like to make some general comments about the code and then get to the code specifically. The Lobbying Code of Conduct released today by the government will not stop the Brian Burkes of this world or other Labor identities from breaking the rules. Labor broke the old rules and Labor will break these new rules. The bottom line is this code will not stop the sorts of problems we have seen arise with former Western Australian Premier Brian Burke or the types of abuses we have read about in the media regarding Labor Party figures and the Wollongong council sex and bribe scandal. Let us not forget that we are only having this debate today for one reason: a string of problems involving Labor identities turned lobbyists who have overstepped the mark in their dealings with both local Labor councillors and state and federal Labor MPs.
I would now like to turn to the code. This code, like the draft, still gives the cabinet secretary unfettered power under section 10.3 to exercise absolute discretion to not register or remove a lobbyist from the register. The minister now defends this by saying that he expects ‘this power will be used in exceptional circumstances only’. Giving yourself complete and unaccountable power with the caveat that you do not expect to use it very much is to use words that should fill everyone involved in this matter with both fear and trepidation. It is still a case of all roads leading to the Special Minister of State and Prime Minister Rudd.
The Rudd government has somewhat addressed the lack of recourse for those who are struck off or denied joining the register but only after the issue was exposed by the opposition. The process by which the cabinet secretary contacts a lobbyist or individual and discusses a potential breach is done in secret. Our question is: where is the accountability in that change?
Also of great concern to the coalition is that this code does not even once mention unions. Unions are not only aggressive campaigners in federal elections but also the most aggressive lobbyists in politics. Their power and influence over Labor governments is not just confined to visitations in ministerial offices. Last Australia Day, representatives of the MUA enjoyed the hospitality of the Prime Minister at the Lodge. Who knows what was discussed and what was agreed. There certainly would not have been any minutes kept of the discussions that day.
In this code, unions come under part (f) of the description of ‘lobbyist’ in section 3 and, remarkably, are therefore exempted from this code. Everyone agrees that unions have the right to put their case forward on policy issues and be walking the corridors of Parliament House, but this exemption for unions, combined with the tens of millions of dollars they donate to the Labor Party, raises serious questions about how effective this code will be in the real world. The omission of unions from this code is breathtaking but, despite this flaw being pointed out by the coalition to Prime Minister Rudd, he has chosen to ignore this advice and persisted with giving unions special privileges. The community will quite rightly ask the rhetorical question: ‘Why are unions being given special privileges in this matter?’ If this code is to have any credibility it simply must deal with the issue of lobbying by union officials.
Like the draft code, this code provides no penalties for government representatives who breach the code. It also still fails to account for the realities of government. What constitutes an oral communication under section 3? Does a chance meeting at the Parliament House coffee shop ‘Aussie’s’ fall under this definition? What happens if a lobbyist has a chance conversation with a ministerial staffer out of sitting hours who is unaware of their engagement as a lobbyist? The provisions of this code certainly will not stop the sort of clandestine meetings we have read about in the media involving the likes of Brian Burke or the types of activities of those Labor figures on the Wollongong Council.
This code, like its predecessor draft, does not properly deal with conflicts of interest or even mention the conflicts relating to spouses or close relatives. While I am sure it is not its intention, in practical terms this code may exempt Prime Minister Rudd’s chief of staff, whose wife is a senior lobbyist. Another practical flaw with this code which may lead to ministerial personnel problems down the track is the prohibition on ministerial staffers taking jobs in the private sector in an area in which they had official dealings. There is no definition of ‘official dealings’. Who makes that decision? Is it the Prime Minister? Is it the Special Minister of State?
While the provision of section 7.1 for former ministers appears reasonable, the prohibition under section 7.2 affecting current Labor ministerial staffers does not appear to take into account situations where they may lose their jobs under reshuffles or the like. In practical terms, this provision appears to be totally unfair. To take a practical example, what happens in a situation where, hypothetically, Treasurer Wayne Swan loses the Treasury portfolio in a reshuffle? What happens to his economic advisers? Under this code there are restrictions on what future jobs they can take. Surely this is a disincentive for potential budding ministerial staffers to enter the political fray. This provision can only have long-term consequences for the quality of staff that ministers can recruit.
Another flaw in this code is that, by exempting companies who lobby directly, there is nothing to stop the Brian Burkes of this world working as employees for a company part-time. It exempts companies who put a former politician on their board of directors for lobbying purposes. It encourages companies to hide their lobbying activities by doing it directly—that is, outside the code—and it discourages an open and transparent understanding of lobbying.
The register requires lobbyists to list all the clients they are lobbying on behalf of. Some would say that is fair enough. But what happens in the circumstances where the Hawker Brittons of this world are in Prime Minister Rudd’s office for a political and strategy briefing and they happen to mention one of their clients or an issue affecting one of their clients? The code does not cover that situation.
I am pleased that Senator Faulkner took on board the coalition’s concerns about the draft code effectively giving Labor law firms a special deal. As the coalition argued on the day the draft was released, by giving lawyers a special exemption we would be moving towards the American model, where most lobbyists are registered as law firms, gaining their clients special lawyer-client legal privilege. Fortunately the coalition was successful in forcing that change.
Finally and importantly, why is this very important debate occurring just hours before the Prime Minister’s first budget? Here is a new government, where Prime Minister Rudd cynically talks about openness, accountability and transparency, and they are dropping this controversial code in the afternoon before the budget so that it gets lost in tomorrow’s newspapers. It is a tactic classically out of an episode of the West Wing. The fact is the Prime Minister wants this debate, which is essentially about the cultural problems of the Labor Party, to be buried under an avalanche of media reports about the budget. It may be a smart short-term political tactic but it has all the characteristics of a government that, in its infancy, is already successfully avoiding accountability. There is no justification, as Senator Bob Brown said, for this matter to be raised today. This is an issue that should not be lost in tomorrow’s budget papers. This is an issue that deserved greater transparency, greater discussion and the ability for the media to be commenting on this matter. They will not comment on this because they will be commenting on the budget. This is not openness. This is not transparency. As I said earlier, we broadly support the thrust of this; we are deeply cynical about both its rationale and the timing of its release.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Lobbying Code of Conduct and Register of Lobbyists</title>,Ministerial Statements,10,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-05-13,"—I am going to start with two notes of congratulation. The first is because, for a change—because it has been put aside as a form of courtesy—we have a ministerial statement to which we can actually apply a debate. It had become the practice under the previous government to drop them into the Senate with no debate, so I am glad to see a return to proper Senate consideration of a ministerial statement. Attached to that note of congratulation is of course a congratulation to the government for having put out an exposure draft two months ago, and for there being adequate time for both the media and politicians to examine this and to come forward with their final conclusion at the earliest opportunity, which is the first sitting day of the new session. I thought the previous criticism outlined was both ungracious and inaccurate.
My second note of congratulation is for the introduction of the code itself. This is an advance in accountability and integrity. This is a movement forward. It is a bit like people criticising a situation where there has been no house and a house has then been built which has not got two bathrooms, only one, and has got only one bedroom and should have two. We have got a house; now let’s build on it. That is going to be the thrust of my remarks. I welcome and I am pleased with the initiative of the government. I want to say to you: it is inadequate and it needs further additions.
When I and my party have looked at the business of lobbying and the question of how a lobbying register should be set up, we have had to address the same fundamental questions which I am sure the minister has addressed. In viewing these questions, the great thing the minister has been able to do is to overcome the natural inertia—in fact the very considerable forces that are always against these sorts of moves. It is no accident that in the previous government they did absolutely zip on this, because the powers that were opposed to a lobbyist register were very strong indeed, despite there being members within the Liberal Party who would certainly have thought it a good idea.
The basic questions you need to cover when you are dealing with something like a lobbyists register are, firstly, who should be on it, how the applications should be made, how decisions as to who should be on it are made and whether there is review of decisions. Secondly, there is the question of how it should be administered and whether that is independent or in house. Thirdly is the question of who should be affected by a lobbying register and, fourthly, what should be the means for enforcement and discipline?
Going to the third question of who should be affected by it, obviously this register covers cabinet ministers, junior ministers and parliamentary secretaries, but there is the question of caucus committee chairs and members of those caucus committees, there is the question of Senate and House committee chairs and their members, and there is the question of members and senators themselves and, as Senator Bob Brown rightly said, particularly with respect to senators who may hold the balance of power on particular issues before the Senate. There is the question of who in the public sector should be covered by it, whether it is those covered by the Financial Management and Accountability Act or the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act, and there is the question of whether the register should apply not just to the Commonwealth but to all states and territories. The basic issue of lobbyists is the same whether you are in the Commonwealth or in the states or territories.
When we think about those who lobby, sometimes those who get the most flak for being basically creatures for hire are those who lobby for anyone—in other words, they are firms whose business is lobbying. But they are no different to accountants or lawyers who accept a fee for service. In that sense, they are a business for hire. The second group are those who lobby for a specific sector or group. There are organisations representing for-profits—peak organisations such as those who lobby for miners or farmers or those sorts of people who are making a profit. There are lobby groups who lobby for specific not-for-profit sections of the community such as unions or clubs. There are lobby groups who represent churches, religions or sects.
There are those who lobby for their own corporation or entity, whether for profit or not for profit—that would be people like Telstra or big not-for-profit organisations such as, say, the Catholic health body. There are those who lobby on their own account as individuals—they have a specific problem with a specific law—and those who lobby in the public interest who have no self-interest but are attached to causes such as environmental groups or civil liberties groups.
The criticisms that surround the register that we have been presented with cover many fields. They cover the fields of independence, they cover the fields of enforceability and they cover the fields of exemption. The Australian Democrats have recognised that this is a complex and difficult issue and it is one on which we need the Senate to form a consensus and push the government for a better standard. We do not simply need to hear the sorts of criticisms without solutions that some might offer. Consequently, I have today put down in the Senate a notice of motion, a signed version of which I have submitted, which asks that the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration inquire into and report on this lobbying code of conduct by the first sitting Thursday of August 2008. I should note that, when I put it down, I had an exposure draft before me and it was titled ‘Exposure Draft’. But that of course is now replaced by the documents before us.
I have asked that the committee examine the code of conduct issued by the government and whether the proposed code of conduct is adequate to achieve its aims—in particular, (a) whether a consolidated code applying to members of both houses of the parliament and their staff as well as to ministers and their staff should be adopted by a joint resolution of the two houses; (b) whether the code should be confined to organisations representing clients or should be extended to organisations which will lobby on their own behalf; (c) whether the proposed exemptions are justified; and (d) any other relevant matters. Frankly, I am open to having those terms of reference changed, improved, except for the one which says ‘any other relevant matters’, because I do not want it to be narrowly confined. Having given the minister a lead that he may propose additions to the terms of reference if he wants to accept the notice of motion, I am happy to do that.
In concluding my remarks, I say let us be clear that this is a very significant milestone—a very significant advance. The minister and the government should be congratulated on it, but the Senate should do its work to improve and add to what we have been offered to make us a leader in the world, not just a follower, with respect to this issue.

That the Senate records its deep regret at the death of Lance Corporal Jason Marks while on a combat operation in Afghanistan andplaces on record its appreciation of his service to his country and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
On behalf of the Australian government and members of the Senate, I extend my deepest condolences to Lance Corporal Marks’s wife, Cassandra, their two children, Connor and Ella, and his parents, Paul and Sharon. Lance Corporal Marks was a loving father, husband and son. He was also highly respected by his peers and renowned for his dedication and his enthusiasm for his job. He had a distinguished career in the Army, rising to the position of Commando in the 4th Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment. He deployed to East Timor and Afghanistan on more than one occasion. He received numerous service medals and was awarded a Unit Citation for Gallantry in 2006.
The sad death of Lance Corporal Marks gives us pause to reflect on the extraordinary strength of character and courage that all our service men and women display. In particular, our soldiers deployed to Afghanistan are making a significant contribution to the region. They are working with coalition partners and the government of Afghanistan to rebuild the country and provide security for its people.
Just over two weeks ago, on Anzac Day, the nation reflected on the Australian traditions of courage and of fighting for freedom and the common good. These traditions are part of who we are as a nation, but tragedies such as this remind us that they come at a terrible cost. As the Prime Minister reminded us a few weeks ago, our commitment to Afghanistan will come at a very high cost. Our successful operations in Iraq, where we suffered a very low level of casualties, created a false sense in the minds of the Australian public of the risks faced by Australian personnel deployed in active combat zones. What we have learnt in Afghanistan is the reality of our commitment to combat and the real costs that our soldiers and other service personnel pay.
The Rudd Labor government and, I think, all members of the Senate take our responsibilities very seriously when we take a decision to send our service personnel into harm’s way by committing them to combat activity. We all carry a heavy burden when we see the cost of our decisions to commit our troops on behalf of Australia. Lance Corporal Marks made a significant contribution to the national interest and to securing peace and nation building in East Timor and Afghanistan. Lance Corporal Marks lost his life serving his nation with courage and honour, and his sacrifice will not be forgotten.

We note and record that Corporal Marks was a loyal and dedicated member of the Australian Defence Force. We on the coalition side join with the government in expressing our sincere condolences to Lance Corporal Marks’s wife, Cassandra, and their children, friends and family for this very sad and tragic loss.

Regardless of people’s views about the merits or otherwise of particular conflicts, we should always ensure that does not spill across into any loss of support for the importance of the role our armed forces play. I would also, as always, emphasise that needs to include continuing to support their families—those that can also pay a price. In this incident, of course, the family—the children and spouse of this soldier killed in action—should not be forgotten.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2008-05-13,"—I table a statement by the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Mr Albanese, and I seek leave to incorporate the statement in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
Today I am announcing one of the Australian government’s initiatives to help drive economic prosperity in regional Australia and deliver on our commitments that we made in the lead-up to the election.
One of our key regional election commitments was that area consultative committees (ACCs) would provide the basis for the creation of Regional Development Australia (RDA).
Consistent with this commitment, today the government announces that area consultative committees will transition to become local Regional Development Australia committees. As a first step, the ACC Chairs Reference Group will become the RDA Interim Board until 31 December 2008. I have spoken to the chair of that reference group today and he has very much welcomed this announcement, as have the ACC representatives who are here in the parliament for this debate.
The Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and Northern Australia, Gary Gray, and I will convene a meeting with the interim board to discuss the transition of the ACC network to RDA, including the development of a charter for Regional Development Australia and its proposed responsibilities. We shall also want to discuss with the interim board ways of ensuring closer ties with the local government sector. Regional Australia’s communities and economy will benefit from a closer relationship between the new Regional Development Australia and the local government sector.
The ACC network was established by the previous Labor government in 1994 under the Employment Services Act 1994. ACCs originally provided advice and generated support for labour market programs. Over time their role has evolved and recently their primary role has been to promote and identify projects and assist in the development of applications for the Regional Partnerships program.
There are 54 ACCs across Australia, which are not-for-profit, community based organisations. Hundreds of Australians give their time to serve their communities as members of area consultative committees. Only the chairs and their deputies are appointed by the government. Committee members are volunteers from all walks of life: businesspeople, farmers, retirees, local government representatives and educators. They are united by their commitment to their local communities. They are a valuable source of local knowledge and advice for government. Some have been more effective than others and there is a need to recognise that regional development requires a reform of existing advisory structures.
The new Regional Development Australia network will build on the success of its predecessor, but will take on a much broader role to develop strategic input into national programs to improve the coordination of regional development initiatives and to ensure that there is effective engagement with local communities. The Rudd government is committed to listening to communities and the Regional Development Australia organisations will assist that process.
The actual roles and responsibilities of Regional Development Australia will reflect our consultations. I am confident that the interim board will have ideas to present to the government. The role of individual RDAs and the network as a whole could provide advice to government on a range of issues. These include:
advise on community infrastructure;
advise on regional issues and opportunities;
advise on local implementation of specific Commonwealth initiatives in the region, as requested;
facilitate economic development planning and investment attraction;
identify any unique local attributes that would favour the development of new and innovative industries;
promote initiatives to retain and expand skills and local businesses and industries;
disseminate information about Commonwealth programs;
undertake ad hoc consultations on behalf of federal agencies where a regional network is required;
advise on adequacy of service delivery in regions;
build networks and relationships with other levels of government and key stakeholders in the region;
advise government on social inclusion issues; and
advise on ways to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and coordination of Commonwealth regional initiatives.
I am looking forward to working with Regional Development Australia and receiving valuable advice on the development needs of regional Australia. The time frame will of course conclude this year, which is why we are maintaining the existing interim board, and I am pleased the chair has committed to active participation in this.
To conclude, this government’s new vision for regional Australia is based on building partnerships to ensure the government is responsive to local priorities and needs, but is underpinned by major new investments in the areas of infrastructure, broadband, housing, health care, education, skills development, innovation and water.
The message to regional communities is clear—this government will work with you to make your solutions work. We will bring fresh ideas and a new approach which will harness the potential of our regions and develop them for a better future.
Today’s announcement relating to the establishment of Regional Development Australia is the first in a number of initiatives of the Rudd Labor government that we will make in terms of regional development.
We will strengthen and invest in the future of regional Australia.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Regional Development Australia</title>,Ministerial Statements,13,1,speech

That the Senate take note of the document.
I rise to make some comments in regard to the ministerial statement on Regional Development Australia. I take this opportunity to thank the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government for recognising regional Australia through his statement. I am particularly pleased the government will be continuing with the process of the area consultative committee network, even though I concede it is getting—as with many things when government changes—a name change.
It should be pointed out that the area consultative committee network has done an absolutely outstanding job, particularly in developing a network across all of the areas that it covers. They have made an outstanding contribution to the development of regional Australia, particularly through prioritising. Everybody understands there are never unlimited funds in government, and it is just fantastic to see a process where people will, from a grassroots level, identify those programs and projects that are closest to the hearts of those communities.
I am concerned, as I am sure are many senators, that the area consultative committees not be allowed to go into some sort of hibernation mode while the interim arrangements, consultations and reviews are taking place. I understand that the circumstances at the moment are that the area consultative committees, or parts of them, will remain in place until December 2008. As I said, certainly many senators on this side are concerned that the work that they do continues. It is absolutely vital that their work continues.
The reason that we are a little concerned is that, I understand, no projects have received funding since the government took office. When projects are approved applicants are notified of the success of the proposal. Disturbingly, their actually entering into contractual discussions with the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government has been put on hold. Communities have an expectation that there is going to some sort of outcome. There are obviously contractors and people within those communities that are putting their best foot forward for some of the work and some of the funding. People have an expectation that proposals they have worked so hard for are in fact going to be funded.
We always look for signs in a new government, and the fact that they have been put on hold is hardly a sign of a committed government—one who stops all progress for nearly six months. Time and effort, and in many cases significant funding, have already been put into getting these proposals up and ready. Again, because of the commitment of the ACCs and all of their staff and the significant effort that has been put in by entire communities, it is simply unfair of the Rudd government to keep these people hanging around for some sort of answer whilst it continues to conduct another review.
The minister has stated that the message to regional communities is clear. This is one of the key statements: ‘This government will work with you to make your solutions work.’ Predictably, Labor’s actions again appear to have fallen well short of their rhetoric—just another example of the government being prepared to say whatever they need to say to get elected. But it seems that when the rubber hits the road there is not a lot of traction. Perhaps we should have taken slightly more seriously the fairly prophetic remarks of the member for Kingsford Smith during the election that once Labor won and got in they were just going to change everything.
Already the Minister for Finance and Deregulation has gutted Regional Partnerships by announcing that the government will be cutting the coalition’s Growing Regions program by $145 million. The Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and Northern Australia, Gary Gray, has been telling people that the government will be further slashing the Regional Partnerships program tonight, and we will be watching very carefully. It is vital that the new Regional Development Australia network is adequately funded; otherwise it is in danger of becoming nothing else but a rubber stamp.
I notice that regional Australia was a government pre-election commitment, and I remind the house of another pre-election commitment made by the then Leader of the Opposition in Perth on Friday, 16 November, in relation to the approvals process of the Regional Partnerships program. The Prime Minister, then as Leader of the Opposition, was asked in an interview:
Mr Rudd, can you explain your position on how you would administer the Regional Partnerships Program? Surely if you’re really serious about total independence you’d take it right out of the hands of a minister and the minister has no say in it?
And today’s Prime Minister said:
... it must pass through three stages—
he was very clear about this and he is a very articulate individual, and I will commend him for making this so clear—
Number one: for anything to be considered by us under this program, it would need to have the endorsement of either a) the local council; b) the local area consultative committee; or c) the State government.
No problems. He went on to say:
Secondly, it would need to form part of that community’s local economic or community infrastructure ...
Fair enough. He went on to say:
... and thirdly it would then need to pass the departmental seal of approval in order for it to proceed.
The obvious question from the journalist:
So ministers wouldn’t be able to overturn the recommendations of the department, is that what you’re saying?
The Prime Minister said:
According to the three stage process I’ve outlined, absolutely.
So he has ruled that out completely. We there have, prior to the election, the then Leader of the Opposition, now Prime Minister, categorically saying that he will make sure that the department is the final arbiter of Regional Partnerships—in effect, that ministers are not going to interfere in this stuff at all and those processes will be adhered to.
I do not understand how it is then, given the Prime Minister has said the department is the final arbiter of these programs, that the $2.6 million dead tree project at Barcaldine is going to be funded. That is right: the pet project from those on the other side, the Tree of Knowledge, a project which I understand was rejected by the minister’s department, is now going to be funded against departmental advice. That involves the second undertaking of that little tranche of undertakings—that it would be the department only; ministers would not intervene. But I will take you to the second part—and I am not sure about this; perhaps it is for the house to decide—which is that this dead tree would need to form part of that community’s local, economic or community infrastructure. Perhaps I do not know enough about that particular tree, but I would have thought that was a fairly tenuous grasp of the second aspect.
—We’ll bump up the Labor vote there!
—We have got interjections from the other side: something about bumping up the Labor vote. I will not take that interjection because perhaps I will get the sway of it wrong. Perhaps the other side need to recognise that there are a number of people who are confused by this matter and perhaps they could explain it to the members of the Royal Flying Doctor Service, who are patiently waiting for notification of whether this government is going to match the $600,000 that they have raised themselves to fit out a medical centre to expand this vital service to rural and regional Australia. So we have got a problem: we have got a Labor Tree of Knowledge and we have got people in the outback. Suddenly, one of these projects manages to push through all the processes and gets through.
It is going to be absolutely pointless, if we have a new Regional Development Australia board and a network, if the ideas and advice are never implemented. It does not matter that we have again had: ‘Core election promises will never be broken’—that has been shattered on a number of issues. But, clearly, we have an evidentiary trail to say that the Prime Minister was not fair dinkum when he said, ‘I’m going to stick to this promise.’ It was some other sort of promise, but let us leave all that aside. This is not going to work if the advice and the ideas are never going to be implemented, simply because we do not recognise the importance of rural and regional Australia. It is the boiler room of the economy of Australia, and we need to ensure that funding is adequate, timely and in response to a whole suite of advice that can only be provided through the area consultative committee network.
It is absolutely essential that the network survives with the new government—I recognise that these things change. This has been an outstanding program that was put in place by the previous government and, over a great deal of time, it has improved the worth of those people in rural and regional Australia. So, despite the duplicity of the Prime Minister and those opposite in terms of the election promise, we support the broad intent of the government’s plans for Regional Development Australia. Whilst not completely endorsing it, we are looking forward very much to some of the details later on.

"Trood, Sen Russell",LP,2008-05-13,"—As many senators would be aware, this month we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the birth of the state of Israel. This is a special occasion not only for Israel but also for the very close relationship it has established with Australia. Israel is the only state so far to be created by the United Nations. This occurred at a time when an Australian occupied the presidency of the General Assembly, and it gave us a unique opportunity to be one of the first countries to step forward and show our support for the creation of the new Jewish state.
All these decades on, Israel stands as a bulwark of democracy in the Middle East and an enduring symbol of courage and determination in the face of daily security threats and extreme geopolitical adversity. Indeed, Israel’s history has been characterised by challenges, by conflict and by a struggle to survive in a sea of regional turbulence and tension. Upon its establishment in 1948, Israel was soon invaded by surrounding states. It has remained under direct threat from many of its neighbours for much of its history.
Following this inauspicious beginning, the first decades of Israel’s nationhood saw a fragile peace interspersed with conflict. The new state provided a safe haven for Jewish people from around the world, among them the disempowered survivors of the Second World War. To many, Israel represented a place of safety from oppression and exclusion and the opportunity to build a life in a free and enterprising new society. Over the last 60 years, Israel’s population has grown from a mere 200,000 people to almost seven million.
Despite its unsettled beginnings, Israel’s economy grew quickly. In the early days, its unique kibbutz system allowed for the growth of a strong agriculture industry on land that for many years had been considered infertile. As the decades progressed, Israel’s economy developed rapidly, particularly its technology sector and its educational institutions. The result is an economy which has became one of the most technologically intensive and innovative of any around the world.
In relation to demography, the diverse mix of national backgrounds that makes up Israel’s population has led to a rich and diverse cultural life and allowed Israel to boast many world-class writers, composers, playwrights, dance groups and orchestras.
Regrettably, today, as at the time of its birth, Israel sits in the heart of an unstable and uncertain Middle East. While it offers a stable and energetic model of democracy for the region, sadly it is not one that to date has been emulated. Israel is yet to secure an enduring peace with its neighbours behind secure borders. Despite all efforts to resolve the complex issues involved, several factors prevent any meaningful resolution. Not least, the peace process is hampered by divisions among the Palestinians. Fatah is perhaps less corrupt and politically incompetent than was once the case, but it remains ‘a thin reed’ on which to build regional peace. Another major obstacle to peace is the militant and extremist nature of Hamas. Despite having won the 2006 Palestinian elections, this hardline extremist group continues to prosecute the destruction of Israel and, as a result, cannot make any substantive or constructive contributions to the peace process. The contrast between the two sides could not be more obvious. While Israel has strong representative institutions, the Palestinian people do not, and they have been ill-served by those who purport to speak for them.
Australia shares Israel’s earnest desire for a just and secure peace. It is one of the many things that have bound our two countries together over the last 60 years. We have been a close friend and ally of Israel throughout this period and we have developed deep political, economic and cultural relationships. Both countries share a strong belief in the principles of democracy and the rule of law. We also share the experience of welcoming a diverse range of peoples and cultures to our respective countries.
Trade is also an integral part of the Australia-Israel connection. From small beginnings, Australia and Israel have developed a wide-ranging trade relationship. In the early 1970s, trade between the two countries totalled only $10 million. In the last financial year, it reached over $800 million, and it continues to grow. The exchange of ideas is another important aspect of Australia’s relationship with Israel. As a result of strong bilateral business networks, Australia has been able to share in Israel’s advanced technology and IT industries, as well as its education and training services sector. Under Operation Paladin, Australia’s defence forces work closely with Israel and other regional partners as a part of the United Nations’ Truce Supervision Organisation. Australia has supported this operation since 1956.
In 2002, the Howard government established the Australia Israel Cultural Exchange. The exchange fosters cultural links and embraces the full range of the cultural diversity of both countries, promoting Australian culture in Israel and Israeli culture in Australia. Today, Australia is also the home of a strong, active and growing Jewish community of around 120,000 people. This makes Australia the 10th largest Jewish community in the world. Australia continues to foster this connection by encouraging Jewish students to come to Australia through a range of scholarships and the active promotion of our university sector.
On this auspicious occasion, I would like to take this opportunity to wish Israel all the best for its 60 year anniversary celebrations. I wish Israelis well for their next 60 years, and for many years beyond. I express the hope that the new American peace initiative may bear fruit and lead to a stable peace between Israel and its neighbours. I look forward to the close relationship between Australia and Israel remaining strong and continuing to grow closer as the years go on.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>60th Anniversary of the State of Israel</title>,Adjournment,17,1,speech
