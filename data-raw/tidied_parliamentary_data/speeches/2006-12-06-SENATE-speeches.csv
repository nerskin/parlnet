"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2006-12-06,"—I move:
That:
the following bill be introduced: A Bill for an Act to amend the Wheat Marketing Act 1989, and for related purposes; and
the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (8) of standing order 111 not apply to the bill allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings.
I table a statement of reasons justifying the need for this bill to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—

Purpose of the bill

Amend the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 to transfer the power of veto for bulk wheat exports from AWB (International) Ltd to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.

Reasons for Urgency

The Government considers that urgent interim arrangements are needed to address current concerns within the wheat industry. Following the findings of the Cole Inquiry, the Government does not consider it appropriate that AWB (International) Ltd continue to hold the veto power, at least until such time as due consideration is given to longer term arrangements.
The interim arrangements are intended to be in place until 30 June 2007, during which time the Government intends to consult widely with industry to ensure the best outcome for wheat growers in deciding longer term wheat marketing arrangements.
(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry)
I remind senators that we have had a statement of reasons for urgency circulated in the chamber. In fact, it was circulated yesterday. The Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2006 relates to, again, the recent Cole commission of inquiry. Of course, we have another bill which is different in form in response to that. This bill deals more with the marketing of wheat. Its urgency relates to the fact that, as a result of the Cole commission of inquiry, the government has considered the way in which wheat is marketed in Australia. There are urgent considerations because a harvest is in the process of taking place across Australia. In fact, I would venture to say that the majority of the wheat has now been harvested.
The government considers that urgent interim measures are needed to address current concerns within the wheat industry. This bill will allow for the change to the veto power for an interim period of six months. The interim arrangements are intended to be in place until 30 June 2007, during which time the government intends to consult widely with industry to ensure the best outcome for wheat growers in deciding longer term wheat marketing arrangements. I stress to senators that this is an urgent interim measure. It was not foreseen; it comes as a result of the Cole commission findings. We need to put this interim measure in place to address at least this summer’s harvest of wheat across Australia. We have attempted to give senators as much notice as possible. It is not a complex bill. In fact, I would suggest it is a very short bill compared to others that we have seen.
Today I am proposing that, should this motion succeed, we proceed with this bill after the Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 4) Bill 2006. That would give senators some time to consider their position. If necessary, government speakers could begin the second reading debate to allow further time for senators opposite to consider their position. And we could have the remainder of the debate concluded after question time today, which would give senators time to further consider their position. That is the proposal of the government. A draft was circulated yesterday—a slight amendment has been made to that—and the final draft was circulated this morning. As I said, it is a short bill; it is not complex. It deals with a very important and urgent issue of great concern to many of our farmers across Australia.",SENATE,<title>WHEAT MARKETING AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>First Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2006-12-06,"—I thank the minister for that round-up about the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2006. This is one of those occasions when there is genuine urgency for the legislation to be dealt with by the Senate at the end of a sitting year. The Greens, very unusually, will not be objecting to the exemption from the cut-off order. Senator Siewert has been dealing with this matter for the Greens. We will be ready to proceed with the debate later in the day, so the Greens will not be opposing this motion.",SENATE,<title>WHEAT MARKETING AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>First Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-12-06,"—Labor also accepts the urgency and the reasons put forward by the government for the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2006 being declared an urgent bill. Labor does understand that there is a need for certainty in industry and will not be opposing the exemption from the cut-off. In terms of management of the bill, it is being introduced now and we have before us the second reading speech and the EM, together with the final version of the bill. We thank the government for the draft presented last night. It also assisted in helping us to formulate our view today. Labor will be in a position later this morning to be able to deal adequately with the bill. We understand the reasons behind it; they emanate from the Cole commission of inquiry. We appreciate both the Greens’ and the government’s position in bringing forward this bill and ensuring that we have been adequately informed about it and the need for urgency.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>WHEAT MARKETING AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>First Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2006-12-06,"—I speak on this piece of legislation on behalf of the opposition. This is yet another tax omnibus bill that contains a variety of provisions. Firstly I wish to outline some aspects of the provisions contained in the Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 4) Bill 2006. Firstly, schedule 1 deals with marriage breakdown rollover. Current law provides for the capital gains tax rollover from the sale of property caught by court order or court approved maintenance agreements occurring as a result of marriage breakdown. There is a problem with CGT treatment as a result of a binding agreement not approved by a court but still consistent with current family law.
The classic case is where a prenuptial agreement exists. This could mean that one party to the former marriage would be able to rent the former family home in a manner that would change the apportionment between the capital gains tax free component of the former family home and the assessable component in the event of a sale. One party could potentially use the current law to influence the capital gains tax treatment of the former family home to the possible detriment of the other party. The amendment is designed to ensure that both parties’ situations are taken into account when calculating how much of the property is capital gains tax free. The law also clarifies the fact that marriage breakdown settlements do not give rise to CGT liabilities. The schedule is a necessary policy change.
Schedule 2 deals with consolidation. The consolidation regime applies where two associated companies elect to be treated as a single entity for tax purposes. Companies can sometimes split or demerge. However, to protect against tax avoidance, current law provides that major transfers of assets just prior to the demerger are ignored. This was to ensure that the demerger was not used to manipulate the cost-setting rules that value assets of the group and reduce tax. In this case, the demerger would be unwound and the previous position would apply for tax purposes. However, if the demerged entity or parts of it then remerge, they would be captured by these integrity provisions and the whole transaction would be unwound for tax purposes. However, the remerger is not tax avoidance and should not be part of the integrity measures. This change modifies the integrity rules to ensure that the remerger is not caught by this provision.
The change appears to be a reasonable correction of a problem but seeks to highlight the confusing nightmare that the consolidation provisions entail. This is at least the 12th time that these matters have been refined since introduction. The repeated amendments to the consolidation regime themselves now need to be consolidated. I repeat the position that Labor have put before the parliament: it would better for a major consolidation bill to be considered by the parliament. The process of considering amendment after amendment to this complex body of tax law does not reduce complexity; it certainly increases compliance costs and is against the broad thrust of seeking to reduce the size and complexity of the tax act. If the Treasurer were serious about reducing the complexity of the act he would do well to consider this proposal.
Schedule 3 simplifies the imputation system for New Zealand companies. Many New Zealand companies operating in Australia elect to be part of the Australian imputation system. But there are problems in allowing the imputation credits to flow to Australian companies as some dividends are non-portfolio dividends—less than 10 per cent shareholding—or otherwise exempt. Harmonisation of the two imputation systems is desirable and these provisions permit the franking credit to apply to non-portfolio dividends.
The original measure to allow cross-Tasman imputation recognition did have a cost in excess of $50 million per year. This bill corrects an unforseen event and therefore gives effect to the original costing. Still, the measure as written has a cost, even if already included in a previous explanatory memorandum to a previous bill. It should have been given in the explanatory memorandum to this bill. This is yet another example of a costing deficiency in the explanatory memorandum to a tax bill.
Schedule 4 deals with non-resident capital gains tax. Schedule 4 seeks to align Australian international tax arrangements with the model OECD treaty in relation to taxation of capital gains for non-residents. Labor supports the policy intent in principle but is concerned that the reduction in the capital gains tax base for non-residents is significant.
This is a complex and controversial measure with two major impacts, and its total cost is $300 million over the forward estimates. The first measure involves a significant tax concession to foreign companies operating in Australia by restricting the capital gains tax base to real property—that is, land and income from land. Capital gains on non-resident shares are therefore now to be excluded. This is consistent with the OECD model tax treatment, and the government argues this approach is sought by other jurisdictions in tax treaty negotiations. However, there is a major compliance measure as well that is likely to be targeted at the mining and minerals exploration sector.
The basic principle of international taxation is that the host country taxes income that relates to operation in the host country, irrespective of where the company headquarters are located. So income from Australian operations is to be taxed here. But there is a major problem with so-called interposed companies. If a foreign company has a subsidiary with operations here, it pays capital gains tax if the assets are owned by an Australian subsidiary. But if the assets are held by an intermediate or interposed company then it is difficult and often impossible for Australia to effectively levy the capital gains tax on capital gains on assets held by these companies, and in some cases the right to claim this tax is disputed. Moreover, if a foreign company holds less than 10 per cent of an asset in Australia, the asset will lack a ‘necessary connection with Australia’. In this case, CGT is not levied on this company’s capital gains from the sale of Australian assets.
So there is scope for an international company group to organise its Australian assets so each of the foreign interposed entities holds less than 10 per cent of a domestic asset, even though the total of the group may well exceed this 10 per cent threshold. This result is that most of these interposed groups can escape the Australian capital gains tax net. The proposed law states that for an international entity with 50 per cent or more of total assets in Australian real property our capital gains tax regime applies. This means that the ATO can look through the international corporate veil and apply capital gains tax on all these interposed entities’ capital gains if these entities are land rich.
This bill is an example of generic problems with tax bills. There are two government amendments to schedule 4 of this bill. This in itself is justification for Labor’s reference of the bill to the committee, and it also reveals a dangerous trend in tax legislation. Time and time again imperfect bills are being put to the parliament. How many times has the parliament been forced to consider amendments to consolidation measures and the international taxation measures? An example is the international tax participation bill of 2004. The debacle of the Tax Laws Amendment (Loss Recoupment Rules and Other Measures) Bill 2005 is still unresolved. Labor’s amendments were rejected in the morning and the bill was made subject to review in the afternoon—a review that is now eight months overdue. The legislative error rate in tax law matters is increasing all the time and it is just far too high.
Senators do not have to take my word for this; they need only hear from Justice Edmonds or the Inspector-General of Taxation, or even the minister himself, if they wish to find out how badly Treasury are being rated at the moment in terms of the production of tax law. Justice Edmonds, for example, was very critical of the way that explanatory memoranda are written, and this bill is sadly another example of the problem that Justice Edmonds referred to recently in his speech to the ATAX conference.
I want to talk about the problems with schedule 4. This schedule involves a major reduction in the capital gains tax base for non-residents. In evaluating this measure, there is of course the initial consideration of cost. The explanatory memorandum suggests a cost of $50 million to $65 million per annum. This in itself is significant, but Labor senators noted that this cost could be expected to increase substantially either as a result of proposed government amendments or as a result of prospective mergers. Such costs have to be weighed judiciously against the suggested economic benefits of increasing the attractiveness of Australia as a source of international capital. It is regrettable that this judgement was not assisted by adequate argument or modelling from the government or Treasury at the hearing. I am sure this is part of an increasing trend by this government to hide costings where it can. I do not blame the Treasury and Finance officials for this. They are under the political control of the ministers of the day. We are finding that information is being hidden and kept secret, particularly in the area of costings, where it is necessary to make a considered judgement about the worthiness of a particular piece of legislation.
In this case, the government has not put its argument with sufficient economic rigour. This may be the fault of the political process but, whatever the case is, it must be corrected. Labor calls on this Liberal government to devote more resources to making its arguments clear to the people through the parliament and through the committees, to desist from this increasing threat to openness and to ensure that costings and modelling are made publicly available.
Why doesn’t the government provide the parliament with the best analysis available? Why should Australia settle for second best in making difficult decisions of this nature? It is nothing but an attempt to undermine the parliament, particularly the role of the Senate. We have seen the increasing arrogance and contempt for the role of the parliament and the increasing domination by the executive, whether it be the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, or the arrogant Treasurer, Mr Costello. We have seen this contemptuous approach manifest in a number of ways that Labor has referred to on previous occasions, particularly now they have a Senate majority.
Labor senators considered this bill in an inquiry and put a number of questions to officials in advance of the hearing. We actually often put our questions on notice so officials have time to consider the matters, and we put questions on notice in advance of the primary hearing associated with this measure. We have sought to uncover the disadvantage to Australian firms relative to foreign firms, and if an increase in merger activity would lead to a significant cost blow-out. Labor senators were not given an answer to these questions that were put in advance of the hearing. This is not acceptable and I certainly hope that officials themselves have not been withholding information.
It is understandable that officials withhold information at the political direction of the government, which I suspect is what occurred on this occasion. There were some answers provided later but they were not adequate and were not covered in sufficient detail, and in some cases the responses were simply framed to avoid making a substantive and properly detailed answer. Labor senators did make some significant additional remarks, as did Senator Murray, the Australian Democrat shadow minister in this area. I acknowledge his active and effective contribution on these matters. I would like to endorse the broad sentiments of Senator Murray’s remarks in his additional comments.
I have noted the joint submission of the Minerals Council of Australia, the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, the Corporate Tax Association, and the comments of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia at the hearing. The joint submission argued that taxable capital gains or losses on Australian real property need to be more precisely focused by specifying that only a proportion of the gain on the sale of interests in a resident or non-resident entity that is land-rich should be subject to CGT, equal to the Australian land-rich proportion. The amendment is worthy of further consideration and Labor is concerned that it was not more properly considered in the Senate report.
Labor has supported in the House of Representatives a further amendment to allow for the fact that the land-rich status of an entity may change between May 2005 and the timing of the bill. This amendment allows the ‘reset the clock’ amendment in relation to the cost base to also cover companies not land rich before May 2005 but who are now over the 50 per cent threshold. Labor notes that this further amendment at this late stage highlights again the deficiencies in the legislative process for this bill. Another amendment is expected to provide that the cost based adjustment also applies where the land-rich status of an entity has changed since May 2005, and that is a logical extension of the first amendment.
At a special briefing provided to Labor in relation to this amendment Labor reiterated its call for the two measures in schedule 4 to be disaggregated in terms of costing. How much is the cost to revenue of the reduction in the CGT non-resident cost base net and how much is the gain to revenue from the new compliance measure? We know that officials were in a position to provide that information but the minister’s office did not grant officials the authorisation to inform Labor of this measure. This is a further example of contemptuous treatment of the parliament, and of the Senate in particular, in the legitimate gathering of information by the Australian Labor Party. I know that the Australian Democrats get frustrated at times. Keeping secret vital information on costings is in defiance, I have to say, of the Treasurer’s own much vaunted charter of budget honesty. Senator Murray is nodding; he knows that the Treasurer runs around saying: ‘We have got this charter of budget honesty. We are going to give full and open costings and access.’ Yet here is another case of this arrogant Treasurer refusing to reveal costings in accordance with his own charter of budget honesty.
—It is because they do not add up.
—I am sure that is part of the explanation, Senator Murray—you are quite right. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, has ruled out tax cuts for individuals and has expressed no interest in providing tax relief to small business, but he has found $300 million for tax breaks for foreign companies. We query the priorities of this government and they do not accord with Labor priorities. This is not the measure we would have chosen to advance at this time. However, given that this has been announced for two years—albeit continually botched and costings having been refused—and there are a number of investment proposals awaiting passage of this bill, Labor considers on balance in terms of being a responsible opposition that we will not seek to oppose the bill at this stage.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2006 MEASURES NO. 4) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-12-06,"—The Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 4) Bill 2006 is comprised of four schedules, each with their own purpose. Schedule 1 modifies the provisions relating to capital gains tax and implications associated with asset disposals arising from marriage breakdowns. The proposed amendments extend the marriage breakdown CGT rollover to assets transferred to a spouse or former spouse. Currently the rollover applies automatically to a relevant CGT event arising from a court order under the Family Law Act or a corresponding foreign law; a court approved maintenance agreement under section 87 of the Family Law Act; or a corresponding agreement approved by a court under a corresponding foreign law or a court order under a state, territory or foreign law relating to de facto marriage breakdowns.
The proposed amendments extend the operation of the marriage breakdown rollover provisions to an additional three situations: a financial agreement binding under the Family Law Act; an arbitral award made under the Family Law Act; or a written agreement that is binding because of a state, territory or foreign law relating to de facto marriage breakdowns. According to the explanatory memorandum the financial impacts and compliance costs are expected to be ‘minimal’.
Schedule 2 contains amendments to the consolidation provisions in the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997 so that the integrity provision requiring certain rollovers to be ignored for tax cost setting purposes does not apply to a consolidated or multiple entry consolidated group that forms after a demerger provided that company that received the rolled-over asset does not join the same consolidated or MEC group as the company that transferred the asset.
The operation of the integrity provision is also clarified, another amendment to what I would broadly describe as the consolidation regime. The explanatory memorandum claims that the anticipated cost to revenue will be $20 million for the financial year 2006-07 and $5 million for the financial years 2007-08 to 2009-10, totalling $35 million. Despite that cost, I think that amendment is valid and necessary, and it is consistent with the intentions of the consolidation regime.
Schedule 3 contains amendments to the imputation system relating to Australian and New Zealand companies. The proposed amendments in schedule 3 aim to solve the so-called triangular tax problem and will ensure that franking distributions by a New Zealand company which are exempt or are non-assessable, non-exempt income can be passed on by the Australian company on a pro rata basis to its shareholders. The explanatory memorandum estimates that the financial impact will be zero, with minimal compliance costs, and I think that is a useful rationalisation of the arrangements between Australian and New Zealand companies.
Schedule 4 contains amendments relating to capital gains tax and its operation in connection with foreign residents. It contains proposed and consequential amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993. The bill will amend the CGT regime such that the capital gain or loss made by a foreign resident from a CGT event—the event by which a capital gain or loss arises—is disregarded unless the event relates to an asset that is ‘taxable Australian property’. Previously, the asset needed a ‘necessary connection with Australia’.
Broadly, ‘taxable Australian property’ will include taxable Australian real property, which is any real property situated in Australia, plus mining, prospecting and quarrying rights; indirect Australian real property interests, which are interests held by an interposing entity or entities; assets used in carrying on a business through a permanent establishment in Australia; an option or right to acquire one of these interests; and any CGT assets covered by section 104.165(4) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Additionally, the bill defines ‘indirect Australian real property interests’ as being those interests that pass the non-portfolio interest test—a non-portfolio interest is held by a foreign resident if the direct or indirect interest held by the foreign resident and associates is 10 per cent or greater—and the principal asset test, which is satisfied when the market value of an entity’s taxable Australian real property is more than 50 per cent of the market value of the entity’s assets.
Schedule 4 also contains consequential and other amendments arising from the proposed changes to the CGT regime relating to managed fund provisions, currency calculation provisions and interests in active foreign companies. According to the explanatory memorandum, the cost of the proposal is expected to be $50 million for 2006-07 and then $65 million for each of the following years 2007-08 to 2009-10, a total of $245 million. I famously—I hope!—described that as a thumb-suck. It might be an educated thumb-suck, but it is a thumb-suck.
Before discussing some of the specific concerns raised by the various schedules of amendments, I would just like to express my concern about the apparent lack of informed public awareness of the bill, although there has been some useful commentary in the more creditable newspapers and magazines. In the Senate Standing Committee on Economics inquiry into the provisions of the bill, only four submissions were received in total, all of which came only from industry bodies and associations and all of which expressed support for the bill. As I said, there has been some media coverage; but, given that schedule 4 alone has a cost to revenue of $245 million over the years 2006-07 to 2009-10, I find the low-ish level of public awareness concerning, particularly since I think the consequences of this change will be dramatic for Australia with respect to a rapidly increased rate of foreign takeover and quite an amazing reduction, I expect, in revenue—far beyond what the government has calculated.
In terms of controversial issues, the bill is split fairly evenly down the middle. Schedule 3 relates to a technical taxation matter that was not dealt with in previous legislative efforts relating to trans-Tasman taxation arrangements. Schedule 2 is also relatively uncontroversial, although the validity of the forecast costs to revenue is always questionable in these matters. My view is that estimates by Treasury, whilst more educated than anyone else’s, are still only estimates. As those who have heard my remarks on consolidations over the years know, I have been consistently of the view that it will cost more than we anticipated. But that cost was actually necessary and justified, so there we are.
It is schedules 1 and 4 to which I wish to devote the majority of my attention, as they raise issues which merit further consideration. Schedule 1 extends the operation of certain marriage breakdown rollover provisions in relation to capital gains tax. However, as Bills Digest No. 16 notes at page 4:
Parliament may note that the measure will make no changes to availability of the roll-over relief: only heterosexual couples, married or in de-facto relationships, will benefit from the expansion of the relief. It will continue to be unavailable to same-sex couples.
As most of my Senate colleagues will be aware, under my portfolios—economics, finance, tax and those sorts of portfolios—I have long campaigned to eliminate discrimination against same-sex couples in our tax, superannuation and property laws, although unfortunately not only have these efforts not borne much fruit so far but they have gone unrecognised by the larger community. So, to anyone who thinks that these are politically motivated efforts, I can assure you I get absolutely no political benefit from them.
In my view, I have also been moving these sorts of amendments consistently with the government’s support. As I understand it, according to coalition government policy and as enunciated by the Prime Minister, the coalition does not support the continued discrimination against gay and lesbian Australians with respect to property matters. Prime Minister John Howard, in a press conference at the Commonwealth Parliamentary Offices in Sydney on 22 December 2005, said that he was strongly in favour of removing any property and other discrimination that exists against people who have same-sex relationships. Well, that strong support does not translate into policy, so I am afraid I am not impressed.
As I stated during the Senate Standing Committee on Economics inquiry into the provisions of Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 4) Bill, the continued discrimination against homosexuals is contrary to the way in which the government is moving. It is contrary to the remarks of the Prime Minister and the minister for finance and contrary to the view of most parliamentarians I know. It may also infringe international law. Some countries such as Canada allow marriage of same-sex couples, and this discriminates against those who are married overseas.
This bill continues to exact the sort of discrimination which the Prime Minister declares he is against. This is a new rule which further entrenches discrimination against same-sex couples in tax treatment and, when the government is forced to change its position and end this discrimination, this will be yet another rule on top of the already myriad number that exist which will need to be amended. Discrimination in our tax laws against people based on their sexuality is a serious concern for the equity of the system. In this bill the government was presented with an opportunity to begin changing this position and that they chose to do nothing is frustrating. I can only hope that in time the government starts an action that will change it. There is overall community and parliamentary support for changing real property rights with relation to homosexual people.
Schedule 4, on the other hand, demonstrates that the government is able to come good on promises made to reform other aspects of our tax laws. The amendments in schedule 4 are the result of a promise by the Treasurer to deliver capital gains tax reform before the end of the 2005-06 financial year. The government contend in the explanatory memorandum that the CGT measures in the bill will further enhance Australia’s status as an attractive place for business and investment by addressing the deterrent effect for foreign investors of Australia’s current broad foreign resident CGT tax base. While this may be so, I have my doubts about the merits of this justification, especially in the light of comments by John Edwards, chief economist at Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. Drawing on an International Monetary Fund report, Mr Edwards observed:
... over the last few years business investment in Australia has been markedly higher as a share of GDP than in the UK, the US, Germany or Japan ... Though widely believed to in a mining boom, Australia has actually been experiencing an investment boom.
It is interesting to note that all of the submissions not only expressed their support for the bill—mind you, I say all the submissions but ‘all’ was only four—but also seemingly had no reservations as to the potential negative impacts of the bill. All emphasise that the changes would bring us into line with international practice, with the Institute of Chartered Accountants also citing that the amendments will encourage greater investment, enhance our competitiveness and encourage global companies to enhance their Australian operations.
While I am always able to support measures which aid the economic wellbeing of Australia—I have a long history in this place of having done so and my party has done so—I am concerned that changes to CGT of this sort as it relates to foreigners may be giving foreigners an unfair advantage, and that is an unfair advantage over Australians. It is an issue of equity. While most of our trading partners probably do have similar tax regimes to Australia in many respects, can Treasury guarantee with any certainty that no foreigners investing in Australia will be receiving an unfair advantage over Australian investors? The answer appears to be not yet.
Treasury has so far provided no modelling, no empirical evidence, no illustrative cameos to support their claims that non-Australians will not be given an unfair competitive advantage over Australian citizens and residents. In that respect, I want to support here in the Senate the remarks made by the Labor shadow minister with respect to the unwillingness and inability of Treasury to provide the sorts of answers to questions that were asked for.
I have a view of Treasury that they are very bright, very competent and highly professional and therefore their failure to provide that sort of response is a failure as a result of political direction, not as a result of failure of the policy officers to be able to deliver such information. It is an affront, as the shadow minister rightly said, to the official opposition of the parliament and to the people of Australia when the government and its principal economic agency start to treat the parliament as if we are mushrooms, as if we do not deserve to be properly informed. When this law goes through, as it is going to, given the way in which the numbers sit, we legislators will bear the consequence of this law. We bear the responsibility, not Treasury—we bear it. Therefore we are entitled to ask to be as fully informed on these matters as possible. With respect to this particular bill, I want to record my strong displeasure and disapproval at the way in which the committee and the Senate have been treated.
It is too easy, by the way, to label concerns about schedule 4 and the possibility of foreigners being given taxation advantages over Australian residents—both foreign and Australian citizens—as ‘economic xenophobia’, as one witness did. Apart from being completely wrong with respect to my and the Democrats’ huge contribution to supporting laws, which have modernised and internationalised Australia with respect to its tax regime and the way in which it operates internationally, we recognise that foreign investment is an important part of a modern and globally integrated economy. But the Democrats and I are deeply concerned that, when we change our tax rules to give foreigners advantages our own citizens and residents do not have, it is a basic measure of equity. Once again, this is about equity and capital gains treatment of Australian citizens and noncitizens. Australian tax law must not have the effect that foreign-born residents of Australia or Australians are treated less favourably than non-Australian residents abroad. This is foolish and would be inequitable.
When these questions were put to the Treasury officials they answered, ‘We disagree; we don’t think it will be inequitable.’ The problem is that they were not able to substantiate that opinion. They were not able to provide any empirical data, any cameos or any illustrative comparisons that would enable us to accept their assurance. As bright as they are, we know from the history of this country that Treasury have got it wrong in the past. They are not perfect. We know from the history of this country that governments have got it wrong. They are not perfect. And we know from the history of this country that at times the legislature has got it wrong. We are not perfect. Therefore, we are all entitled to be given the maximum information that enables us to make a considered decision. In this case you did not provide it and therefore you have not allayed my fears. Judging by the remarks of the shadow minister, despite the fact that Labor will end up supporting this bill, they share those broad fears and are concerned at the sort of treatment we have been given.
I am unable to give this bill full Democrat support without the CGT marriage and de facto breakdown provisions being amended so that they at least remove the discrimination against de facto homosexual couples. I understand that, if they are married, the law prevents that happening. But with respect to real property issues, de facto homosexual couples should not be discriminated against. I cannot give this bill full Democrat support without addressing the schedule 4 capital gains tax issues that we are concerned with. That was my position throughout the Senate inquiry into this bill. The inquiry did not allay my concerns and my fears, and therefore it remains my and the Democrats’ position now.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2006 MEASURES NO. 4) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2006-12-06,"—What a rort. The Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 4) Bill 2006 would exempt foreign residents from paying capital gains tax unless they are selling what are called ‘real property assets’ or taxable Australian property. The government says that this will make Australia a more attractive place for foreign investors. That is no surprise, when foreign investors are getting a special tax break. Using the same argument, we could make Australia a more attractive place for Australian investors if we were to abolish capital gains tax altogether. But the government is not proposing that.
The practical effect of this bill will be to give foreign companies an unfair advantage over Australian companies. I will say that again: the practical effect of this bill will be to give foreign companies an unfair advantage over Australian companies. It will give individual people from other countries a tax break that is not available to people in our own country. Australians have a very keen sense of fairness. They are prepared to give people a fair go if they follow the rules and if everyone is treated equally. But they do not like rorts, and this is a rort—where they are taxed and their government gives noncitizens a tax break. What is fair in that? What is fair when your own government taxes you for exactly the same transaction that someone else can make tax free? Ask ordinary Australians what they would think of giving special tax breaks to foreigners while continuing to tax Australians for the same thing, and they would say it is wrong, it is wrong and it is wrong. One of the government’s arguments is that the laws fit with the standards set by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. But we should never adopt laws that do not make sense. And we should never adopt laws just because some group tells us to.
So what would the practical effect of these laws be? If this rort is allowed we can expect to see a wave of international money hitting Australia in search of a fast buck. We have already seen in the last year the impact of private equity funds in Australia. For example, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts made an $18.2 billion bid for Coles Myer, which was rejected by the board. If this rort is allowed, expect to see KKR back for another go. With the sale of assets like Coles Myer, worth billions of taxpayers’ dollars, how much revenue would the Australian taxpayer lose if this rort is allowed? We do not know.
It is worth focusing for a moment on private equity funds—what are they and what do they do? Private equity funds typically look for companies they can quickly overhaul for a quick profit. They take on huge debt to make takeover bids for listed companies. They do not create and develop businesses; they simply restructure them for profit. Restructuring companies involves major changes, including cost cutting—and that means Australian jobs will go. Of course private equity funds want to make big profits. They increase company profits by fair means or foul then sell the asset. Under the rort—and it is a rort—in this bill foreign investors could pocket the capital gains as profit. Where is the fairness in that? Finance commentator Alan Kohler suggests a KKR takeover of Coles Myer would lead to thousands of Australian jobs disappearing. He has also predicted the break-up of the company, with the sale of divisions like Target and Officeworks.
Does this sort of behaviour sound familiar? It should. Private equity funds are simply leveraged buyout funds by another name. Leveraged buyouts are a familiar term from the 1980s. The character Gordon Gekko, who senators may remember from the 1987 movie Wall Street, accurately depicted 1980s corporate raiders who bought companies to strip them for their assets. With this bill to slash tax for foreign raids on companies, it is no surprise that private equity funds are interested in Australia. A representative of the Institute of Chartered Accountants told the Financial Review last month that ‘there is certainly merger and acquisition activity being delayed’ in anticipation of this bill.
Obviously this rort, handing out tax exemptions to overseas investors, will also have a financial impact on our budget. But the full financial impact is unknown. The government estimates a loss of revenue of $65 million a year, but I understand from the committee report that they have not done modelling on what the benefits would be. If the government only knows the cost and not the benefits, that suggests this bill is no more than another way to continue its ideological crusade for free market economics.
Family First supports free enterprise but not the unfettered free market. Family First will not agree to a situation where we are taxing Australians for capital gains but giving foreign investors a tax break. That is not fair. That is a rort, and Australians will not buy it. As I said before, a representative of the Institute of Chartered Accountants told the Financial Review last month that ‘there is certainly merger and acquisition activity being delayed’ in anticipation of this bill. Family First will not agree to a situation where we are taxing Australians for capital gains but giving foreign investors a tax break and I urge Labor to reconsider its position, given that, in terms of fairness and a fair go for Australian families, this is a rort. I urge senators to vote against this bill.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2006 MEASURES NO. 4) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2006-12-06,"—I am not going to comment on the Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 4) Bill 2006, except for schedule 4, which I have some serious problems with. Schedule 4 is about discriminating against the Australian investor in favour of the overseas investor. Schedule 4 talks about the so-called capital-gains-tax-free world of people living overseas, which Australians do not get.
This bill is going to go through because the Labor Party support it. It is interesting that today, when we heard about Mr Rudd’s ‘fork in the road’, the first thing he will do at his fork in the road is look after people overseas at the expense of Australian investors. Apparently this fork in the road is going to be nothing more than some sort of slovenly roadside diner at which all that is dolloped out is disappointment to Australians.
It is quite clear that not only are we are about to pass a piece of legislation that discriminates against Australians but we are doing it at the behest of other people in other corners of the globe. We are here to look after other people in other corners of the globe before we start looking after our own! Some of the figures that have been put up—I have been reading through the explanatory memorandum—indicate that it is going to cost the Australian economy $50 million in 2006-07, $85 million in 2007-08, $80 million in the following year and $75 million after that.
I will give you a bit of a run-down on some of the things that are happening. We have this takeover of Coles. The bid was for $18 billion but let us call it a $16 billion takeover. Let us say they get a 20 per cent write-up on that $16 billion takeover. That is $3.2 billion. We are going to compromise $960 million of our own money in that one transaction.
The Labor Party support this and it is complete lunacy. The Coles workers go to public hospitals, send their kids to public schools and go on public roads. They are supported by a defence force and a police force. All these things are supported by the Australian taxpayer, yet the benefits of that transaction go to the United States treasury. So what are the Labor Party going to do? Are they going to send Kevin Rudd over there to knock on the door to ask for some of the money back?
Then we have Boral and Qantas which are up for takeover. How on earth did the Labor Party decide that they were going to agree with these figures? It is a peculiar day when the first thing we do at the fork in the road is follow someone else. The first thing the Labor Party have done, at the fork in the road, is to follow someone else. The Labor Party’s clear statement to the people of Parramatta and Ipswich today is that they are trying to find mates. That is what they are doing; they are trying to find mates. This is a piece of legislation to try and find mates. That is disappointing, because they had a chance to make a difference.
This legislation is going to be sneaked through. I agree with what Senator Murray said: it has not had the proper airing in the public realm that it should have had. I strongly question the numbers that have been put up. Do you know that today we have overseas equity firms that in the United States have put in a bid for Home Depot of $100 billion? They have the ability to remove $100 billion from the share market and the Labor Party is quite happy for that investment to be tax free. They are quite happy to completely desert the working class.
I will tell you what happens when these overseas equity funds buy up an Australian company—and this might be news to the Labor Party—they break them up, because they have to try to take cost-cutting measures. So the Labor Party are turbocharging the break-up of Australian companies with the loss of Australian jobs. That is what they are doing today. And then they wonder why people do not take the Labor Party seriously at their IR rallies. It is because people know that the Labor Party are not fair dinkum. They know the Labor Party are not the full bottle. Today the Labor Party are going to turbocharge the break-up of Australian companies, with the loss of Australian jobs. They have some pathetic excuse as to why they believe this is a good thing. I do not know whether this will get reported, but I hope that Labor Party constituents find out about this. I hope they bring the Labor Party to account on why they would discriminate against Australian companies, why they would exacerbate the break-up of Australian companies and why they would move Australian jobs overseas.
Why would the Labor Party, who want to get into power, do that? What is their excuse? Maybe the Kevin and Julia roadshow is getting out of here quickly so that they do not have to explain that to the Australian people. It is interesting that the first thing Mr Rudd will have to talk about at his so-called fork in the road roadside diner, the slovenly house of rhetoric, is his views about delivering this to the Australian people. Boral, at $4 billion, will be up for grabs, as will Coles. Even, I think, the market cap of BHP Billiton, our biggest company, is $164 billion. So if they can find $100 billion for a department store in the United States, I reckon they could start looking out for large sections of the Australian economy. What you are doing today is turbocharging that.
With regard to schedule 4, I will support Senator Murray in opposing that schedule. This is an issue we have brought up before. We have been trying to lobby support and get it out there in the public domain. It has been very hard to get some support, but I hope that the fourth estate is still vigilant enough to start running this scenario past people. On the argument that accountants support it: I can tell you right now that I am an accountant and I do not support it, and every other accountant I run it past cannot believe it; it just fascinates them.
Here is another bit of information: they say it is all about reciprocal agreements. I can affirm that when $1 billion is up for grabs, people might start using other tax-free companies to base their rating on. I will give you one place. It is not very far away and people might have heard of it: New Zealand. New Zealand has no capital gains tax, so you can launch from New Zealand, come into Australia, buy up Coles, hold it for a year, sell Coles, put your money in your pocket, take it back to New Zealand and not pay one cent of tax—and that is something you are agreeing to today.
Of course, you have the Bahamas, Lichtenstein and the Cayman Islands—all these are going to be assisted greatly. One would presume that Australia had a problem attracting foreign investment. I think the problem is that at times we might be attracting a bit too much of it. But there is no problem in attracting foreign investment to Australia. It is falling over itself to get in here. We have a safe, stable country; that is why they are coming here. What they are going to have now is a benefit that no-one in this chamber has, no-one in Ipswich, Queensland has, no-one in Mackay will have, no-one in Parramatta will have and that no-one in the suburbs of Perth will have. What people overseas will have is the benefit that it will now be tax free.
So if I am a reliable investor looking for a break and I know that the people of Pyongyang have a better tax advantage than the people of Sydney or that the people of Houston, Texas have a better tax advantage than the people of Sydney, the smartest thing for me to do is to move, to leave Australia and go somewhere else and invest in this country. I just cannot work out why you want to support that. I cannot work out how you could possibly think that this could go through to the keeper without someone finding out about it. Where was the glorious speech by one of our learned friends on the other side of the chamber as to why it is a great deal for the Australian voter to pay a tax they would not have to pay in an Australian company if they lived overseas? The only exemption is if you could say: ‘If the company’s more than 50 per cent real property, they’re outside the law.’ There is a fair bit of investment you can do that you can box up so that 49 per cent of your company is mining shares or 49 per cent of your company is land and 51 per cent is something else.
The vast majority of our investments, however, show that there are inactions and goodwill. If you live overseas but not in Australia, investment will be tax free. I think that it will be an interesting debate, and I challenge Mr Rudd in his new role as the glorious Leader of the Opposition to explain to the Australian people why he believes that one of his first decisions is going to be this—this is the fork in the road he has decided to follow.
—You’re in government, in case you hadn’t noticed.
—I know it is hard and I know you are trying to deal with the issue yourself—he has probably rolled you in some caucus meeting—but there is probably something hanging out the end of it there. There is probably some promise. Maybe somebody is going to look after you favourably. But this works in a troika. You had the cross-media ownership laws, you had the mergers and acquisitions laws and now, to really help you out, we are going to make it tax free. What more can we do? What we are going to do is let you buy out our media companies through the media ownership bill, which unfortunately was supported by Senator Fielding, and then we are going to allow you to get as big as you possibly want with the mergers and acquisitions laws—we do not want to have much oversight over that. Is there anything else we can do for? Yes, we have thought of it: we will make it tax free. What a package deal! You should box the trifecta, Senator Sterle. You are complicit in it now.
—It’s your government’s legislation.
—You have now decided to put your hands on it. I understand it perfectly, and I think you should understand it a bit better; otherwise, you are not being completely honest with us. It is not a good day for the Australian investor. It is not necessary; it is not required. The fact that it completely reflects what happens overseas is not right; in so many other countries this is not the case. It seems to state that we are somehow lacking in foreign investment, but we are not. So this is going to be an interesting time.
However, there is not a hell of lot we can do about it now. It is one of those peculiar things everybody gets to see, where the Labor Party decides that they are going to discriminate against Australian investors. This will be an interesting vote. It will go to a division. I do not know which side of the Labor Party would actually want this. Maybe you could tell me: is it the right, the centre left or the far left? Which part of the Labor Party is big on the idea of turbocharging the takeover of Australian companies to be broken up so that jobs can be moved overseas? Is that the TWU, Senator Sterle, or is there another group that wants this? I am fascinated. Maybe someone can suggest to me which side of the Labor Party wants to move jobs overseas.
With this $100 billion, if they were not investing in Home Depot and they turned their attention to Australia—we know they are out there: KKR has money to burn and that is just one of many—what would be your plan of attack after you put this through? What will be your plan of attack when they start breaking up Australian companies and losing Australian jobs? Aren’t you going to feel just a bit duplicitous when you go back to the working people, as you fondly call them, and say, ‘We’re going to fight for our laws if there are any of you left employed in Australia’?
—How did you vote on Work Choices? How is that debate going to work?
—I know you are upset and I know you are coming out because the truth hurts.
—You did the grubby deal with your side.
—I know it is galling to you, but you should have been stronger in your caucus. You should have spoken up. You have really got yourself in a bind. What you have done is basically said that with a wink and a nod we can get this past Australian workers and the Australian people without them knowing. Well, they are going to find out today, and they are going to call you to account.
What we have here today is the turbocharging of foreign equity firms for the buyout of Australian firms to be broken up, and there does not seem to be much we are going to do about it. What we have here today is something that basically discriminates against the Australian investor for the overseas investor. What we have here today is a clear statement that if you want to get a tax break then the best place to be is not here. What we have here today is something that is being quietly moved through with bipartisan support—except for some—because it fits another agenda, which has nothing to do with capital gains tax. That agenda is one that you might be serving at the fork in the road slovenly diner. It is called currying favour. It is first on the menu. That is what is on the menu at the fork in the road diner today: currying favour with a certain group of people.
You are not going to get away with it. You are going to have to deal with it. You are going to have to think about it. The problem that I think we all have is the matter of how we actually get the Australian people to hear about this. It is a problem that Senator Murray has. There has not been a recognisable argument put up as to why this is a good thing. I have not heard one. One certainly has not been presented by the Labor Party.
I challenge the Labor Party. Today, in the reign of their new glorious leader, they have a chance to be relevant. Once more we give them a chance to be relevant. We give them a chance to be courageous. We give them a chance to stand up for the Australian worker and to stand up for the Australian investor. Today is their chance, if ever they have one, to look after the Australian investor, the Australian worker, the Australian company and the Australian ownership of Australia. Or they can roll over and be dispatched for what they are: irrelevant shadows. But all we will hear is more of this rhetorical nonsense about a fork in the road, new chapters and a bridge too far—a bridge to a farce; that is what it is. But what we get is the fork in the road diner, where the No. 1 item on the menu is currying favour.
Unfortunately, the people who will get the Christmas present are investors in Houston, investors in Paris, investors in Berlin and investors in Japan and Tokyo—not the people of Ipswich, not the people of Longreach and not the people of Parramatta. What you are doing today is rolling over. And then you are going to come in here with the theatrics and bang on about something else and think that the world is going to change and actually focus on you and take you as relevant. But it is not. It is going to take you as completely and utterly irrelevant. I challenge the Labor Party to make itself relevant today and not support schedule 4.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2006 MEASURES NO. 4) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2006-12-06,"—I thank all those who have participated in what has, as always, been a lively and interesting debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 4) Bill 2006. The bill has, I think, been adequately described by previous speakers. It contains some four schedules, all of which but for schedule 4 seem to have at least substantial support in this chamber. Schedule 4, as Senator Joyce in his contribution has just now made clear, is somewhat more controversial. Can I say on behalf of the government that we welcome the fact that the Labor Party is at least not going to oppose schedule 4. I welcome the fact that they have considered this properly and on its merits. The Labor Party, as the alternative government of this country, recognises the importance of this measure and of bringing Australia’s tax system properly into line with international tax arrangements. It is refreshing that at least on this issue the opposition does recognise the importance of having such consistent international tax arrangements.
Schedule 4 does do that. It is part of our ongoing efforts as a government to bring our tax system more into line with international norms and to ensure that the tax system does remain internationally competitive. The nation as a whole must remain internationally competitive. Our tax system must remain internationally competitive. The competition internationally for investment dollars is intense and immense and we must never ignore the critical importance of ensuring Australia’s policy framework is internationally competitive.
The reforms, as has been said, better target and strengthen the application of our capital gains tax regime to foreign residents. That is achieved firstly by narrowing the range of assets on which foreign residents are subject to Australian CGT, which will be restricted to Australian real property and the business assets of Australian branches of a foreign resident. As has been noted, it also strengthens the integrity of that narrower base. CGT will apply to non-portfolio interests in Australia and foreign interposed entities where more than half the value of the interposed entity’s assets is attributable to Australian real property.
It is of course one of the great virtues of the Liberal and National parties that, unlike the Labor Party, our members are free to exercise their will in relation to measures of this kind. I profoundly disagree with Senator Joyce on this issue. He and I share many views in common, and I enjoy siding with Senator Joyce on some of the great and important issues facing this country. But on this issue we do not agree, and the government party room does not agree. The government party room supports this measure for the reasons set out in the explanatory memoranda, in various government statements and in public statements as to why we should follow the international norms with respect to the way in which foreign entities are taxed on capital gains. That is what this bill seeks to do and, as I said, I am pleased that the Labor Party understands that.
I do not want to go into a particular critique of Senator Joyce’s difficulties with this bill. I do respect where he is coming from, but I do need to say that, overall, the history of this country is one that demonstrates the overwhelming virtue and importance of foreign investment. There is no way this country would have the development, extraordinary living standards and economic prosperity that we have without foreign investment.
As I said, the competition for investment dollars is extraordinarily intense. As many of the developing countries in the world improve their legal and regulatory frameworks, they will become increasingly attractive to investment. This country is one that, in its 200-year history, has never had a situation where its savings meet its investment requirements. There are a lot of reasons for that but we have always been—and, in my view, will always continue to be—reliant on foreign savings to provide the investment dollars that this country needs. To ensure that we continue to attract that foreign investment, which provides overwhelming benefits to the Australian economy, we do need an internationally competitive tax regime.
I do profoundly disagree with Senator Joyce in his assertions that foreign investment somehow costs jobs. Foreign investment creates jobs. Foreign investment in my own city of Adelaide creates thousands upon thousands of jobs in the defence and automotive industries. Without foreign investment we would not have anything like the industrial base or the employment prospects that we have in this country. So that is something with which I profoundly disagree and on all the evidence that I have ever seen those firms that are engaged internationally or are partly or wholly owned by foreign entities operating in Australia are among the most efficient. They are the companies that have most significant investments in R&D, they are the most innovative and they offer in many respects the best employment opportunities and conditions for their employees, so we do profoundly believe as a government that on balance foreign investment is good for this country and we want to continue to attract it. With those few remarks, I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2006 MEASURES NO. 4) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-12-06,"—The Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2006 has hardly been seen by the opposition, although we have seen it and were recently given a copy of the explanatory memorandum. We were expecting that the debate on this bill would not commence before 12.30 pm. For that reason, the opposition has some significant comments that it wishes to make. The opposition will be supporting the thrust of this legislation. It is important that the ability to trade without the impediment of the veto power of the AWB be enshrined in law and the opposition will be supporting that principle.
I can also say that we are giving serious consideration to using this amendment bill as a vehicle to propose another amendment to the legislation that is in fact very similar to an amendment we moved to the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2003 on 26 June 2003, I think. What we wanted to occur then was a full and proper inquiry into the exercise of powers under the legislation of what has become AWB International and also AWB Ltd in its control of the wheat pool, its veto power and the exercise of other functions under the single desk in order to satisfy growers that the system under which we were operating was the best available to create proper financial returns for growers, without paying undue and excessively large commissions or other fees to AWB Ltd for their management of the wheat market in Australia.
That is a subject which has exercised the minds of many growers and indeed many senators in this place in recent times. It is a subject which I have had conversations with many senators about and I have heard others having that conversation. It has been discussed in the media and it has been discussed across the kitchen table on many farms, I am sure. It is frankly appalling that the minister did not begin his speech introducing the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2006 with an abject apology from the Howard government to every Australian wheat farmer.
The mere fact that we are debating these issues today can be seen as an admission by the government that it failed to get the structure of AWB right in the first place and that, ever since then, it has failed to adequately monitor the performance of AWB. Every wheat grower deserves an apology for the failure of a succession of Nationals ministers and leaders to do the jobs they were being paid to do. It was a former Nationals leader, Mr John Anderson, as the minister responsible for agriculture, who did much of the spade work in devising a flawed structure for AWB at the time it was privatised. It was the current Nationals leader, Mr Mark Vaile, as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, who took much of the legislation for the flawed structure through the parliament. It was the deputy Nationals leader, Mr Warren Truss, who was asleep at the wheel while the Wheat Export Authority failed again and again to properly do its job as a watchdog and allowed AWB to run amok. While Australia produces just less than five per cent of the world’s wheat, it accounts for approximately 15 per cent of the total world wheat trade. That is an important factor considering how important this market is.
Lest it be said that, in my criticism of the ministers, I am biased, I want to lay some of the blame for this mess at the feet of the Liberal Party as well. The current Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, Mr Ian Macfarlane, must also take his share of the blame. As President of the Grains Council of Australia at the time, Mr Macfarlane was heavily involved in the development of the Howard government’s flawed structure for AWB. A number of the flaws and weaknesses in the Howard government’s wheat marketing arrangements were exposed during the Cole inquiry into the wheat for weapons scandal. Commissioner Cole shone a spotlight on AWB and exposed serious problems with its corporate culture and the performance of a number of its employees. One consequence of the oil for food scandal has been a renewed focus on the fitness of AWB to manage Australia’s single desk marketing arrangements for wheat and even on the need for the continuing existence of the single desk itself.
These are important matters of vital interest to every wheat grower in this country. Through AWB, Australia exports around $5 billion worth of bulk wheat a year to around 50 countries. As I said, although we produce just less than five per cent of the world’s wheat, it accounts for approximately 15 per cent of the total world wheat trade. In addition to bulk wheat, Australia exports a relatively small quantity of bagged and containerised wheat through AWB and other traders. Not only does this trade secure the incomes of wheat growers and their families; it sustains the economies of many country towns and rural communities.
It is worth spending a little time looking at the history of wheat marketing in this country. The Australian Wheat Board was established in 1939 with legislated monopoly power over both domestic and export grain sales. Labor has been a strong supporter of the single desk ever since it was established. In July 1999 the Howard government privatised the former Australian Wheat Board. AWB became a grower owned company under the Corporations Law and retained effective control of the single desk. AWB Ltd has two classes of shareholdings. Class A shares are restricted to wheat growers while class B shares are traded on the Stock Exchange, or at least they were until trade was suspended recently. The proportion of shares held by growers has been steadily decreasing, as has the value of the shares they own.
A particular point of contention for growers is the service fee and bonuses that are paid by AWB International to AWB Ltd. The service fee is currently set at a minimum of $65 million per annum. After considerable pressure from growers AWB has announced that, because of the drought, the service fee for the current pool will be reduced to $39.5 million on a one-off basis. This service fee is part of a services agreement between the two arms of AWB. A key problem of the services agreement is the fact that its contents have been kept secret from growers and just about everybody else. This secrecy has become a hallmark of the arrogant way AWB has conducted its business.
AWB’s structure contains an inherent conflict of interest. Companies law requires AWB Ltd to maximise returns to shareholders whilst its constitution requires that it acts to maximise the return to growers. In granting a legislation monopoly to a Corporations Law company, the government has a clear duty to ensure that those monopoly powers are not abused. Central to the failure by the government to properly oversee AWB’s management of the single desk has been the failure of the Wheat Export Authority to do its job.
The Wheat Export Authority was established in 1998-99 to control the export of wheat from Australia and to monitor AWB’s performance in relation to the export of wheat and examine and report on the benefits to growers that resulted from that performance. It has considerable power, including the power to direct AWB to give it any information, documents or copies of documents under the control of AWB or a related corporate body. It must report annually to growers and the agriculture minister on AWB’s performance and it must also publish an annual report. Any individual or company other than AWB seeking to export wheat from Australia must get prior approval from the Wheat Export Authority. This applies to all wheat, whether bagged, containerised or in bulk. In the case of bulk wheat, the Wheat Marketing Act requires the Wheat Export Authority to seek the approval of AWB before it can authorise a shipment by someone other than AWB. These two right of veto proposals by AWB’s competitors to ship wheat out in bulk are the core of AWB’s single desk power.
The performance of the Wheat Export Authority in monitoring AWB has been the subject of criticism from Labor and from grower organisations for a number of years. The Wheat Export Authority completely missed the involvement of AWB in the wheat for weapons scandal, even though the potential impact on grower incomes was considerable. The incompetence of the organisation as it is currently staffed and structured was highlighted recently when it was revealed that it went through 2005 using the provisions of an out-of-date service agreement as the basis for monitoring AWB. It is important that the operation of the Wheat Export Authority be thoroughly reviewed as part of any process leading to improved arrangements for wheat marketing.
AWB has been given a legislated monopoly but we should be mindful of the fact that AWB is not the only company with experience and expertise in the marketing of Australian grain. The other key players in the industry are the largely grower owned grain handlers who control most of the storage, loading and handling infrastructure. They have large purchasing and distribution networks. These companies include Consolidated Bulk Handlers, a Western Australian based grower owned cooperative; ABB Grain, a mainly South Australian based largely grower owned company; and GrainCorp, a largely grower owned company that operates on the east coast. CBH and the other grain marketers have considerable interest in the outcome of this process. These largely farmer owned grain handling and marketing organisations have a legitimate interest in the fate of the single desk and it is important that they are given the opportunity to make their views known.
Others groups with a considerable interest have been the associations representing grain growers. Labor has held extensive consultations with these groups and has noted that there is considerable debate about the appropriate form for future grain marketing arrangements. For example, the Grains Council of Australia, which represents growers in all states and most state peak farmer organisations, strongly supports the single desk. In Western Australia growers are divided. PGA represents mainly the larger enterprises and the Western Australian Farmers Federation represents many of the smaller growers. PGA opposes the single desk and the Western Australian Farmers Federation supports it. The non-grower-owned grain traders are represented by the Australian Grain Exporters Association and are generally in favour of opening up the market. Because there is such a variety of strongly held views on the nature of future arrangements for the marketing of wheat, it is important that the consultation mechanism the government puts in place ensures that all these views are heard.
In 2003 Labor proposed an amendment to the Wheat Marketing Bill 2002 which would have had the effect of establishing a formal independent inquiry into all aspects of wheat marketing. The government opposed that amendment and the inquiry was never held. If the government had listened to good sense back in 2003 it may well be that timely action could have been taken to prevent at least some of the problems that have been exposed with AWB’s management of the single desk.
There have been a number of independent reviews of the current arrangements and they have generally recommended changes to the single desk arrangements. For example, the Productivity Commission issued a report in 2002 entitled Single-desk marketing arrangements: assessing the economic arguments. Its key findings were as follows. Most of the potential benefits of the single desk arrangements can be achieved without the compulsion of a single desk. In export markets where premiums might be obtained—for example, due to quotas imposed by importing nations—targeted export licences can be used to control exports and monopoly marketing of all exports is not required. Economies of scale and scope in marketing can be captured without monopoly selling, while premiums could still be ‘earned’ for high quality and customised service. Activities which deliver industry wide benefits, such as research and development and quality control, can be delivered and funded by more targeted mechanisms. It found that, whereas the potential benefits of single desk selling are likely to be small—or could be achieved in a more competitive marketing framework—the costs of single desk arrangements have the potential to be large. Single desk arrangements inevitably discourage product and marketing innovations; costs may be especially large in markets where product variety and value adding are essential for success; and, importantly, statutory marketing authorities can be reconstituted to operate on a commercial basis in a competitive environment, continuing to offer services to producers and providing a vehicle for continued grower ownership of marketing functions—voluntary producer organisations can continue to give producers a voice.
In December 2002, Malcolm Irving chaired a national competition policy review of the Wheat Marketing Act 1989. This review made a number of specific technical recommendations aimed at improving the operation of the Wheat Export Authority, and freeing up trade in containerised and bagged wheat and in bulk for specialised varieties such as durum wheat. Importantly, while there is much uncertainty as to whether the single desk arrangements produce a net benefit for growers, in conclusion the review stated:
On balance the Committee came to the view that the introduction of more competition into export wheat marketing in the future would ... deliver—
greater—
net benefits to growers and to the wider community than continuation of the current arrangements ...
The review specifically recommended:
if no compelling case can be made by the time of the 2004 review that there is a net public benefit, then the ‘single desk’ should be discontinued ...
The government, might I say, accepted the technical recommendations of this review but reaffirmed its long-term commitment to the existence of the single desk.
The wheat marketing review of 2004 made a number of recommendations related to the corporate structure of AWB Limited and its subsidiary AWB International, calling for less overlap between the boards of the two entities. It also recommended changes in the way the Wheat Export Authority operates. In accordance with its terms of reference, the review made no recommendation as to the future of the single desk.
Proponents of the single desk, including AWB itself, the National Farmers Federation, the Grains Council and most state farming organisations, except PGA in Western Australia, tend to argue the case for the single desk along the following lines: the single desk allows AWB to establish an integrated marketing system which captures benefits for growers right along the supply chain; AWB’s constitution requires it to maximise returns for growers; having just one Australian player in the international marketplace ensures price confidentiality and Australian growers are not played off against each other; the single desk gives growers the market power to achieve supply chain efficiencies and reduce costs; through the single desk, AWB provides clear market signals and rewards growers precisely for the quality of wheat they produce; the single desk manages price and currency risk; the single desk underpins the market as a buyer of last resort.
These views were backed by a study by Econtech of the premium attributed to the single desk. This study was commissioned by AWB to quantify the benefits to growers of the single desk arrangements. The study found that on the benchmark of Australian premium white grade of wheat, the single desk captures a premium of between $15 and $30 a tonne. The total annual value to Australian growers of this premium on Australian premium white is $80 million. On all grades the average premium attributed to the single desk is $13 a tonne and the total annual value of the premium on all grades is $200 million.
It is clear that there will have to be some changes to Australia’s wheat marketing arrangements. The Cole inquiry has established serious flaws in the way AWB conducts itself, but there are such a wide variety of views about the best way forward for wheat marketing and the single desk that a formal and independent inquiry is needed to ensure we get the structure right. A number of organisations have proposed detailed models or sets of principles for future wheat marketing. These all need to be properly evaluated. The past record of the government and the National Party in particular cannot lead to any confidence that they will get the wheat marketing arrangements right this time. Frankly, a properly constituted formal inquiry is required.",SENATE,<title>WHEAT MARKETING AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-12-06,"—I indicate to the chamber the Democrats’ support for the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2006. I would also like to put on record and signal to the government the Democrats’ willingness to support further changes to the current single desk arrangements. As Senator O’Brien has just outlined, a range of different views and ideas have been put forward, most significantly from different parts of the wheat growing industry, and they will need to be considered. Also, it would be best for them to be considered a little bit further removed from the current upheaval flowing on from the Cole commission of inquiry and further action flowing out of it. The level of damage that has been done to the industry and export opportunities is obviously enormous. Precisely how enormous that is and how it presents itself will still need to be seen. In that sense, taking a bit of time to look at all the alternatives is very wise.
The simple fact is that the Democrats are prepared to support the change. We believe that change has to be made in consultation with wheat growers. Of course, there are a variety of views about that, but we believe that the future of the wheat export industry is too important to just be sorted out in the backrooms, with coalition members reaching an arrangement that has as much to do with maintaining some sort of harmony within the coalition as it does with what is in the best interests of wheat growers. There is no need for the government to have to try and do distorted deals with one or two National Party MPs to get an outcome when, clearly, others in this chamber—certainly the Democrats and, I suspect, others—are willing to work to support change. We should do that openly and with the involvement of all political parties and all people at community level rather than just have party-political deal making.
We are at this point, with this change before us today, because of the monumental failure of governance and the dereliction of duty of a number of senior members of the government. It is a clear example of hubris and arrogance, not just because many warnings were ignored by senior government ministers but also—and in some ways I find this even worse—because of their total failure to take any responsibility.
It is one thing, for all sorts of reasons, to make mistakes along the way, not notice what is going on, fail to take account of warnings and not have proper structures in place to ensure accountability; it is another thing, when all of that finally comes to light, to take absolutely no responsibility at all for the debacle and for the damage that has happened. I think this issue has focused too much on examining how much political damage might be done and how many political hits might be landed on the government or on individual ministers. There has been a continual focus on the soap opera aspect of politics. That might be exciting for those of us who live in the bubble of Parliament House, but the real issue is the damage that has been done to Australian wheat growers, to the Australian wheat market, to the reputation of Australia in general, and, I might add, to corporate culture and the notion of responsibility and accountability in corporate dealings.
Frankly, people had clear, direct responsibility under law—such as the federal government had and ministers had—for ensuring that we abided by the UN oil for food program and that we did not breach those sanctions. The people who had that responsibility and failed just went, ‘Oh well, it wasn’t my fault and I’m not going to make any changes at all as a consequence of all that has come out.’ What sort of message does that send to our corporate community? We are passing more and more laws through this place and putting higher and higher accountability standards upon them—and that is something in the main that the Democrats strongly support; indeed we have put forward some of those measures. But you cannot impose more and more accountability requirements on the corporate sector, and the not-for-profit sector for that matter, and have zero accountability at government level. The disconnect has become enormous. The hypocrisy is too much. Unless we seek to address that then it is not surprising that we will have ongoing problems in other sectors—whether it is the non-government sector, the corporate-for-profit sector or other areas of endeavour—where people will think: ‘Oh well, nobody takes responsibility at the leadership level in the government. We’ll see what we can get away with as well. We’ll just try to bluster our way through if we get caught and hope for the best.’
It is a seriously damaging attitude and a clear hallmark of a government with immense arrogance. The government now believe that the natural state of being is for them to be in government. They completely confuse self-interest with national interest. This sort of debacle is the consequence. But it is not the political damage or otherwise that I am concerned about. I am concerned about the damage to hard-working Australians, to Australia’s reputation and to those important standards of proper accountability. Contrast that with what has actually happened within AWB. They have had a complete shake-up and a change of management. That organisation has had a major upheaval—as it should have, of course. Along with a change of management there needs to be a change of culture, and that is why the signals that the government and the ministers send about this are equally as important. Clearly there is a lot of overlap between the cultural problems within AWB in the way it did business and the cultural problems within senior levels of government. In addition to that, we need more transparency into the future about the nature of export contracts. I am not suggesting that every contract should be made public or anything like that, but I think an extra level of oversight of all the variations that occur and the way that the trade operates into the future would be desirable.
There are many views amongst growers about what the best way forward is from here. A number of them are still suggesting that the existing single desk arrangement should remain, that this legislation should just be a temporary measure and that it should all revert back to the way it was afterwards. That is not a view I share and it is not a view the Democrats share. We believe there should be change. We are completely open as to the nature of that change and how quickly it should be put in place. Indeed, at this stage, we believe that it is best to remain open about it. I am highly sceptical that a single desk type arrangement actually delivered the best prices for growers in general. I think the introduction of a degree of competition in various ways will deliver better results for many growers. That is a view that I will continue to put in the ongoing debate. I am not here to try to impose my view as to what the next step forward should be, other than to say that it should not be a step backwards to the past. I accept that the existing single desk arrangement delivered more certainty for a lot of growers and often that is worth the trade-off. Having greater certainty about income flow is more valuable, in some circumstances, than the uncertainty of possibly higher or lower prices or sales not coming through once the crop is harvested. That certainty is now lost as well because of the damage that has been done by the previous AWB management and by the coalition government’s negligence.
We have reached a stage where it is time for change, but there is still a lot more consultation required to determine what that change is. I would urge the government to include all political parties in that consultation rather than have a backroom arm wrestle amongst the various competing factions and groups within the Liberal and National parties. Also, with regard to this specific legislation and the specific measure before us, I would urge the government to hand over the veto power to the agriculture minister. That step is not only welcome; it was specifically suggested by the Democrats. Of course there are specific difficulties in Western Australia at the moment. I believe this legislation will provide a mechanism to address that—although it obviously depends on what the minister does. In the current environment, I think the principle contained within the legislation is a sound one, and that is why the Democrats suggested it earlier. We are pleased that the government has acted on that.
I hope they also listen further to some of the other suggestions that the Democrats and others put forward as to where we go from here. In addition to ensuring best return for wheat growers, it is also important to ensure that that market operates in a way which is sufficiently transparent and accountable. There are obviously some reputations that need to be rebuilt here, not just AWB’s but Australia’s as a nation in export circles. I fully accept that some of that damage will be deliberately exaggerated by competitors seeking to harm our trading opportunities and boost their own. I fully accept that there is a lot of hypocrisy and there are double standards in the area of global trade, not just in wheat but in plenty of other areas as well.
But that should not be an excuse for inappropriate conduct and illegal conduct in particular. The Democrats have had before this chamber for a number of years now—perhaps six or seven years—the Corporate Code of Conduct Bill, which sought, and still seeks, to put in place mechanisms of corporate behaviour in the international arena. That is a measure which I believe is still merited and this sort of example is the reason why it is merited. We do need to lift standards more widely internationally. I am certainly not suggesting that Australian companies are worse than others. Indeed, I am sure in many cases we are better than others, but we do need to ensure proper standards of corporate behaviour wherever the company might be operating. The suggestion that what is appropriate corporate activity within Australia somehow does not apply once you leave our shores is not only an unacceptable one but also an unwise one in the long term in many cases. I think that this episode provides a reminder of why that general principle is important, and it is one that the Democrats will continue to push.
There is obviously a lot more that could be said about the government’s failure in this regard, and the responsibility they should take and must take for the situation that has now been reached and the damage that has been done. I do not want to expand on it any further. I think that I have made enough of a point with regard to that. Also, for the sake of wheat growers in particular, I think it is important that we focus attention on where we go from here and what is best for that important domestic and export industry.
Whilst it is appropriate that we do continue to point to the failings of the government, that should not be the focus of this whole debate. Ordinary wheat growers have already suffered enough damage—collateral damage, if you like—from political infighting and political negligence. We all need to try to make sure that they remain the main focus of debate around this issue. It is still important to point to the failings of government, not for partisan political purposes but as a reminder that we do need to take responsibility when we make mistakes. It is certainly a principle that I have tried to follow in the approach that I have taken in political life—a willingness to accept mistakes and take responsibility for that. It is not just because it is a nice sounding principle and a good thing to teach your kids; it actually leads to better governance, and better governance is in the interests of the entire Australian community. It means that fewer innocent people end up getting hurt and getting caught out as collateral damage in these sorts of debacles.",SENATE,<title>WHEAT MARKETING AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2006-12-06,"—I am aware that there is a long list of speakers here and that we probably need to be fairly quick and to the point so I will try to meet those goals. The Greens will be supporting this amendment. We support the lifting of AWB’s right of veto temporarily. We believe that it is important as a short-term measure to allow Australian wheat growers the chance to sell this year’s crop without having to wear the risk of the fallout of the AWB fiasco. We believe that it is much better to proceed down this path of temporarily lifting the veto to enable a discussion about the longer-term future and not force a quick decision on the long-term future when, quite clearly, there are very serious issues that need to be discussed and reviewed before reaching a decision on the long-term future and the way we market wheat in Australia. This will give all stakeholders the time to give proper consideration to the best way to market Australian wheat into the 21st century so that we get the best deal and protect the interests of all wheat growers in Australia—not just the large wheat growers but also the small ones—and so that we have a system that is transparent and accountable, the good name of Australia in the wheat market is restored, the good reputation of our agriculture is protected and we never again see corrupt and shoddy deals being done and having been done in our name.
In October the four Australian Greens sent a letter to the Prime Minister requesting that he temporarily lift the right of veto from the AWB. We had recognised the looming crisis for the wheat growers of Australia, particularly the Western Australian wheat growers. It was quite obvious that the findings of the Cole inquiry were not going to be positive and that the AWB was exposed to risks that would therefore lead to our farmers being exposed to risks—particularly Western Australian farmers. We are pleased that this amendment is putting in place a temporary veto and that essentially the government is assuming the responsibility for that decision making. We asked for a temporary lifting of the veto to allow the immediate concerns to be dealt with so that everybody could have time to review the Cole findings with a cool head and a view to the best outcome for all.
The long-term changes are quite clearly needed—absolutely. It was obvious that there would be massive fallout following the report of the Cole inquiry and that time is needed to review these findings with a cool head. Farmers in WA were, and remain, concerned. They look like the only mob likely to be exporting wheat during this season because of the impact of the drought and they largely do the bulk of the exports anyway. Farmers are worried about the risks and liabilities of having to deal with the AWB during the current crisis and, as many people know, most of the wheat from Western Australia is in storage in bins, rather than being delivered to AWB.
The important thing here is the uncertainty for our farmers. Even those farmers who support the single desk are concerned. They have this massive inner conflict between wanting to support the single desk and being deeply concerned about the risks and uncertainties that they face should they deliver their wheat to AWB.
Most people are probably aware of some of the potential liabilities that AWB currently faces, such as the direct costs of the Cole inquiry, bills from the ATO, actions by shareholders, owing money to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and actions from overseas. The list goes on and on, with AWB’s liabilities potentially amounting to between $1 billion and $2 billion. I believe that farmers have a right to certainty—and, of course, they have cause for concern. If and when these chickens do come home to roost, Australian growers who have handed over their wheat to AWB may find themselves at the bottom of a long list of creditors. They may only receive a percentage of the crop’s value. I do not need to tell you what a cause for concern this would be for farmers in normal circumstances; but, with the current drought, their margins are even tighter and, quite frankly, they need every dollar they can get from their exports.
As I said, WA growers are particularly exposed to this risk, because at this stage they are likely to be the main people exporting their wheat and are therefore the farmers who are most likely to face the biggest fallout from the AWB fiasco, paying for its incompetence and fraud in the oil for food scandal.
Of course, lifting the right of veto only addresses part of the problem that we are facing. The government still needs to answer a number of very difficult questions. Firstly, who is going to step in to bail out AWB and make sure that the growers do not end up paying for this anyway in the long run; who is going to pick up that tab? Secondly, what kind of process of inquiry will the government put in place to make sure that ongoing decision making is open and transparent and that growers and the broader community have a chance to have their say, are heard and have input into the long-term decision making on the future of the way we export wheat from Australia?
We need to properly assess the findings of the Cole commission of inquiry. In particular, we need to look at what role ministerial responsibility, the failure to oversee the current system, played. The Cole findings clearly said there was a failure of culture, but culture does not occur in a vacuum. Signals from the government, from DFAT and from the Wheat Export Authority, which I will get to in a minute, were critical. There seems to have been a series of very convenient instances of overlooking warning signals, as well as organisations—for example, AWB—not performing the functions that they are supposed to carry out.
When the Australian Wheat Board was privatised and became AWB, a system was supposedly put in place to oversee that privatisation. The agency with that responsibility was the Wheat Export Authority, which clearly did not properly carry out its functions. It not only did not carry out its functions adequately; it also had a very narrow interpretation of its functions. This narrow interpretation of its functions resulted in its failure to pick up the failings of AWB. However, it does not stop there. The WEA is supposed to report to the minister—so what did the minister and the departments do with the reports? Do they just file the WEA reports? Didn’t they check that the WEA was carrying out its functions? If they did, they might have identified the improper way in which AWB was handling its business. Quite clearly, changes are needed for the long term.
We need to decide how to market Australian wheat on the world stage in the 21st century. We need to protect the interests of our growers, both big and small. We need to protect our international reputation—first, of course, we need to restore it and make sure that we do the right thing in responding to the Cole inquiry into the Wheatgate kickback scandal. We need to have a debate in which all Australian wheat growers and the broader community have a chance to be involved and put forward their opinions on the future of the single desk and the best way to manage their interests. We need to make sure that the single desk process is open, transparent and working in the best interests of growers, not the stakeholders in a privatised monopoly. That was a built-in conflict of interest. We need to make sure that growers are involved in the decision making on how their wheat is marketed.
I am concerned that some people’s single-minded belief in the single desk has resulted in their overlooking the shortcomings of the current approach to the single desk. We need breathing space and we need to carefully review what led to the malfunction and the breakdown of the current single desk process so that we have a system that does deliver in the interests of all growers, not responding to the interests of shareholders in private companies, and that is open and transparent. We need time to discuss this, which is why I am glad that the government has responded to calls from the community and from the Australian Greens to temporarily lift the veto power to enable a much more proper process to be put in place, rather than making a rushed decision which I think would inevitably have led to a poor outcome for the Australian wheat market.",SENATE,<title>WHEAT MARKETING AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2006-12-06,"—The Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2006 has been brought in as a necessary measure for the Australian wheat industry. As Senator Siewert said, one of the reasons for this temporary measure is to end the impasse that currently exists with the Western Australian wheat farmers who are not delivering their wheat to the pool but are storing it on their properties—thousands of tonnes of wheat that are not going to either CBH or AWB. The government want to ensure that the single desk selling arrangements retain the confidence of growers in the short term and that growers are not disadvantaged in the long term. I urge Australian wheat growers to take advantage of the next three months of consultation to ensure that a united position is presented to the federal government on the future marketing arrangements for bulk export wheat.
There is a push for deregulation of wheat exports and there are all sorts of variations on the single desk. But the Nationals have held the line on this important issue for regional Australia and we have bought some time for wheat growers. I say to growers today: you have 17 Nationals representatives here in the federal parliament; we are your voice here, but your voice, the voice of growers, needs to be loud, clear and distinct when you give us the message to carry for you on the way you want your wheat marketed overseas. Your future is strongly linked to the future of the single desk, and make no mistake: the future of the single desk is at stake right at this moment.
The minister, under this bill, will be handed the veto for a period of six months up until 30 June 2007 before it comes back to AWB, and this gives growers time to confirm: firstly, if they want to retain the single desk, which I believe they will; and, secondly, what format the single desk should take and who should ultimately exercise the veto. I have met with representatives of the wheat industry already and understand that they are preparing to undertake a comprehensive consultation process over the next three months to confirm that wheat farmers want the single desk retained and to present all the options available to growers. I understand that Minister Peter McGauran will be writing to wheat growers soon on this matter to kick-start the consultation process amongst the farmers.
This consultation must form a basis for presenting a unified case to government at the end of the three-month consultation. The export veto power for bulk wheat has been placed with the minister as an interim measure to ensure grower confidence in the current arrangements in the short term. Putting the veto in trust with the minister will potentially reduce the chance of pool-contributing growers being left with a disproportionate share of the cost. That is one reason the bill is being put forward. An export licence will continue to be granted on terms where it will have to assist in maximising the bottom line for wheat growers. In this way, the minister’s veto will help to ensure that those who contribute to the pool are not penalised for the benefit of growers outside the pool.
When the three months are up, it is essential that growers have made a clear decision on what constitutes a single desk and who is the appropriate entity to control it. I have made my position on the single desk patently clear. The Nationals have always defended the single desk as a fundamental defence for Australian wheat growers against the protectionist policies and subsidies of our overseas competitors, totalling more than $17 billion per year or 39 per cent of farmers’ income in the EU and 32 per cent of farmers’ income in the US. While ever growers remain united and can clearly demonstrate a requirement for the single desk, the National Party will continue to support them. Most of the world prefer to buy through a single desk, so we must continue to sell through a single desk to suit our markets.
To me the single desk is defined by five clear principles: a single desk entity is grower owned; it is the operator of the national pool; it is the holder of the export veto; it is the buyer of last resort; and it provides security of payments for growers. As far as I am aware—and I am pretty certain of this—a farmer has never not been paid by the AWB; never at any stage has the AWB reneged on a payment. This is not the case in many other markets where people trade. These principles must be changed only with the support of a clear majority of growers. Most growers, the Nationals and many of our Liberal colleagues support the current definition for the single desk. Logically, the next step in the government decision-making process is determining what alternatives are being put forward that uphold the principles and definition of the single desk, and whether growers agree with any of the new proposals.
Australian wheat growers must take advantage of these next six months and ensure that they present a united position to the federal government on future marketing arrangements for bulk export wheat. I sound this warning: let there be no uncertainty at the moment; the single desk is under threat. The only way the single desk can be maintained is by a strong voice of growers who want it. That voice has got to be loud, definite and united. If a united voice is not coming through into the parliaments of Australia then the single desk is definitely under threat. So it is time for the voice of the 22,000 wheat growers to be heard and it has got to be heard loudly and clearly. There cannot be meetings where 200 growers get up and come up with 200 different variations of what a single desk is because the single desk has got to be defined out there amongst the growers. That message has got to come through into the parliament and then we, the various parties, will know what the farmers want.
There is a period of six months before the government make a decision: three months for negotiations and three months for the government to come up with a proposition. So, 22,000 wheat growers, it is over to you. If you want it, fight for it. Go out there and fight hard for it because if you fight hard you may be able to maintain it the way it is.",SENATE,<title>WHEAT MARKETING AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2006-12-06,"—Senator Boswell realises that the single desk is under threat. He says it is under threat now and puts the responsibility back on the growers to do something about it, which is absolutely extraordinary. It is not up to the National Party, apparently. It is not up to the Liberal Party, whose Prime Minister John Howard promised in the last election that the single desk would be maintained. No, it is now back to the growers to do something about it, which is an absolute disgrace given that we have known for some time that the single desk was under threat.
In his second reading speech the Minister for Justice and Customs (Senator Ellison) said:

To rush the consideration of these long-term arrangements—

that is, the single desk—

would put at risk the future interests of Australian wheat growers. The government’s dominant concern in the consideration of both long-term and temporary arrangements is the interests of Australian wheat growers.

What happened to looking at the long-term interests of Australian wheat growers over the past four or five years? It had become clear that the single desk was under threat from competitors who were pushing, people like CBH and ABB. The government has known for years that the single desk was under threat.
What did either the government or AWB do about it? The AWB stood where it was, said, ‘We must have the single desk,’ and refused to look at any alternative methods of dealing with all these possible competitors and the push from America and others about the single desk. It stood there and absolutely refused to look at any other ways to deal with it. Now, as a result of the inherent problems within the arrangement, we are looking at a rushed, inadequate method of dealing with this. And now we go out, now we consult and now it is the growers’ responsibility to deal with it and come up with a single model of single desk. It is not the government, it is not the AWB—it is the poor growers whose responsibility it is to come up with a sophisticated marketing model.
This is an absolute failure of this government, whose Prime Minister promised the continuation of the single desk and now acknowledges that the cracks are far too obvious and that, on the government’s watch, the AWB collapsed due to its own inherent structural problems. This is the problem for growers, who are looking at a decrease in the price for their wheat in this drought. Many of them also have shares in AWB, which has been the worst performer in Standard and Poor’s ASX200 index and has seen a 60 per cent drop in its share over the last year. So AWB loses on both fronts. These poor growers out there who now have to get together—

"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2006-12-06,"—I rise today to talk about the issue of biofuels in this nation. I think it is an issue that we need to keep focusing on. It is vitally important that we get biofuels and the future of biofuels right in this nation. I will talk today particularly in terms of ethanol.
What we have seen in the past is a complete lack of determination and interest from the major oil companies in committing to using ethanol in this nation. We have seen an entire range of benefits presented for this particular fuel in this nation. We have health benefits, environmental benefits, benefits for rural and regional areas, jobs and opportunities that can be created and price benefits from ethanol, and we are seeing this out there in the community. We are seeing ethanol blended fuel at 3c and 4c a litre less for consumers right out there across the nation. The only thing is that it is not across the nation: it is in very few service stations, so consumers cannot access it. And why is it not there and available? It is not available because the major oil companies are not coming to the party and doing what they should.
People would be very aware that, at the end of last year, the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister came to an agreement with the major oil companies to set some voluntary annual targets so that the government could reach 350 million litres of biofuel production by 2010. This year the target is 89 million litres at the bottom and 124 million litres at the top. To all intents and purposes, at this stage, we have seen the major oil companies use about 15 million litres of ethanol. It is falling far short of the target. It is completely reprehensible that the oil companies have not done more to meet this target.
I acknowledge that there are some oil majors that have taken steps to address this issue, but I draw to the attention of senators that the agreement at the end of the last year was that these targets would be met. The bulk of the ethanol that is being used out there in the marketplace at the moment is from the independents. United Petroleum has done a terrific job in getting ethanol out there to the marketplace. As I understand it, they were not even part of the agreement with the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister at the end of last year.
The point of having those discussions and the point of having the targets in place was to ensure that the major oil companies, for the good of this nation, would come to the party and start increasing their use of ethanol—and they are not doing it. As far as I am concerned, if they are not going to meet these voluntary targets, those targets should be mandated. What is the point of having a voluntary agreement if those involved in the agreement are not going to stand up for either side and are not going to meet those targets? It is a complete waste of time to have it in place if they are not going to meet their targets. It is not good enough to say, ‘We’ll meet it in 2008, or we’ll meet it in 2009.’ It is just not good enough. Those targets were put in place to be met this year and they should have been met. They should have been met because it is in the interests of people right across this nation. It is in the interests of all Australians.
The environmental benefits are enormous. There are health benefits in terms of emissions. In particular, as a senator from country New South Wales, the jobs and opportunities that can be created out in the country areas from the development of this industry are tremendous. We talk about creating industries and we talk about creating development out there in the regions. This is one way of doing it: developing that ethanol industry so we can get those jobs and opportunities out there in the regions. Do you know the only thing stopping it at the moment? It is the major oil companies who will not commit to doing it. For years and years they have not put in the effort to take up ethanol and get it out there into the community.
We as the government have recognised the benefits that ethanol puts forward. There is absolutely no doubt about that. When you look at the focus at the moment on climate change and renewable energy, you have to ask: why are we not ensuring that there is more ethanol-blend fuel out there in the marketplace? The way to ensure it is through getting the major oil companies to meet their commitment. At the end of last year they committed to meeting those targets. The percentage of total fuel that that ethanol means to them is negligible. It is a tiny amount compared to the billions of litres of fuel that are consumed in this nation. So why aren’t they doing it? I do not know the answer. They have had years and years. It is not about just these 12 months. Our policy was in place for the 2001 election. They have had years and years to improve their uptake of ethanol and they have not done it.
The government, quite rightly, some time ago announced funding for capital grants to help develop the ethanol industry. That was a terrific initiative, a very good measure. What we are seeing now is that some of those companies that were the recipients of that funding have had to hand it back because they cannot get any certainty because the major oil companies will not enter into contracts and so they cannot get on with their development. To me, that is appalling. It all hinges on the major oil companies’ increased use of ethanol. Why aren’t they doing it? As I travel around the state I have people ask me, ‘Why can’t we get access to ethanol-blended fuel? Why is it not there?’ Years ago there was a scare campaign. It was to scare people away from ethanol. There were signs that said, ‘No ethanol at this service station’. We are finally getting past that. We are finally getting to the point where people out there in the community want to embrace ethanol. They want to use it. They want it in their fuel mix.
So we have this situation where the government wants to see greater use of biofuels. We are doing a lot to make sure that that happens. We had the commitment from the major oil companies at the end of last year that they would work with the government to meet the targets. At the other end of the scale we have the consumers who want to use it. What is in the middle? The major oil companies who will not increase their uptake. Quite frankly, I think 15 million litres is pathetic. It is appalling. Compare that to the situation overseas in Brazil and the US where they are using around 15 billion litres each. Here the major oil companies come up with 15 million litres. Why is that? Is it perhaps that overseas it is regulated—that there is a requirement to do it? What I would like to see is a requirement placed on the major oil companies if they are not going to meet this voluntary target.
What was the point of entering into an agreement at the end of last year? What was the point of getting that commitment if we are now going to say, ‘It’s okay not to meet the commitment. That’s fine. We’ll do it next year. We’ll do it the year after that. That won’t be a problem.’ We need that commitment now. It will continue to get pushed back. We have all these wonderful people around this nation who have terrific ideas for setting up ethanol developments. It is tremendous in terms of regional development. But they cannot get going because there is no certainty. They cannot do it because the major oil companies are not doing enough.
So again I say: the commitment was there last year. The major oil companies and the government agreed on these voluntary targets. I say: what is the point of a voluntary target if it is not going to be met? There was a commitment and it should be met. If those voluntary targets are not going to be reached then there should be a requirement. All it would be doing, if we put a mandate on those targets, is turning the expectation that we had into a requirement.
I cannot be more firm in my belief that this country needs a strong and sustainable biofuels industry. It is for the benefit of people right across this nation. I call on those major oil companies to meet their commitment, and I call on the government to mandate those targets if they do not.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Biofuels</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST,4,1,speech

Is the minister aware that this weekend marks five years in custody without trial or conviction for Australian man Mr David Hicks? Can the minister explain why the Prime Minister has been so callous as to let an Australian rot in a foreign jail without trial for half of the life of his government? Now that coalition backbenchers have joined the calls of every state and territory Attorney-General, the UK Attorney-General, the UK Lord Chancellor, a former High Court judge and many other eminent Australians, will the government ask the United States to release Mr Hicks into Australian custody so that he can be dealt with under our laws?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Mr David Hicks</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2006-12-06,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Why is the government so weak and lacking in compassion in standing up for the rights of Australians? Why can’t David Hicks be returned to Australia immediately and, if he is assessed to be posing a risk to the community, control orders could be used to monitor his movements? Isn’t this a fairer process than keeping him locked forever without trial in Guantanamo Bay?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Mr David Hicks</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2006-12-06,"—This is a matter which, of course, the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General have been working on assiduously for some time. They have been making strong representations to the United States and telling the United States that Australia believes that this man should be brought to trial as soon as possible. I understand that the Attorney-General in a recent visit to the United States conveyed that sentiment personally to the Attorney-General of the United States. I also understand that the Attorney-General met with Terry Hicks, the father of David Hicks, recently in Adelaide and discussed the situation with him. The family raised a number of issues with the Attorney-General. He sought advice on the conditions of Mr Hicks’s detention from US authorities as a result of that and that is being pursued.
Throughout all of this, going back to when I visited Washington some years ago, we have made it very clear to the United States that this man should be brought to trial. He was charged and as a result of an appeal, Hamdan v Rumsfeld, those proceedings were stayed. The consequential decision in Hamdan v Rumsfeld necessitated a change in the regulations to the military commission that is dealing with Mr Hicks. We understand that Mr Hicks will be charged under these new arrangements and we have indicated in the strongest possible terms that all of the safeguards and concessions that we obtained previously will be applied and we received those assurances.
—He’s been in jail longer than the war has lasted in Iraq.
—Order! Senator Sherry, shouting across the chamber is disorderly.
—The counterterrorism laws that we have in Australia today were not in place at the time of the alleged activities of Mr Hicks. We have made it very clear that, if he were to be returned to Australia, he could not be tried accordingly. We have treated this matter seriously. I reject totally that the Prime Minister has been callous in his approach. I reiterate that the Attorney-General met with David Hicks’s father recently. On, I think, some 17 occasions, Australian officials have visited Mr Hicks. In relation to his welfare, there have been two formal investigations carried out by United States authorities and, of course, we will continue to address any request for assistance from his counsel. Major Mori was here in Australia recently, we understand in relation to the conduct of Mr Hicks’s defence, and we stand ready to assist should a mutual assistance request be made to us in relation to any evidence that is sought.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Mr David Hicks</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,answer

That is totally untrue. We are making it very clear that Australia believes that this man should be brought to trial and we are saying to the United States that that should be done as soon as possible. He has been there for a lengthy period of time. There have been court proceedings which have necessitated a delay in the proceedings of the charges. He was previously charged on three serious counts in relation to his alleged activities and we believe that the military commission is an appropriate way to deal with him, but he should be brought to trial as soon as possible.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Mr David Hicks</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,answer
"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2006-12-06,"—My question is to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell. Will the minister advise the Senate of any impediments to the Howard government’s efforts to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions through the expansion of the use of natural gas?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Climate Change</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,question
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2006-12-06,"—I thank Senator Adams for asking such an incredibly important question. We know that the world in the postindustrial era has pumped about a trillion tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. We know that has happened over the last 150 years. We know that, on a business as usual basis with no change to how we produce and use energy, we will double that in about 50 years. We know that the consequence, based on a consensus of the best scientists around the world focusing on that, is that there will be global warming. This has been in the order of 0.6 to 0.7 of a degree in the last 100 years. We know that there would be double the rate of warming at the poles. We know that has the potential to increase sea levels, particularly if there is a melting of the Greenland icecap. That could be catastrophic for ecosystems and for places like the Barrier Reef and the coastal regions of Western Australia, in Senator Adams’s home state. We know that could be catastrophic for the global economy and for mankind.
We know that, as a globe, we need to take this seriously. We need an effective international agreement on greenhouse gas reductions. We also need to take action domestically in Australia. One of the great contributions that Australia can make to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions around the world is to export our liquefied natural gas, much of which comes from the state of Western Australia off the Kimberley coast and, in the future, off the Pilbara coast. We know that that industry can deliver greenhouse gas reductions of 25 million tonnes a year because, when you replace coal-fired or oil-burning power stations with beautifully clean Western Australian gas, you get a 40, 50, 60 or even 70 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. It is a transformational way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and it also produces 80,000 jobs in Australia and a $10 billion export industry.
There is a risk to this industry. The risk is from the Australian Labor Party in the guise of Dr Carmen Lawrence, a senior member of the Rudd Labor team, and their comrades in the Greens, who yesterday lodged an emergency heritage listing application for the Burrup Peninsula which, if it is successful, will stop the Pluto project, the biggest gas export project in Australia. I wrote to Mr Rudd, the new leader of the Labor Party, yesterday to bring this to his attention and to ask him to call in Dr Lawrence if he is serious about development in Australia, as he said he was in the Financial Review this morning. He said:
I think it’s the last big frontier of micro-economic reform.
He went on to say:
You talk to the business community. They pull their hair out about the way in which commonwealth and states fail to properly work together when it comes to their regulatory environment for getting business and development projects going.
This is the biggest project in Australia. The Premier of Western Australia and I have agreed on a process and now a member of his team wants to put a spanner in the spokes. If Mr Rudd wants to be leader, and if he is serious about Commonwealth and state cooperation on projects, the first thing he should do is call Dr Lawrence in and tell her to withdraw this frivolous and stupid application to close down the biggest project in Australia.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Climate Change</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,answer

Is it true that civilian personnel on board the rescue vessel had to themselves be rescued by defence after the vessel sank to the sea floor? Can the minister advise the Senate of the fate of the submarine rescue vessel—does it remain on the sea floor?

I was assured yesterday that the crew would be safe for a couple of days, but the good news that the minister was able to give me when I talked to him was that the crew have been recovered and that they are safe and well.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2006-12-06,"—I think that all senators would want to congratulate those involved in that rescue. The rescue demonstrates that we were successful in retrieving these two people from the bottom of the ocean, off Rottnest Island, I think. We know that the Labor Party have two policies on privatisation. When they were in power, they privatised Australian Airlines, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and the Commonwealth Bank. They sold all of those assets and used them to fund current expenditure: they sold the silver to pay the butler. The great thing that we on this side did when we privatised things is that we used the proceeds to pay off the debt that was racked up by  Labor. And now, having paid off all of Labor’s debt, we are now using the proceeds of privatisations to build up a Future Fund to make Australia economically secure for many years to come—a Future Fund that Rudd Labor would raid for short-term, politically expedient purposes. That is the difference. (Time expired)

"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2006-12-06,"—I wish to add to an answer that I provided to Senator Marshall yesterday in relation to Viewhills Manor home. Yesterday Senator Marshall made some assertions about Viewhills Manor home, claiming it had escaped penalty after failing some accreditation standards. In fact, that home had its accreditation period cut by two years as a result of the finding and it has been placed on a timetable for improvements. It will face another full audit within 12 months to make sure that it is on track.
The report on the agency website also states that the home undertook immediate actions following the review audit to lessen the impact of noncompliance on the residents and has developed an action plan to address the issues. On 17 November 2006 the department issued the home with a notice of noncompliance. This is the first step towards the imposition of sanctions which may be imposed if the deadline is not met. The Australian government has in place a comprehensive regulatory framework to ensure any instances of poor care are quickly dealt with. This includes the Commissioner for Complaints, the accreditation agency and the Department of Health and Ageing. The agency and the department will continue to closely monitor Viewhills Manor.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2006-12-06,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage (Senator Ian Campbell) to questions without notice asked today.
It has been 10 very long years that we have put up with the Howard government frustrating and obfuscating and pretending climate change is not happening, but lately we have been watching them squirm and struggle and try to work out a way that they can accept the fact that climate change is happening and not lose face. The bottom line for this government is that the tide has come in on them on climate change, both figuratively and literally. The government are scrambling to try and find a rational policy to deal with climate change. They have got a long way to go. It is very interesting to note that legislation being debated in this place this week does not go anywhere near it. Despite the specific opportunities presented to the Howard government, none of them have been taken.
It was on only 20 August this year that the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources of the Howard government infamously told the Sunday program that he was a ‘sceptic’ about the connection between emissions and climate change. And then on 27 September, in a disgraceful statement, the Prime Minister said he was not interested in what might happen in 50 years time. What an abrogation of responsibility. What a disgraceful way to let down not only Australia but the global movement to stem climate change. It is a serious threat to Australia’s environment and our ecology. Action is needed on the ground and in legislation, and it is not happening under this government. As I mentioned, we do have a bill before us at the moment, but there is no measure that the government is prepared to support in that legislation that will actually take tangible steps towards turning the problem around.
Today we heard Senator Polley’s question about the 16 faith organisations that have now joined the call for immediate, specific and useful action to stem climate change. They have joined with the community, with business groups, with schools, with children and with the Labor Party and other political parties to call for change.
Perhaps the most obvious and glaring example of the Howard government’s weakness is an incompetent Minister for the Environment and Heritage. Senator Carr today asked a question of Senator Ian Campbell about the Bald Hills wind farm once again having to threaten court action to force the minister to do his job. Let us see what has been going on today. The minister feigned ignorance about the latest submission from the proponents of the Bald Hills wind farm. Either he is completely and utterly incompetent or he is just pretending he did not know, because on the department’s website, dated 20 September 2006, is that submission that the minister claims he knows nothing about. Does that not prove that he is completely incompetent? I seek leave to table the submission for the interest of senators.
Leave not granted.
—Isn’t that a disgrace! It is there on the website. We are debating this issue. The act requires this submission to be on the website. The geniuses across the floor here today have decided not to agree to a public document being tabled which informs this debate. That sums up the incompetence that we are dealing with. This government has nowhere to go in the environmental debate. They cannot stand it when facts expose an incompetent minister in question time with just a few days to go of the federal parliament in 2006. It is no wonder it is widely expected that he is going to get the punt. What sort of dope of a minister, who did not even know that this document was on his site—
—I rise on a point of order. That is unparliamentary language and a reflection on the minister.
—Please withdraw, Senator Lundy.
—I withdraw. But this proposal that I am discussing—which has been denied leave to be tabled by government senators—clearly confirms that the minister misled the public over his claims that the project would kill one parrot every year instead of one bird every 1,000 years. This document shows it. No wonder they do not want it tabled here. It also confirms that the minister abused his power, misled the public and tried to cover his tracks. We all know, and it is firmly on the public record, that the Bald Hills wind farm was blocked in April as a political favour by the minister to the member for McMillan. We know that because he was ordered to pay costs and to reconsider the proposal. How incompetent is he? The proposal has been on the website and today in question time he did not even know it was there or what it contained. Well, well, well. He has been completely and thoroughly exposed as being incompetent to an extraordinary level. That just about sums up the Howard government’s performance on climate change, on environmental management and on the issue of the Bald Hills wind farm. (Time expired)

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2006-12-06,"—I can only assume that the ALP Senate Christmas party has started and they had a whip round to see if someone was prepared to talk about anything for five minutes. That is probably the most bizarre five-minute speech that I have ever heard in my life. We had this feigned indignation about the treatment of David Hicks. Do we hear a word about it? Was the taking note of answers about David Hicks?
—It will be.
—That would be a very pleasant change. Say no more: when the retiring senator is making more sense than one of Kevie’s kids, who came in here and talked about climate change—
—You need to refer to people in the other place by their correct title, Senator Ronaldson—if you are.
—Sorry, Mr Deputy President: the new Leader of the Opposition, who replaced poor Mr Beazley. You claimed to be serious. You came into this place during question time and wrung your hands with indignation about someone’s treatment, yet when you had the opportunity to speak on the issue during the taking note of answers—which even in my short time here I have seen is reserved for the discussion of important matters raised during question time—there was not one word. Instead, there was some extraordinary general spray about climate change. I have worked with Senator Lundy. We put together a report in relation to women in sport. She was clearly set up. I respect Senator Lundy, and we did a great job with that report. But she has been set up. How can you go out now into the public and talk about your concern for David Hicks when you did not have the intestinal fortitude or the intellectual rigour to raise the matter today during the taking note of answers?
I heard the interjections from across the chamber while the minister was giving his answers to the question on David Hicks. There was a wringing of the hands and interjections about how appalling this is. And at the first opportunity to debate it—your first opportunity to do what the minister did: talk about it—you slipped away. You think that this David Hicks matter is so incredibly serious that you took up half of question time with it, but you were not prepared to come in here and discuss it today.
I am still totally gobsmacked by Senator Lundy’s extraordinary climate change contribution. We got that for the leading item in the taking note of answers. Let us look at the issue of Bald Hills. If the Australian Labor Party is proud of the fact that they are making political mileage out of the protection of an endangered bird, then congratulations; if that is what turns them on, then congratulations. I find it quite extraordinary that you can be so duplicitous as to come in here and attack the minister for the environment—who is about 85 times more effective than you lot have been over the last 25 years. Why aren’t you attacking Rob Hulls in Victoria, who refused a permit for wind energy installation in Ballan—which is in my old seat of Ballarat—because of unacceptable risk to the wedge-tailed eagle? The wedge-tailed eagle is not on the threatened species list—albeit that there is no more magnificent animal than a wedge-tailed eagle. You have not had a go at Rob Hulls for the decision in relation to Ballan, but you have come in here day after day talking about the move by the minister for the environment in relation to the orange-bellied parrot. That was a disgraceful performance today. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Every time that you talk about David Hicks in public, I am going to remind you of what you did not do today. I am afraid that crocodile tears are no substitute for quality debate. You had the chance and you failed. (Time expired)

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2006-12-06,"—I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Ian Campbell to questions relating to the environment and climate change—or, should I say, his attempt, in his patronising response, to answer questions. This government has repeatedly demonstrated its ignorance when it comes to the environment and climate change. It has spent the last 10 years in office in complete denial that climate change is a serious problem and, for the last 10 years, it has failed to protect Australia’s environmental and economic future.
This is not just the opinion of members of the opposition; this is a known fact. The Howard government has not been concerned about climate change, because this government, which cares only for the here and now, knows nothing of the concept of planning for the future. This is obviously a view held by many, many Australians. We now see that Australia’s religious communities are uniting to demand action on this serious issue. Sixteen faith communities—including Anglicans, Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, Jews and Aboriginal Australians—have joined together to release a report, titled Common belief: Australia’s faith communities on climate change, which demands that this government act on climate change—and act now.
In its statement, the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils said, ‘The Howard government has a poor record on climate change.’ They were obviously being kind. We all know of this government’s refusal to sign the Kyoto protocol and how it has actively discouraged Australians from taking up more sustainable energy resources. Recently we saw the government move to end a rebate that was available for Australians who wanted to install solar energy systems in their homes. A campaign against that move was led by Mel and Kochie from Channel 7’s Sunrise program and resulted in more than 170,000 Australians signing a petition for the rebate program to be kept in place. Coincidentally, we then saw Mr Costello announce that that program would be kept. If this example is any indication, along with a continuing interest in Mel and Kochie’s Cool the Globe campaign, it would seem that a great majority of Australians are now aware of the very real issue of climate change and the fact that that action is needed.
The Howard government would have liked us all to believe that climate change is a myth—that this is just a scare tactic being bandied about by scientists and environmentalists. That is most certainly not the case. You only have to take a drive in the countryside around Canberra to see how dry this wonderful country of ours is. This is a problem that is not going to go away, and the only solution that the Prime Minister is offering is nuclear energy—another one of his ideological agendas left over from 20 years ago.
In the interfaith report on climate change, the Uniting Church of Australia was vehement in its opposition to nuclear energy, stating:
We believe that the continued research, development and implementation of renewable energy is an absolute priority for governments and industry in order to minimise greenhouse gas production. As a matter of urgency we must reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.
This report by Australia’s interfaith leaders, which represents more than 12½ million Australians, is the greatest demonstration yet of just how out of touch the Howard government is when it comes to the issue of climate change and the effect it is having on Australia’s environment.
I would have thought that some of my Tasmanian colleagues within the government—who I know identify themselves as members of the communities included in the report—would be urging Mr Howard and the Minister for the Environment and Heritage to take action. But it would appear that they are just as out of touch as their rest of their colleagues are with the Australian people on this issue. It is very disappointing.
Also of note in the report is the point made by the Federation of Islamic Councils that the rapid onset of climate change will only be slowed down by shifting the focus away from consumerism and ‘the concept of profit above everything else’. This attitude of profit above everything else resounds right through the Howard government. You only have to look at its so-called Work Choices laws or the Independent Contractors Bill that we debated in this place last week. Unfortunately for this government and for Australia, the government has failed to realise that climate change and the environment will have a far greater effect on our economy than they could ever have predicted. The report indicates just how much weight the Australian people put on this issue, whether the government likes it or not. Our religious leaders have confirmed what Labor has known for some time, and we will continue to put forward Labor’s plan to combat climate change.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Environment</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,11,1,speech
"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2006-12-06,"—For those who are listening to these proceedings on broadcast, I should explain that this is a period—known as ‘take note of answers’—of some half an hour when the government, the opposition and the minor parties get a chance to debate answers given during the Senate’s one-hour question time. It is an important period, particularly for oppositions. It gives them an extra chance to drive home their point, their theme, that they set up during question time. But I would have to say that I have been taking note of answers for many a year now, and this would have to be the most contemptible take note of answers from the opposition that I have ever known.
They come in here and feign compassion for Mr Hicks, who has been stuck for some five years in Guantanamo Bay. They raised at least four questions on the matter, and yet they have not raised the matter here in taking note of answers. And it really gets worse. I endorse everything that my colleague Senator Ronaldson said: the Labor Christmas party must be on, because it just got worse. Not only have they chosen not to raise the theme of their question time, which is a serious matter—particularly for the family—and a cause that they have apparently taken up. Not only have they decided not to raise it in taking note of answers, but they never intended to. We heard the mishmash address by Senator Lundy, but I can tell you that Senator Polley just made it worse. She had prepared her speech. This was a set-up. They never intended to raise the issue of Mr Hicks in Guantanamo Bay.
What was all that about? You had your speech prepared early this morning, Senator Polley. You were never going to raise the matter of Mr Hicks. It just got more contemptible. I say to Senator Ronaldson, if he is listening: it just got worse than what you believed it to be. Mr Deputy President, I have got to tell you that the government are of late most concerned about the Hicks issue—to the point where they have raised it with the President of the United States and have said that this man’s trial ought to be brought on. Yes, he has been in Guantanamo Bay for too long without trial. We have raised that with the President of the United States.
We show a political genuineness. We understand the elevation of this issue in the community; you do not. We have been genuine from day one. What I say about Mr Hicks is that he was caught with a gun in his hand, he did return to Afghanistan post September 11 and, apparently, he did train with the Taliban and al-Qaeda. There is enough circumstantial evidence for the Americans to believe that he should be charged, but they ought to charge him and get on with the trial quickly. That has been our genuineness. That is what we have raised with the Americans—and you cannot come into this chamber and sustain the argument. If I were Mr Hicks, I would be very worried about the Labor Party’s support and ability to sustain their interest. Instead of the Hicks issue, they came in here and raised the issue of the Bald Hills wind farm and the orange-bellied parrot—which time does not permit me to get on to. That is what you have raised in this motion to take note of answers. You have made a mockery of it. You have disgraced yourself.
You have elected a new leader this week who purports to bring in change and a fresh approach to the Labor Party. Where are the issues on the economy that you want to bring in? What do you think you lost the last election on? It was your credibility with regard to economics. You do not discuss that; you discuss the yellow-bellied parrot. Where is the IR issue that you are going to make the centrepiece for the next election? You do not bring in that issue; you discuss the yellow-bellied parrot. This has been one of the most disgraceful motions to take note of answers. All I can say is: thank goodness for Senator Stott Despoja. I am going to stay and listen to her address on Mr Hicks. We should all have an equal concern with regard to the delay in that trial. There are reasons given as to why that trial has been delayed as long as it has, but if you have a serious concern about it raise it in this chamber and use this period as an opportunity to do so. Senator Stott Despoja, I invite you to address the matter of Mr Hicks in Guantanamo Bay. (Time expired)

"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2006-12-06,"—I too am going to take note of answers given by Senator Ian Campbell, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage. I note that Senator McGauran is off on some bizarre analysis of the Labor Party’s responses in taking note today, when in fact the biggest issue of today is probably the release of the Australia state of the environment report 2006, which Senator Ian Campbell willingly referred to in his answers.
In the state of the environment report we find that greenhouse gas emissions in this country have risen by 22 per cent. When we asked the minister for the environment questions about the appalling state of the environment in this country at the moment, he made some comment about South Australia’s Coorong. I do not think he has ever been there. I do not think he has any idea what the Coorong is or how important it is to the whole Murray-Darling Basin system. He also made a comment about some pathetic commitment of 35 gigalitres to go into the Murray for the purposes of rehabilitating the Coorong wetlands—the Coorong wetlands which are about to be delisted because they are so degraded due to the inaction of this federal government. The Coorong wetlands need 1,500 gigalitres of water, and this government can find 35 gigalitres. It is an absolutely appalling response to a very serious issue.
Senator Ronaldson, in his bizarre spray, also made mention of Senate Christmas parties. I did not go to the Labor Senate Christmas party for too long last night, because I had the misfortune of having to be in this chamber listening to Senator Ian Campbell attempt to debate a very important piece of legislation—the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2006. It was a woeful performance from the minister in charge of the single biggest issue in Australia at the moment, and that is climate change. It was an absolutely woeful performance. It was puerile and we had sulky behaviour from him. We spent four hours debating one amendment last night, and Senator Ian Campbell’s contribution was to pick up the pronunciation of ‘Kyoto’ by senators opposite. So we had to endure elocution lessons from the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, instead of addressing the real issues of the day, including climate change. His bill does not even mention climate change. The bill that we spent four hours debating one amendment on last night, because of his complete lack of action with regard to the environment, does not even mention climate change.
We heard from Senator Julian McGauran just then about the yellow-bellied parrot. Is that another endangered species, Senator McGauran? There is no yellow-bellied parrot. I think there has been comment made about yellow-bellied ministers but not yellow-bellied parrots. It was in fact the orange-bellied parrot. So we have helped you out there, Senator McGauran.
We did note today in question time that the proponents of the Bald Hills wind farm are threatening legal action against the federal government because this minister has taken so long to respond to their legitimate request for a decision so that they can get on with either building or not building the $220 million wind farm that the people of Victoria need so that they can have clean green energy. Isn’t that what we are all about? What does your minister do? Sit down and do nothing. He does not even know what submissions are on the department’s own website.
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I am quite taken by Senator McEwen now launching into an off-the-cuff speech which would now give her an opportunity of some two minutes to turn her attention to Mr David Hicks. I invite her to do so.
—There is no point of order, Senator McGauran.
—With regard to the submission from the Bald Hills wind farm proponents, I would like to give the government another opportunity to make good the ridiculous mistake they made last time when they neglected to agree to table the document that is on their own website. I seek leave to table the documents that were referred to earlier by Senator Lundy.
Leave not granted.
—They are great, aren’t they? They would not have a clue what was going on with the environment. They do not even know what is on their own website. What a spectacular result from the minister that is. After all, this is the minister who cannot tell a cow from a horse. We remember that wonderful contribution we got from him about cattle grazing in the Victorian alpine region. He cannot tell one four-legged critter from another, but he is pretty good at flying around the world trying to protect the whales. I do not think he has protected one, but he manages to wear his lovely blue bracelet every day. When he is pointing and wagging his finger across the chamber at us— (Time expired)

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2006-12-06,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The need for the Australian Government to develop its own plan to withdraw all Australian troops not involved in personal security roles from Iraq as soon as practicable, given that:
The March 2003 invasion of Iraq and Mr Bush’s 2005 ‘Victory in Iraq’ strategy paper has demonstrably failed and, as Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, former United States Secretary of State, Colin Powell, and former Iraqi Prime Minister, Ayad Allawi, have all said, Iraq has descended into civil war;
The Bush Administration-appointed Iraq Study Group report, due on 6 December 2006, is tipped to recommend that America begins a phased withdrawal of combat brigades in Iraq, starting in 2007 and ending in 2008;
The United Kingdom announced its intentions to hand over security in Basra in 2007;
A poll by the University of Maryland found 71 per cent of Iraqis now want the United States out of Iraq; and
Former United States Defense Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, suggested that the United States should consider an accelerated draw down of bases.
Three years and nine months ago, Australia joined the United States in invading another country based on a lie. Last month, finally, a US committee on intelligence said that there was little or no evidence to support claims by US intelligence of weapons of mass destruction or links between Iraq and al-Qaeda—something that weapons inspectors and intelligence analysts had been telling anyone who would listen well before the invasion. The strike was all over within weeks. Iraq not only had no weapons of mass destruction but had very little by way of military defence in the face of the firepower from the world’s most heavily armed country.
When you keep changing the rationale for pre-emptive strikes—one day weapons of mass destruction, the next day liberation of the people from an evil dictator—the problem is you never know when the job is done. Now the talk is about the need to protect the fledgling democracy we imposed on Iraq to stop Iraq tearing itself apart. Of course there are many ways of liberating a country. Usually the residents of that country rise up and liberate themselves. That is how America did it. Citizens also do it through non-violent, mass civil disobedience. That is how India did it. You can get the world to boycott a regime until they are so ostracised they capitulate. That is how South Africa did it. Or you can just wait them out and sooner or later the king’s legions simply leave. That is how Canada did it.
Against the advice of the United Nations Security Council and the Australian parliament, and despite the biggest mass demonstrations ever seen in our streets, our Prime Minister decided we would join in the invasion of Iraq—and it turns out that he made that decision well before he told us.
The Democrats strongly opposed this invasion of Iraq. However, we did recognise that once the bombing had stopped we had an obligation to help rebuild the massively damaged infrastructure. Three years and nine months on, the postwar death toll is higher than that caused by the invasion—all up an estimated 600,000 people. Heroic assumptions about bringing democracy have all but failed. Basic services are still a pipedream. The reputation of the United States has been sullied by Abu Ghraib and massacred civilians. Oil supply arrangements and lucrative rebuilding contracts have benefited the occupier.
It is little wonder that our presence is doing more harm than good, regardless of how necessary our work might be, or might be seen to be. Fourteen hundred Australian soldiers are still there as an occupying force. According to the University of Maryland, more than two-thirds of Iraqis want us all out. Richard Woolcott, former secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, says that the world and Australia have been less safe since the invasion and occupation of Iraq and terrorism has increased in Iraq and beyond, including in Indonesia. Although it was a minor terrorist target before the invasion, he says Australia is now a much higher profile target than it was. Dr Scott Burchill says:
The war was lost 2 years ago, and the insurgents have been celebrating their victory ever since by attacking coalition troops and tormenting the civilian population. It cannot be won now by extending or intensifying the occupation. Many insurgents presumably want US, UK and Australian troops to stay on where they can be further humiliated. As US General Casey admitted last year, the presence of coalition troops fuels the insurgency. A withdrawal, on the other hand, removes its raison d’etre.
The invasion of Iraq has been very costly in humanitarian, economic and environmental terms too. The cost to Australia of the Iraq war will be $1.6 billion by the end of the year. Two thousand nine hundred and six American soldiers are dead. Luckily, Australia has had no deaths in action but hundreds around the world have died in retaliatory terrorism incidents. The cost to Iraq and innocent Iraqi civilians is incalculable. An estimated 655,000 civilians have died since the invasion. Amnesty suggests women are no better off now in terms of safety than under Saddam Hussein, with increased murders and sexual abuse, including by US forces. Former US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, and former Iraqi Prime Minister, Iyad Allawi, say that Iraq has descended into civil war. Kofi Annan says the situation in Iraq is worse than civil war, that the ordinary life for Iraqis is far more dangerous than it was under Saddam.
The majority of Iraqis see us as part of an occupying force that is delivering nothing but instability and violence and not liberation. Sixty-one per cent of all Iraqis support insurgent attacks on US troops. It should be a lesson to us that you cannot bring peace by force, that you cannot always impose the Western notion of democracy—with its many flaws—and that you cannot impose cultural change from without, particularly from a Western nation that is so clearly at odds with the norms and the religious bases of its warring factions. The international chorus has been joined by a growing number of Australians from across the political spectrum and within defence, but this government has nothing to say.
We will not be with President Bush and Tony Blair, who are meeting in Washington tomorrow to talk about a phased withdrawal, starting early next year. In a classified memo leaked over the weekend, former US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld laid out a series of policy options that included a modest withdrawal of US troops. The UK defence secretary announced on 27 November that the number of British troops in Iraq will be ‘significantly’ reduced by a ‘matter of thousands’ by the end of 2007. The Iraq Study Group report, due today, is tipped to recommend that America begin a phased withdrawal of combat brigades in Iraq, starting next year, saying this should pressure the Iraqi government to clamp down on sectarian violence.
The Prime Minister may be incapable of admitting his terrible mistake. Indeed, he said a week or so ago that he still holds the view that the decision to invade Vietnam was right. The least he can now do is show some clear leadership rather than wait for instructions from Mr Bush. We should not be stuck here waiting for the US to tell us what to do next, waiting for the next piece of hollow rhetoric from President Bush about victory and staying until the job is done. He is apparently not going to cut and run. Apparently Mr Howard said a couple of weeks ago that he would pass on ‘some ideas and information about how to reduce the violence in Iraq’ but what this is is anyone’s guess. Is he ready with a plan? It does not seem so. I hope Mr Bush gives the Prime Minister a heads-up before he announces the US withdrawal; otherwise we will still be there when everyone else has gone.
More violence never stopped violence. Only talking, diplomacy, agreement and sorting out the issues have delivered long-lasting peace. The Democrats say that the way to peace and stability in Iraq, as elsewhere, is to withdraw Australian troops other than personnel essential in protecting diplomatic staff, encourage engagement of the warring factions and the Iraqi people in ceasefire talks, and divert the billions that are currently spent on keeping troops in Iraq to rebuild essential services and schools and hospitals.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,MATTERS OF URGENCY,20,1,speech
"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2006-12-06,"—I do not think that in almost the decade that I have been here I have heard a more anti-American or un-Australian speech from anyone in this place. I want to disassociate myself from that speech by Senator Allison—that limp-wristed, hollow-chested, unwashed, left-wing rubbish that she has just spoken about. I find that speech absolutely and totally appalling. Let me go through some of these items that Senator Allison has brought before us as a matter of importance today.
She spoke of the need for the Australian government to develop its own plan to withdraw all Australian troops not involved in personal security roles as soon as practicable. I guess she changed ‘practicable’ from ‘possible’ at some stage. Of course there is always a plan to withdraw the troops—when the job is done. Senator Allison did not mention Saddam Hussein once, one of the most heinous killers this world has ever seen. She railed against America and Australia and those allied troops and those young men and women that went to Iraq to defend the rest of the free world. She talked about the Western democracy with all its flaws; has she talked about Saddam Hussein and the people that he has killed, the people he has been responsible for? Has she talked about the democracy that we are trying to establish in that part of the world? Has she talked to other people that come to this country from Iraq? Today in this country we have the Minister for Foreign Relations, the Hon. Falah Bakir, who is in this house at the moment, from the Kurdistan Regional Government—not in the chamber, but in the house. If she wished to talk to him, he would tell her something about Iraq. He would tell her about his own relatives that have been slaughtered in Iraq. He would tell her about the thousands of people that have been slaughtered there.
I have been to Iraq on several occasions and I must say that I have learned to have a great affinity and in fact a great affection for Iraqi people, knowing as I do that which they have suffered. I do find this one of the more disturbing speeches that I have heard from the left-wing rhetoric of Senator Allison. It was a disgraceful speech, one I am appalled by, and I am ashamed that it should have been spoken in this house. Senator Allison spoke of and condemned America and Australia, but she did not condemn Saddam Hussein. Hasn’t Senator Allison heard of that killer? Hasn’t she got something bad to say about the 20 or 30 years he spent in power and the hundreds of thousands of people he was responsible for killing? She never mentioned once his invasion of Kuwait and the tens of thousands of people that were maimed and lost their lives in that particular takeover of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein. She never mentioned once the appalling war between Iran and Iraq where thousands upon thousands of young men and women lost their lives in a conflict that ended in both parties drawing apart with no ground gained and nothing lost, an abortive situation there.
What does Senator Allison believe we should do to defend democracy, to defend our colleagues who have always come to our aid—the Americans? Does she honestly believe that after the appalling thing that happened on September 11 we should have done nothing? Does Senator Allison believe that the damage being done to Iraq is coming from people inside Iraq? She must know, if she reads anything at all about the truth of the Iraqi war, that the allies, of which Australia is a significant part, are attempting to rebuild the country. We are not in Iraq to fight and kill people. We are there to defend democracy, to re-establish the democracy that has been missing from Iraq for generations. We are there to assist in the rebuilding of Iraq and in the re-education of the Iraqi people, who suffered for so long under Saddam Hussein—but I heard no condemnation of that by Senator Allison.
I have been to Iraq and I have seen its magnificent renaissance, not around Fallujah or Tikrit or the green zone or the so-called Sunni triangle but in the state in the northern part of Iraq known as Kurdistan. Great things are happening there. There are more children at school in Kurdistan now than there have ever been before in Kurdistan’s history. For the first time in generations, in perhaps 100 years or more, Kurds are safe and secure within the boundaries that have been set by international recognition. There are new hotels being built in Kurdistan, particularly in Irbil and Sulaimaniyah. There are also new universities being built in those towns, Sulaimaniyah and Irbil, as well as in other places. There are more female university students than male students in the three universities in Kurdistan. There is a whole new world opening up. That new world opened up because Australia and America came to the aid of a people who were suffering the most appalling actions, hundreds and thousands of them losing their lives each month.
I have been to Iraq several times and I intend to go there again early next year, making it my fourth trip. I have been to Baghdad too. There are things that need to be done, but there are things that are impossible to do because of the insurgency. But these insurgents—these killers, these people who kill in the name of God—do not come from inside the Iraqi borders. They come from Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia and, to a lesser degree, Yemen, Syria and Turkey—all of the countries that abut Iraq. They do not come from inside Iraq. They are people who are trained to kill. They are people whose brains have gone. They are people who, if there is a God, will never get into heaven under any circumstances. These people who kill in the name of God are condemned to hell forever. They certainly will not get any rewards.
But Senator Allison did not say any of those things. She did not condemn Saddam Hussein, who—I might use the expression ‘God willing’—will shortly be despatched from this earth. She said that the Iraq Study Group appointed by the Bush administration is ‘tipped to recommend’. What does she mean by ‘tipped’? Does she have inside information? I do not think she has. I do not think any decent person who had inside information on Iraq would talk to Senator Allison. That she would use something as emotional and ambiguous in this urgency motion quite surprises me, even coming from Senator Allison.
She went on to say that the UK had announced its intention to hand over security in Basra next year. But Basra and Umm Qasr, in the south of the country, are not under threat like areas around the capital, Baghdad, or the birthplace of Saddam Hussein, Tikrit, or Fallujah, with its radical mullahs. Basra is a place where security could easily be handed over. And, once the job is done, all of the foreign troops—American, Australian and others—will be withdrawn. They will stay there until then, by invitation of course. South Korea has 3½ thousand people in the northern part of Iraq who are there at the invitation of the democratically elected Kurdistan Regional Government. There are lots of things to do in Iraq. Once the job is done, our plan is to withdraw. That has been said many, many times. To say, at the beginning of this motion, that there is no exit plan is completely and totally misleading.
Senator Allison also said that a poll by the University of Maryland in the United States found that 71 per cent of Iraqis want the US out of Iraq. What does Senator Allison mean by that? What was the standard of this alleged poll? Who did it question? Where was it done? Did it poll expatriate Iraqis? Did it poll Iraqis who are sympathetic to some other cause? Did it poll people who alleged they were Iraqi? How can Senator Allison have any credibility with a motion of this type and on this scale?
Lastly, Senator Allison said former US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld suggested that the US should consider ‘an accelerated draw-down of US bases’. Having been in the Army, I do not know what she means by that. The language, the interpretation and the words, to me, are strange—very strange. I understand what she wants to do: she wants to discredit Australia and the United States by bringing forward this motion here today. The motion has no credibility. It is appalling. I feel very sorry for the people of Iraq and I assure them that the sentiments that Senator Allison expressed here today have nothing whatsoever to do with the vast majority of people in Australia.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,MATTERS OF URGENCY,20,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2006-12-06,"—I think we all agree with Senator Lightfoot that we are sorry for the people of Iraq but, unfortunately, he does not address any of the key issues about resolving the situation. Labor does not support this urgency motion. As it stands, the motion does not reflect the entirety of Labor’s policy position, but it is an important debate and I am happy to join it.
There are elements in the motion that reflect Labor’s position, and I am going to concentrate on some of those. Let me say from the outset: Labor has always been opposed to this war. We voted against Australian participation. We spoke out against the government’s refusal to abide by the United Nations charter and its defiance of the United Nations Security Council resolution, and we strongly opposed the Howard government’s haste to involve our military forces in the war. Our position on the war has never changed. Our position is on the public record.
Labor’s position, and that of the millions of Australians who opposed this war, has been vindicated by the horrific events that have occurred every day since the invasion. The motion before us today is important because it asks the question: what is John Howard’s strategy for the future of Iraq? This question is vital as Iraq descends into a quagmire. It is a civil war. Iraqis are dying at a rate of 100 a day; the Pentagon has estimated that over 50,000 have died as a result of the war. According to the Lancet, perhaps 600,000 Iraqis are dead from the war and its effects.
Iraq has a population of some 26 million people. We know that over 1.6 million Iraqis have been internally displaced and an additional 1.8 million have fled their homeland. The security of the civilian population has clearly diminished—and it is not enough to say that Saddam Hussein was a butcher; we have to deal with the reality now. Overnight, the new US defence secretary, Robert Gates, testified that he believed the war was being lost. His statement before congress was not a surprise; but it is welcome for its acknowledgement of the reality of the situation facing the Iraqi people and the coalition.
Of the 18 provinces in Iraq, the handover of security responsibilities has only occurred in two provinces despite a police force of some 130,000 trained police, other police units of 176,000 and an army of 130,000. The multinational force in Iraq of some 140,000 troops and the trained Iraqi security forces have failed to curb an insurgency by Sunni Muslims, and it has failed to curb the violence by Shiite Muslim militias linked to religious parties in the majority Shiite dominated government.
The United States is moving to reassess its Iraq strategy. Secretary Gates’s testimony came a day before the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, headed by former Secretary of State James A Baker, releases its recommendations. Mr Baker briefed President Bush on the findings on Tuesday, and we can anticipate what the Iraq Study Group will recommend. Secretary Gates, of course, was a panel member of the Iraq Study Group but quit after President Bush nominated him to become the new defence secretary.
We know that two days before resigning as defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld informed President Bush that the US strategy was not working and adjustments needed to be made. This is the man that helped plan and engineer the war. He referred to possible troop withdrawals and an accelerated draw-down in the number of security bases in Iraq: from 55 bases to 10 to 15 bases by April 2007 and to five bases by July 2007.
Unlike the United States, John Howard is refusing to face up to the reality of our Iraq engagement. Many Australians now acknowledge that this government is guilty of changing its story on Iraq to suit its political interests, not the Australian national interest. Many Australians now reject the government’s glib use of slogans such as ‘cut and run’ or ‘stay till the job is done’, which are still used to justify our participation in the quagmire in Iraq.
The core issue in the urgency motion is correct. It refers to the strategic plans that the government has for Iraq’s future. It is about what has been discussed with other allied governments and it is about working out the priority of our efforts, our objectives and the manner of achieving them. It is about the clarity of the message, not the ambiguity of concealment.
As Kevin Rudd said some weeks ago, the question is how this government proposes to stabilise Iraq’s security and how this government will bring about political arrangements in Iraq that give the Iraqi people hope for the future. It is about John Howard’s plan for overcoming the problems that were generated from the effects of the war and the abject failure of postwar planning.
Many Australians now accept that this government was guilty of taking Australians to war for the wrong reasons. There were no weapons of mass destruction. The prewar intelligence was flawed. There was no reconstruction plan for the postwar period. Many Australians now criticise John Howard’s decision to commit our troops to the war because it has made Australia a bigger target for terrorists. The evidence is clear that even more jihadists are being trained in Iraq—trained to unleash terror on any part of the world in the years to come. The Iraq war has generated a more militant Islamism, which may never have eventuated in different circumstances. But the Prime Minister refuses to admit that this is the outcome of the Iraq war and to accept any responsibility for this.
So where is the government’s strategy for Iraq’s future? It has definitely not been made clear by John Howard. The Prime Minister recently admitted that ‘democracy has a reasonable chance if that is the wish of the Iraqi people’. That is a long way and a huge backdown from the euphoric speeches on how the democratisation of Iraq in the postwar period would lead to the eventual democratisation of the Middle East. Remember those heady days? No-one talks that talk anymore.
On 19 October this year, Mr Howard indicated that Iraq may turn out to be a split state. This was probably the first public utterance from our Prime Minister that acknowledged the reasons for the civil war and the chaos that has engulfed Iraq. He recently stressed on ABC radio that ‘a signpost for determining Australia’s troop withdrawal will be the handover of security responsibility to the Iraqi forces’. What does that mean? Does this mean after the Iraqi security forces have taken responsibility for eight, 10, 12 or 18 provinces? Why doesn’t he inform the nation? It is time that he laid out for the Australian people what is to happen and when, and what the conditions of play are.
As the urgency motion indicates, during the next week the US administration may be forced to review and initiate a new Iraq strategy. This will come about because of the convergence of the Iraq Study Group report with the Pentagon’s ongoing internal revision of the operational and tactical use of US forces in Iraq. This convergence comes after the UK government confirmed that the security of Basra will be handed over to the Iraqis next year.
Where is our government in all this? Where is the Australian plan? Have discussions occurred with our allies? I do not know. Iraq has certainly entered a new phase. So how has the Howard government responded? On Monday and Tuesday this week Labor senators, including me, asked Senator Minchin these very questions. On Monday he responded by saying that Australia is:
... committed to remaining in Iraq while we believe that (a) we are welcome there at the invitation of the government of Iraq and while they profess the need for our modest forces to remain and (b) we are making a contribution. We continue to believe that we are making a contribution ... What we will not do ... is simply exit.
On Tuesday, Senator Minchin reverted to the familiar ‘staying the course’ assertion, with a number of ‘cut and runs’ thrown in for good measure and the declaration that the ultimate withdrawal of Australian troops ‘will not be based on some arbitrary calendar’.
Well, we know what it will not be, but what will it be? What is the plan? Or is it in fact the case that we are just waiting for the Americans to tell us? The aim, Senator Minchin added, is to bring ‘peace, order and good government to the people of Iraq’. Very laudable, but there was no mention that the Iraqi nation should be either unified or split before the withdrawal of our forces. There was no clarification of what the security of the people means in military terms, let alone political terms, and there was no indication of how good governance could be achieved for the Iraqi people. Indeed, the lack of specifics shows that the Howard government is playing the waiting game: waiting to see what others do, waiting to see how the political and military landscape will change before deciding on a course of action, waiting to assess the political fallout domestically. So much for the national interest.
It is time for the Howard government to face up to the reality in Iraq. It is time for the government to make some tough decisions. What is John Howard’s and the Liberal government’s plan for our troops in Iraq? It seems to me that there isn’t one.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,MATTERS OF URGENCY,20,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2006-12-06,"—The Australian Greens have opposed the war in Iraq from the outset and all the way through. I think we are the last party standing in terms of having that consistent position right the way through. We have seen wavering views expressed by the opposition and by the Democrats, but the Greens are pleased that more and more people are joining us in our view that the war in Iraq is a disaster and has always been a disaster. Indeed, just last month we saw millions of Americans vote that way. What we saw in the United States in their congressional elections was millions of Americans saying: ‘Wrong way, George Bush. The war in Iraq is a disaster.’
Americans know it and Australians know it, but the Australian government refuses to accept the inevitable. It refuses to take off the ideological blinkers and see the reality on the ground in Iraq—the quagmire that we are stuck in. It refuses to acknowledge the hundreds of thousands of Iraqis who have lost their lives because of this folly. That is the position of the Australian government. It refuses to accept the mistakes it has made and the responsibility that it bears for those mistakes.
In the United States, as a result of those millions of Americans voting to say that George Bush has done the wrong thing in Iraq, we have seen some change in leadership. We have seen a new US defence secretary. Donald Rumsfeld, who created the disaster, has been kicked out, and now we have a new US Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, whose job I am sure none of us envies, coming in and trying to fix the disaster that has been created by the Bush administration and by Donald Rumsfeld. I do not know very much about this guy, but as he is a former head of the CIA we probably do not share the same ideological views.
We may not share the same ideological views, but I can say one thing for the new US defence secretary: at least he is honest. Overnight, we heard the new US Secretary of Defense being asked a number of questions by the congress. He was asked whether or not, given the information we know now, it was the right thing for America to have invaded Iraq. He did not say, ‘Yes, I’m a lackey of the Bush administration and I’ll say yes.’ He did not say that. He refused to say that they had made the right decision by going into Iraq. What he said was: ‘History will judge them.’
And history will judge this decision. History will judge the Bush administration, and history will judge John Howard’s government. History will judge whether or not these over 100,000 Iraqis should have died. History will ask: did the right thing occur? And I predict that history will find that the position that my party, the Australian Greens, has taken from the outset has been the correct position to take on this issue. It is a moral position; it is a just position—that is, that hundreds of thousands of Iraqis should not have to die.
—Don’t exaggerate.
—We have seen a number of estimates for how many Iraqis have died. They range from 150,000—the figure put out by the Iraqi government that this government supports—up to 650,000. Wherever you choose to put it, the Greens say that it is, at the very least, 150,000 too many Iraqi lives. That is why the Australian Greens have been consistent in our position in opposing this war in Iraq.
What we need now is some honesty from the Australian government. I asked the Chief of the Defence Force at estimates whether or not we were losing the war in Iraq, and he did not give the same honest answer that I think we saw overnight from the US defence secretary. What we are seeing in the United States is an acknowledgement of the policy failure and an acknowledgement that we are losing the war in Iraq. I will be moving a motion tomorrow on behalf of the Australian Greens which calls on the government to acknowledge the inevitable, take off those ideological blinkers and see what the rest of the world has seen: Iraq is a disaster.

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2006-12-06,"—I can say this much: at least the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate made a measured statement, stating his party’s position, which I do not agree with, but at least the contribution that he made was rational. I will make some comments about it later. But I was appalled at Senator Allison’s contribution. It was full of mistruths. I have heard the Democrats described as ‘the fairies at the bottom of the garden’. I guess the best thing to say is that you would have to be a fairy at the bottom of the garden to believe some of the things that Senator Allison said.
Also, the only thing that I can draw from both Senator Allison’s contribution and Senator Nettle’s contribution is that they wish that Saddam Hussein was still in power in Iraq. I can draw no other conclusion. Because Saddam Hussein only murdered 300,000 or 400,000 people—cold-blooded murder! I am not surprised that Senator Nettle is leaving the chamber because there is one thing they cannot deny—that had these events not taken place there is nothing surer than that Saddam Hussein would still be in power and he would still be killing people at the rate that he was killing them before. So your 600,000 could be anything up to one million. Nobody believes that figure of 600,000.
As a matter of fact, at estimates the Chief of the Defence Force was asked, ‘Is there any official count of people who are killed in the Iraq war?’ I think Senator Nettle may have been there when that question was asked. The Chief of the Defence Force said, ‘No, there is no official count, but the most believable estimate is around 50,000.’ And you say over 600,000, because you only believe what you want to believe, Senator Nettle.
We had Senator Allison saying that they could have got rid of the Saddam Hussein regime by civil disobedience. Has she got any concept of what civil disobedience is and how people who used civil disobedience were treated in Saddam Hussein’s Iraq? They were murdered. They were tortured. They were put through all forms of torture. And Senator Allison came here and said they should have overthrown the Saddam Hussein government by civil disobedience! I have never heard anything so ridiculous in my life.
She then talked about other methods and how other countries had managed to obtain their independence. I think she referred to the American Civil War. Before the American Civil War took place you did not have a dictator who was killing people at a rate of knots, which is what happened in the time of Saddam Hussein. I cannot believe some of the things that Senator Allison was saying in trying to justify her case.
She talked about the humiliation of Australian troops. It is an insult to say that our troops have been humiliated. Our troops have never been humiliated in Iraq. They have fought with distinction in Iraq. I am sure Senator Nettle would not go and see them, but in fact those who are there and those who have returned have all fought with distinction. They have never been humiliated. They have represented their country very proudly. It is an insult to talk about the humiliation of Australian troops.
Senator Allison talked about retaliatory terrorism. Retaliating to what? Was 9-11 retaliatory terrorism? It happened two years before the Iraq war even occurred. Was the Bali bombing retaliatory terrorism? It happened before the Iraq war even started. So we have this ridiculous statement from Senator Allison about retaliatory terrorism against the Western world when the most significant of these events started before the Iraq war even started. What a ridiculous argument from Senator Allison!
She talked about a whole range of other things. She mentioned Richard Woolcott and a whole range of other people, most of whom are leading left-wing commentators. Senator Allison dragged out those commentators that suit her argument—like most people do—but most of them are unbelievable.
I congratulate Senator Evans on his measured response. I am pleased to see that the Labor Party are not supporting this urgency motion. He said that the position of the Labor Party has been vindicated by the events that have taken place since the termination of the initial part of the Iraq war. If the Labor Party believe that their position has been vindicated, it is also fair to assume that they would have been happy to see Saddam Hussein stay in place, because there is no way that he could have been driven from office and taken out without these events taking place.
I accept Senator Evans’s arguments that from the start the Labor Party have never supported the Iraq war. They did not like the reasons for going. I accept the arguments that he put.

Senator Faulkner interjecting—

—I do not know whether you heard him, Senator Faulkner. He gave very reasoned arguments but if you believe that the Labor Party position has been vindicated it stands to reason that you would have been happy to see Saddam Hussein remain in power. I would not have.
—Regime change was never the reason for the war.
—I did not say anything about the reasons, but if you say that you believe that you have been vindicated then you must believe that Saddam Hussein should have stayed there.
I saw Mr Rudd on television some three or four weeks ago. I saw him asked four times a simple question about the ramifications of an immediate withdrawal, and four times Mr Rudd refused to answer the question of what would be the ramifications of an immediate withdrawal. So there is no point in coming into this chamber and criticising what the government have done if there are no other plans by the alternative government as to what their position would be.
The other thing that has been overlooked is the progress that has been made in Iraq in that time. The insurgents, and the killing of Arabs by other Arabs—those insurgents who come from outside Iraq as suicide bombers—receive all of the publicity. Think about all of the progress that has been made. I could name tens of projects that could only have taken place because the coalition of the willing is there protecting those who are building these projects for the people of Iraq.
There have been new water projects, where 4.2 million people can now receive potable water which they did not have before. There have been 36,000 new teachers trained. That would not have happened without the regime change and without the coalition of the willing being there. There have been 154 health facilities built. We never hear the Democrats or the Greens talk about the good things that are happening in Iraq at present. (Time expired)

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2006-12-06,"—We have just heard a speaker representing the government tell us about all the progress that has been made in Iraq in recent times, all the good things that are happening there. Let us have a look at the record. Let us try to see whether we can establish what is occurring in Iraq. These are some things that have happened in this calendar year. On 3 August, the outgoing British Ambassador to Iraq, William Patey, had a memo which was leaked. It was his final memo to the UK government. Ambassador Patey said:
The prospect of a low intensity civil war and a de facto division of Iraq is probably more likely at this stage than a successful and substantial transition to a stable democracy.
On 3 August, two senior generals warned the US Senate Committee on Armed Services about the risk of civil war. General John P Abizaid, commander of US military operations in the Middle East, said:
The sectarian violence is probably as bad as I’ve seen it … If not stopped, it is possible that Iraq could move toward civil war.
The Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Peter Pace, said:
We do have the possibility of that devolving to a civil war.
Is this the progress that Senator Ferguson is telling us about? Are these the good things that the government speakers wax lyrical about? Large numbers of tortured corpses, often headless and with hands bound, are being found on an almost daily basis in Baghdad, despite the launch of a joint US-Iraqi security operation in Baghdad, Operation Together Forward, on 7 August involving 12,000 US and Iraqi soldiers.
A secret intelligence report dated 16 August says that the US has lost control of Anbar province and there is almost nothing the US can do to regain control. The report that was leaked to the Washington Post finds that the Iraqi government institutions are inoperational and that the major political force in the province is al-Qaeda. Is this progress? Are these good things that the government tells us about? A Pentagon report to congress dated 1 September found:
Concern about civil war within the Iraqi civilian population and among some defense analysts has increased in recent months. Conditions that could lead to civil war exist in Iraq.
A United Nations report to the Security Council dated 1 September 2006 said that Iraq was now the most violent conflict in the world and that, on average, 100 civilians a day were being killed as a result of the conflict. There were 3,149 civilians killed in June and 3,438 civilians killed in July. Since February 2006 the United Nations believes that 200,000 people have been displaced. The United Nations warns that, if these trends continue, ‘The social and political fabric of the country could be endangered.’ Is this the progress that government speakers tell us about? Are these the good things the government speaks of?
According to a 1 September 2006 Pentagon report to the United States congress, Iraqi casualties increased by 50 per cent over the previous three months and insurgent attacks increased by 15 per cent. On 8 September this year the US Senate Intelligence Committee released a report which found that the US government knew before the war that there were no links between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda. On 21 September the United Nations released a report on the use of torture in Iraq saying that the use of torture today was worse than during Saddam Hussein’s regime. Is this the progress and good things that the government speakers speak of?
On 24 September the New York Times and Washington Post published reports of a leaked US National Intelligence Estimate, prepared by 16 intelligence agencies, which showed that the war in Iraq had increased the global terror threat. On 27 September the US released a declassified version of the key findings of the National Intelligence Estimate which said that Iraq had become a cause celebre for jihadists and that al-Qaeda was using the conflict to train recruits for other theatres. This is the progress and the good news that the government speaks of.
On 29 September former UK foreign secretary Jack Straw described the situation in Iraq as ‘dire’ and said that the US had made ‘mistakes’ in Iraq because it had not followed the advice of Colin Powell. On 11 October 2006 the British medical journal the Lancet published research conducted by the John Hopkins School of Medical Research showing that up to 654,965 Iraqi civilians had died as a result of the war in Iraq and that 601,000 of these had died as a result of violence.
On 13 October, the United Kingdom Army Chief of Staff, General Sir Richard Dannatt, told the Daily Mail that Britain should get out of Iraq soon and that the presence of foreign troops in Iraq was exacerbating the situation. Is this the good news and progress that government speakers have the hide to come in here and talk about?
On 15 October, it was reported that General Cosgrove had said that he had apologised to the Australian Federal Police Commissioner, Mick Keelty, for publicly disagreeing with his comments on involvement in Iraq increasing the terror threat. General Cosgrove said that it was ‘pretty obvious’ that the jihadist movement had been energised by the war in Iraq. Shiah politicians have put forward laws proposing the break-up of Iraq into autonomous provinces. The UN Secretary General has said, following a tour of the Middle East, that most leaders in the region believe that Iraq is a disaster and that Iraq is having a negative impact on their own security. George Bush declared that Iran was part of the ‘axis of evil’, but the invasion and its aftermath have driven Iraq closer to Iran and to religious extremism.
And just today we hear from Robert Gates, the man President George Bush has chosen to replace Donald Rumsfeld as US defence secretary after the recent US election made it inevitable that changes would have to be made to the administration’s policy in Iraq. At his Senate confirmation hearing, Mr Gates was asked by Senator Levin, ‘Mr Gates, do you believe that we are currently winning in Iraq?’ Robert Gates replied, ‘No, sir.’ He was asked by Senator McCain, ‘We are not winning the war in Iraq; is that correct?’ He replied, ‘That is my view, yes, sir.’ This is not progress. This is not good news. And these are all the reasons it is time for the Australian government to face up to the reality and the responsibility and work out an exit strategy.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,MATTERS OF URGENCY,20,1,speech
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2006-12-06,"—I have heard some parts of the debate this afternoon. There is an interesting contrast amongst the speakers, in some way—a significant number of conflicting views. I guess, to a degree, that makes this place go round. But, when you are discussing an issue like the motion before us, I think it is probably more constructive to make the place go round, as it were, with less shrill and less political invective and perhaps with a more considered approach to some of the issues that are on the table before us.
I did listen to the remarks of Senator Evans, as indeed did Senator Ferguson, who remarked on that himself. I was interested in the approach and tone that Senator Evans took. I listened to the conclusion of Senator Faulkner’s remarks this afternoon. I do not think I would ever be described—hopefully at least not by those making a constructive description of me—as delusional, so I am not delusional about this issue either. I, for one, am not going to stand up in this chamber and pretend that all is good in Iraq in 2006, because that is clearly not the case. There is evidence clearly to the contrary, and it has been delivered to the chamber in a range of ways this afternoon.
But one of the bigger questions that I think faces us in addition to those horrors which are on the record is: what choice do we have? What choices are we left with if we contemplate leaving Iraq to those who would now perpetrate the acts that have been described, albeit laced with invective, by some of the other speakers this afternoon? What is the choice if our government remains fully committed to the security and the stability of Iraq? Our only choice is to stay and do the job we undertook to do some years ago now. What is the choice if there is still a job to be done in Iraq? And clearly there is. The choice is not to leave. To leave now would be to abandon the Iraqi people completely to the sorts of things that Senator Faulkner was placing on the record this afternoon. That is not a choice that I am prepared to contemplate.
The Prime Minister said towards the end of last month that the path ahead in Iraq lies in accelerating as much as possible the training of the Iraqi military forces and letting them assume as much as possible of the day-to-day security responsibility. And that is exactly what we are doing. That is exactly the commitment we have made in so many places, enabling the Iraqi security forces to do the job that obviously needs to be done but that cannot be done overnight. We are trying to create a strong security force out of a debilitated military and in many cases horrifically debilitated country and community, and that does not happen simply or easily.
If you talk about a timetable for withdrawal, what are you going to do? Are you going to say, ‘By next Easter that is it—we are out of here and that is the end of the story’? It does not work like that. It works on progress—the sorts of things that Senator Faulkner was referring to so disparagingly. It strikes me as ironic that you can be that disparaging about the ability of children to attend a school as a mark of progress. It strikes me as ironic that you can talk about freedoms advanced for women in those terms and in that context, even if you do not cite them expressly, because they are part of the marks of progress to which we refer. An independent press, the capacity to pay teachers to do the job of teaching children—I will not belittle those as marks of progress as others here have this afternoon in the context of this debate.
It is true to say, and I will agree, that horrors perpetrated on the community by insurgents and terrorists are not great marks of progress. They are not. But in the overwhelming number of provinces in Iraq there is significant progress. There are children enrolled in high schools and there are schools rebuilding so they can at least physically attend them after decades of horrors were wrought on them. Are we supposed to say, ‘That is it—we are going’? I do not think that is appropriate.
Look at the role that the Australian defence forces are playing—let us look at just one: the overwatch role in Dhi Qar province, where, at the end of October, we formally took over the operational overwatch role in southern Iraq from the Italian forces. That followed the transition of security responsibility in that province to the Iraqi security forces in the previous month.
That is the second province to transfer to Iraqi control after Al Muthanna province made the transition in July. Australia’s undertaking is to continue to support the Iraqi government and its security forces until such time as they can provide for the country’s security. That is an appropriate undertaking in this course in which we are engaged.
The Overwatch Battle Group (West) comprises about 490 Australian Army personnel. It is based at the Imam Ali Air Base in Tallil and it conducts the operational overwatch task for both Al Muthanna and Dhi Qar provinces. Those troops are required to provide support to the Iraqi security forces in a crisis if they are requested to do so by the Iraqi government, running their own business in that case, and the Multinational Force Iraq. That involvement is, of course, also subject to Australian government approval. The ADF will continue training Iraqi army personnel at the basic training centre in Tallil.
What frustrates me most is that, if you come to the debate sensibly and intelligently, I do not understand how you can say now, in December 2006, that because there are still significant problems—as there always have been with the building and creation of nations in the history of the world—it is appropriate for us to consider withdrawing. I do not understand how you can say that it is appropriate for us to disparage progress because it is undermined by some defeats.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2006-12-06,"—I present the 13th report of 2006 of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I also lay on the table Scrutiny of Bills Alert Digest No. 15 of 2006, dated 6 December 2006.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
In tabling the committee’s Alert Digest No. 15 of 2006 and 13th report of 2006, I wish to draw the attention of the Senate to the amendments made to the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 and proposed amendments to Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Bill 2006. These amendments raise no issues within the terms of reference of the committee. However, in both cases, the amendments address concerns raised by the committee in earlier Alert Digests and reports and the committee wishes to acknowledge the positive response taken by each minister in response to these concerns.
In commenting on the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2006, the committee noted that the provision for the constitution of a military jury, and the manner in which questions are to be determined, differed substantially from the constitution and operation of civilian juries in criminal matters. The bill provided that the classes of offences to be heard by a military judge and jury could potentially include offences of treason, murder and manslaughter, and that a military jury was to be composed of six members and was to determine questions of guilt on the agreement of a two-thirds majority. The committee expressed concern that this represented an infringement of individual rights and sought advice of the minister as to the extent to which the rights of the individual had been balanced against the particular needs of the military justice system in drafting these provisions.
The minister responded that he had noted the comments of the committee and had instigated a specific amendment to address the concerns raised. The committee notes that on 29 November 2006 the House of Representatives amended this bill to provide that there will be a 12-member jury in a trial for a class 1 offence and a six-member jury in a trial for a class 2 or class 3 offence. These amendments further provide that a decision of a military jury is to be unanimous or by a five-sixths majority in certain circumstances. On behalf of the committee, I would like to thank the minister for this positive response to the concerns of the committee.
In commenting on the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Bill 2006, the committee expressed concern about certain strict and absolute liability offences. In relation to the offences of strict liability, the committee was concerned that the explanatory memorandum to the bill did not set out a clear justification for the imposition of offences. The committee noted that A guide to framing Commonwealth offences, civil penalties and enforcement powers advises that:
Strict or absolute liability should only be used in an offence where there are well thought out grounds for this.
The minister responded with a detailed and clear explanation for the inclusion of strict liability in each case and undertook to make a correction to the explanatory memorandum to include this explanation. The committee notes that the minister has since circulated a correction to the explanatory memorandum. The committee also notes that the minister has circulated a correction to the explanatory memorandum on the comments of the committee on the abrogation of the privilege against self-incrimination in certain provisions. The committee expressed concern that, whilst the explanatory memorandum explained the effect of those provisions, it did not justify their inclusion.
Finally, the committee expressed concern at the inclusion of certain absolute liability offences and sought advice from the minister as to the justification for their inclusion. The minister responded that the provisions were intended to address a knowledge of law issue. The committee was not persuaded that this was sufficient justification for the inclusion of absolute liability offences and sought further advice from the minister. The minister responded that, after considering the comments of the committee, he accepted that the application of absolute liability in these particular provisions appeared inconsistent with applying strict liability to other provisions in the bill with the knowledge of law issues. The minister has undertaken to amend these provisions, replacing the application of absolute liability to the relevant elements with strict liability. Again, on behalf of the committee, I would like to thank the minister for his constructive responses to the concerns of the committee.

"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2006-12-06,"—Before the break in my speech, I was talking about the government’s failure to provide adequate safeguards for wheat growers on the price of their grain and for the many of them who have shareholdings in AWB. The government did this by being complicit, with the AWB, in failing to provide any alternatives or deal with the imminent threat of the end of the single desk. The government was found out earlier than it wanted to be, because of the cracks appearing in the structure of AWB and its single desk marketing arm. Those cracks were obvious to anyone, yet the senior management of AWB—as, it appears, was their wont—refused to look at a plan B. They refused to look at any alternative or at any response to the competitors that were knocking at their door. Competitors like CBH and ABB are large grain marketing outfits that are perfectly capable of dealing with bulk wheat shipments in the international market, but the AWB refused to address this issue.
What we got from the government was repeated inquiries into the single desk. We had economists at 60 paces, and we got no result whatsoever. It was put off and off, until finally the government has been forced to face what has happened with the Cole inquiry and the collapse of the single desk. This is despite Prime Minister John Howard having promised at the last election to maintain the single desk. The government has failed on repeated occasions. What do we see now from this creaky coalition? We see some inadequate compromise for six months—another putting-off. The Leader of the Nationals, Senator Boswell, has now put the onus on the growers to come back with a solution. We have had years and years of inquiry after inquiry—everyone has known that there is this pressure—and now Senator Boswell says to the wheat growers around Australia: ‘It’s up to you. You have to come back with a single unified solution that is workable.’
These wheat farmers are having to cope with the drought and the fact that they will probably get less from AWB for their wheat crop this year and the fact that the value of their shareholding in AWB has plummeted. But they are also having to get together and determine a sophisticated, international marketing structure for their wheat into the future. Is this not a monumental failure by the government and by the party that is meant to represent the cockies out there, the National Party? It is a monumental failure not to have dealt with this issue previously and not to have had some plan for what might happen if the single desk collapsed.
This is in the face of international pressure, from the United States and elsewhere, on the single desk. There are not only the internal pressures and problems that we knew existed that led to the cracks in the edifice; there is also the international pressure to get rid of it. But the government did not deal with the issue; they refused to deal with it. They cosied up with their mates in AWB and refused to look at the issue. They stuck their heads in the sand, and in doing so they have let down the wheat growers of Australia as they have not adequately provided for them, particularly for their long-term future.
I think the government should hang its head in shame over this. Agriculture has been the mainstay of our country since its inception, and the government has let down one of the chief elements of our agricultural industry. It has let it down in many ways, but the marketing arm is the particular way by which it has done so. I hope wheat growers do indeed, as Senator Boswell exhorted, contact their members of parliament to tell them what a failure the government has been in this instance, that they expect much better of government members and that they expect to have a model that they can be properly consulted by the government on and can vote on and that the government will not turn its failure against the wheat growers of Australia.",SENATE,<title>WHEAT MARKETING AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,29,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-12-06,"—In speaking to the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2006, I point out that when the Cole report came down I was immediately certain that the legal framework under which AWB had been operating would need to change completely. The single-desk concept does not exist if the veto is taken away from AWB. The veto gives AWB the effective monopoly, the effective sole right, to export wheat. In the year 2000 a majority of the High Court found in the NEAT Domestic Trading Pty Ltd case that:
The legislation confers upon AWB(I) a practical monopoly on the bulk export of wheat save to the extent to which the authority, which is to issue guidelines, and AWB(I), which is not bound by the guidelines but whose conduct is subject to review and report, are prepared to relax the monopoly.
Of course they have not been prepared to relax the monopoly. Nobody can export wheat from Australia without the written consent of the Australian Wheat Export Authority, which is a statutory board. However, that consent must not be given by the Australian Wheat Export Authority without the approval of AWB(I), as per section 57 of the act. I have not checked the latest statistics, but up to 10 months ago the AWEA had never given consent for anyone other than AWB(I) to export wheat although there had been 45 applications to do so, according to Leon Bradley, who is the Chairman of PGA Western Graingrowers. So the veto and AWB were inextricably bound together and that has resulted in an effective monopoly and an effective single desk.
The problem for me, as a Western Australian senator, has been that WA wheat farmers’ current crop has been under threat. This year’s wheat crop is around four million tonnes. Ninety-five per cent of the wheat produced in WA is exported. Because of the drought, WA will end up supplying almost all the export wheat from Australia this season. Western Australian growers in very large numbers—apparently about 90 per cent of them—have not been providing their crop to AWB on the principal ground of disaffection with AWB because of corruption and reputational loss, the dangers of farmers losing their crop income if AWB is put into administration or is sued or prosecuted and AWB being perceived to have a diminishing ability to trade as it is regarded as a distressed seller. So my immediate concern as a Western Australian senator was that we had to move WA’s crop.
I discussed these matters with Liberal Western Australian senators, who I know have been deeply concerned with this matter, and the Australian Greens WA senator, Senator Siewert. Following publication of the Cole report, I was convinced that politically the coalition would find it difficult to come to a rapid policy decision. There is a clear policy disagreement between large numbers of Liberal members of the coalition and large numbers of National members of the coalition. If that were the political reality, what circuit breaker could I provide?
What was needed was a short-term temporary solution for Western Australian farmers who were disenchanted with AWB and were not prepared to provide them with their crop. Three weeks ago, I thought we would need legislative change in this chamber in these last sitting weeks of the year. I discussed that fact as I saw it with ministers, and I thought that from a cash flow and revenue perspective WA wheat farmers needed an urgent resolution. The solution that I came up with and proposed to the government was that they should overturn AWB’s veto power in the short term and that they could do that in one of two ways. They could give the veto power to the Australian Wheat Export Authority—which I did not favour because I believe it has been proven to be weak and inefficient—or they could give the veto power override to a senior member of the cabinet—I was suggesting the Treasurer—and that would result in a quick political decision-making process which I thought was better in these specific circumstances.
I discussed those options with WA Liberal senators and the WA Greens senator. Once that had been done and I had advised the government and various ministers of my views, and once we had discussed it in our party room, the Democrats came to the view that this was a desirable solution to support as a whole. On 30 November, with Senator Siewert, I moved a motion. That motion read:
That the Senate—
notes that:
the Government will need time to consider possible legislative changes to the wheat export regime, following the report of the Cole Commission of Inquiry, but
from a cash flow and revenue perspective, Western Australian wheat growers need urgent resolution in 2006 to present export impediments; and
asks the Government to consider introducing legislation into the Senate in the sitting week commencing 4 December 2006 to provide that for a period of 15 months or two seasons the final approval power for wheat export licences be transferred to the Treasurer.
The essence of my recommendation, which is a circuit-breaker, has been accepted by the government. They are providing a temporary cessation of the single desk for a period of six months. They will consult with the growers in the industry to establish how to move the next phase onwards in terms of policy, and I am hopeful that as a result of this move and this initiative the WA export crop will be able to be moved.
As the chamber knows, there is a campaign on to save AWB and to save the single desk, and there is another campaign to end the single desk—not necessarily to destroy the AWB but just to leave them as one of the export licensed bodies. Wheat farmers and their organisations are split on the issue. I take into account the various vested interests on all sides. I am particularly careful where there is a clear conflict of interest in any grower who is also a shareholder or director in AWB, which does bother me when I get those emails. Frankly, if a vote comes before the Senate next year which tries to keep the single desk, I will argue against it, but I do not have at this time a determination as to what should replace it. I am of the view that farmers are entitled, like anyone else in the community, to have choice as to who exports their crop, so I will look with great interest at what proposal is hammered out between the National Party and the Liberal Party following consultation.
In my view—and I am strongly influenced by the Cole commission of inquiry—the single desk in the hands of AWB is simply history. AWB has deceived the United Nations, it has deceived the Australian government and it has detrimentally affected the interests of the people of Australia by its conduct. There have been very serious findings by the Cole commission, and I expect there to be very serious consequences. It is too early to see the exact consequences that will ensue, but AWB’s companies, officers, advisers, management and directors are all facing the possibility of domestic legal action, both civil and criminal, and may even face international legal action, judging by media reports of those circumstances. The ATO may make claims for hundreds of millions of dollars for substantial recovery of tax concessions wrongly claimed. There may be claims for hundreds of millions of dollars compensation as a result of class actions. We cannot foresee anything else but that there will be legal action against individuals and those entities in some form. There is therefore contingent risk to the assets and viability of AWB and entities, and any wheat exporter forced to deliver their crop to AWB may be subjecting their own revenue to contingent risk. So I am not surprised that independent arrangements have been made to warehouse the wheat crop.
In these circumstances, an Australian government that continued to legally oblige wheat exporters to sell their crop through AWB, after they had been advised that the findings of the Cole commission had been made known, would, I think, expose themselves—in other words, expose taxpayers—to claims of compensation by wheat growers who did not want to give their crop over to AWB for export or who suffered detriment as a result of that circumstance. I think the government have recognised that danger and they have very wisely taken the veto away from the existing holders of that veto and given it to the cabinet.
Of course, we in the chamber should all recognise that under no circumstances will the minister who has direct responsibility through this legislation be able to take unilateral action. He will obviously, as is typical with these things, consult with his senior colleagues in the cabinet, and that is right and proper. It is in my view completely unacceptable for AWB to retain a veto power over any other body seeking a licence to export wheat. The conflict of interest is massive. The veto has to be removed, and the government are to be congratulated on removing it.
I recognise that the Democrats did support the single-desk concept. They traditionally supported it for the export of Australian wheat because it was generally thought that it was the best way to obtain the best price for wheat against big market competitors where subsidies to farmers make their wheat more competitively priced. That approach is not consistent with general Democrats policy, which is a support for more open and more competitive markets, as with most agricultural goods.
Speaking for myself, I am no longer of the view that the single desk is sustainable, but I stress that I recognise that I need to be flexible about what replaces it, and that is in view of the industry interests that are involved and in view of the transitional arrangements that need to be arrived at. But I will not support the return to the single desk in the form that it has been previously.
Whether any others simultaneously had the idea for the circuit-breaker that has come through, I do not know. I am prepared to claim credit for this initiative, because I think it is a good one. I am hopeful that, time having been bought with this particular change to the legislation, a long-term and beneficial result for wheat exporters will occur in the future.",SENATE,<title>WHEAT MARKETING AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,29,1,speech
"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2006-12-06,"—I rise this evening to speak on the Wheat Marketing Legislation Amendment Bill 2006. First, I would like to say that I am a Western Australian wheat grower and our family and partnership do not hold any shares in AWB. I think it is important for me to say that.
I concur with the remarks of Senator Murray. A lot of what I have to say he has already said. Western Australian farmers are in a dilemma. On the front page of the West Australian today it says, ‘West Australian farmers in limbo’.
I come now to the bill and what it will do. The Wheat Marketing Act 1989—the act—establishes the Wheat Export Authority and defines the arrangements for controlling export wheat from Australia. This Wheat Marketing Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 is required to enact temporary arrangements in the enabling legislation. The purpose of this bill is to amend the act through the transfer, on a temporary basis, of the right to veto bulk wheat export applications from AWB International Ltd—AWBI—to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. This transfer will be effective until 30 June 2007.
These changes do not amend the function or role of the Wheat Export Authority other than in the fact that it needs to seek the agreement of the minister for each application it receives. AWBI can still engage in export activities but no longer holds the right of veto. The reasons for these temporary changes are that the current system grants a monopoly to AWBI in the bulk export of wheat from Australia. Growers are compelled by law to consign their wheat to AWBI if it is to be sold internationally. In the present circumstances of drought caused low productivity, in my opinion this system is undermining growers’ profitability.
In Western Australia, some 95 per cent of the wheat produced is exported. This is also true of the vast majority of wheat produced in South Australia. This means that wheat growers in these two states are almost totally dependent upon the export market for their annual income. The dependence upon exports is not shared to anywhere near the same extent by wheat growers in other states, as most of that wheat is produced for the domestic market. Therefore, wheat growers in Western Australia and South Australia are left with no choice but to pay the fees extracted by AWB Ltd as the service agent for its fully owned subsidiary company, AWB International.
Whilst the Cole inquiry has brought significant media attention to the export wheat monopoly, I believe the system has been failing growers for many years. There is an inherent conflict of interest for AWBI between satisfying shareholders and maximising grower returns. This conflict, combined with excessive supply chain costs and marketing costs, particularly in low-production years, and an underinvestment in the industry, has led to a situation where wheat growers are at the bottom of the food chain in terms of receiving the true market value for their crops.
In addition, the Cole inquiry has revealed the significant contingent liabilities overhanging AWBI. With harvests well under way, Western Australian wheat growers are expected to deliver around five million tonnes of wheat from the current crop. That figure was released by ABARE this week. Because of the drought, this figure is well down on last year’s figure of 15 million tonnes. This year, Western Australia will supply almost all of the export wheat from Australia due to the drought in the eastern states. This, of course, also means that Western Australian wheat growers will be shouldering most of the cost burden if they are forced to deliver their wheat to AWBI.
Currently, Western Australian growers are consigning over 80 per cent of their wheat to grain marketers other than AWB or are warehousing their wheat. Normally around 80 per cent of wheat would go directly to AWBI, so it is plain to see that Western Australian wheat growers have voted with their wheat about what they believe to be the best option for their financial futures.
Leon Bradley of the Western Australian Pastoralists and Graziers Association was quoted in the Australian on 21 November 2006 as saying:
Normally farmers can’t wait to get their crop off and give it to the AWB, because they need the money to pay off their overdrafts, which reach a seasonal peak at this time of year.
He went on:
This year, even though they are under financial pressures, more than 70 per cent of farmers are refusing to deal with AWB, and we can understand it …
Growers must have a path to export their wheat other than through AWB before the end of the 2006-07 harvest, and this legislation provides it. I believe it is imperative that the legislation is enacted as a matter of urgency to allow greater competition in the marketing of export wheat.
If the restrictions that force growers to consign their export wheat to AWB pools are lifted, growers will be freed from the contingency risks impacting on AWB. It will also have the following advantages: there will be greater liquidity in the wheat industry, cash prices will be increased by opening the system to competition, competition will increase investment in agriculture and there will be better risk management opportunities as well as cost savings in the supply chain.
By amending the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 to remove the power of veto from AWBI and transferring it to the minister it is to be hoped other industry accredited wheat exporters will be able to seek licences to bid for growers’ wheat. This competition will allow greater freedom of choice for wheat growers to maximise the return on their crops. The proposed amendments do not prevent AWBI from continuing to provide exactly the same services to growers as they currently do.
In conclusion, I am somewhat concerned about the AWB service fee of $39.7 million and who will be responsible for it. I do not want to see Western Australian wheat growers being left to service this debt.",SENATE,<title>WHEAT MARKETING AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,29,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2006-12-06,"—The reason we have a single desk is twofold: firstly, the advantages to our growers domestically and, secondly, the advantages to the marketing of the product overseas. We have heard a lot of argument and contention about the advantages or disadvantages domestically but the facts stand that, on the 2006 census from Rural Press, about 73 per cent want a single desk. In fact, 69 per cent of them want it to be run by the AWB.
We have a campaign in Western Australia that is based on the fear that if you present your grain you will not get payment and that inordinate liabilities are hanging over the head of AWB. I think this fear campaign has been strategically placed to come out during the Cole inquiry with the result that it breaks the single desk. No doubt anybody can cherry-pick a market in such a way as to get a certain section of the market, a certain period of time in the middle of a drought when the wheat crop is low, supply their own mills in another country and say that they have created a situation that no longer spells the relevance of the single desk. But over a period of time that will prove to be completely and utterly wrong. Furthermore, the results of the advantages of the single desk are that the marketing of this product throughout the world has been built on the work of a company called AWB. Since 1939 the AWBI has built up the marketing of this product. Anybody can go into an established market of another person and say, ‘If I can basically steal some of your market, I can get the same price or better than what you have, because you’ll be left with all the contingent liabilities and I’ll get the benefit of the revenue.’ That is what is happening here.
AWB, in the marketing of the product, has to take a long-term position in the market; it is the diligent and safe thing to do. In taking a long-term position in the market, you take out the troughs but you can also take out some of the peaks. Nonetheless, today we see that CBH, which has been put up as the shining light of where this is all going, offered a price that is basically approximate to what the AWB offers in any case. Even with all that, the AWB is still basically on the mark, and the AWB is always conservative in its price. In fact, it has gone below it only once; that was in 1990.
What we give up if we lose the single desk is no better enunciated than by our major competitors. People such as Pascal Lamy from the EU, Senator Norm Coleman from Minnesota or Tom Harkin, Democrat senator in charge of the agriculture committee of the congress, want to get rid of our single desk. They want to get rid of it for one specific reason: it is a strategic market advantage that they feel compromises the price they can get—not the price we can get but the price they can get. On destruction of the single desk there is only one person who will lose and that is the Australian wheat grower. To have a single desk you must have integrity of the pool. The integrity of the pool relies on the power of veto. You cannot ask a certain company to be the buyer of last resort yet not give them the integrity of the pool. If we get the destruction of this, we will have a case where we can have certain deals for certain mates and other deals for other people. What I do agree with is that we must have greater transparency in the single desk. We must have a move back to grower owned directors. But to get rid of it, to throw the baby out with the bathwater—to prove a point for a very peculiar, specific period of time based on the fear of an inquiry into the actions of certain people in the executive of a company, who are now sacked—is blatantly ridiculous. If you do that, you are creating a great mischief in the lives of people.
However, we could see the numbers. I do not know where the Greens were on this issue; I suspect that they want to get rid of the single desk. I know that the Democrats have been clearly on the record that they want to get rid of it. The private member’s bill was being put forward by a number of members of the Liberal Party, so the obvious reality was that we were about to have a total deregulation and I think that would have been an extremely unfortunate outcome.
But we have a period of time. It is a fact that, if no other legislation is passed through this parliament, on expiry of the six-month period of time the single desk will revert to the status quo and then it is back with AWBI. As a final statement, I say that it is up the growers who write to me from Western Australia—from Bob Ifler to all the local growers in New South Wales. I also am a wheat grower. I do not have shares in AWB, but I am a small wheat grower nonetheless. I did not have a crop because we had a drought, and the insinuation that it was somehow hidden or warehoused is slanderous. The fact is that we got eight tonnes from 350 acres of seed wheat for next year—that was it—and then we stopped the headers because there was no point in going on. The position is that growers must be absolutely open and vociferous in their campaign to protect the single desk. Ambivalence or saying nothing will be taken as a vote to get rid of the single desk.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-12-06,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The Department of the Environment and Heritage Australia state of the environment report 2006 is a very important document and a reasonably sizeable one. It is certainly a document that I cannot do justice to in the very short time I have available to speak to it tonight. I think every member and senator of this parliament should endeavour to read it, because it is a five-yearly snapshot of the state of play, as the title obviously says. One very important thing that I believe needs to be emphasised is that the report makes it clear that, whilst it endeavours to give a snapshot of the state of play, to a significant degree, we do not actually know what the state of play is. The report says:
Each of land, biodiversity, coasts and oceans, inland waters, and natural and cultural heritage lacks more than half the data needed to make a comprehensive national assessment.
So, if we lack more than half the data, we are at not actually sure. To me, that signals a significant problem. The report also says:
It is the emphatic opinion of the 2006 Australian State of the Environment Committee that the future role of a national state of the environment committee should be to provide data interpretation and commentary, using accessible, up-to-date, relevant national data. The year 2006 must be the last state of the environment report that starts with a committee-initiated process of indicator and data selection. Environmental data should be continuously updated and made publicly available on the web. This will require strategic responses that are tailored to national, state and territory and regional needs, and that are sufficiently understood and accepted to be sustained into the future.
That would enable us to have the capacity to assess the state of the environment on an ongoing basis, not just every five years, and to do so from a position of much more complete and comprehensive knowledge. Having said that, I certainly do not want to suggest that there is not a lot of data that is available and that is very useful. This report pulls it together.
In shorthand, a couple of key areas need to be emphasised. Firstly, whilst it looks at the state of the environment rather than looking solely at the threats to the environment, there is no doubt that climate change presents the biggest overarching threat to our natural and our marine environments and, indeed, to our urban and social environments. A failure to address that serious threat will clearly show up in major declines in the state of the environment into the future. There is a clear amount of data detailed in the report that says we are doing far less well than we should in living sustainably in the urban environment. There is a lot of untapped potential, if you can forgive the pun, particularly in recycling of water and also of waste products. There is still enormous scope for improvement in efficiencies in energy consumption, in transportation and in water usage, and we need to be doing a lot better than we are.
Outside of the urban environment, I am pleased to see the report notes the significant role that Indigenous Australians play in environmental stewardship. There is a big overlap between areas that are amongst the most ecologically important and healthy parts of certainly the terrestrial environment and those areas that are Indigenous land. That is in part an indication of the skills of Indigenous Australians in maintaining stewardship of the natural environment but it also shows the opportunities that are there. The responsibility is on governments to do a lot more to support the capacity of Indigenous communities in regard to environmental stewardship. There are win-win opportunities here, not only in providing more opportunities that have synergies with Indigenous cultures and maintaining cultural diversity alongside biodiversity, but also in maintaining that broader health of the natural environment along with it.
Those are a few key points that I think we need to draw attention to. We can do a lot better in our urban environment. We can do a lot better in supporting Indigenous Australians in their stewardship, particularly in a lot of the more remote areas of Australia. There is a lot more to the report than that, but five minutes is not really sufficient to deal with it. Perhaps another speaker will reserve their remarks and we can have another go at it later.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Australia State of the Environment Report 2006</title>,DOCUMENTS,30,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2006-12-06,"—I rise tonight to take note of the Australia state of the environment report 2006. I want to build on a couple of things that have been said. The first is that it is an absolute disgrace that the government has not got in place a data monitoring and collection system such that you can actually ask people to comment on the state of the environment. I put it on the record that the government says it has spent $10.3 billion between 2001 and 2005 on the environment, and yet we have a situation where we absolutely do not know what the state of the environment is. Australia is not equipped with the national capacity to monitor and assess the condition of the environment on an ongoing basis—what an indictment of the government and the environment minister.
So what we have is a glossy, coffee table production of out-of-date science. On climate change, the report gives climate change progressions in figure 21—it is a 2001 document. What use is that to us in 2006? Climate change has accelerated at a great rate since then. It is appalling. And, what’s more, it is clear that the whole section and all the work on climate change was written as an apology for the Howard government’s position that they did not believe in climate change, that the Prime Minister was a sceptic of climate change and that he did not believe in extreme predictions of climate change. In fact, the report was clearly written at a time when the excuse of the Howard government was that the science was undecided about whether we were having climate variability or climate change.
But of course in the last two months things have rapidly altered. Out came the Stern report. Out came the world’s scientists. The Howard government was completely isolated, and has had to admit that climate change is real. But it was too late for this document, and so we get embarrassing statements—for example, about the drought. The report poses the questions: how much is current variability due to climate change? How much is it natural variability? It goes on to talk about our need to increase our climate literacy. Well, we absolutely do, and the reason that Australians are not as climate literate as they might be is that for a decade the Howard government has not put in place appropriate policies.
An example of the report’s out-of-date science, apart from the climate predictions, is the statement that, ‘A possible impact on climate change is a change in how often coral-bleaching events occur relating to the Great Barrier Reef.’ But the latest science says that it is already too late for the world’s coral reefs. Why are Australian scientists not reporting on that in this particular report? Why are they not saying what the world’s scientists are saying, which is that coral reefs are beyond the threshold of dangerous climate change and from here on in it is decline? They are saying that we have to take the pressure off the reefs by getting rid of pollution and other pressures on the reefs and trying to make them as resilient as possible. But the fact is that acidification of the oceans as a result of the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed has already weakened the corals. The coral bleaching is real. Ocean temperatures are hot. The reefs do not recover if the bleaching events occur more frequently than five years apart. It is already too late. I am disgusted with this report. What it does is play to the notion that we are not sure whether the drought is just climate variability or whether it is climate change.
That whole notional view gives a lie to what is going on with climate science and it gives false hope to people in rural Australia, particularly in marginal areas, that suddenly the drought is going to break, everything is going to be all right again and we are going to go back to how it was. That is completely wrong and frankly I am sick and tired of anecdotal half-measures being equivalent to statements by the world’s leading scientists who write the IPCC reports. Uncle Bill up the road’s view of what the climate is doing is an equivalent response to that of the world’s leading scientists, and that is not good enough.
I want to talk about Minister Campbell’s wedges. He talks about Princeton University and says, ‘We have to have nuclear and we have to have carbon capture and storage because they are the seven wedges required.’ That is wrong. Princeton University gives 15 wedges on its diagram, seven of which need to be employed to achieve deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. It is a complete misrepresentation of the science to suggest that they argue either nuclear or carbon capture or both are essential. They do not. And before anybody reports on Senator Campbell’s statement of his seven wedges, they should look at the academic research. It is the minister’s attitude that underpins what is wrong with this report. It does not give us a view of the environment and it cannot name one single area where the environment has improved. (Time expired)

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2006-12-06,"—I also rise to take note of the Australia state of the environment report 2006. Like my colleague Senator Milne, I am dismayed at this report. Although it is quite obviously a greenwashing of the government’s handling of the environment, it does actually contain some issues and facts that the government cannot run away from. For example, in the water section it talks about how the increasing demand for water is placing significant pressure on Australia’s inland water system. Unfortunately, this section dealing with inland waters did not address the issue of climate change, despite the fact that just yesterday the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs reported on its water inquiry and stated that climate change was playing a significant role in water security management.
The report also highlights the fact that water consumption has increased by 10 per cent—so much for our efforts to reduce our water consumption. It also highlights the fact that our riparian vegetation is suffering significantly and is continuing to decline. It states that 80 per cent of the remaining red gums on the Murray River flood plain in South Australia are stressed to some degree and that 30 per cent of them are severely stressed, and this severe decline has occurred in the previous 12 months. So just in the last 12 months, we have had even further decline in our riparian vegetation.
The report also talks about our wetlands and the stress that they are under. It says:
The impact on wetlands has been dramatic. As many as 231 nationally important wetlands are under pressure across Australia. Of the 64 Ramsar wetlands, latest assessments indicate that 22 have changed in ecological character or have the potential to change …
The report also highlights the fact that there has been an increase from four to 14 in the percentage of our fisheries which are at severe risk. This highlights the flawed approach this government takes in its fisheries management and the fact that it will not put any species in our commercial fisheries on the threatened species list because if it did that, of course, it would have to actually do something about protecting them adequately. The facts clearly demonstrate the government’s approach is flawed.
The report also highlights the fact that clearing has occurred at the rate of 1.5 million hectares this year and the government claimed, ‘Oh, that’s okay, because it has decreased.’ It is still 1.5 million hectares and we know that clearing vegetation is the biggest cause of biodiversity loss in this country. So much for the work that the government is doing on reducing clearing and protecting our biodiversity.
What I particularly wanted to highlight is in the water section. Despite the fact that this is a greenwashing, the report also highlights some significant issues around the government’s processes and programs to try to protect our natural environment. I will read some quotable comments. The report states:
These programmes have addressed local and regional needs, but Australia needs a systemic approach that develops sustainable systems of land management that address fundamental environmental problems.
It goes on:
As important as these programmes are, they provide little ground for complacency—the magnitude of human impact often exceeds the scale of restoration programmes.
It continues:
It is likely that the Murray River will require at least three times this volume of water if there are to be significant improvements in the entire river environment, rather than just improvements to the parts that are targeted to receive environmental flows …
Moreover, analysis shows that so-called ‘best management practices’ might not achieve sustainability or the desired catchment management targets. This is partly a product of the small scale and fragmented nature of various investments in inland water, riparian and catchment management. Past investments in these programmes addressed local needs, but did not often address the larger, strategic needs for improved practices and sustainable solutions.
It then goes on:
… it should be noted that the success of many excellent, small-scale habitat and species restoration programmes is easily compromised by unsustainable large-scale land and water use patterns.
So much for NHT and the government’s much heralded environment restoration programs. They are clearly being undermined by poor governance, bad policy, overallocation of our water resources, mismanagement and failure to deal with land clearing and wetlands decline. The picture is an indictment of the approach that has been taken: ‘Let’s throw some money at small-scale projects but not deal with the underlying causes.’ It is quite clear—for example, in the Macquarie Marshes and the Gwydir wetlands—that the government has been unable and unwilling to deal with the causes that have led to the problem, overallocation and failure to deal with other broadscale issues in the catchment. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. (Time expired)

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2006-12-06,"—Recently I was involved in a conference in the Canberra Convention Centre when in-depth consideration was given to international accounting standards and the GAAP/GFS harmonisation project, which aims to develop principles whereby accountants, statisticians and economists can reliably analyse standardised financial statements of government entities. During my preparation for the paper, I discovered a new accounting standard, AASB 120, which I noted with some interest because it requires that government grants be apportioned to the future years benefiting from that grant. I believe that is a very sensible standard.
I would therefore like to draw the Senate’s attention to some related matters. Reported profit for public entities seldom equates to taxable income—for example, adjustments are always required for such matters as long service leave and holiday pay accrued but not paid. The significant differences between taxable income and reported profit have again been highlighted as a result of Australia’s adoption of this new accounting standard AASB 120, which requires that government grants are to be apportioned for corporate law purposes over the period of future years which benefit from the grant.
However, for income tax purposes, where a grant is received by a corporate entity the whole of the grant must be brought to account in the year in which the grant is received. Perhaps it is time for a harmonisation of tax and corporate law reporting. This would be a useful and practical project. Earlier this year the federal government provided some very generous grants to encourage the private sector to upgrade plant to ensure that Australia had an internationally competitive timber conversion industry. Unfortunately, the current state of the tax laws requires that such a grant be assessable in the year of receipt. On the other hand, the dilemma for those likely to accept the grant is that, on the expense side, the deduction is limited to the depreciation or the reduction in value of the effective life of that particular plant. Therefore, tax-wise, the benefit of the grant is severely diminished because of the tax cash flow implications.
The purpose of my contribution tonight is to seek to encourage the government to follow the lead of the international accounting standards in relation to grants by actually changing the Income Tax Act by an amendment which would apportion the tax benefit of the grant—that is, the income—to the future years to which the benefit would apply. By adopting such a recommendation, there would be a better matching of revenue with costs incurred through an effective life apportionment with the income tax expense. As a result of that, I believe that the value of the grant would therefore not be diminished through the application, as we have it, of the current taxation laws.
In conclusion, my recommendation is that the grants could be much more attractive to industry, and there could be a greater incentive to invest in modern equipment and to take up the very generous grants offered to industry by the government. But to effect this recommendation what would be required would be an amendment to the income tax act.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>International Accounting Standards</title>,ADJOURNMENT,31,1,speech
